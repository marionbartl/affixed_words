Daniel Hauser has what doctors consider one of the most curable types of cancer , Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
But the 13 - year - old from Sleepy Eye , Minn .
and his parents do n't want him to have chemotherapy and radiation , the standard treatments .
For the past three months , they have ignored the advice of his cancer specialists and turned to natural therapies , such as herbs and vitamins , instead .
Now they are going to court to defend their decision .
James Olson , the Brown County attorney , has filed a petition accusing Daniel 's parents , Colleen and Anthony Hauser , of child neglect and endangerment , and he has asked a judge in New Ulm to order the boy into treatment .
The case , which goes to trial this morning , has quickly turned into a cause celebre in the world of alternative medicine .
Last week , supporters packed the courthouse in New Ulm , Minn. , for a pretrial hearing , and both sides are bracing for an even a bigger crowd today .
" You can't imagine what kind of outpouring we 've gotten here , " said Calvin Johnson , a Mankato attorney who is representing Daniel 's parents .
" There 's a lot of feeling on this subject . "
Daniel , one of eight children , has asserted that treatment would violate his religious beliefs .
The teenager filed an affidavit saying that he is a medicine man and church elder in the Nemenhah , an American Indian religious organization that his parents joined 18 years ago ( though they do n't claim to be Indians ) .
" I am opposed to chemotherapy because it is self - destructive and poisonous , " he told the court .
" I want to live a virtuous life , in the eyes of my creator , not just a long life . "
He also filed a " spiritual path declaration " that said : " I am a medicine man .
Some times we teach , and some times we perform .
Now , I am doing both .
I will lead by example . "
Johnson said Daniel 's case has touched a nerve because the state wants to impose a potentially dangerous treatment that neither the boy nor his family believe in .
" Why does a doctor have the right to come in with the power of the state and the county attorney by his side and say ' take my medicine ? ' " he said .
But Olson , the county attorney , says he is trying to protect a child from a decision that could cost him his life .
" If he were 18 years old and made the decision that his parents are making for him , we would not be in court , " Olson said .
" Since the boy just turned 13 in March , I felt the judge needs to take a look at this and make a decision . "
The family declined a request for an interview Thursday .
Danny , as he is known , was first found to have cancer in late January , and his doctors recommended six rounds of chemotherapy and radiation , according to court papers .
The disease -- a cancer of the immune cells -- has a 95 percent survival rate for his age group with treatment , according to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society .
But after one round of chemotherapy , Daniel became so sick that his parents refused to send him for a second treatment .
They switched him to an alternative regime of complementary medicine , including dietary changes and " ionized water , " Johnson said .
In the meantime , the Hausers asked for second and third opinions from the Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota .
In both cases , the cancer specialists recommended chemotherapy and radiation , said Olson , the county attorney .
Without treatment , he said , he was told the boy could die .
In April , he filed a petition asking the court to force treatment .
Olson 's petition says , in part : " Both the Mayo and Children 's doctors have told the parents that Daniel has a 90 percent chance of being cured with standard chemotherapy and radiation , and this would decrease significantly to 50 percent or less if the tumor is allowed to re-grow and develops resistance to chemotherapy . ''
" There 's a fine line between parental rights to do what parents feel [ is ] in the best interest of their children , and the state 's right , " Olson said Thursday .
" In this case , we 've claimed we have a compelling state interest in protecting this young man . "
Today 's op - ed by Ali Soufan , an FBI interrogator of Zubaydah , gives us critical , first - hand evidence of how the torture regime was put into place .
Soufan notes that torture was applied to Zubaydah even though he had provided a great deal of actionable and accurate intelligence from traditional Western interrogation techniques .
But he adds a critical detail : CIA officers were in the room during the traditional interrogation tactics .
They knew he was cooperative .
They did not want to start torturing him .
Someone higher up ordered them .
And yet the premise of the Bybee memo's authorization of the torture of Zubaydah states as fact :
The interrogation team is certain that he has additional information that he refuses to divulge .
Specifically , he is withholding information regarding terrorist networks in the United Stares or in Saudi Arabia and information regarding plans to conduct attacks within the United States or against our interests overseas .
As the invaluable emptywheel notes ( more valuable than most of the journalists at the NYT and WaPo ) , Soufan is proving that the CIA 's premise to Bybee was false .
It appears that all the FBI interrogators and several CIA interrogators believed Zubayhdah had nothing more to tell .
And here is Bybee 's caveat :
We also understand that you do not have any facts in your possession contrary to the facts outlined here , and this opinion is limited to these facts .
If these facts were to change , this advice would not necessarily apply .
If someone withheld information , or someone ignored that information in providing the factual basis for Bybee 's torture green light , then we have very clear proof that someone high up wanted to torture Zubaydah regardless .
We also know that some have testified this was designed to prove a Saddam - Qaeda link ( which did not exist ) .
To put this in plain English :
We had a president determined to torture a prisoner to get false evidence on which to justify a war .
Keep walking , Peggy .
Keep walking .

UC Berkeley physicist Charles Townes cleans one of the large mirrors of the Infrared Spatial Interferometer ( ISI ) .
The ISI consists of three 5.4 - foot ( 1.65 - meter ) diameter mirrors separated by distances that vary from 12 to 230 feet ( 4 to 70 meters ) .
A massivered star in the constellation Orion has shrunk in the past 15 years and astronomersdo n't know why .
CalledBetelgeuse , the star is considered a red supergiant .
Such massive stars arenearing the ends of their lives and can swell to 100 times their original sizebefore explodingas supernovae , or possibly just collapsingto form black holes without violent explosions ( as one study suggested ) .
Betelgeuse , one of the top10 brightest stars in our sky , is a popular target among backyardskywatchers and was the first star ever to haveits size measured , and even today is one of only a handful of stars thatappears through the Hubble Space Telescope as a disk rather than a point oflight .
It was the first star ( besides our sun ) to have its surfacephotographed ( by Hubble ) .
The newfinding , presented today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Societyin Pasadena , Calif. , was based on data collected by UC Berkeley 's Infrared SpatialInterferometer ( ISI ) on the top of Mt. Wilson in Southern California .
In 1993 , measurements put Betelgeuse 's radius at about 5.5 astronomical units ( AU ) , where one AU equals the average Earth - sun distance of 93 million miles , orabout 150 million km .
Since then it has shrunk in size by 15 percent .
Thatmeans the star 's radius has contracted by a distance equal to the orbit of Venus .
" Tosee this change is very striking , " said Charles Townes , a UC Berkeleyprofessor emeritus of physics .
" We will be watching it carefully over thenext few years to see if it will keep contracting or will go back up in size . " ( Townes won the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics for inventing the laser and themaser , a microwave laser . )
Though thestar is shrinking , its visible brightness has not dimmed significantly over thepast 15 years , the researchers say .
" Butwe do not know why the star is shrinking , " said Edward Wishnow , a researchphysicist at UC Berkeley 's Space Sciences Laboratory .
" Considering allthat we know about galaxies and the distant universe , there are still lots ofthings we do n't know about stars , including what happens as red giants near theends of their lives . "
Townes , whoturns 94 in July , plans to continue monitoring Betelgeuse in hopes of finding apattern in the changing diameter , and to improve the ISI 's capabilities byadding a spectrometer to the interferometer .
" Wheneveryou look at things with more precision , you are going to find some surprisesand uncover very fundamental and important new things , " he said .
The findingwas also published June 1 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Google is preparing to launch a new service called Google Voice that is built with technology obtained through its 2007 acquisition of Internet telephony company GrandCentral .
The Google Voice service gives users a single phone number that can seamlessly route calls to their existing phones .
It has its own built - in voicemail service that can be accessed from any phone or through a browser , with GMail - like archiving features for audio messages .
The Google Voice service launched in March for closed testing with a limited audience that consisted of existing GrandCentral users .
Google introduced a number of highly impressive features such as automatic message transcription and free SMS delivery .
The transcription feature will convert voicemails to text and make them searchable .
The service can also automatically forward voicemail transcripts directly to your preferred e-mail account .
There are signs that Google is preparing to open the service to a broader audience .
Reports indicate that Google has recently obtained over one million new phone numbers from backbone operator Level 3 .
PC
World speculates that the number grab could be a prelude to the full public launch of Google Voice , but it was unable to get official confirmation from the search giant .
There are also reports that Google will offer number portability , enabling consumers to move their existing phone numbers to Google 's infrastructure .
Ars recently began testing Google Voice as part of the closed beta program .
The service is remarkably powerful and easy to use .
It has a number of killer features , such as support for switching between lines during the middle of a call and recording incoming calls by simply pressing a button .
Recorded calls and voicemails can be heard directly in the browser through a streaming playback interface and can also be downloaded as MP3 files .
It also offers a simple scheduling system that can be used to control when calls will be routed to specific numbers .
For example , you could configure it to direct calls to your work phone during the day and your home phone on evenings and weekends .
Google Voice also integrates with your Google address book and allows you to configure different greetings and forwarding destinations for various groups .
Call screening is supported with the ListenIn feature , which allows you to hear a voicemail as it is coming in and enter the call by pressing the star key .
The service is off to a good start and already feels relatively mature despite the fact that it has n't opened broadly to the public yet .
Although we 're strongly convinced that Google Voice has the potential to be a winner , there are some limitations that detract from its current appeal .
The most disappointing bit is that call recording does n't work on outgoing calls at the present time .
The user interface is consistent with the rest of Google 's ecosystem , so it 's easy to navigate and very search - centric .
The transcription functionality is far from perfect , but it works well enough to consistently convey the gist of a message , if not the exact words .
It 's a compelling addition to Google 's lineup and has the potential to get a lot more interesting as Google integrates its capabilities into its Android smartphone platform .
A divorce case was all that passed for excitement at Richard P Altschuler 's " kinda small " lawyer 's office in West Haven , Connecticut , when the phone rang nine years ago .
On the other end of the line , a world away in the heat of Nigeria , was Etigwe Uwo , a young lawyer with " an incredible story about Pfizer " .
The Lagos attorney was going to take on the largest pharmaceutical company in the world in an unprecedented class action pitting African parents against an American corporate giant .
And he needed help .
Mr Etigwe had chosen Mr Altschuler because , back in 1979 , the Connecticut lawyer had successfully defended a friend of the Nigerian .
The unlikely pair were about to embark on a marathon journey into the world of " big pharma " .
Nine years on and their efforts have finally been rewarded with a reported $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) settlement , the terms of which are likely to be released this week .
If it sounds like the script of a Hollywood blockbuster that 's because it was this story that prompted John Le Carre to write The Constant Gardener , according to Mr Altschuler .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In real life it was to Nigeria , not Kenya , that Pfizer turned .
In 1996 , the company needed a human trial for what it hoped would be a pharmaceutical " blockbuster " , a broad spectrum antibiotic that could be taken in tablet form .
The US - based company sent a team of its doctors into the Nigerian slum city of Kano in the midst of an appaling meningitis epidemic to perform what it calls a " humanitarian mission " .
However the accusers claim it was an unlicensed medical trial on critically - ill children .
A team of Pfizer doctors reached the Nigerian camp just as the outbreak , which killed at least 11,000 people , was peaking .
They set themselves up within metres of a medical station run by the aid group Médecins Sans Frontières , which was dispensing proven treatments to ease the epidemic .
From the crowd that had gathered at the Kano Infectious Diseases Hospital , 200 sick children were picked .
Half were given doses of the experimental Pfizer drug called Trovan and the others were treated with a proven antibiotic from a rival company .
Eleven of the children died and many more , it is alleged , later suffered serious side - effects ranging from organ failure to brain damage .
But with meningitis , cholera and measles still raging and crowds still queueing at the fence of the camp , the Pfizer team packed up after two weeks and left .
That would probably have been an end to the story if it were n't for Pfizer employee , Juan Walterspiel .
About 18 months after the medical trial he wrote a letter to the then chief executive of the company , William Steere , saying that the trial had " violated ethical rules " .
Mr Walterspiel was fired a day later for reasons " unrelated " to the letter , insists Pfizer .
The company claims only five children died after taking Trovan and six died after receiving injections of the certified drug Rocephin .
The pharmaceutical giant says it was the meningitis that harmed the children and not their drug trial .
But did the parents know that they were offering their children up for an experimental medical trial ?
" No , " Nigerian parent Malam Musa Zango said .
He claims his son Sumaila , who was then 12 years old , was left deaf and mute after taking part in the trial .
But Pfizer has denied this and says consent had been given by the Nigerian state and the families of those treated .
It produced a letter of permission from a Kano ethics committee .
The letter turned out to have been backdated and the committee set up a year after the original medical trial .
At stake at one point last year was more than $ 8bn in punitive damages being sought in a string of cases , as well as potential jail terms in Nigeria for several Pfizer staff .
" There has been a complex web of cases with proceedings in Connecticut , New York , Lagos , Abuja and Kano , " Mr Etigwe said .
" The strategy of big companies when they are dealing with smaller opponents is to stretch the process , to overwhelm us until we are ready to accept whatever they want to offer . "
Trovan never became the blockbuster that Pfizer had hoped for and it is no longer in production .
The EU has banned the drug and it has been withdrawn from sale in the US .
It appears that Pfizer has finally ended the public relations nightmare with Friday 's settlement .
But the Trovan battle may not be over yet .
At the end of January 2009 , a New York appeal court ruled Mr Etigwe and Mr Altschuler 's case could be heard in the US .
The Connecticut attorney says it could still go ahead .
" Our case is firmly embedded in the US ... so a Nigerian settlement does not foreclose our case .
But this is very good news .
I 'm glad we remained the constant gardener and could see this come to fruition . "
Every year I go to the Renaissance Fair , a month - long festival where you ’re encouraged to roam in Shakespearean - type clothes and speak in Ye Olde English just like it was olden times .
I also have sex regularly , thankyouverymuch .
Okay , the Ren Faire is one of those places where losers do flock – there has to be something to fill up all those empty schedules til ComicCon .
But there are a variety of reasons that you , non-loser person , should join me at the Ren Faire !
And they are : Booze .
There ’s tons of it .
Wine and beer flow from the heavens , but there ’s even more interesting selections for getting plastered than your local bar .
Honey mead tastes deeeelicious and pear cider is more refreshing than a Cosmo on a hot day , I guarantee you .
Food .
Giant turkey legs are worth the price of admission alone .
And no one scolds you for not using a napkin or a knife and fork !
Henry VIII would have wanted it that way .
Boobs .
You ’ll see more cleavage on display , all day , than a wings marathon at Hooters .
Every female dresses in a tight corset that props their boobs up like a mantel for your eyes to rest on .
It ’s like Halloween , and every woman is dressed as a slutty milkmaid .
Plus , you can call women “ wenches ” there and they do n’t mind one bit !
Weapons .
You can play with a crossbow , a sword and other pretty dangerous shit .
Ca n’t do that at a Hollywood club !
( You can , but you ’ll likely be arrested . )
And while you ’re swash - buckling , you might as well …
Be a Pirate .
C’mon , admit it .
Dressing like a pirate is something you totally wanted to do ever since Johnny Depp made it cool again , but were too afraid to for fear of being mocked .
Well , they had pirates back in Renaissance times * , so grab those boots and take a swig of grog and earn yar sea legs , matey !
Arr !
* They also exist today , but modern pirates are just fucking depressingly .

Iran ’s Worst Clerics
AYATOLLAH AHMAD JANNATI
AFP / Getty Images
Position : Chairman of the Guardian Council , the 12 member group that oversees elections and is tasked with ensuring the government complies with the principals of the Islamic state .
He also holds seats on the Assembly of Experts and Expediency Discernment Council , two other top regime bodies .
Jannati frequently acts as “ substitute imam ” for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by delivering the Friday prayers in Tehran .
Worldview : “ He ’s considered a real hardliner .
Way , way , way on the right .
He ’s a real dying breed , ” says Geneive Abdo , a Middle East expert at the Century Foundation who has reported extensively on Iran ’s clerics .
The 82 - year old Jannati has used his Friday sermons to call for the destruction of Israel and the United States and encourage Iranians to support Hezbollah in Lebanon and an Islamic state in Iraq .
Possible election role :
The Guardian Council vets candidates before they can run , generally weeding out unacceptable reformists and women .
As chairman of the council , the hard - line Jannati wields enormous influence over Iran ’s political process .
At the same time , experts say , his influence has been somewhat diminished lately .
“ Jannati is old and he ’s an idiot , ” says Rasool Nafisi of Strayer University .
“ He was put in his position only because of his absolutely loyalty [ to Khomenei ] . ”
Jannati has been eclipsed somewhat by Akbar Hashemi Rasfanjani , his more politically shrewd and ideologically promiscuous rival within Iran ’s clerical establishment , according to Nafisi .
But given his revolutionary credentials , powerful office , and nearly blind devotion to Khamenei , it would be a mistake to write him off completely .
AYATOLLAH MOHAMMAD -TAQI MESBAH -YAZDI
AFP / Getty Images
Position : Member of the Assembly of Experts , the group tasked with selecting Iran ’s supreme leader
Worldview : Nicknamed “ professor crocodile ” by reformists , Yazdi ( not to be confused with fellow Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi of the Guardian Council ) is the hard - liner ’s hard - liner .
“ He speaks only in rhetoric , ” says Abdo , who has interviewed him .
“ When you ask him questions , you do n’t get answers , you get slogans . ”
Yazdi has publicly supported the use of suicide bombing against the enemies of Islam and the use of death squads against political reformers .
He is often described as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s spiritual mentor , though at times , even the incumbent president has been too moderate for him .
When Ahmadinejad tried to change the law to allow women to attend soccer matches , he was publicly rebuked by Yazdi .
Possible election role :
The current turmoil should be a test of Yazdi ’s true loyalties .
In recent years , there has been speculation that Yazdi has been eyeing Khamenei ’s position .
If true , Yazdi could exploit the current turmoil to move against the supreme leader , but Nafisi thinks the rumors are overblown .
“ He ’s on Khamenei ’s payroll , ” he says .
“ [ Khamenei ’s predecessor , Ayatollah Ruhollah ] Khomeini hated Yazdi .
It was Khamenei who lifted him up and gave him his position . ”
On the other hand , Nafisi also believes that the relationship between Yazdi and Ahmadinejad has been exaggerated , noting that in the run-up to the election Yazdi “ said nothing in support ” of the president .
But if Yazdi is not overly fond of Ahmadinejad , he absolutely despises Iran ’s reformists and is unlikely to favor concessions to them .
GRAND AYATOLLAH NASER MAKAREM SHIRAZI
jafariyanews.com
Position : A grand ayatollah , the highest rank for Shiite clerics , Shirazi was very politically active before and during the 1979 revolution and played a role in writing the Islamic Republic ’s constitution .
Worldview : Shirazi is among the most conservative of the Iran ’s ayatollahs and one of the most influential .
His views on gender roles are particularly extreme ; he ’s written that men should be permitted to beat their wives for failing to perform their sexual obligations .
He is a “ major player in terms of advocating the authority of the supreme leader from a religious point of view , ” says Nafisi .
Possible election role : Shirazi , who can be relied upon to go to bat for Khamenei in any potential power struggle , came to his position of influence within the clerical establishment through a somewhat unusual route .
After the revolution , Shirazi was given control of Iran ’s sugar exports and became very wealthy in the process .
“ Today , Shirazi is powerful in Qom [ Iran ’s center of religious scholarship ] because he is the man the other clerics go to when they need money , ” Nafisi says .
The “ Sultan of Sugar ” has more than a few favors to call in if his friend Khamenei needs it .
AYATOLLAH QORBANALI DORRI -NAJAFABADI
AFP / Getty Images
Position : Iran ’s prosecutor general
Worldview : Dorri-Najafabadi has earned some ridicule in the West last year for calling Barbie dolls and Harry Potter a “ destructive culturally and a social danger , ” but his role in stifling dissent in Iran is deadly serious .
In his former post as minister of intelligence , Dorri - Najafabadi was implicated in the murders of numerous reformist politicians and journalists .
He was forced to resign that post under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami , but under Ahmadinejad he has reemerged as a major player in the Iranian state ’s security apparatus .
“ He ’s a very brutal guy , ” says Nafisi .
“ He ’s involved in nearly every atrocity . ”
Dorri-Najafabadi also spoke out shortly before the election to emphasize that whoever won , they should continue the struggle against Zionism .
Possible election role : Dorri-Najafabadi ’s political influence is limited , but he can still make life miserable through his influence in Iran ’s security and legal systems .
He has described pro-Mousavi marchers as “ opportunists ” who are “ engaged in criminal activities . ”
But Dorri-Najafabadi has been sending mixed signals recently .
He chastised election authorities for not allowing Ahmadinejad ’s opponents equal time during televised debates and the Association of Combatant Clerics , a leading group of reformists , has asked that he be invited to participate in the Guardian Council ’s deliberations on whether to hold an election recount .
It would be the ultimate irony if this longtime scourge of Iran ’s reformist movement emerged as a key ally .
HOJJATOL -ISLAM GHOLAM -HOSSEIN MOHSENI-EJEI
AFP / Getty Images
Position : Minister of intelligence and security
Worldview : A member of the infamous Ministry Of Intelligence and Security since its creation , Mohseni - Ejei is dedicated to protecting the Islamic Republic from enemies foreign and domestic .
He has on numerous occasions accused the United States and Israel of spying inside Iran and has routinely blames domestic unrest on foreign involvement .
Even after Iranian courts cleared U.S. journalist Roxanna Saberi of any wrongdoing , Mohseni - Ejei publicly maintained that she was a spy .
Mohseni -Ejei has a reputation , like Ahmadinejad , who appointed him to his current post , for being tough on corruption and brought prosecutions against a number of government officials in his former post as prosecutor general .
However , reformists point out that he has almost never prosecuted clerics suspected of corruption , earning him a reputation as an enforcer for the ayatollahs .
( Mohseni - Ejei is not an ayatollah himself but a hojjatol - Islam , a middle - ranking cleric . )
Possible election role : Since Iran ’s election crisis began , Mohseni - Ejei has followed his usual habit of blaming the unrest on international actors .
His ministry has carried out numerous arrests of “ provocation agents ” and he has warned that if demonstrators disturb the peace , they will “ not only be arrested … their identities will be made public . ”
Like Dorri-Najafabadi , Mohseni - Ejei is one of the most influential clerics in Iran ’s security establishment , but unlike him , “ he remains quite active politically , ” according to Nafisi .
He can be expected to lobby the state to resist reform and quash dissent .
Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel was a short - lived solo project by Les Claypool in the mid 90s , he played almost all the instruments on the recordings of all of the songs .
The touring band consists of Bryan " Brain " Mantia on Drums , Mark " MIRV " Haggard on Guitar , Adam Gates on Bass ( tuned an octave lower ) , and of course Les Claypool on Bass .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Global wind capacity grew by 29 percent in 2008 with the United States surpassing Germany to become the world ’s leading wind power generator , Worldwatch Institute said .
The Washington - based research organization said on Thursday that global wind capacity rose by over 27,000 megawatts ( MW ) , or enough to power around 27 million homes , to some 120,798 MW last year .
Power - generating windmill turbines form a wind farm near Port Saint Louis du Rhone , near Marseille on December 4 , 2008 .

Wind now provides 1.5 percent of the world ’s energy demand , up from 0.1 percent in 1997 .
U.S. wind capacity increased by 50 percent to 25,170 MW , or 21 percent of world capacity .
In Europe , wind represented the leading source of new power capacity , with 8,877 MW installed last year .
This was 28 percent more than new natural gas capacity and over 10 times more than new coal , Worldwatch said .
Europe now generates 65,946 MW of wind power , or 55 percent of global capacity .
Germany still leads the region , generating 23,903 MW of wind power , but it saw new installations drop slightly in 2008 .
In Asia , China ranked second globally in new capacity last year , adding some 6,300 MW to bring its total to over 12,200 MW .
The Chinese government has now surpassed its 2010 goal of 10,000 megawatts of installed wind power and a senior energy official said in April the country will have 100,000 MW in place by 2020 .
Fang Junshi , head of the coal department of the National Energy Administration , told a conference in Beijing that China ’s annual wind power growth rate will be about 20 percent , enough to outpace fast - growing nuclear energy .
India added 1,800 in new wind , and now ranks fifth globally with capacity of 9,645 MW , Worldwatch said .

Visit Rob Thurman online .
These days I ’m kept so busy reviewing books that it ’s rare for me to buy & catch up on an author ’s old works .
Something has to be very , very good indeed for me to take time out to do that .
That should give you some idea of how excellent Rob Thurman ’s Deathwish really was — I found out it was book four in her Leandros Brothers series and I had to , HAD TO , get the first three books .
And since these days it seems like by the time a series is done the first books are out of print already , I highly recommend picking this series up as quickly as you can .
Nightlife is book one in the saga of the Leandros brothers , Cal and his older brother Niko .
Well alright , technically they ’re half - brothers .
Their mother was a con-woman ;
Niko ’s father did n’t stick around ; and Cal ’s father was a monster .
No , not a figurative monster — a literal one , with sharp teeth , blood - red eyes , and an extremely deadly pedigree .
For years that monster was content to watch Cal from the shadows , but something changed that .
Now Niko and Cal are constantly on the run from the creatures they call “ Grendels , ” trying to stay one step ahead of the nightmare that even vampires and werewolves fear .
The two brothers are about as alike as night and day .
Niko ’s an obsessively orderly health nut schooled in the martial arts and swordplay , plenty deadly for a “ mere ” human and possessed of a keen intelligence and a dry wit .
Cal ’s a lazy junk - food bum with a preference for guns , a hair - trigger temper , and a sarcastic knack for pissing off everyone and everything .
He ’s also inherited a few things from his father , like the ability to sniff out other non-humans .
The brothers have been running from place to place for years , and they plan to keep doing the same , but New York City might just force them to stop running .
Here they can lose themselves in a thriving supernatural community .
Here they start making one or two tentative friendships , even if those friendships are with a lecherous Puck , an underage psychic , and a vampire .
Besides , the Grendels have hatched a plan , and they are n’t going to let the brothers slip through their fingers this time .
Where do I start ?
The book is told from Cal ’s viewpoint .
He ’s a wonderfully sarcastic young narrator — 19 years old , and his take on the world is noir - ish and cynical , yet in some ways vulnerably young and dependent on his brother Niko .
Rob Thurman gets into Cal ’s head so admirably that his personality vibrates from the pages !
The action is first - rate .
The entire book is filled with tense fights , flights , and arguments that keep the reader glued to the pages .
The narrative is highly visual , which contributes to the intensity of the action .
If that was n’t enough , Nightlife is darkly humorous enough to keep you wanting to quote page after page to everyone around you .
The characters are enjoyably witty , each in his own unique way .
And I just love the character of Rob Fellows , a car salesman and lonely Puck who gets sucked into the brothers ’ troubles .
This is n’t your average urban fantasy of werewolves , vampires , and elves .
The elves in this world are everyone ’s worst nightmare , and the werewolves and vampires are n’t at the top of the food chain .
Thurman ’s world has its own very distinctive feel , and it ’s a wonderful departure from the norm !
“ When [ the U.S. ] decouples , the world will thrive , ” Schiff told CNBC .
“ The world does n’t need our consumption , we need their production .
The global economy is fine without propping up the U.S. economy .
We are in serious , serious trouble . ”
Schiff said it ’s not only a possibility , but “ it ’s inevitable ” that Brazil and China are eventually going to dump the dollar as the international currency of choice .
( Watch interview for more of Schiff 's reasons why the U.S. dollar is in trouble . )
“ As far as I ’m concerned , the U.S. has already lost its AAA rated status , ” said Schiff .
He said emerging markets continue to be strong and had great gains since they bottomed in October 2008 .
“ Americans are going to lose their wealth if they go down with this ship , ” he said .
“ I ’m trying to help by getting their stocks abroad , out of the dollar and protecting them from Ben Bernanke , Obama and the congress . ”
Disclosure :
No immediate information was available for Schiff or his firm .

Crossword homework is here , like usual .
Socrates discusses part of an encounter with a perfect [ noble and good ] gentleman in Oeconomicus VII .
The gentleman ’s name is Ischomachos ; Socrates is relating his discussion with him for the sake of moderating the ambitions of the primary interlocutor of the Oeconomicus , Crito ’s son Critoboulus .
One of Critoboulos ’ problems is moderation ( cf. Memorabilia I.3.8 - 10 ; Symposium IV 10 - 18 ; Oeconomicus II 1 - 9 ) , and Socratic rhetoric in the Oeconomicus ultimately depends on convincing Critoboulos of the good of farming ( the word shares a root with phusis – nature ) .
So how philosophic the Oeconomicus is when all is said and done is an open question : nature is literally covered over with earth in this dialogue .
Strauss maintains that if Xenophon ’s works on Socrates correspond with the Xenophontic division between men ’s speeches , deeds , and silent deliberations , then the Oeconomicus is the Socratic speech , while the Symposium is the Socratic deed and the Apology the silent deliberation ( “ Xenophon ’s Socratic Discourse , ” 86 ; Memorabilia I.1.19 ; thank you to Sharon Loo for pointing this out initially ) .
I ’m in no position to argue with Strauss : I cannot claim any sort of expertise on this dialogue like I can attempt to with the Memorabilia : any conclusions you may want to reach about the Socratic manner of speaking from this should probably have some reference to Seth Benardete ’s The Rhetoric of Morality and Philosophy , which I have been working through carefully recently but am still very confused by .
The particular problem of this short book of the dialogue is introduced by Ischomachos ’ instruction to his wife on her proper role in the household ( economics comes from the Greek word for household management ) .
The perfect gentleman tells Socrates that he “ never spend [s ] time indoors , ” as his wife “ is quite able by herself to manage the things within the house ” ( Oeconomicus VII 3 ) .
This is not an innocent claim ; Ischomachos is totally dominated by his wife , as evidenced by the fact he only has leisure for the conversation because some clients did not show up ( VII 2 ) .
More importantly , when Ischomachos relates how he initially “ educated ” his wife to Socrates , we find him claiming to have said no less than :
“ … if you [ Ischomachos ’ wife ] look to be better than I and make me your servant , you will have no need to fear that with advancing age you will be honored any less in the household , and you may trust that as you grow older , the better a partner you prove to be for me , and for the children the better a guardian of the household , by so much more will you be honored in the household .
For the fine and good things increase for human beings , not by ripening like fair fruits , but through the exercise of the virtues in life ” ( VII 42 - 3 ) .
This sounds beautiful and noble , and it is to a degree , but the consensus among scholars is that Athenian women were treated like dirt .
One of the ironies of Athenian women watching tragedy was that tragic figures like Antigone were allowed to do things like leave the house .
I am not kidding on how restrictive Athenian law was on this score ; Ischomachos himself began his speech to his wife by saying that the gods designed man by nature for the outdoors , and woman for the indoors ( VII 18 - 23 ) .
To a degree , he is reaping ironic fruits from that instruction .
The real darkness of Ischomachos ’ speech concerns children .
The woman loves the child more than the man because of nature ( VII 24 ) ; children are only necessary because they are “ supporters in old age ” ( VII 19 ) .
The beauty and nobility of this speech drops almost entirely away when one considers its overarching purpose :
[ Ischomachos : ] “ … this household is what is common to us .
As to myself , everything of mine I declare to be in common , and as for you , everything you ’ve brought you have deposited in common .
It ’s not necessary to calculate which of us has contributed the greater number of things , but it is necessary to know this well , that whichever of us is the better partner will be the one to contribute the things of greater worth . ”
To this , Socrates , my wife replied : “ What can I do to help you ? ” she said .
“ What is my capacity ?
But everything depends on you : my work , my mother told me , is to be moderate . ”
“ By Zeus , woman , ” I said , “ my father told me the same thing .
But it ’s for moderate people – for man and woman alike – not only to keep their substance in the best condition but also to add as much as possible to it by fine and just means . ”
“ Then what do you see , ” said my wife , “ that I might do to help in increasing the household ? ” “ By Zeus , ” I said , “ just try to do in the best manner possible what the gods have brought you forth to be capable of and what the law praises . ” ( VII 13 - 16 , boldface mine )
I think you can see what ’s happening here : this is a thoroughly materialistic society that has traditions , and those traditions are merging with the materialism ( if they had n’t done so before ) to form a definition of “ moderation ” that is anything but moderate .
( Not far from this is the notion that a society can form an idea of “ equality ” that is anything but equal , but if you ca n’t think that far , do n’t trouble yourself . )
There ’s a lot you can do within the law that manages to be very unjust to your fellow citizens , not to mention humanity at large ; it is , perhaps , knowing this that Ischomachos insists on a separation of “ nature ” ( the gods ’ design ) and law ( what all man - made laws everywhere insist is good ) , even while pretty much saying that the law exists only to give an “ honorable ” stamp on nature .
The fundamental good is acquistion for Ischomachos ; one wonders if Socrates is letting him speak so that Critoboulos can see the unwitting results of immoderation .
Again , before I conclude , I need to be clear – this is not meant to be a rehash of the recent thoughts on Euripides ’
Hippolytus , despite some strong parallels .
There ’s a ton going on in this text – in this passage even – for which I do n’t have proper insight yet .
Ultimately , Xenophon , Plato , and thinkers like Euripides do n’t talk about “ materialism ” because that ’s too simplistic / moralistic a concept to benefit thought .
If you ’re thinking about what goods motivate people and to which are the goods we ought to be directed , and willing to keep the question open , you ’re probably already in a more philosophic frame of mind .
You may be ready for the deeper themes of why we think the way we do , and how that gets incredibly complicated very quickly .
The most stunning irony here is that the perfect gentleman – one who strives for prosperity , honor and a solid place in public life – is entirely ruled by his private fortune , therefore entirely ruled by his wife .
It is not clear Ischomachos could be trusted to rule the city well , or participate in such rule well : his wife is the one , because of her care over the servants and the children , who has to work with human nature and see how people respond so things get done .
His wife has to make speeches to others and set up incentives for others .
And yet none of that can translate appropriately into rule in the city necessarily , without some more learning , attention and ability .
A more honorable notion of the holding of power – that it is for a greater good , a greater future for all – is reduced to preserving what one has and grabbing more , and again , we note that Athenian society had a propensity to blame this on women ( cf. Aristophanes , Lysistrata ) , instead of taking a good hard look at their own values and rhetoric and seeing where the truth really lay .
Ischomachos ’ private discourse is unwittingly political , and we are at a far remove from philosophy : the erotic is neither present in marriage nor this speech , as Socrates speaks not much at all in Book VII .

Although the adverse effects of women taking psychiatric drugs while pregnant related to birth defects and infant withdrawal syndrome are often discussed or reported , the serious adverse effects on the sex lives and reproductive systems of millions of young couples are rarely mentioned .
Whatever the reason , due to the ever widening marketing campaigns by the psycho- pharmaceutical industry , young people need to be warned before they get conned into taking psychiatric drugs .
Sexual dysfunction , including lack of libido , orgasmic dysfunction and delayed ejaculation , are common side effects of using SSRI antidepressants , according to the May 2005 report , “ The Marketing of Depression : The Prescribing of SSRI Antidepressants to Women , ” by Dr Janet Currie .
The report warns :
“ There are concerns that not all sexual dysfunction may fully resolve after termination of treatment .
Since SSRIs are prescribed more often for women , women are more frequently affected by SSRI - induced sexual dysfunction .
Because SSRIs can also lead to a worsening of depression , paradoxical effects , emotional blunting or detachment , reduced emotional activity , memory loss and confusion , these effects , in conjunction with sexual dysfunction , can negatively affect intimate relationships . ”
In 2006 , Dr Antonei Csoka , from the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences , at the University of Pittsburgh , and Dr Stuart Shipko , in private practice , in Pasadena , California published a paper titled , “ Persistent Sexual Side Effects after SSRI Discontinuation , ” in Psychotherapy & Psychosomatics .
The paper documented three cases of fairly severe and permanent sexual dysfunction resulting from prior use of SSRIs in two men and one women .
“ These case studies have important clinical implications , ” the authors note .
“ They suggest that when patients develop sexual dysfunction as a side effect of SSRIs , clinicians should be alert to the possibility that restoration of sexual function may not correlate temporally with medication cessation . ”
In recent studies , “ doctors have specifically asked about sexual difficulties , and found that they are present in up to 83 % of patients , ” the authors report .
“ Patients are often willing to continue taking SSRIs despite sexual side effects , but the possibility of increasing the probability of dysfunction remaining after discontinuance should be taken into consideration , ” they state .
“ Such persistent side effects could even worsen the long - term prognosis of depression . ”
“ I suspect that these three cases are just the tip of the iceberg and that possibly thousands of people are similarly affected , ” Dr Csoka told this author in an email .
In July 2005 , WebMD noted that sexual side effects can cause significant problems of their own .
“ For both men and women , this means being unable to initiate , participate fully in , or enjoy sex , and that can lead to a crippling loss of self - confidence that can , in turn , undermine depression recovery , ” the article pointed out .
On the website , Prozac.com , under possible side effects of Prozac , “ decreased sex drive ” and “ impotence ” are listed .
It also states Prozac “ can cause changes in sexual desire and satisfaction . ”
After five years of tracking Big Pharma ’s disease mongering and off - label marketing schemes , I can say without a doubt that the sickest plot ever devised is the legislation moving through the US Senate right now referred to as the “ Mothers Act , ” for short .
This is the sickest of all marketing schemes because it is aimed at young couples in child bearing years and reaches into the cradle where the brains and bodies of the most vulnerable victims will be forcibly drugged through pregnant and nursing mothers without any voice of their own in the matter .
Although the language in the Act says postpartum conditions refers to “ postpartum depression ” and “ postpartum psychosis , ” the campaigns run through websites like Postpartum Support International , Postpartum Progress and Perinatal Pro , are using the bill as a vehicle to diagnose pregnant and nursing mothers with a whole list of pregnancy related “ mood ” and “ anxiety ” disorders to further a new cottage industry in the works for treating these women .
For instance , one website is run by Karen Kleiman , who happens to have her own counseling agency called the “ Postpartum Stress Center , ” and quite a few books to sell .
On this website you can even buy some books directly with paypal and bypass Amazon .
“ The Postpartum Stress Center specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety disorders , ” the homepage says .
Services offered at the Center include , “ Screening for prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety , ” and “ Psychiatric evaluation and follow - up . ”
The postpartum websites continuously argue that the Act does not promote screening women , but the bill they tried to slip through Congress last year specifically called for screening women and referring them for services .
The language in the 2008 bill stated : “ To ensure that new mothers and their families are educated about postpartum depression , screened for symptoms , and provided with essential services , and to increase research at the National Institutes of Health on postpartum depression . ”
The truth is , universal screening has always been the goal of this blatant off - label marketing scheme because no psychiatric drug has been FDA approved as safe for use by pregnant women and screening opens the door for drug treatment .
The screening language was removed only after strong objections were raised about the prospect of requiring all women to be screened and referred to treatment .
The history of the attempts to pass this legislation clearly shows screening was the plan .
For instance , Dr Katherine Wisner is professor of psychiatry , obstetrics , gynecology and reproductive sciences and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , and her work in promoting screening as well as drug use by pregnant and nursing mothers is constantly cited on the postpartum websites .
In an editorial in the December 2006 , Journal of the American Medical Association , Dr Wisner recommended “ that the United States take steps to implement a universal screening program , in which all women are screened between two - and 12 - weeks postpartum , ” the University reported in a December 5 , 2006 news release with the heading , “ JAMA Editorial Notes Childbearing Presents Unique Vulnerability for Psychiatric Illness , Making Effective Screening , Education and Treatment Essential . ”
“ Those presenting with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder should be treated immediately after diagnosis , ” Dr Wisner said in the University news release .
The Mothers Act is said to be modeled after a New Jersey law in the home state of the bill ’s main sponsor , Senator Robert Menendez .
“ The State of New Jersey has been the first to address the problem on the governmental level by legislating that all women receive screening and education for postpartum depression ; the law went into effect in October ( 2006 ) , ” the University pointed out .
Six months prior to the JAMA editorial calling for “ universal screening ” and “ treating immediately , ” on August 5 , 2006 , Medical News Today ran the headline : “ Commonly Used Anti-depressants Safe And Effective For Treating Postpartum Depression , ” for a study led by Dr Wisner published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology .
The researchers compared the tricyclic , nortriptyline , and Pfizer ’s Zoloft , but there was no placebo group to see if the drugs worked any better than a sugar pill , which countless studies have shown they rarely if ever do .
“ We ’ve been treating postpartum depression based on the assumption that drugs that work for a woman with depression under usual circumstances will work for a woman who experiences depression after giving birth , but there have not been studies that provide scientific proof that this was an effective and safe course of treatment , ” Dr Wisner told Medical News .
“ Treating these women based on that assumption was simply not good enough , and we felt compelled to provide scientific evidence to guide postpartum depression treatment decisions , ” she stated .
The disclosure by Medical News said Pfizer provided the Zoloft for the study but did not provide any direct financial support for the conduct of the study .
It was noted that Dr Wisner is a member of Pfizer ’s speaker ’s bureau and has a grant from Pfizer for a study of ziprasidone ( antipsychotic Geodon ) pharmacokinetics during pregnancy , and is also a member of the speaker ’s bureau for GlaxoSmithKline .
A 2005 paper in JAMA reported that Dr Wisner had received grant funding from Pfizer and “ is a member of the speaker ’s bureau for Pfizer , GlaxoSmithKline , and Shire . ”
Dr Wisner is also “ a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association , ” the University website notes .
In a running list of Mothers Act supporters , the Perinatal Pro website , which is actually another site run by the owner of a treatment center , Susan Stone , with a book for sale , lists the APA as endorsing the bill .
This Big Pharma front group will probably go down in history as the most notorious disease mongering association of all time .
A prime example of disease mongering at its worst can be found in a May 21 , 2008 headline by US News and World Reports stating : “ Postpartum Depression Strikes New Fathers , Too , ” with a story based on research presented at the APA ’s annual meeting .
Ten percent of new fathers and 14 % of new mothers are affected by depression , psychologist James Paulson , assistant professor of pediatrics at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk , told US News .
“ If untreated , a father ’s postpartum depression can be harmful to the child as well as to both parents , ” the article noted .
On May 8 , 2008 WebMD reported that then APA President , Dr Nada Stotland , said first - time new dads are at greatest risk for postpartum depression and apparently the causes of this newly discovered mental disorder are as follows :
“ The life changes for a new dad are enormous .
Just thinking about the costs of raising the kid to 21 , maybe for life , can be terrifying .
And all the unspoken fears :
Will my wife still be as interested in me ?
Will my baby be as cute as my brother ’s baby ? ” , Stotland explained to WebMD .
Stotland has served on the speakers ’ bureaus of Glaxo and Pfizer , according to Slate Magazine .
In 2006 , the pharmaceutical industry accounted for about 30 % of the APA ’s $ 62.5 million in financing , the July 12 , 2008 New York Times reported .
Pfizer ’s 2008 grant report shows donations of more than $ 700,000 to this “ non-profit . ”
Lilly gave grants totaling more than $ 600,000 in both the first and second quarter of 2008 .
In 2007 , the APA received over $ 400,000 from Lilly and another $ 450,000 went to the American Psychiatric Foundation .
Last summer , an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee , led by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley Senator accused the now president of the APA , Dr Alan Schatzberg of Stanford , of failing to disclose payments of over $ 70,000 from Johnson & Johnson and Lilly in filings with the University .
The Senator also revealed Schatzberg ’s stock ownership of millions of dollars in a company seeking to commercialize a depression drug .
Schatzberg has since stepped down as chair of the psychiatry department at Emory .
On May 29 , 2009 , Katherine Stone wrote on the Postpartum Progress website : “ The MOTHERS Act is not sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry . ”
“ Its only sponsors , ” she said , “ are the Senators ( Menendez ) and Representatives ( Rush ) who created it and brought it to a vote , thanks to the unending insistence of Carol Blocker , the mother of Melanie Blocker Stokes , who committed suicide while suffering from postpartum psychosis . ”
“ Its endorsers , I might point out , include the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists , the March of Dime , the National Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition , the Chidlren ’s Defense Fund and NOW , ” she says , and also mentions a new one , the National Perinatal Foundation .
However , Katherine did not mention the main supporters listed on Perinatal Pro , including the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance , Mental Health America ( MHA ) , National Alliance for the Mentally Ill ( NAMI ) , National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare , and the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA and the APA .
This sudden omission might have something to do with an article I wrote titled , “ Just Say No to the Mothers Act , ” in which I showed all the drug company money directly flowing to these front groups in great detail .
On June 2 , 2009 , Amy Philo , the leader of “ Unite For Life , ” a coalition of 50 groups against the Mothers Act , posted the dollar amounts funneled to these main supporters of the Act on her website , based on estimates from specific excerpts from the “ Just Say No , ” article , also posted on the site .
The total she came up with was between $ 13,095,010 and $ 16,487,497 .
The variation in the total amount resulted from the fact that front groups will often list how much companies give by wide margins
For instance , the 2007 Annual Report for the Depression and Bipolar Alliance says the group received between $ 150,000 and $ 499,000 from AstraZeneca , Pfizer , and Wyeth .
Abbott , Cyberonics , Lilly , Forest , Glaxo , Organon , and Otsuka American Pharmaceuticals gave between $ 10,000 and $ 149,999 .
The 2006 annual report for Mental Health America shows the group received over $ 1 million from Lilly , Bristol - Myers , and Wyeth in 2006 .
Pfizer and Janssen gave between $ 500,000 and $ 1,000,000 , and AstraZeneca and Forest Labs donated between $ 100,000 and $ 499,000 .
Glaxo gave the group between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 .
As I have previously pointed out , Pfizer ’s 2008 grant report shows a $ 20,000 grant to a Mental Health America group in Georgia to sponsor : “ Project Healthy Moms : Education for Prevention / Treatment for Perinatal Depression Disorders . ”
Next , I found a June 8 , 2008 newsletter put out by the Georgia group that advertised Katherine Stone as the speaker for the lectures paid for by Pfizer .
However , the Georgia group called the program : “ Project Healthy Moms : What You Need To Know About Perinatal Mood Disorders . ”
E -news said attendees of her presentation would learn in part : “ One size does NOT fit all :
Why postpartum depression is just part of a spectrum of mood disorders women may experience & what to look for . ”
Without disclosing the large amount , e-news stated : “ This special hour of learning is made possible by a grant from Pfizer . ”
But in checking the Georgia group ’s website yesterday , the ad there contained no mention of the fact that Pfizer paid the tab .
Pfizer markets drugs now commonly called “ mood stablizers , ” such as the anticonvulsants Lyrica and Neurontin , and the antipsychotic Geodon , 3 antidepressants including Zoloft , and Viagra , a big seller , likely due in part , to all the sexual side effects caused by psych drugs .
After Senator Grassley demanded an accounting , the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill , the executive director , Michael Fitzpatrick , admitted that “ pharmaceutical companies contributed an average of 56 % of national NAMI ’s budget annually for the period 2005 to 2009 , ” in an April 28 , 2009 letter to NAMI leaders and members .
Amy ’s total does not include money to the National Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition , which receives money from Wyeth , Glaxo , J&J , Merck , and Sanofi Pasteur .
The total amount funneled through the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA is not available because it recently merged with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Pfizer and Lilly were the only drug companies with public disclosures of their grants to both groups .
Dr Charles Nemeroff , another disgraced shrink who recently stepped down as the chair of the department of psychiatry at Emory University after 17 years , took over the presidency of the Foundation for Suicide Prevention for a 3 - year term in 2008 .
Nemeroff ’s resignation came after Senator Grassley revealed that he had earned more than $ 2.8 million from drug companies between 2000 and 2007 , but failed to disclose at least $ 1.2 million to Emory .
Amy included this amount in the estimated total .
The list of members on councils and committees on the Foundation ’s website includes Alan Lipschitz , MD , from Glaxo , Steven Romano , MD , of Pfizer , David Norton from Johnson & Johnson , and Cathryn Clary , MD of Pfizer , along with APA president , Alan Schatzberg , and Dr Frederick Goodwin , who had his radio show thrown off the air last fall after Senator Grassley revealed that he failed to tell listeners that he was receiving millions of dollars from drug companies .
The “ Directors ” of the Foundation include Pfizer ’s Cathryn Clary , and Philip Ninan , MD of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals .
Katherine has herself listed online for hire on Linked In with a lead - off pitch that reads : “ Talented , award - winning marketing and PR professional returning to the workforce after brief sabbatical as full - time mom . ”
“ Skills include experiential marketing concept development , brand positioning , marketing strategy , social networking , and public relations campaign development and execution , ” she writes .
“ Used break from full - time employment to become an expert at social media , creating most widely - read blog in the U.S. in her niche , ” the summary says in obvious refererence to the Postpartum Progress site .
At the end , Katerine includes a paragraph on her days as an agent for the the public relations firm Cohn & Wolfe .
This firm ’s clients have included Lilly , Merck , Novartis , Pfizer and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention .
Another website with links to all the others , is run by Lauren Hale , the Postpartum Support International Georgia coordinator .
Her site seems dedicated to minimizing any negative information that comes out about taking psych drugs while pregnant or harm to the fetus .
Once a commentary or article is posted on her site , the other gals usually put up a link to it on theirs to get maximum exposure on the internet .
For instance , on April 29 , Hale used her site to discount some of the top experts in the field quoted in the May 2009 Vogue article , “ Pregnant Pause , ” by Alexis Jetter , which stated : “ With a flurry of recent reports challenging the safety of antidepressant drugs for unborn babies , doctors and concerned mothers - to - be are rethinking the guidelines . ”
“ What alarms doctors is the sheer number of pregnant women who use SSRI antidepressants – perhaps as many as 250,000 in the U.S. each year – when we still know so little about how the drugs effect babies , ” Jetter reported .
“ SSRI usage dramatically increases the chances that a baby may be miscarried , born prematurely or too small , suffer erratic heartbeats , and have trouble breathing , ” she noted .
The rise to 250,000 appears to be quite a jump considering that back in the May 2005 Journal of the American Medical Association , researchers estimated that in any given year about 80,000 pregnant women in US were prescribed SSRIs .
In the article , Jetter quotes Dr Adam Urato as saying , “ these antidepressants are portrayed almost like prenatal vitamins that will level out their mood and lead to a healthier baby .
But antidepressants have not been shown to decrease rates of miscarriage or birth defects or low birth weight .
On the contrary , they ’ve been shown to increase those problems . ”
Hale ’s commentary was titled , “ Thoughts on exploring a “ Pregnancy Pause , ” and she also sent it to Vogue .
“ I methodically refuted and balanced the article ’s bias against medicating with anti-depressants during pregnancy , ” she writes on her site .
On May 6 , Karen Kleiman provided a link to “ Thoughts ” on her website and told readers , “ Please take the time to read her very thoughtful and well - researched post . ”
The same day , Katherine also posted a link on Postpartum Progress with the headline , “ Hale Responds to Vogue Piece on Antidepressants in Pregnancy . ”
Not surprisingly , Hale specifically singled out the comments made by Dr Urato in the Vogue article .
In 2006 , Urato was responsible for exposing the fact that the financial ties of the authors to SSRI makers were not disclosed in a paper titled , “ Relapse of Major Depression During Pregnancy in Women Who Maintain or Discontinue Antidepressant Treatment , ” published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , which led to major media coverage and a public admonition by the editor of JAMA reporting that seven authors had failed to reveal their financial ties to drug makers .
A letter from Urato was also published in JAMA , stating that being the study dealt in part with the question of stopping antidepressants during pregnancy , the readers should be aware of the potential for pro-drug bias .
The Wall Street Journal reported that , “ the study and resulting television and newspaper reports of the research failed to note that most of the 13 authors are paid as consultants or lecturers by the makers of antidepressants , ” and “ the authors failed to disclose more than 60 different financial relationships with drug companies . ”
Most of the authors , the Journal noted , were leading psychiatrists at Harvard ’s Massachusetts General Hospital , Emory University , and the University of California Los Angeles .
The American Psychiatric Associations ’s pumping up SSRI sales at their annual meeting via a new male diagnosis of PPD may cause problems for couples who want more children for more reasons than lack of interest in sex by one or both partners .
On October 24 , 2006 , the Guardian reported that a study by doctors at the Cornell Medical Center found that two patients who had normal sperm counts and mobility before taking SSRIs had a severe deterioration of both when they began taking the antidepressants .
The doctors , who were treating the two men for infertility , found that when the men stopped taking the SSRIs , their fertility problems disappeared only to resume again when they went back on SSRIs .
The problem is believed to be caused by an adverse effect of SSRIs on both the concentration and swimming ability of sperm .
The men were tested over a 2 - year period and Dr Peter Schlegel , who presented the research at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference , in New Orleans , explained that :
“ The patients had normal sperm counts and motility before medication .
On the medication they have severe deterioration of both .
The same patients going on and off medication had the same pattern .
It shows a strong association . ”
Impotence and delayed ejaculation are well - known side - effects of SSRIs but now Dr Schlegel says he believes the drugs may be preventing sperm from getting into semen .
“ These were men with normal sperm counts that went to nearly zero when they were on these antidepressants but returned to normal when they were off them .
It ’s a dramatic effect and it ’s never been described before , ” he advised in the Guardian article .
“ We believe that while it ’s had a profound effect on these two men , ” he said , “ it could be having a significant but more subtle effect on many more men . ”
Two years later , on September 24 , 2008 , Bloomberg News reported another study from Cornell University that found Paxil may impair fertility by damaging DNA in sperm .
The study of 35 healthy men who were given the antidepressant “ found that the amount of damaged DNA in the men ’s sperm rose to 30.3 percent after four weeks , from 13.8 percent , ” the report noted .
“ We suspect the other SSRIs would have similar effects , ” Dr Schlegel told Bloomberg .
The treatment for all these “ mood ” and “ anxiety ” disorders women will be screened for as a result of the Mothers Act , includes not only antidepressants , but also drugs used as “ mood stabilizers , ” such as the antipsychotics Zyprexa , Seroquel , Risperdal , Invega , Geodon and Abilify , and antiseizure medications , along with benzodiazepines like Ativan and Xanax and sleeping pills such as Ambien or Lunesta .
In most cases patients are given combinations of different types of drugs at the same time .
In fact , two different drug classes , Zyprexa and Prozac , are combined in Lilly ’s Symbyax , and prescribed for “ treatment resistant ” depression .
This one is a real money maker , selling at $ 1,564 for ninety 12 - 25 mg capsules on DrugStore.com in May 2009 .
For a simple diagnosis of “ postpartum obsessive - compulsive disorder , ” after her first pregnancy , Katherine Stone took “ Effexor , Celexa , Seroquel , Risperdal , Wellbutrin , Luvox , Cymbalta , and etc. , ” according to a line in a story about the treatment she received on her website , which was removed after I wrote about it .
In a blog describing her treatment during her next pregnancy , where she admits she took Cymbalta throughout , Katherine identifies her shrink .
“ I saw my fabulous psychiatrist at Emory every month ( Hi Dr. Newport ! ) , ” she writes .
That would be the Dr Jeffrey Newport at Emory University who has received research support from Lilly , Glaxo , Janssen , and Wyeth , and has served on speaker ’s bureaus and / or received honoraria from AstraZeneca , Lilly , Glaxo , Pfizer , and Wyeth , according disclosures in the August 2007 study titled , “ Atypical Antipsychotic Administration During Late Pregnancy : Placental Passage and Obstetrical Outcomes . ”
Another author listed on this antipsychotic study is Charles Nemeroff .
On April 29 , 2009 , Philip Dawdy ’s headline on the popular website Furious Seasons , read : “ 10 Percent Of Depressed Patients Now Take Antipsychotics , ” based on statements made during a conference call by executives of Abilify maker Bristol - Myers Squibb .
“ Forget about Prozac Nation , this is Atypical Nation , ” he said .
“ Antipsychotics are now the top revenue producing class of drugs , topping even statins .
The labeling on Risperdal says Risperdal “ can raise the blood levels of a hormone known as prolactin , causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia .
Blood levels of prolactin remain elevated with continued use . ”
“ Some side effects seen with these medications include the absence of a menstrual period ; breasts producing milk ; the development of breasts by males ; and the inability to achieve an erection , ” the label notes .
A Patient Fact Sheet by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , explains that , “ Hyperprolactinemia is a condition in which too much prolactin is present in the blood of women who are not pregnant and in men . ”
“ In women , this results in a decline in the body ’s production of progesterone after ovulation which , in turn , can lead to irregular ovulation and infrequent menstruation , cause you to stop menstruating altogether , or cause your breasts to start producing milk , a condition called galactorrhea , ” it states .
“ Men also can experience galactorrhea , ” the Society says .
“ High prolactin levels in men can also lead to impotence , reduced libido , and infertility . ”
A 2005 paper titled , “ Medication - Induced Hyperprolactinemia , ” from the Mayo Clinic reports that other classes of medications that cause hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants .
“ The clinical consequences of hyperprolactinemia include galactorrhea and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , the latter manifesting as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in women , erectile dysfunction in men , and loss of libido and infertility in both sexes , ” the paper states .
A July 1 , 2000 paper in the American Family Physician , by Dr Nancy Phillips , lists psychoactive medications that cause “ disorders of desire ” as antipsychotics , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , SSRIs , Lithium and Tricyclic antidepressants .
The list of drugs that cause “ disorders of arousal ” also includes benzodriazepines , SSRIs and Tricyclic antidepressants .
These drugs , as well as antipsychotics and amphetamines ( ADHD drugs ) are reported to cause “ orgasmic dysfunction ” in the paper .
Purely to increase profits , people are encouraged to take psychiatric drugs for life and in some cases can never get off because the withdrawal syndrome is so severe .
It would be interesting see how many patients would be willing to begin a life - long treatment regimen if doctors were required to warn that it could mean the end of a normal sex life .
It would also be interesting to know how many patients are given the opportunity to check with their partners to see how long they will remain in a sexless relationship .
Correction :
The article above mistakenly says that Alan Schatzberg stepped down as chair of the psychiatry department at Emory .
He is at Stanford and he has not stepped down as chair of the psychiatry department .
The statement should have been that Schatzberg of Stanford has “ resigned his position as principal investigator on a federal research grant in response to the committee ’s scrutiny , ” the Stanford Daily reported .

The following is from then - Sen .
Barack Obama 's floor statement explaining why he would vote against confirming Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts ( September 2005 ) :
. . . [ T ]he decision with respect to Judge Roberts ' nomination has not been an easy one for me to make .
As some of you know , I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and taught courses in constitutional law .
Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views .
What engenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar arrives at but , rather , the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision .
Given that background , I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume , his conduct during the hearings , and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon .
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land .
Moreover , he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge .
He is humble , he is personally decent , and he appears to be respectful of different points of view .
It is absolutely clear to me that Judge Roberts truly loves the law .
He could n't have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for the law , and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does , in fact , deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 % of the cases that come before the federal court -- adherence to precedence , a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional text , a respect for procedural regularity , and an impartiality in presiding over the adversarial system .
All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts .
The problem I face -- a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues , both those who are voting for Mr. Roberts and those who are voting against Mr. Roberts -- is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 % of the cases that come before a court , so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 % of the cases -- what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 % of cases that are truly difficult .
In those cases , adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon .
That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one 's deepest values , one 's core concerns , one 's broader perspectives on how the world works , and the depth and breadth of one 's empathy .
In those 5 % of hard cases , the constitutional text will not be directly on point .
The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear .
Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision .
In those circumstances , your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country , or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions , or whether the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce , whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled -- in those difficult cases , the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge 's heart .
I talked to Judge Roberts about this .
Judge Roberts confessed that , unlike maybe professional politicians , it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings .
That is not how he is trained .
He did say he does n't like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the weak .
I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way .
The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts ' record and history of public service , it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak .
In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General 's Office , he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process .
In these same positions , he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man .
I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he does n't like bullies and he sees the law and the court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak .
But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the court , I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting .
The bottom line is this : I will be voting against John Roberts ' nomination .

Afghanistan 's leading human rights ­organisation is investigating claims that white phosphorus was used during a deadly battle between US forces and the Taliban last week in which scores of civilians may have died .
Nader Nadery , a senior officer at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , said the organisation was concerned that the chemical , which can cause severe burns , might have been used in the firefight in Bala Baluk , a district in the western province of Farah .
Dr Mohammad Aref Jalali , the head of an internationally funded burns hospital in Herat , said villagers taken to hospital after the incident had " highly unusual burns " on their hands and feet that he had not seen before .
" We can not be 100 % sure what type of chemical it was and we do not have the equipment here to find out .
One of the women who came here told us that 22 members of her family were totally burned .
She said a bomb distributed white power that caught fire and then set people 's clothes alight . "
US forces in Afghanistan denied they had used the chemical , and have also said claims that up to 147 civilians were killed were grossly exaggerated .
As with previous such tragedies , both sides have made wildly different claims , with the Taliban seeking to exploit ­popular fury and US officials attempting to limit the damage and blame the Taliban for allegedly using civilians as human shields .
But members of the human rights department at the UN mission in Afghanistan have been appalled by witness testimony from people in the village , according to one official in Kabul who talked anonymously to the Guardian .
He said bombs were dropped after militants had quit the battlefield , which appeared to be backed up by the US air force 's own daily report , which is published online .
" The stories that are emerging are quite frankly horrifying , " the official said .
" It is quite apparent that the large bulk of casualties were called in after the initial fighting had subsided and both the troops and the Taliban had withdrawn .
" Local villagers went to the mosque to pray for peace .
Shortly after evening prayers the air strikes were called in , and they continued for a couple of hours whilst the villagers were frantically calling the local governor to get him to call off the air strikes . "
He said that women and children hid inside their homes while their men went on to the roofs with guns .
US forces say these men were militants , but the UN official said they were simply villagers and " it is totally normal for them to have guns " .
Also contested is an incident immediately after the battle when people from the village took piles of corpses to the governor 's compound in the provincial capital .
The UN official said their willingness to ignore the Islamic custom of organising burial within 24 hours of death showed the level of anger .
A statement by US forces said insurgents forced tribal elders to parade the corpses through neighbouring villages to " incite outrage " .
It said that a joint US - Afghan investigation team confirmed that " a number of civilians were killed in the course of the fighting but is unable to determine with certainty which of those causalities were Taliban fighters and which were non-combatants " .
Last week Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , called for all air strikes in villages to be stopped , a view privately backed by many in the UN .
Yesterday Barack Obama 's national security adviser , Gen James Jones , ruled out such a change in policy , saying " we ca n't fight with one hand tied behind our back " .

The sudden ubiquity of ways to share one ’s most intimate observations every second of every day has Michael Rosenberg , in the Detroit Free Press , worried he recently let an original thought go “ unwritten , unblogged , unTwittered , unFacebooked . ”
He tries to jog his memory , not wanting another to get away : “ Would n’t it send me on a vicious downward spiral , leaving me with all sorts of private emotions and feelings , even dreams ? ”
“ So I waited for the light to turn green , and pulled into a parking lot to send a tweet ( ' Wonderin ’ what my 6th - grade English teacher looked like naked lol ' ) and then , 4 miles later , I stopped at a deli for lunch , ” he recalls .
“ But during those 4 miles , I had another , totally separate thought .
I know I did .
I just ca n’t remember what it was . ”

National Geographic has helped answer our burning questions about where we 'd end up if we actually pulled a trick from The Core and shot ourselves through the center of the planet .
This diagram shows several antipodes , or spots on the exact opposite side of the planet from you .

According to National Geographic :
From most locations in the Northern Hemisphere , the opposite spot is water , since oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth . . .
Playing antipodes produces amusing pairings .
Bermudans would still enjoy sea breezes by Perth , Australia , but climate shock would await Timbuktu 's desert dwellers , who 'd come up near tropical Fiji .
And as one player says , " Imagine the disappointment of someone digging their way out of Siberia and ending up in Antarctica . "

It seeks to work with similar bodies in other European countries , North America and elsewhere in the world .
Bill Watkins , the outspoken former chief executive of Seagate , wants to make a thinner iPod .
Paul Sakuma / Associated Press
The Silicon Valley veteran has joined the board of Vertical Circuits , a start - up that has come up with a technique for cramming large amounts of flash memory into a tight space .
By using Vertical Circuits ’ technology , device makers can fit lots of high - speed memory into their products and leave more room for bigger displays and larger batteries .
“ The thing that has stunned me is how much a Dell or Apple will pay for thinness , ” Mr. Watkins said .
“ There ’s a big difference for them between 2 mm and 1 mm on some of this stuff . ”
Mr. Watkins knows plenty about the desires of PC and device makers .
He ran Seagate ’s hard - drive empire for years , before being dismissed as chief executive in January and replaced by the company ’s chairman , Stephen Luczo .
Reflecting on his departure , Mr. Watkins said , “ I am a certain type of person and will do things a certain way .
Sometimes , I get into disagreements with people , and that was a classic example of that . ”
Mr. Watkins says he ’s “ still on the hook for a while ” at Seagate in a consulting role but has started dabbling with some new projects like Vertical Circuits .
The start - up specializes in what semiconductor folks call 3 - D stacking technology .
Essentially , this means placing chips on top of each other and forming electrical connections between the products .
The technique can lead to faster communications between the chips , takes advantage of vertical space inside products and can reduce the need for wires stretching across a device .
Vertical Circuits has technology for connecting memory chips to other memory chips , computational chips to graphics chips and various other combinations .
But its main focus for the moment is on connecting the flash memory chips used to store data in hand - held devices .
According to Sunil Kaul , the chief executive at Vertical Circuits , current stacking methods are cumbersome and inefficient .
Companies today will stack some types of memory chips on top of each other using a technique known as wire bonding , where loops of gold wires link the chips together and to an underlying circuit board .
Or they will create packages where groups of chips are meshed together inside some conductive material that then has a wire coming out of it to connect to the rest of the system .
In either case , the wires and the packaging material take up a fair amount of space .
Vertical Circuits has developed a patented ooze that it uses to create electrical connections between chips .
It dribbles this silver - based epoxy over the chips , reducing the need for wires or clunky packages that group chips together .
When seen under the microscope , the goo covering the chips is reminiscent of lava coating terraced farms on a hillside .
Mr. Kaul says that Vertical Circuits can save device makers space and let them use larger , higher - capacity chips .
Ultimately , the company is talking about a difference of 1.6 mm — about the thickness of a chain necklace — between its stacks of memory chips and more conventional ones .
“ The device makers are dying to get that 1.6 mm back , ” Mr. Kaul said .
He argues that the 1.6 mm could be the difference between a larger battery or larger screen fitting into a new device .
Vertical Circuits is staying quiet about its arrangements with chip makers and assemblers , although Mr. Kaul said he hoped to announce a number of partnerships in the coming months .
The company has yet to turn a profit , but it will in “ the next few quarters , ” Mr. Kaul said .
Devices using the silver ooze should appear later this year .
Intel and other major chip makers are working on even more complex 3 - D stacking techniques that would create direct connections between computational processors and memory , speeding the flow of information between the devices .
As for Mr. Watkins , he ’s biding his time until that consulting gig with Seagate runs its course .
In addition to serving on the boards of Vertical Circuits and Flextronics , he ’s helping some solar technology companies navigate the ways of Washington .
“ I have time on my hands , but I am not about to go to Napa and grow wine , ” Mr. Watkins said .
I pay my bills online .
The interface for the bill paying system is a tragedy , as you might expect from a bank .
But it ’s not entirely accidental .
Banks inconvenience their customers for a reason .
For example , I would like the option of automatically debiting my checking account every month to pay off my credit card balance just before it is due .
The system could easily send me a courtesy e-mail warning me the transfer was about to happen , in case I changed my mind .
And if I did n’t have enough money in my checking account , it could warn me by e-mail and abort the transfer .
This system would save me time and avoid late fees on my credit card .
You wo n’t be seeing that feature anytime soon .
Banks and credit card companies make a lot of money from late fees .
They have a naked interest in keeping their service as inconvenient as possible .
My bank does n’t even offer a check box option for paying the entire balance on my credit card .
Instead I need to write down the balance from one screen , or try to memorize it , until the screen appears where I can enter that figure .
In other words , they even make money from my typos .
It ’s totally intentional .
Bastards .
That trap has worked on me several times .
If consumers mattered , your bank would offer one retail product .
It would be part checking account and part credit card .
And by that I mean your balance could either be above zero or below zero at any given point .
When your balance is below zero , you pay interest to the bank .
When it is above zero , the bank pays you interest .
You ’d have one plastic card that does what your ATM and your credit card does now .
If you needed more credit , you could secure your account with your home equity .
That way you would n’t have multiple types of credit with the same bank , where the bank hopes you misplace at least one of their bills so they get the late fee .
Banks might argue that they ca n’t offer that sort of product for regulatory reasons .
But I have n’t seen a bank shy away from trying to influence regulators when it works for them .
Did I say bastards yet ?
( P.S. I started my career at a bank .
And that ’s where Dilbert was born . )
Life How to Be Awesome
The other day I was talking with my friend Phil , a doctoral student in philosophy .
Phil is much smarter than me – of that there is no doubt – but he ’s struggling with the process of working through a draining series of requirements to receive his terminal degree .
A Ph.D. in a field like philosophy usually requires at least 5 years of study beyond the 4 - year bachelor ’s degree .
Some students do it in less time , but many others require six , seven , or even eight years .
Even after you get the degree , the training process continues with an average of six more years working as an Assistant Professor .
In other words , it ’s a hard struggle for a long time .
I had the chance to head out for Ph.D. kindergarten last year myself , but I decided it was n’t the best decision for me .
Phil , on the other hand , is good at what he does and enjoys the academic environment much more than me .
The problem is the 5 - 10 year stretch where no one pays attention to you and you spend weeks on end writing papers that one or two people will read .
“ Why not find another way ? ” I asked .
“ If you write a great book about philosophy , for example , or publish a major article , no one will care which program you went to or how you performed during your oral exams . ”
“ That ’s what everyone says , ” Phil told me .
“ It ’s as if the answer is , ‘ Go be awesome ’ – but that ’s too vague . ”
Go and be awesome .
Hmmm .
The thing is , the answer Phil is getting is completely true .
If you can be awesome , a lot of other things do n’t matter .
College degrees , life experience , the long slow climb up the ladder ( corporate or otherwise ) – no one cares about that stuff .
However , I also understand the challenge .
Telling someone to “ go and be awesome ” is frustrating , even to people who are completely capable of being awesome .
They just do n’t know how .
Therefore , I thought , someone should take the time and write this out .
How can you really “ be awesome ” ?
This list is a good start , and I ’m sure you guys will add to it at the end .
THE FIRST THING
Think about this every day :
“ The question is n’t who is going to let me ; it ’s who is going to stop me . ” ~ Ayn Rand
If you are n’t comfortable with this attitude , it ’s hard to be awesome .
Sorry .
You can be good enough without being assertive , but to a large extent , being awesome requires that you initiate , take action , and chart your own course through the norms of mediocrity .
HARD WORK
Working your ass off , at least during specific seasons in life , is also a prerequisite for being awesome .
This goes at the top , because if you do n’t like hard work , good luck .
I hung out with J.D. Roth in Portland a few weeks ago , and we talked about the big success of his personal finance site .
Guess how many hours a week he has worked on the site since going full - time last year ?
60 HOURS EVERY WEEK .
That ’s right , aspiring bloggers – you too can have 70,000 + readers and write your own ticket to internet fame – but it wo n’t happen by playing World of Warcraft every night .
If you are n’t blogging , the same principle holds true with most other work that is worth doing .
Yes , I know about things like life / work balance , taking time off to rest , and so on .
Those are things you do after you ’ve created your world of awesomeness .
Jason Calacanis put it best , “ If you want to work 9 - 5 , get a job at the Post Office . ”
Still reading ?
As mentioned , those first two are prerequisites .
They also serve as filters , because lots of people give up on self - determination and hard work .
Assuming you can stick with it , it gets easier from here on out .
THE GENERAL WORKPLACE
In any given work environment , almost everyone is focused on one goal : to make themselves look good .
If you can change things around and focus on making other people look good , you ’re well on the way to being awesome .
In some environments ( certainly academia ) , this is exceedingly rare behavior .
Showing up to work is expected .
Showing up early , prepared , and with a good attitude is remarkable ( sadly ) .
Present solutions , not problems .
If you can present solutions to other people ’s problems , you ’ll go far .
Contribute big ideas , including some that you know are likely to fail .
You ’ve probably heard this before : “ If you want to get something done , ask a busy person to do it . ”
To be awesome , be the busy person who gets things done .
MEETINGS & EMAIL
From time to time you ’ll arrive at a meeting where it ’s not clear who is in charge .
Examples : a collaborative school project , a work project among colleagues of equal rank , etc .
Here is how to handle this :
Step 1 : Assess the situation to determine the leadership skills of the other attendees .
Remember that your goal is to get things done and make other people look good .
Step 2 : Take initiative without taking control .
Be helpful , ask questions , and offer to accept tasks on behalf of the group .
Step 3 .
At the end of the meeting , provide a quick wrap - up based on the actions the group agreed to .
“ OK , so Jon will do this task and report back , I ’ll do the other research … ” and so on .
Step 4 .
If no one else is openly taking notes , do it yourself .
Type them up and send them out to the participants within 24 hours of the meeting .
A Note on Notes : being the recorder accomplishes two things .
1 ) You are viewed as awesome for taking the initiative and capturing information for everyone else , and 2 ) You get to put your own bias on how the notes are written .
A wise person once told me , you do n’t have to be the first person replying to every convoluted email thread .
That just shows everyone that you live on your email .
Instead , show up at the end and contribute something of value .
Your comments will come to be viewed as the deciding word instead of the kneejerk reaction .
The next time , people will look forward to your response and wonder what ’s wrong when you have n’t written in .
Do n’t use rude autoresponders .
A rude autoresponder looks like this :
What were you thinking in writing to me ?
I am too important to be bothered by inane requests like yours .
I may or may not get back to you , and if I do , it will probably be a while .
Have a nice day .
Those are not the exact words ( usually ) , but that ’s the implied message .
If you must use an autoresponder , like when you are traveling or otherwise not checking email very often , be polite and gracious .
RELATIONSHIPS
Overdeliver in your personal relationships .
Give more than you get .
Never find yourself in relationship debt .
Never make excuses about being too busy , not having enough time , etc .
People who are awesome make time for what ’s important to them .
From time to time , you ’ll screw up .
This is how you apologize :
“ I ’m really sorry .
It was completely my fault .
I hope you ’ll forgive me , and here is how I am addressing this in the future . ”
If you forget to do something you ’ve committed to do but remember it later , do it right when you remember .
Buy thank - you cards and write 2 - 3 every day .
Use your calendar to keep up with the birthdays of as many people as possible .
Write real birthday notes or cards instead of Facebook posts .
Whenever a casual relationship is coming to a close ( the class ends , colleagues move to another project , etc. ) write the person a quick email .
“ I enjoyed working with you … thanks for doing a good job . ”
When bad things happen , you can forgive the following : mistakes , weaknesses , shortcomings .
( No one is exempt from these things , even awesome people . )
When bad things happen , you should worry about the following : dishonesty , passive aggressive behavior , chronic tardiness , whininess .
( These patterns do not usually get better with time . )
Practice the art of radical exclusion with people who waste your time .
This is NOT being impolite – it is showing respect for the people you have committed to serve .
Remember that people will basically act the same no matter who they are around .
If the people you hang out with are always complaining about other people , chances are they probably complain about you too .
The point is : do n’t put others down when they ’re not around , or at least make sure you ’re comfortable with whatever you say being repeated .
GOOD VERSUS EVIL
Reward the behavior of other awesome people , and stop rewarding mediocrity .
Tip 20 - 25 % for good service at a restaurant .
For the rare occasion when service is awful , do n’t tip at all .
When you find yourself in a conversation with someone who likes to argue all the time , you may be tempted to respond , but you ’ll regret it in the end .
Just walk away .
Always focus on core motivations .
When presented with a request , analyze the situation by thinking about exactly what the person wants from you .
( Hint : it is not always what they are explicitly asking for . )
Keep up the positive momentum .
Look to the future , not the past .
The U.S. election last fall was framed as a choice between the past and the future .
Guess who wins a contest between old and new ?
Never be a critic without presenting an alternative .
Remember that no statues are erected to critics , and no one is remembered for shooting down other people ’s ideas .
***
Of course , there are some variations on this list depending on which kind of awesomeness you wish to pursue .
But if you can do at least some of these things , you ’ll be off to a great start .
Are you up for it ?

The Decision to Be Remarkable
“ Fort Awesome ” ( Harvard Yard ) Image by DrGamby
We wrote last night about how Ted Olson , George Bush ’s former Solicitor General ( the guy who argues the administration ’s cases before the Supreme Court ) – and the guy who argued Bush v. Gore before the Supreme Court on behalf of Bush – is now teaming up with attorney David Boies to launch a federal legal challenge to Prop 8 in Cailfornia .
As I mentioned last night , it ’s hard to overplay the significance of this .
Olson may very well be the man singlehandedly responsible for putting George Bush in the White House these past eight years .
He is a conservative .
He was a member of the board of the American Spectator , the magazine that investigated Bill Clinton in the early 90s , and got that entire ball of wax rolling .
Olson was the guy who was so conservative that Harry Reid torpedoed Bush ’s desire to make Olson Attorney General after Gonzales .
Olson is so conservative that Bob Novak ( aka Novakula ) called him “ highly esteemed . ”
You get the point .
This is as significant in conservative circles , I believe , as former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt , now supporting gay marriage .
Moderates in the Republican party – or perhaps more accurately , conservatives – are suddenly speaking out with more moderate views .
The irony is that we always wanted moderate / liberal Republicans to stand up and denounce the culture wars .
To take their party back .
But instead , we have a growing number of conservatives who are washing their hands of the religious right and its phobias .
Read what Olson said to Byron York at the Washington Examiner about his work on the Prop 8 case :
“ I personally think it is time that we as a nation get past distinguishing people on the basis of sexual orientation and that a grave injustice is being done to people by making these distinctions , ” Olson told me Tuesday night .
“ I thought their cause was just . ”
I asked Olson about the objections of conservatives who will argue that he is asking a court to overturn the legitimately - expressed will of the people of California .
“ It is our position in this case that Proposition 8 , as upheld by the California Supreme Court , denies federal constitutional rights under the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution , ” Olson said .
“ The constitution protects individuals ’ basic rights that can not be taken away by a vote .
If the people of California had voted to ban interracial marriage , it would have been the responsibility of the courts to say that they cannot do that under the constitution .
We believe that denying individuals in this category the right to lasting , loving relationships through marriage is a denial to them , on an impermissible basis , of the rights that the rest of us enjoy …
I also personally believe that it is wrong for us to continue to deny rights to individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation . ”
If Ted Olson can say that about gay marriage , then all bets are off in terms of what we should expect from Democratic politicians .
Joe and I both used to give a lot of latitude to Democrats on gay marriage .
We ’re both realists who believe that civil rights , like so many other victories , are most often won in small steps ( or “ tranches ” ( aka slices ) as they say in the financial world , and France ) .
We were willing to cut Obama some slack on gay marriage because we understood that America was n’t there yet , and it was difficult for a Democratic politician to openly support gay marriage and not lose his career .
No more .
Times have changed .
We have conservative Republican leaders like Steve Schmidt and Ted Olson openly endorsing gay marriage while our Democratic president and far too many of his administration are treating gays and their civil rights like some kind of crazy
Aunt you do n’t talk about in polite company because she ’s just so embarrassing .
Religious right bigots like to invoke Obama ’s supposed opposition to gay marriage when trying to take away our civil rights , and the White House says nothing to dispel the comparison .
Well , perhaps it ’s time we started quoting pro- gay marriage conservatives like Steve Schmidt and Ted Olson , and asking the White House why Barack Obama seems to have a bigger hang up with our civil rights – hell , with us ( do you see anyone openly gay in the Cabinet ? ) – than two of the most conservative Republicans in Washington .
Watching Australian Securities and Investments Commission chief Tony D'Aloisio flailing around on last night demonstrated ASIC 's failure as both a watchdog and regulator , leaving it as just a legal administrator - perhaps all it aspires to be .
On one hand , D'Aloisio denied knowledge that the hedge funds , aided and abetted by investment banks , have circumvented his financial stocks shorting ban , even though he has previously admitted that it 's done .
And on the other , he amazingly defended ASIC 's reviews of Storm Financial over recent years , reviews that found nothing wrong with that rapacious and centrally - flawed company that has cost Australian investors billions .
But that 's just in keeping with the view of an ASIC boss who , despite Storm , Opes , MFS , Westpoint et al , believes the system is working well .
It seems that belief stems from ASIC 's view of itself as a legal administrator , rather than a watchdog .
Asked about the series of failures on his watch , D'Aloisio said :
" These business models may not have worked for commercial reasons , it 's a long jump to then suggest that the business models did n't work for legal reasons . ''
When I was a kid , I loved the Legion of Super Heroes and the Justice League of America .
These were comics for slumming comic book writers , fun and sort of stupid stories where a whole bunch of superheroes would get together , hang out in the clubhouse and then work together to destroy some sort of monster that any individual superhero could never have bested .
Anyway , near the beginning of most of these comics was a scene where a stranger would meet the team .
Inevitably , the heroes would introduce themselves .
Of course , Batman or Superman would n't need an introduction , but the lesser ( lower rent ) heroes had to speak up and describe their super power .
" I 'm the Wasp .
I have the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters , fly by
means of insectoid wings and fire
energy blasts . "
Some fancy marketers might call this a positioning statement or a unique selling proposition .
Of course , it 's not that .
It 's just her super power .
When you meet someone , you need to have a super power .
If you do n't , you 're just another handshake .
Do n't say , " Hi , I 'm Don , I 'm from Cleveland . "
Instead , try , " Hi , I 'm Don , I tell stories that spread . "
It 's not about touting yourself or coming on too strong .
It 's about making the introduction meaningful .
If I do n't know your superpower , then I do n't know how you can help me ( or I can help you ) .
I was sitting next to a guy at a conference a few years ago .
When people went around and said who they were and what they did , he said , " I'm Stephen , I 'm a judge . "
He gets points for humility , and not pointing out that he was a Supreme Court Justice was certainly his privilege … sort of like Superman not having to tout his x-ray vision .
The rest of us , though , do everyone a service when we let others know what we do and how it might help .
Use your favorite potting mix , compost , plants , seedlings , etc. , and put it all together !
This part is really up to you , but I would encourage you to soak the wicking basket first , and only use a small amount of fertilizer .
The bucket recycles it , so you probably wo n't need to add fertilizer again for a very long time .
If you cut smaller holes in the lid , gently thread the plants through the holes before lowering the lid completely .
If you cut one big hole , line the top of the bucket with black plastic .
This helps keep the potting mix moist .
( see Mr. Beefhead 's comment about why it 's important to use potting mix )
To water the dearthbox , just pour water down the pipe .
You know it 's full when water comes out the drainage holes on the sides .
We started with moist earth to make the wicking basket 's job easier .

Robertson's '
Industrial Revolution that took place first in England during 18th century brought about sweeping changes throughout Europe .
Never before in history did social changes take place on such a massive scale .
Sociology emerged in the context of the sweeping changes .
Factory system of production and the consequent mechanisation and industrialisation brought turmoils in society .
New industries and technologies change the face of the social and physical environment .
The simple rural life and small - scale home industries were replaced by complex urban life and mass production of goods .
Industrialisation changed the direction of civilisation .
It destroyed , or radically altered , the medieval customs , beliefs and ideals .
Industrialisation and led to urbanisation .
Peasants left rural areas and flocked to the towns , where they worked as industrial labourers under dangerous conditions .
Cities grew at an unprecedented rate providing an anonymous environment for people .
Social problems became rampant in the fast developing cities .
Aristocrats and monarchies crumbled and fell .
Religion began to lose its force as a sours of moral authority .
" For the first time in history , rapid social change became the normal rather than abnormal state of affairs , and people could no longer expect that their children would live much the same lives as they had done .
The direction of social change was unclear , and the stability of the social order seemed threatened .
An understanding of what was happening was urgently needed ' [ " Sociology " Page : 11 ]
Its clear from the above that sociology was born out of the attempt to understand the transformations of that seemed to threaten the stability of European society .
Social thinkers like Comte , Spencer and others argued that there was an urgent need to establish a separate science of society .
They believed that such a science would be of great help in understanding the nature and problems of society and find out solutions for the same .
The Obama administration agrees that more regulation is needed .
A proposal unveiled recently by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner won plaudits for trying to make derivatives trading less freewheeling and more accountable  a plan that hinges in part on using clearinghouses for the trades .
Critics in both the financial world and Congress say relying on clearinghouses would be problematic .
They also say Mr. Geithner ’s plan contains a major loophole , because little disclosure would be required for more complicated derivatives , like the type of customized , credit - default swaps that helped bring down A.I.G. A.I.G. sold insurance related to mortgage securities , essentially making a big bet that those mortgages would not default .
Mr. Rosen and other bank lobbyists have pushed on Capitol Hill to keep so - called customized swaps from being traded more openly .
These are contracts written for the specific needs of a customer , whose one - of - a - kind nature makes them very hard to value or trade .
Mr. Rosen has also argued that dealers should be able to trade through venues closely affiliated with banks rather than through more independent platforms like exchanges .
Mr. Rosen ’s confidential memo , dated Feb. 10 and obtained by The New York Times , recommended that the biggest participants in the derivatives market should continue to be overseen by the Federal Reserve Board .
Critics say the Fed has been an overly friendly regulator , which is why big banks favor it .
Mr. Rosen ’s proposal for change was similar to the Treasury Department ’s recently announced plan to increase oversight .
Treasury officials say that their proposal was arrived at independently and that they sought input from dozens of sources .
Even so , market participants , analysts and members of Congress who have proposed stricter reforms worry that the Treasury proposal does not go far enough to close several important regulatory gaps that allowed derivatives to play such a destructive role in the current financial crisis .
But increased transparency of derivatives trades would cut into banks ’ profits  hence the banks ’ opposition .
Customers who trade derivatives would pay less if they knew what the prevailing market prices were .
So , Google is now using your surf history to tailor online ads to your particular online interests .
It 's a rather creepy thought , but that 's not the problem .
The problem is that Google wo n't say how much of your surf history it 's capturing - or how long it plans on keeping this potentially ginormous data hoard .
When Google announced its " interest - based advertising " program on March 11 , it said the program would target ads on YouTube and the many third - party sites in its AdSense network .
And with a new FAQ , Google mentions that these ads would be targeted using data collected via cookie technology fashioned by DoubleClick , the online ad giant it acquired last year .
What 's still unclear is whether Google is collecting your surfing habits across AdSense pages as well as sites that serve ads via DoubleClick 's ad management platform .
Presumably , it is .
It appears that both AdSense and DoubleClick sites are using compatible tracking cookies .
We 've asked Google ( several times ) to clarify the situation , but it has yet to provide an unambiguous answer .
" The Google content network ( AdSense partners ) and DoubleClick ad management platforms have not been combined , " reads a carefully worded statement from a company spokeswoman .
" The Google content network uses the DoubleClick cookie to serve interest - based ads on the Google content network . "
What 's more , even when it comes to AdSense sites , Google 's has yet to say what exactly it 's collecting when you visit a site or how long that data will be kept .
Presumably , it 's grabbing your IP address , your browser user agent , and a time stamp as well as a specific url .
DoubleClick has collected such data for years .
The concern is that Google is gradually expanding the already vast array of data it stores on each individual web surfer - data it could be coughed up after a Google hack or the arrival of a subpoena or national security letter .
DoubleClick 's ad serving technology is collecting surf data across third - party sites .
It now appears that Google is combining this with data harvested on AdSense .
And if the company ever sees fit , it could easily fold in the data collected on its juggernaut of a search engine .
According to the latest numbers from Attributor , AdSense and DoubleClick are by far the most dominant ( non-search ) ad platforms on the web .
Together , they control 57 per cent of the market .
Even if you combine Microsoft and Yahoo ! - which Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer once tried to do - they would reach only 15 per cent .
And in search , Google shows even more muscle , ruling more than 60 per cent of the market , according to comScore .
Google will tell you it does n't collect any " personally identifiable information . "
But it refuses to acknowledge that an IP address is enough for personally identification - particularly when its paired with countless urls and time stamps .
As longtime Google Watcher Daniel Brandt points out , it would seem that Google is already collecting your surf history across both AdSense and DoubleClick .
Using a network protocol analyzer , Brandt has noticed that if you visit DoubleClick site like , say , MSNBC.com and it places a DoubleClick ad cookie on your machine , that same cookie is offered up to the server when you visit an AdSense site .
And vice versa .
We choose MSNBC only because it 's slightly amusing to note that Microsoft is using Google ad technology .
The AdSense DoubleClick cookie does use a different prefix in the ID field than the DoubleClick DoubleClick cookie , but otherwise , the two seem identical .
When we ask Google whether it 's pooling data from both networks , it does not respond .
But surely , to question whether Google is collecting user data across both systems is merely questioning the obvious .
" The doubleclick . net cookie is served up by your browser for both the so - called DoubleClick network that does not use AdSense , as well as the AdSense that everyone is talking about , " Brandt tells us .
" They 'd be crazy to harvest data from AdSense only , but not the old DoubleClick .
It would take them twice as long to build up their database of user interests . "
But the bigger question is what 's in that database of interests - and how long it 's kept .
Again , Google is mum on the matter .
But that 's the norm .
In September , Google told the World it was " going to anonymize " its search logs after only nine months - down from the current 18 .
But half a year later , Google has yet to say whether thus plan has actually be put in place .
And even when this nine month anonymization plan does arrive , it wo n't actually anonymize after nine months .
Google does let you opt out of its DoubleClick cookie .
But government regulators must determine whether this cookie should be opt - in only .
At the very least , Google should provide the facts needed to make an informed decision . ®

Satellite information on incoming meteors is blocked .
Military satellites that constitute a missile early - warning system also pick up inbound meteors .
D. SCOTT / CORBIS
The US military has abruptly ended an informal arrangement that allowed scientists access to data on incoming meteors from classified surveillance satellites .
The change is a blow to the astronomers and planetary scientists who used the information to track space rocks , especially those that burn up over the oceans or in other remote locations .
" These systems are extremely useful , " says Peter Brown , an astronomer at the University of Western Ontario in London , Canada .
" I think the scientific community benefited enormously . "
When the policy changed is unclear .
The website Space.com reported the end of the relationship on 10 June , but Brown says that he was told at the beginning of this year that there would be no further data releases .
Mark Boslough , a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , New Mexico , says he was told this spring that he could no longer publicly discuss the classified data to which he had some access .
Neither scientist could give a reason for the end of the arrangement , and the United States Air Force , which operates the satellites , did not respond in time for Nature 's deadline .
The Air Force did issue a 16 March memo on the military classification of fireball data , but Nature could not confirm its contents .
The Defense Support Program satellite network is part of the Pentagon 's early - warning system .
Since 1970 , 23 infrared satellites in the series have been launched into geosynchronous orbit to monitor the globe for missile launches or atmospheric nuclear blasts .
But the same infrared sensors were perfect for spotting fireballs as they streaked across the atmosphere , according to Brian Weeden , a former Air Force captain who now works at the Secure World Foundation , a non-profit organization based in Superior , Colorado .
The satellites could precisely detect the time , position , altitude and brightness of meteors as they entered Earth 's atmosphere .
Weeden , who left the Air Force in 2007 , says that the military did n't consider that information particularly useful , or classified .
" It was being dropped on the floor , " he says .
Under an informal arrangement , at least some of the data seem to have been provided on an ad - hoc basis to scientists studying meteorites .
Often it came in the form of an anonymous , tersely worded e-mail describing the coordinates , altitude and size of a fireball .
Brown , who has collected the data since 1994 , declined to specify who sent the reports .
Even the short descriptions of events were enormously helpful .
In 2002 , Brown and his colleagues used a larger data set from the satellites to quantify the number of objects striking Earth each year ( P. Brown et al. Nature 420 , 294–296 ; 2002 ) .
Last year , they were used to narrow the search for remnants of the asteroid 2008 TC 3 in the Sahara Desert in North Africa , and they were also crucial in recovering a meteorite fragment in 2000 from Tagish Lake in northern Canada .
" In both of those cases it 's hard to say whether this would have been picked up without the satellite data , " Boslough says .
The data also provide a useful check against ground - based instruments monitoring low - frequency sound waves and dust from the fireball explosions , says Brown .
Although the reason for ending the arrangement remains unclear , Weeden notes that it coincides with the launch of a new generation of surveillance satellites .
The US $ 10 - billion - plus Space - Based Infrared System will provide a more detailed infrared picture of Earth for battlefield surveillance , early - warning alerts and the US missile defence programme .
The first of these satellites was launched in 2006 in a highly elliptical orbit and entered operational service in November 2008 , a month after Brown received his last report .
In its final configuration , the system will include at least two satellites in highly elliptical orbit and three or more geosynchronous satellites for a whole - Earth view .

Weeden speculates that the Pentagon may not want details of the new satellites ' capabilities to be made public , or it may simply lack the expensive software needed to handle classified and declassified data simultaneously .
" The decision may have been made that it was perhaps too difficult to disclose just these data , " he says .
Brown says that whatever the reason , the end of the relationship has left the tight - knit meteorite community smarting .
The global reach of the satellites and the data they supplied were unparalleled , he says .
" There 's nothing else that even comes close , " he says .

Update : Here 's a critique of Psiphon from a crypto expert .
Mentioned in a NYT article by John Markoff about tools such as Tor used in places like China and Iran to route around internet censorship , this word of a new browser - based toolkit .
Political scientists at the University of Toronto have built yet another system , called Psiphon , that allows anyone to evade national Internet firewalls using only a Web browser .
Sensing a business opportunity , they have created a company to profit by making it possible for media companies to deliver digital content to Web users behind national firewalls .
The danger in this quiet electronic war is driven home by a stark warning on the group 's Web site : " Bypassing censorship may violate law .
Serious thought should be given to the risks involved and potential consequences . "
Psiphon is here , and on Twitter .
Here 's a snip from their launch press release :
At the heart of the new venture is Psiphon 's Managed Delivery Platform ( MDP ) , in which large - scale producers of content push their media through Psiphon 's proprietary cloud - based system to consumers in denied environments .
On the user end , the free service is encrypted , requires no software to download , is multimedia capable , and can even work through mobile smart phone platforms , such as the iPhone .
Users can sign on to Psiphon in a variety of ways : through email invites from trusted friends and colleagues , for example , or through Psiphon 's innovative " right2know " technology , which allows media producers to show consumers in censored environments content which is not available to them .

JERUSALEM , May 3 ( UPI ) -- Israeli air force reservists are sharpening their missile defense system skills amid fears of a long - rang missile attack from Iran , a military official said .
The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday that the reservists who operate the Arrow and Patriot missile defense systems are spending one day a week on duty .

Israeli air force Brig .
Gen. Daniel Milo decided last year to call up the reservists , the newspaper reported .
Before Milo's order , only reservist pilots were called up for one day of reserve duty a week .
" We are working hard to be ready for the Iranian threat , " an unidentified senior officer was quoted by the newspaper as saying .
" We are preparing for barrages , split warheads and other surprises and therefore we need to retain a high operational level by everyone , including reservists . "
The State Examinations Commission has decided to postpone Leaving Certificate English Paper Two , both Higher and Ordinary levels , after it emerged that students in one centre have already seen the paper .
The examination has been rescheduled to take place on Saturday morning using a contingency paper .
English Paper
Two was opened by mistake at an examination centre in Co Louth this morning .
The error was immediately spotted and the papers were taken back , according to the state Examinations Commission .
It has confirmed that a number of students did see the exam paper .
In a statement , the Examinations Commission said that in ‘ fairness to all candidates ’ taking the subject and ‘ in order to protect the integrity of the examination process ’ the Leaving Certificate English Paper two , Higher and Ordinary Level , is being deferred .
It says that the compromised papers have been replaced and the Leaving Certificate English Paper two examinations will now take place on Saturday , 6 June 2009 from 9.30 am to 12.50 pm .
The Commission stressed that all of the other examinations scheduled for tomorrow are going ahead as planned .
Meanwhile , Minister for Education Batt O'Keeffe said the decision to defer the exam was made in consultation with the education partners .
He said that the Commission 's decision has , by necessity , been taken in a very restricted time frame .
He added that the Department of Education is making arrangements with Bus Éireann to ensure the provision of the regular weekday post - primary school transport service on Saturday .
A Helpline number is available for students affected by the cancellation of tomorrow 's Leaving Cert English Higher and Ordinary level paper 1800 713 913 and the website is www.examinations.ie.
More than 115,000 second level students began their Leaving and Junior Certificate exams this morning .
The exams began with English , Paper One , and will run until 19 June .
The students will be examined in almost 100 different subjects and more than 3 m exam papers have been printed .
Changes this year include a Leaving Cert timetable tweaked for a second time to relieve the pressure complained of for years by students .
Most candidates should now get at least one half - day free between now and the weekend .

HOUSEHOLD water bills will rise significantly in the next four years after Victoria 's independent regulator yesterday approved price increases of between 51 and 64 per cent .
The increases come as Water Minister Tim Holding announced that a long - held plan to pipe recycled water to the Latrobe Valley to cool power plants has been axed because the project would add hundreds of dollars a year to the cost of water .
But price rises approved by the Essential Services Commission  starting this July  to supplement the cost of other water saving measures will still add hundred of dollars a year to water bills .
City West Water prices will rise for a typical household using 165 kilolitres of water a year from $ 568 to $ 858 in 2012 .
South East Water customers will go from paying $ 599 to $ 894 and Yarra Valley Water prices will increase from $ 585 to $ 960 in the same period .
The increases will help cover the cost of major water infrastructure such as the Sugarloaf and North - South pipelines , Eastern Treatment Plant upgrade and the Desalination Plant .
The plan to pipe recycled water from the Eastern Treatment Plant to power stations in Gippsland to supplement their use of about 100 billion litres of drinking water a year was a cornerstone of the Government 's water policies in the lead - up to the 2006 election .
IN EERIE , deserted silence on the outskirts of Phnom Penh sits the Prey Speu detention centre .
Barely legible on its grimy walls a few weeks ago were cries for help and whispers of despair from the tormented souls once crammed into its grimy cells .
“ This is to mark that I lived in terror under oppression , ” read one message .
Ryan Plummer
The wrong side of the street
It recalls a Khmer Rouge torture centre from the genocidal 1970s .
But in fact the building was used just last year as a “ rehabilitation ” centre , where detained sex - workers , along with beggars and the homeless , learnt sewing and cooking .
They were rounded up in a crackdown on trafficking for the sex industry .
At first an attempt to clean up Phnom Penh , it soon escalated into a violent campaign by the police against prostitutes and those living on the street .
According to Licadho , a local human - rights group , guards at the centre beat three people to death , and at least five detainees killed themselves .
Sreymoa , a trafficked sex - worker , detained in May 2008 with her four - year - old daughter , recalls daily beatings , rapes and one death .
Partly to allay the previous American administration 's concerns about trafficking , Cambodia in February 2008 outlawed prostitution .
Three months later the State Department took Cambodia off its annual “ watch - list ” of human - trafficking countries .
But the police read the law as entitling them to lock up all sex - workers , not help victims of trafficking .
Reports of abuses soon surfaced , at first denied by the government .
But in August it halted the raids as the United Nations and NGOs expressed mounting concern .
One worry was that they would endanger HIV / AIDS - prevention programmes .
The prevalence of HIV in Cambodia had fallen to 0.8 % of the population since the government adopted a campaign in 2001 for “ 100 % condom ” use .
Now , however , fearing the brothels where they worked would be raided , many sex - workers had started plying their trade on the streets or in karaoke bars , where health - care workers could not find them to distribute condoms .
Tony Lisle , of the UN's AIDS organisation , says that since the raids stopped , HIV - prevention efforts have resumed with more success .
Sex - workers in bars as well as brothels are to be covered , and the police to be encouraged to teach sex - workers about condom use .
But those campaigning for sex - workers ' rights have objected , fearing that this might give the police a pretext to renew the raids .
Jason Barber of Licadho says that for years the government has stopped arbitrary detentions when a fuss has been made , only to restart them as soon as attention has shifted .
Indeed , just before a regional summit in Phnom Penh in late May , the police again herded up beggars , sex - workers and drug-users , and sent them back to Prey Speu , newly reopened ( with the graffiti painted over ) .
Detaining sex -workers is much easier than arresting the traffickers .
But the global slowdown is adding to the ranks of the unemployed .
The World Bank forecasts that 200,000 Cambodians will fall below the poverty line this year .
Many will fall into prostitution or beggary , whatever the law says and high - minded donors hope .
A Provo , Utah newspaper has confirmed our earlier story – a Mormon geneological Web site does in fact list President Obama ’s mother , Stanley Ann Dunham , as having been baptized into the Mormon faith after her death ( and presumably without her , or her son ’s , consent ) .
The Mormon church has yet to respond to numerous reporters ’ inquiries whether they did in fact baptize the President ’s dead mother last year in the middle of the presidential campaign .
If true , and it ’s looking increasingly likely , this could cause the Mormons quite a bit of trouble politically and in the public relations sphere .
Still unanswered is whether the Mormons also baptized Obama ’s father .

Socialization Development of Autistic Children in Public School Settings
With the advance in spectrum disorders , many public schools systems across the United States have begun to develop programs that are uniquely designed for at - risk children .
For children with Autism Spectrum disorders , the complications of socialization are often a key focus of the school district ’s program .
If you are the parent of a child who lives with an Autism Spectrum disorder , you may well understand the complications and dynamics associated with your child ’s interests and social skills .
While the complication of Autism Spectrum disorder developed early in your child ’s life , the progression of the disorder , into grade school , often complicates the ability to develop peer relationships and , ultimately , perform academically .
When your autistic child enters grade school , it is important that you begin to develop relationship with the school teachers and officials .
In many public school systems today , there are special education programs that are designed specifically for this demographic of children , with focus on socialization and unique academic structure .
Using IEP , Individual Education Programs , your child ’s progress through grade school is managed more closely and requires a more collaborative approach .
Unfortunately , in many school districts , children with Autism Spectrum disorders are not readily recognized at the onset .
Therefore , if you already know that your child has been diagnosed with this developmental complication , it is important to let the school officials know from the first day your child starts school .
In doing so , the school can begin , at an early age , to develop the IEP .
While it is unfortunate , many parents of children with AS will defer telling the school of their child ’s AS diagnosis in hopes the child will adapt to the normal curriculum .
However , by doing this , you may be depriving your child of key opportunities in education and in peer relationship development .
Autism has become a condition of greater focus within the school systems .
While there is still much to be learned about autism and Autism Spectrum disorder , we do know that children with this condition often require more unique approaches to education .
As a parent , it is important to not deprive your child of academic success and in working with the school officials you can ensure , to some extent , your child is given the best possible opportunities for success .
Creating the IEP , communicating with teachers on a regular basis , and assisting your child in home study will be an integral part of your child ’s education when living with autism and Austim Spectrum disorder .

Hello , I just pushed a patch to haskell - debian - 3 which makes a bunch of updates to cabal - debian .
It should be a lot closer to being useful for Debian now .
I tested using the latest packages in Debian sid -- not sure if there is an even fresher place I should be looking .
I do not actually know of any outstanding issues at the moment , but I have not tested the new changes throughly yet .
For simple packages , like zlib and bzlib , the only lintian errors in the generated . debs are due to the fact that ' api ' is lower case instead of upper case in the Description ( which comes from the .cabal file ) .
So , if you want to give cabal - debian a shot , now would be a good time .
I 'll do a new upload to hackage if things look good .
For now , you will need these packages from darcs : darcs get http://src.seereason.com/ghc610/haskell-unixutils/ darcs get http://src.seereason.com/ghc610/haskell-extra/ darcs get http://src.seereason.com/ghc610/haskell-debian-3/
From hackage : HaXml 1.13.3 , QuickCheck 1.2 , zlib , bzlib
And I think the rest of the dependencies you can get from sid ( mtl , parallel , etc ) .
My recent fixes and updates include : haskell - debian ( 3.31 ) unstable ; urgency=low * update to use newer haskell - devscripts which includes hlibrary .mk * change libghc6 -*- doc to haskell -*- doc * move haskell -*- doc to Section : doc * build haskell -*- doc for Architecture ' all ' instead of ' any ' * make ghc6 - doc and haddock Build - Depends - Indep * update Standards - Version to 3.8.1 * depend on cdbs and haskell - devscripts instead of haskell - cdbs * only use one space at the beginning of lines in the long description * add $ {misc : Depends} to Depends lines -- Jeremy Shaw < jeremy@seereason.com >

We also have some patches to haskell - devscripts , but they are not required for cabal - debian to work .
We are in the progress of merging them against the latest haskell - devscripts : - A patch that prevents the generation of less than dependencies so it still tries to build if the dependencies get newer - a patch to handle ^M characters in cabal files - A patch to make it expand # PACKAGE # to the debian package name I think - not sure if I use this feature in the postinst and prerm scripts et al - There is a patch that adds a postinst and a postrm to the haddock package to regenerate the documentation index - jeremy
Jamie Zawinski uses that term in his ( 1997 ) article " java sucks " as if you should know what it means :
I really hate the lack of downward - funargs ; anonymous classes are a lame substitute .
( I can live without long - lived closures , but I find lack of function pointers a huge pain . )
It seems to be Lisper 's slang , and I could find the following brief definition here , but somehow , I think I still do n't get it :
Many closures are used only during the extent of the bindings they refer to ; these are known as " downward funargs " in Lisp parlance .
Were it not for Steve Yegge , I 'd just feel stupid now , but it seems , it might be OK to ask :
Jamie Zawinski is a hero .
A living legend . [...]
A guy who can use the term " downward funargs " and then glare at you just daring you to ask him to explain it , you cretin . -- XEmacs is dead , long live XEmacs
So is there a Lisper here who can compile this for C - style - programmers like me ?
A self - published author in Cape Cod has sued Elisabeth Hasselbeck , a co-host of the ABC program “ The View , ” for copyright infringement , accusing her of plagiarizing substantial portions of her book , “ Living With Celiac Disease . ”
According to a lawsuit filed Monday in United States District Court in Massachusetts , Ms. Hasselbeck , whose diet book “ The G - Free Diet : A Gluten - Free Survival Guide , ” was published by the Center Street imprint of the Hachette Book Group in May , copied “ significant portions ” of various lists from “ Living With Celiac Disease ” by Susan Hassett .
In the complaint , Ms. Hassett says that Ms. Hasselbeck ’s book “ includes dozens of paraphrased as well as word for word regurgitations of phrases and scrupulously researched factual data entries ” and “ utilizes a virtually identical order and format of 13 chapters ” of Ms. Hassett ’s work .
The lawsuit states that Ms. Hassett sent a copy of her book to Ms. Hasselbeck in April 2008 after “ The View ” host disclosed that she had celiac disease .
According to the complaint , Ms. Hasselbeck never acknowledged the book or Ms. Hassett .
Ms. Hassett and her lawyer , Richard Cunha , declined to comment .
In a statement , a Hachette spokeswoman denied the accusations and said that no complaint had been served .
What the pirates do is exactly what Somali militias do on land :
They feed off of anyone with anything to steal .
On land , rival clan - based militias attack UN aid convoys , food trucks — even refugees forced to carry all their wealth in the world as they flee from home .
At sea , they use the same tactics , only with higher , more public stakes .
In the past year , they have seized 30 Russian - made tanks ( from a Ukrainian ship bound for Kenya ) ; they have stripped parts from luxury yachts and oil tankers ; and last year they raked in an estimated $ 30 million .
Finally , two weeks ago , they drew the world ’s attention by attacking their first American ship , the Maersk Alabama .
The Alabama was carrying containers of food — vegetable oil , wheat , and dehydrated vegetables — meant to alleviate starvation in Somalia .
And while the attack kept the world riveted , as if this were a unique and astonishing event , in reality , it was just a larger - scale version of what these bandits do on land every day , while the world pays little attention .
Thanks to the high - profile rescue and the courageous tale of the Alabama ’s captain and crew , however , the world is paying attention now .
Last week , Hillary Clinton unveiled several new anti-pirate initiatives , which include proposals for freezing pirate assets , arrangements to work with 30 nations on international maritime protection , and , most importantly , new plans to address the glaring chaos of Somalia — Finally .
Secretary Clinton also spoke of the need to take Somalia ’s new Prime Minister , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed — one of the leading Islamists who fled the U.S. - backed invasion by Ethiopia nearly three years ago —very seriously .
Paradoxically , the Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed , are the only leaders who have effectively banned piracy ever — during their six months in power in 2006 .
Under the Islamist ’s watch , piracy stopped almost completely .
Now , heading back into power after nearly three years of bloody insurgency , the Islamists are ready to take on the pirates again .
In the past few days , the Islamists leading Somalia ’s transitional government have announced that piracy is a crime against Islam and punishable by death .
The Islamists have other concerns along their coast , however .
For years , a number of countries ( especially the Japanese ) have taken advantage of Somalia ’s chaos to poach tuna by helicopter , while others have dumped their toxic waste along what is one of the world ’s longest coastlines .
As Ibrahim Addou , an American citizen and high - ranking minister in the new Somali transitional government said , these international practices , too , must end .
The pirates are only a symptom of an increasingly desperate nation struggling to survive .
And what of those Somali women dolling themselves up and racing to the coast in search of pirate husbands ?
A couple of salient facts render this alleged trend implausible .
For both men and women , crossing clan lines — or even traveling at all — can be lethal , due to the warlord - controlled militias that trawl the highways and set up makeshift checkpoints .
What ’s more , most Somali women have their hands full just trying to feed themselves and their children , let alone plotting to run off with pirates .

Jury Announcement
In August 2006 the Irish company Steorn published an advertisement in the Economist announcing the development of “ a technology that produces free , clean and constant energy ” .
Qualified experts were sought to form a “ jury ” to validate these claims .
Twenty - two independent scientists and engineers were selected by Steorn to form this jury .
It has for the past two years examined evidence presented by the company .
The unanimous verdict of the Jury is that Steorn ’s attempts to demonstrate the claim have not shown the production of energy .
The jury is therefore ceasing work .
The jury consists of scientists and engineers in relevant fields from Europe and North America , from industry , universities and government laboratories .
Information about individual members can be found at stjury.ning.com / R.I.MacDonald
Chairman , Steorn Jury
It would be nice if the jury could let us know what evidence they have been given .
I suspect this will be bound up in dreary non-disclosure agreements forbidding any open discussion of evidence .
If any of the jury would like to pass me some or all of Steorn ’s unconvincing evidence , in the public interest I am , as ever , on ben@badscience.net
Meanwhile here is a weak response from the company :
www.steorn.com/news/releases/?id=1151
Jury Report Steorn today confirmed that the internet ‘ blog ’ stjury.ning.com had been posted on behalf of members of the Jury of scientists that Steorn had engaged to conduct an independent review of its Orbo Technology .
In a statement , Steorn CEO , Sean McCarthy said that “ he was grateful to the Jury members for the time and effort that they had devoted to the process . ”
McCarthy continued on to state that he “ fully understood the frustration of the Jury members with respect to the time that the process was taking .
Implementing Orbo in a reliable and consistent manner had remained a challenge for the organization , one that we had made no secret of .
Due to these difficulties we had focused on providing the Jury with test data relating to the underlying magnetic effect behind Orbo .
This work concluded at the end of 2008 . ”
McCarthy concluded by stating that “ during 2009 the company had resolved the key technical problems related to the implementation of Orbo and is now focused on commercial launch towards the end of this year , at which time academic and engineering validation would be released concurrent with public demonstrations ” .

With the Espresso Book Machine , Suddenly You Are An " Electronic Publishing Company , " Or You Are Nothing
It is the Starship Enterprise crashing into a tall , humble tower !
We sold more books than ever that year .
The Fiction Circus used to make short - story anthologies at Kinkos when we first started out five years ago .
We would deliver our painstakingly - crafted .pdfs or PageMaker files on a CD and they would snap out fifty books for us overnight for something like three hundred dollars .
We would sell the books in Austin at the Staple !
Independent Media Expo , and sometimes we would make back our printing costs , as long as our table was elaborate enough to attract attention .
At Kinkos , they would tape - bind our fiction anthologies using huge machines in the back that we coveted .
Sometimes the Kinko's employees would chat with us about their jobs and ask us why we did n't just buy a printer ourselves .
( " Because we have no fucking money .
Ha ha . " ) I would stare blankly at the greeting cards and stationery while Dr. Future haggled over prices and quizzed the hapless clerk about paper stock and bleeds .
We learned about toner , paper joggers , and proper collation .
It was easy to see where things were going : soon there would be machines that could do perfect binding on books as fast as tape binding , xeroxing , or scanning .
The real mystery was why " printers " were so exclusive in the first place .
Books were n't special ; we could make rough approximations of full print runs ourselves for cheap , overnight , in Austin , Texas -- a city with fifty functionally literate people .
We sat there in Kinkos watching them print our anthologies , trying to swipe tape , markers , and paperclips , and we argued about the shape of things to come .
( " What the hell does publishing even mean anymore ? " )
Every once in awhile we would try to take up a collection from other people in town with similar publishing concerns in order to buy our own printer .
To invest in the future !
But it never seemed worth the trouble in the end .
It seemed like the real hard work was in figuring how to do everything BUT print books .
These days , publishers stand around clucking over invoices to printers and paper companies , or poking through the ashes of the last batch of remaindered books returned from the latest out - of - business bookstore , and they ask themselves the same question we used to ask : what does publishing even mean anymore ?
What should publishing be doing instead of worrying about getting books to a press ?
Because suddenly , the machine that makes perfect books in minutes now exists .
It 's called the Espresso Book Machine , and it is being put through trial runs in England , California , and New York .
It can make a book from raw electronic blueprints while you watch .
It is the size of an arcade race - car game .
A few of the big publishers are already participating in a pilot program to make print - on - demand selections available from their catalog using this new machine , and are taking royalties from the Espresso Book Machine every time one of these wonder presses prints a new volume at a pilot location for some knee - slapping tourist to take away as a curio .
( " A real live book , kids !
Printed in an instant ! " )
From the " On Demand Books " website " The EBM is a fully integrated patented book making machine which can automatically print , bind and trim on demand at point of sale perfect bound library quality paperback books with 4 - color cover indistinguishable from their factory made versions .
The EBM 2.0 is modular in 2 parts and the core unit measures approximately 2.7 feet deep , 3.8 feet wide and 4.5 feet high .
The EBM 2.0 is available with a high speed ( 105 page per minute ) black and white printer , a high speed color printer or a 35 page per minute printer .
The EBM will print , bind , and trim a 300 - page book in less than four minutes with a high speed printer model .
Production cost is a penny a page and minimal human intervention is required for operation .
The trim size of a book is infinitely variable between 8.5 " x 11 " and 4.5 " x 4.5 " and the EBM Version 2.0 can bind up to 830 pages .
" Take a look :
They are billing the EBM as an " ATM for books . "
But really , if deployed correctly by a cunning nexus of publishers and brave entrepreneurs , the EBM is a jukebox rather than an ATM , and the " playlist " is the internet itself , along with all the creativity and pluck that the next generation of electronic publishers can muster .
Keep the following five points in mind : 1 ) .
You can print whatever book you want on the EBM using the EBM 's internal catalog , the internet , a CD , or USB drive . 2 ) .
Sooner rather than later " self - publishers " will use the EBM to make their books available in print through any companies that jump on board , whether Amazon 's CreateSpace initiative , Google Books , or some other company that offers low - cost book hosting and electronic file management . 3 ) .
You do n't have to love books to stick an EBM in your store .
Wal - Mart could offer EBM print - on - demand .
Starbucks could offer EBM print - on - demand .
In fact , a new coffee chain could spring up around the idea of the EBM itself : it would be called " Espresso Books , " and it would offer both frothy lattes and frothy literature in your neighborhood next to the post office .
While your barista makes your drink , she also punches up the novel you want and both are delivered to you hot and steaming on a tray with a napkin . 4 ) .
The EBM will have two pricing models .
There will be one price for books that you purchase straight from the EBM catalog that will factor in royalties and the official catalog price from publishers .
Then there will be another price to print books directly from your own file ( a penny a page ) .
These could be pirated books , perhaps .
Suddenly ebooks will be valuable to pirates because they will also be the blueprints for a hot , cheap copy down at the local EBM .
The cheap price will also be for books purchased online from a retailer that does not have a deal with the EBM machine , but who still sells books formatted for EBM printing .
5 ) .
Some people wo n't mind only being allowed to buy books that the EBM has acquired through licensing deals .
But the vast majority of folks will want to print the books that they can't order anywhere else : they will want to print the books that come from a brand new market that does n't really exist yet .
From exclusively " electronic " publishers .
So let 's say you completely get rid of print costs for a publishing company .
Now your job as a publisher is really what it was supposed to be all along : your job is editing , publicity , and design .
Since people can already publish themselves for free without relying on you as a gatekeeper , you now have to sell yourself as being able to code better electronic books than they could at home , on being able to better publicize their novel if it is good and worth selling , and on being able to provide better editing than their spouse or a freelancer .
When people buy a book from you , they will buy unlimited permanent access to the electronic copy .
They will be able to read this electronic copy on the device of their choice ( a copy specifically formatted to take advantage of all of the possibilities of electronic publishing , such as multimedia , search , annotation , and flash ) , or they will be able to take it to an EBM and print it themselves , in the same way that Victorian gentleman took the rough blocks of their dirty French novels to bookbinders to be cut and bound in handsome leather volumes .
Electronic publishers will not need warehouses , storage space , deals with bookstores , deals with shipping companies , or deals with anybody but consumers .
Consumers will buy ebooks directly from publishers , and then it will be up to the consumers what to do with these ebooks , whether to leave them in their original electronic formats , get them printed down at the local EBM , or both .
People fear this model .
They fear this model because it seems like publishers will have less control over content .
But so what ?
For the first time in the history of publishing , publishers will make money from their actual skills , instead of by simply being the copy machine that writers must con in order to get their books to people .
There will be an initial phase where writers will think they can " do it all themselves " without the aid of an editor or publishing company .
But slowly they will realize the value of having an interested team ( with taste ) behind their books , and they will join up to do battle in an age that might be the greatest , most refined exploration of the art of the printed word since the first dawn of print media in the 16th century .
Imagine the thrill of working with pure text .
Pure images .
Pure hard data .
Imagine all you can do with an " electronic book " when you know that people will also be able to print up a paper copy at will if they prefer .
Movies are a dead medium by now .
The real excitement for creative minds is here , in electronic literature .
For instance , last year The Fiction Circus published an electronic verison of my own novel " Rocks at the Cuts " to show what can be done with persistent online versions of books .
This is only a sample .
The possibilities for creativity with code are limitless , and the Espresso Book Machine proves that it is not an either / or proposition when it comes to ebooks versus print .
Electronic publishers will soon be ready to compete with traditional publishers in every area but connections .
Big , clumsy publishing houses will find themselves beat at every turn by these whip - strong , tightly - run electronic publishing mutants .
The watchwords of the upcoming print wars will be the same watchwords that the military uses to explain third - generation warfare : flexibility , mobility , and independence .
The Espresso Book Machine is n't magic .
It is n't the entire future delivered like a pizza to those in publishing who are fretting about ebooks like silent movie stars in an age of " talkies , " wavy stink - lines coming out of their armpits as they sweat over their artistic relevance in an image - addicted age .
But the EBM is certainly a big piece of the puzzle , and it is here today to shock us into doing things differently .
[ Haskell - cafe ] Functional Reactive Web Application Framework ?
Hi , I 've been learning Haskell for a few months , and it has influenced my thinking about programs quite a lot .
Most of my current work is creating complex web applications .
Naturally , I was thinking about how to make rich internet applications ( and GUI apps in general ) in an ( utmost :-) ) functional way .
Recently I found out the concepts of functional reactive programming < http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming>, which supersede and generalize my ideas .
My question is : " Is there a FRP web application framework , or perhaps an effort to create one ? "
If not , I 'd be willing to start such a project , but since I 'm not very experienced Haskell programmer , I 'd most likely need some help from somebody more experienced .
If somebody would be interested , my ideas go as follows : Handling events in GUI / RIA applications can be very tedious , especially for complex applications .
Instead , I 'd prefer something like that : 1 ) Abstract what a user wants to see using a structured datatype , specifically tailored for the application .
You may imagine it as something like a structured URL .
This can be then viewed as a FRP behavior -- a function of the user 's request depending on time .
2 ) The data that will be displayed on the page are a function of this structured user request and an environment , which is usually database .
This is again a behavior .
3 ) Finally , the resulting page is a function of the data ( again a behavior ) .
4 ) User actions that change the application state ( update the database ) could be viewed as FRP events .
So instead of handling tons of events , the programmer would construct the application mostly by composing behaviors .
Only state - changing user actions would be handled as events .
Does anybody see these ideas as useful ?
Constructive criticism is welcomed .
Best regards , Petr
To say that Rush Limbaugh has been among the most prolific critics of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor would be something of an understatement .
In the last few days , he has blasted her as “ an angry woman ” and a “ bigot ” , an “ anti-constitutionalist , ” the “ greatest living example of a reverse racist , ” while urging Republicans to “ go to the mat ” to oppose her and prevent her from getting confirmed .
All of which is pretty standard stuff from Limbaugh .
But , just for old time ’s sake , I thought I ’d highlight this quote from him back in 2005 in which he literally screamed at Democrats to “ shut up ” about Bush ’s Supreme Court nominees because , until they could start winning elections , their views did n’t matter :
It is a bit odd to try and sleep in the purple haze …
OH and virgin america had wifi and absinthe ~ but i did not partake in either ~ tried to sleep uncomfortably instead …
Its a real perspective shifter to see the US so dark while bouncing between big cities !
The brightness of the moon was rather blinding to sleep with ~ and the stars were distractingly beautifully bright ~ and the patches of cities and towns below were just gorgeous … and google maps led me to believe this may be omaha … but i’m not sure how accurate it was …
mmmm typography is so nice in the morning … and looks like this table will be fun to shoot stuff on this week !
I really do like that they both tell me “ Everything is going to be alright ” and “ thanks for sleeping with us ” ~ there ’s just something so nice about that …
Welcome to my new home !
Yes , i get to sleep under care bears , the cat in the hat fish that is somehow IN the koolaid man , casper , ET , and more …
The door !
the mirror !
The lamp !
i just adore the attention to detail and how everything is so random yet perfectly matched …
Smeg. LOVE the smeg .
It ;s a cozy hoodie robe … and these fixtures are even nicer in person than i imagined frmo the pics i’d seen … .
Too cute …
Here ’s the bathroom …
Soap on a rope !
or maybe… soap on a string ?
nice idea , adorably executed …
just love these buttons …
Canvas hanging from the shower curtain rod with an attached sheet of pockets of goodies …
Nice graphic …
Everything you need to know … unfortunately Stumptown and the restaurant are n’t quite open yet … but they will fetch you food from a list of restaurants for room service !
Maid Tip envelope , comment card , pencils , notepad all rubberbanded neatly
I know you were curious what the food is …
… and what is in that SMEG !
… and with that i think it is now time for a nap so i can run around today !!!

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Tuesday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says Nickelodeon should remove Chris Brown 's nomination for its Kids Choice Awards .
( CNN ) --
On the same day singer Chris Brown was arraigned for allegedly beating his pop star girlfriend Rihanna , he made an appeal to fans on his Myspace page : Vote for me for the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards .
That 's right .
No apology , no concern for his battered girlfriend .
He 's worried about the next awards show .
Since his arrest , he did lose an endorsement deal with Doublemint gum .
But for some reason the folks at kids ' channel Nickelodeon still think it 's appropriate to nominate him for Favorite Male Singer .
' No Bias , No Bull '
Get the latest on the day 's main events .
8 ET Monday through Friday see full schedule »
In a statement they say : " Chris brown was nominated by kids several months ago based on his body of work as a performer . "
But the executives at Nickelodeon ought to take a good look at this photo obtained by TMZ because this may be Brown 's real body of work , allegedly taking a beautiful young cover girl and turning her face into this .
Nickelodeon should wake up .
I think , the only place Chris Brown belongs is in jail .
It boggles the mind that a children 's TV network , trusted by parents for decades , could turn a blind eye when faced with such violence .
Imagine the message it sends to a generation of boys and girls ?
iReport.com : Chris Brown fans :
Share your reaction
The awards take place the end of the month .
In other words , there is still time for Nickelodeon to come to its senses , even if Chris Brown never comes to his .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .

Palm Saturday
The iPhone was introduced at Macworld Expo on 9 January 2007 .
On that day , Palm Inc. was screwed .
Their relevance in the industry had already been slowly draining , and they not only had no available products in the same league as the iPhone , they had no future products in the same league .
For all the mistakes Palm made to get to that point , and they clearly made many , it ’s quite possible that they have done everything right since then .
They abandoned whatever then passed for their product plan .
They hired Jon Rubinstein and gave him control over building a new hardware and software engineering division .
They hired not just new engineers , but great designers and all sorts of other smart and talented people essential to building a world - class engineering , design , and developer culture .
In short , they did something few companies , no matter how deeply in trouble , ever do : they recognized that they were screwed and took drastic action .
It ’s an overused phrase , but in this case it is true : they ’ve bet the company .
Palm designed , built , and released the Pre , WebOS , and an app store , all in about two years .
I ’ve not yet seen or used an actual Pre , but I have been using the WebOS , emulated on my Mac , as a member of Palm ’s beta SDK program , and it is excellent .
It is hard to imagine how Palm could have produced anything better in the same amount of time .
The question is whether even the best they could do is still too little , too late .
Even if , for the sake of argument , we concede that Palm has caught up to the iPhone technically , Apple has a two year marketing head start , too .
The iPhone has already joined the iPod as not just a tech culture hit , but a pop culture hit .
Everyone knows what an iPhone is .
It also has worldwide distribution ; the Pre is exactly where the iPhone was two years ago : on one carrier , only in the U.S.
The iPhone ’s popularity has led to third - party developer support , and third - party developer support has in turn made the iPhone even more popular .
It ’s a virtuous circle .
That sweaty “ Developers , developers , developers , developers ” rant is probably the smartest thing Steve Ballmer has ever said .
But so what does the Pre have that the iPhone lacks ?
The two biggest differences are its hardware keyboard and that it has a different exclusive U.S. carrier , Sprint .
But Sprint is smaller than AT&T .
Imagine instead if the Pre were launching tomorrow morning on Verizon .
That might have proved to be an interesting advantage against the iPhone .
That leaves the keyboard .
I ’ve been thinking about this ever since the keyboard - less iPhone launched , and it is my theory that a hardware keyboard is a significant selling point for only one group of customers : those who already own a phone with a hardware keyboard , and that group is a niche .
A nice niche , but a niche nonetheless .
Here ’s why .
Most normal people have yet to buy their first smartphone .
That ’s why the stakes are so high — it ’s a wide open market frontier , but it wo n’t remain that way for long .
Normal people are n’t planning to do much typing on their new smartphones , and they ’re probably right .
Any smartphone QWERTY keyboard , software or hardware , is going to be better than what most people are used to , which is pecking things out on a phone with a 0 - 9 numeric keypad .
I type far better on my iPhone than I expected I ’d be able to , and that seems to be true for everyone I know who owns one .
The only people who struggle with the iPhone keyboard are those who are already accustomed to a hardware smartphone keyboard .
It is definitely different .
Here ’s what Dieter Bohn of PreCentral wrote in his Pre review :
I ’ve been using QWERTY keyboards on phones for over seven years now and I had no problem adjusting to the Palm Pre .
If you ’re looking for a comparison , I ’ll say that it ’s not as good as your standard BlackBerry keyboard , but for 90 % of people it ’s going to be much better than the iPhone ’s on - screen software keyboard .
My take is that his seven years of hardware keyboard use have warped his perspective .
He ’s got it backwards : for 90 percent of people , it does n’t make a difference whether the keyboard is hardware or software .
So while the comparisons between the Pre and iPhone are obvious and inevitable , I think the Pre stands a much stronger chance of stealing customers away from RIM than from Apple .
For as good as the Pre is , and I ’m convinced it is excellent , it just does n’t have much to offer that would sway someone considering an iPhone .
But for someone considering a BlackBerry , the Pre might look very sweet : a big bright screen , a beautiful modern user interface design , a kick - ass mobile web browser , and , yes , a hardware keyboard .
The Pre is the BlackBerry Bold done right .
Another aspect where the Pre is different than the iPhone is in nerd appeal .
Here ’s a passage from Jason Chen ’s Pre review for Gizmodo :
Opening multiple apps at once really does slow down the phone enough to be noticeable .
In fact , if you ’re doing something particularly intensive , you ’ll actually notice your music stutter , which we ’ve never experienced once on the iPhone .
Ever .
The problem with giving you the ability to open a lot of apps at once means you need to police yourself and close them when they ’re not in use .
But it ’s damn well worth it .
Being able to view a PDF , then flipping over to Messaging to answer a text , then over to Music to change a song , then over to email to tap out a quickie — that ’s computing .
What ’s fascinating about this passage is that Chen clearly intends for it to be taken as a compliment — he is praising the Pre ’s multitasking support and interface .
But these exact words also summarize perfectly why Apple has withheld multitasking from third - party iPhone applications .
The Pre will let you run too many apps at the same time and suffer the consequences .
The iPhone will not .
Palm has chosen a different trade - off than Apple in this regard , and it might help them carve out a segment of the market that the iPhone does not , and probably never will , appeal to — the “ do n’t treat me like a child , let me shoot myself in the foot if I want to , I despise artificial constraints imposed upon me ” crowd .
Some expert users will see the Pre ’s stance as a huge win .
Regarding the Mojo SDK and Eating Their Own Dogfood
One misconception I ’ve seen this week is that the Pre ’s “ web - based ” SDK is similar to the development situation for the iPhone during its first year .
This is false , but it ’s easy to see the confusion because of all the talk about WebOS apps being written using “ HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ” .
Prior to Apple ’s release of the Cocoa Touch APIs and App Store , the developer story for the iPhone was “ just write iPhone - optimized web apps ” , where by “ web apps ” they meant “ web sites ” — something delivered from a remote web server that ran within a page in MobileSafari .
Yes , Palm ’s Mojo SDK is based on HTML and CSS for layout and JavaScript for programming .
But it includes a real API for WebOS - specific things .
JavaScript executing in a WebOS app can do many things that JavaScript running in a browser web page cannot .
It ’s conceptually very similar to Mac OS X’s Dashboard — WebOS apps are like Dashboard widgets , not web pages .
They ’re installed on the device , not loaded over the web from a server .
What was frustrating for would - be iPhone Cocoa developers during the period where Apple was telling them to “ just write web apps ” was that Apple itself , of course , was writing its own iPhone apps using Objective - C .
It just was n’t ( and is n’t ) possible to write an iPhone web app that looked or felt anywhere near as nice as a real Cocoa Touch iPhone app .
But Mojo , on the other hand , is what Palm is using to write its own WebOS apps .
They ’re up to their ears in Mojo dogfood .
Third - party WebOS apps have the potential to be just as nice as Palm ’s WebOS apps , because they ’re all written using the Mojo APIs .
It ’s an open question whether Mojo will prove to be a weakness ( because it ’s slower than compiled code ) , strength ( because HTML , CSS , and JavaScript are so familiar to so many existing developers ) , or non-issue .
But however this question is resolved , Palm ’s own WebOS apps are in the same boat as third - party apps , which is nothing at all like the pre-SDK iPhone situation .

Over - packaging seems to be the norm in our excessive society but too much packaging causes problems for the consumer , as well as the planet .
It ’s frustrating to tear through huge boxes filled with endless packaging foam to finally unwrap the tiny iPod you ’ve been waiting on – getting rid of all that waste is an entirely new battle , not to mention all the unnecessary space required during shipping for too much packaging .
We ’ve gathered some of the most ridiculous examples of over - packaging and included a few ways you can help diminish the excess .
These 2 little bitty Bluetooth ear hooks from Motorola were really the only items in this super - sized box .
The 2 - inch components could have easily shared a padded envelope and maybe even saved on shipping costs – but everyone appreciates a big complimentary box of air .

This over - packaging mishap was committed by the Danish kitchenwares company , Rosti .
Within this humongous box , 2 pizza pans and a water pitcher could have safely survived in a container less than half the size .

The tiny iPhone headphone adapter above , already in it ’s manufacturing packaging , was shipped from PC Connection .
The bubble envelope it was placed in would have probably been sufficient for shipping , but to be on the safe side ( ? ) , the envelope was carefully placed on top of another empty envelope , surrounded by needless paper , and sent on its way in a waste of cardboard .

Amazon seems to be a fan of excessive packaging , earning themselves multiple spots in our collection .
This particular shipment was nothing but the minute iPod Nano – in a box big enough to hold a child .
( Source : Overpackaging.com )
Dell ( or a Dell vendor , according to their spokesperson via Treehugger ) is also guilty of overdoing the packaging materials .
This lonely little flash drive ’s only companion inside a way - too - big empty box was a waste of shipping paper .

HP is n’t doing much better .
What would you expect to find after unwrapping this much plastic and tape – all neatly packaged on its very own wooden pallet ?
A small box that could have been shipped without the pallet and extras , containing nothing more than a mere PS2 mouse .
( Source : The Register )
Notice the small bottle sitting in front of all these boxes ?
The glass bottle contains 1 gram of a toxic chemical called ethidium bromide .
There were definitely no worries of contamination the way this thing was ( over ) packaged – bubble wrap , inside a large paper - filled bag , inside a closed tin , in a really big box , in an even bigger box .
( Source : Too Much Packaging at Wired )
This is a first - class example of waayy too much packaging .
The 6 very small boxes in the corner were shipped by iittala .
Rather than pack all 6 boxes in one larger box ( with plenty of room to spare ) , each little box deserved its own big box for one great big over - packaging mistake .
( Source : Treehugger )
What would you like in your gigantic HP box ?
I ’ll bet it is n’t 32 sheets of paper !
The mega box shown here was filled with 16 smaller boxes , each containing 2 pages of obviously fragile info .
Do envelopes still exist ?

This is another over - packaging example from Amazon .
The lone webcam could n’t have asked for a bigger shipping box unless it was coming from HP !

What Can You Do ?
Employees of LUSH Cosmetics get naked to draw attention to the waste of unneeded packaging .
The ‘ bare message ’ campaign has been held for 2 years now , with 24 different locations participating in 2008 .
UK Environment Minister , Ben Bradshaw , has given shoppers a new voice in the fight against over - packaging .
After a disappointing reduction of only 12 % between 1999 and 2005 , consumers were urged to leave their excess and unnecessary packaging at the checkout counter – forcing grocers to take action .
Tesco is working to meet the goal of waste reduction by 2010 – with the help of their customers .
Shoppers are asked to dump packaging they find excessive before leaving the store , helping the company learn where the biggest reductions can be made .
If leaving your packaging waste at the counter is n’t an option and getting naked does n’t seem like the most effective strategy , continue to submit your excessive packaging photos to websites like ours and those mentioned above .
You can also do your best to avoid products with excessive packaging and send a note to online companies that over - package to let them know you ’re disappointed .
Contact Congress and the Obama administration and urge the US to step forward and take action against excessive packaging .
One of the issues under consideration in the Perl 5 support policy is binary compatibility .
Binary compatibility is the likelihood that binaries compiled against a previous release will work with a newer release .
These binaries are most likely modules with XS components , though they can also be programs which embed Perl .
This is very different from source compatibility ( Unix 's traditional compatibility guarantee ) , where the syntax of a program does n't change in incompatible ways .
You may not be able to take advantage of new features , but old features continue to work as you expect .
An XS of Pain
If you 've used the CPAN much , you know that XS modules can be more difficult to configure , build , and install than pure Perl modules .
( If you have n't used the CPAN much , know that there 's a convention of providing pure Perl versions of certain XS modules .
They may be slower and less efficient , but they can be easier to install and debug . )
Why is XS so troublesome ?
Windows and Mac OS X users have noticed that installing XS modules requires a working development environment , including the Perl headers , a decent compiler , and a passable make utility .
( To be fair , even Unix users can have trouble , especially those on platforms with horrible C compiler support .
The C99 standard is a decade old .
If you 're not busy , would you mind implementing some of its features ?
Thanks ! )
Strawberry Perl is a great Perl distribution which includes a preconfigured development environment suitable for building XS modules .
Part of the problem is that XS is difficult to use correctly .
The Perl 5 core has far too little encapsulation ; XS exposes many intimate details of its internals .
This allows a lot of power , but it has other implications which I 'll discuss in a future entry .
The problem here relates to binary compatibility .
Duck Sequencing
The silly example of duck typing suggests that anything that looks like a duck , walks like a duck , and quacks like a duck is obviously a duck .
That 's fine in a lot of languages .
It 's not ( usually ) fine in C ( though like most things in C , you can fake it if you 're exceedingly clever and disciplined and very good at lying to yourself ) .
Suppose you have a Duck struct :
struct Duck { quack_func_t * quack ; walk_func_t * walk ; unsigned int num_ducklings ; bool has_feathers ; }
If you do n't know C , that 's fine .
Think of this like a hash or a dictionary where the order of the keys really , really matters and the size of the values really , really matters .
In C terms , this describes a blob of memory .
The compiler carves out some 16 bytes of memory ( four bytes per pointer , four bytes for an unsigned integer , and four bytes for the boolean -- wasting plenty of bits to make the struct size a power of two ) .
Anytime in the source code you refer to a Duck , the compiler knows that the first four bytes refer to the function the duck uses to quack .
At least , the compiler believes you when you tell it that .
The compiled binary does n't check .
That information is n't there .
All the binary knows is that it has a chunk of memory and that to quack , it grabs the first four bytes from that chunk and uses that to look up a function to call .
All is fine and good if you 've typed your program appropriately .
Imagine that someone comes along and says that ducks must also swim .
This means that the Duck struct also needs a swim member .
There are several ways to handle this .
One is to put this member where it makes the most sense :
struct Duck { quack_func_t * quack ; swim_func_t * swim ; walk_func_t * walk ; unsigned int num_ducklings ; bool has_feathers ; }
This version of the struct has functions at the top in alphabetical order .
That 's nice for maintainers ; it has a well - defined structure .
Unfortunately , any binary which used a Duck before is now broken until you recompile it .
Remember , the binary does n't check that the struct 's layout has changed .
The binary does n't know about the struct layout .
It just knows to look in a specific spot for a specific amount of memory which it can treat in a specific way .
Code that tried to walk before will now swim .
If those functions have different signatures , expect a crash .
Code that checked the number of ducklings will now show a very , very fertile duck when the code treats the walk pointer as an integer value .
When Ducks Cry
The right way to maintain backwards compatibility is to put the swim function at the end of the struct declaration .
Code compiled against the previous
Duck wo n't be able to swim because it does n't know anything about that struct member , but at least it can do everything the previous Duck did ...
... unless it did anything advanced with Duck structs , like constructing its own or relying on a particular layout for reflection purposes .
At this point you should be able to imagine the chaos if you want to remove a struct member .
While there are some benefits to C's compact representation of data , the drawbacks are serious .
C's type system is a thin veneer over memory layout which goes away at compile time .
Another approach is to hide the details of a Duck behind an interface of functions .
To create a duck , call a function .
To manipulate a duck 's member variable , call a function .
( You can also use macros . )
Adding a layer of abstraction gives you the ability to hide a duck 's intimate details behind an interface that wo n't change as much .
This often works , but those functions can change too .
As I alluded before , changing a function signature or name can make existing binaries crash too .
You can keep old functions around as a compatibility layer , revising arguments and delegating to the new versions ....
Less Code is Easier to Maintain
... but the more code you have , the more difficult it is to maintain .
This argument applies to the users as well as the developers of Perl 5 .
The cost of sorting through an API and documentation is important to consider .
Pawing through lists of deprecations and backwards compatibility concerns is not free .
In the Internet age , when Perl 4 - style tutorials have long outlived their usefulness , it 's easy to find a tutorial that explains the old and broken way to do something .
If that code 's still around , it 's not obvious that the new way works , or what that new way might be .
Sometimes the best way to implement a new feature is to remove old code ; sometimes the only way to fix a bug is to remove old code -- especially when you develop iteratively toward the optimal potential solution .
If Perl 5 had a well - defined and well - enforced boundary between perl internals and Perl extensions , p5 p would have an easier time rearranging the internals to support new features , remove bugs , and to improve the code to make maintenance easier .
The current situation allows extensions to poke at Perl 's guts .
As I 've said , we can't even tell if or when this happens .
Improving Perl 5 is unnecessarily difficult -- but we need the courage and the freedom to break binary compatibility when the gains outweigh the costs of upgrading and changing .
That 's a calculation we perform too infrequently .
The Current Policy
The current binary compatibility policy is that all minor releases in a major release series maintain binary compatibility .
5.8.0 established a binary compatibility level in July 2002 .
The nine subsequent releases over the next six and a half years modified neither existing function signatures nor exposed struct layouts .
Of course , without a well - defined and regular release schedule , users can't predict when they 'll have to recompile their XS extensions .
Without a well - defined extension API , XS developers may have to support multiple major versions of Perl .
Without a formal end - of - life policy for Perl releases , XS developers have to make their own decisions about what they 'll support -- and which APIs work where .
( XS itself is often unnecessary , but that 's a different problem altogether . )
Do n't misunderstand .
Binary compatibility within releases in a major family is usually very good .
Perl 5's reliance on the CPAN is wonderful , but reinstalling dozens of modules after upgrading to a newer minor version would be problematic .
( This may argue for better CPAN distribution management . )
Yet drawing out binary compatibility for unknown periods of time -- like drawing out the lifespans of releases for unknown periods of time -- leads to unpredictability , not just for developers but for users .
Reliable , constant improvement requires not just the will but the ability to make changes .
Sometimes those changes are incompatible with what 's come before .
( If we could predict the future reliably , they would n't be -- but the best way we can learn is through experience . )
Allowing ourselves the ability to make changes -- and remove vestigial code that we'd otherwise have to support for indeterminate periods -- allows us to improve .
Tying those periods to well - known calendar dates actually increases the predictability of our systems and processes .
Users do n't have to upgrade , of course .
Users can choose to stick with the best Perl 1999 had to offer .
It 's free .
They get the same amount of support they would back then .
Yet if we can make improvements -- if we have the will to unshackle our future from our past -- we may be able to offer them something far better than we could have imagined in 1999 .
That 's my goal , anyway .
It 's like finding out there really are monsters under the bed :
Over the weekend , a Seattle man visiting a WaMu ATM noticed there was something peculiar about the card - reader slot .
There certainly was -- it was covered by a card skimmer with a battery , card scanner , and mini USB port .
The good news , as reported by Consumerist , is that this is pretty much the first time anyone involved has actually encountered a skimmer installed and operating ( presumably ; the investigation is ongoing ) in the wild .
The bad news is that the wee beastie was found not on some random gas - station cash machine , but on an actual bank - maintained ATM .
Once upon a time we thought those might be safer from such tampering ; so much for that security measure .
The full interview is potentially even more explosive .
Bradley says she initially believed that we 're trying the worst of the worst -- but when she first met Muhammad at Gitmo in 2005 , it was the most shocking experience she'd had in her 20 years as a lawyer .
He actually believed she was going to hurt him .
She says that Muhammad was the only one telling the truth in this case -- she'd been stonewalled at every turn .
For instance , she could n't get the CIA to admit he'd been rendered from Pakistan to Morocco , even though she had flight reports from the CIA and the dates Muhammad gave her tracked with the dates on those reports .
Bradley says Mohamed 's abusive treatment began in Pakistan , when he was picked up in April 2002 .
He was held up above his head with his feet barely touching the floor without food or use of a bathroom .
This continued in Morocco , and he was also drugged .
The genital mutilation happened for over a month -- they cut him , let it heal , then cut him again .
They deliberately used scalpels so there would n't be any evidence left .
Bradley believes the commission system -- at least the Bush incarnation -- is a " farce " intended to rubber - stamp convictions .
Besides using evidence that might have been obtained through torture , there 's heavy use of hearsay , refusal to turn over exculpatory evidence , etc .
Muhammad 's entire case , she says , is based on evidence obtained through torture .
I apologize if I missed anything -- there 's no transcript out yet , and I 'm shaking with anger even as I type .
I listen to this , and the first question I have to ask is , " What the hell happened to my country ? "
The tactics described here are something you 'd expect from North Korea or China .
It 's things like this that make me think that even in the face of polls that appear to show the American people oppose torture investigations , it 's going to get to a point where Reid and Pelosi will be able to say , " Sorry , we have to investigate this " -- and there wo n't be any blowback .
Update : Roberttacker13 managed to find the video for the short version of the interview here :
After seeing this , I 'm starting to wonder -- will even Obama 's revised plan be at all legitimate ?
Update # 2 : After watching only a little bit of the Russia Today video , I have to confess -- there needs to be another moratorium on new proceedings against these detainees .
If Bradley is telling the truth ( and I have little reason to doubt that she is n't ) , then most cases against them will have to be thrown out since a good portion of the evidence was illegally obtained .
Update # 3 : After being alerted in the comments , I looked more into Russia Today - - turns out it 's an arm of the less - than - free Russian state media .
They may be right on about this , but I 'm not willing to give them credibility .
Update # 4 : Just discovered the # 2 result when you search for Yvonne Bradley on YouTube is from Press TV , which is owned by Iran state media .
You 've got Russia and Iran effectively lecturing us about torture .
What does that say about what 's happened to our country ?
WASHINGTON  Judge Sonia Sotomayor , President Obama ’s Supreme Court choice , has a blunt and even testy side , and it was on display in December during an argument before the federal appeals court in New York .
The case concerned a Canadian man who said American officials had sent him to Syria to be tortured , and Judge Sotomayor peppered a government lawyer with skeptical questions .
“ So the minute the executive raises the specter of foreign policy , national security , ” Judge Sotomayor asked the lawyer , Jonathan F. Cohn , “ it is the government ’s position that that is a license to torture anyone ? ”
Mr. Cohn managed to get out two and a half words : “ No , your hon . ”
Judge Sotomayor cut him off , then hit him with two more questions and a flat declaration of what she said was his position .
The lawyer managed to say she was wrong , but could not clarify the point until the chief judge , Dennis G. Jacobs , stepped in , asking , “ Why do n’t we just get the position ? ”
To supporters , Judge Sotomayor ’s vigorous questioning of the Bush administration ’s position in the case of the Canadian , Maher Arar , showcases some of her strengths .
She is known as a formidably intelligent judge with a prodigious memory who meticulously prepares for oral arguments and is not shy about grilling the lawyers who appear before her to ensure that she fully understands their arguments .
You know what was a great idea ?
To send a low - flying plane cruising down the Hudson river this morning , days after a dude was fired for authorizing a similar flight that scared New York .
Remember how the military sent Air Force One to New York to scare the shit out of Wall Street ?
( This was one of those " hedge fund death threats " everyone 's bitching at Obama for , we are pretty sure . )
And then Louis Caldera had to resign , because of this ?
Yes , well , you remember this , but apparently the Pentagon did n't .
The FAA sent out word this morning that " a military plane will fly up and down the Hudson " between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m..
Why ?
Who knows .
Boredom .
It 's sunny out .
This seemed like a wonderful idea that would n't get anyone in trouble for exactly 30 minutes , at which point an email went out from the city 's Office of Emergency Management 's Notify NYC program announcing the cancellation of the flyover .
Someone saved their job today .
Though this would 've been a totally acceptable little exercise if they 'd just announced that Sully was the one flying it .
Here ’s a talk I gave earlier this year at the O’Reilly Tools of Change for Publishing conference in NYC , about the way that DRM gives distributors control over publishers and writers .
This talk went down very well , and is the source of “ Doctorow ’s Law , ” which a lot of people have asked me about : “ Any time someone puts a lock on something you own , against your wishes , and does n’t give you the key , it ’s not being done to your benefit . ”
There ’s some errata here , though : the Overdrive debacle was due to a licensing dispute , not a bankruptcy ; and there ’s now a “ DRM - free ” option for the Kindle , but I ca n’t find out if the file comes with legal encumbrances that would prevent people who buy one of these from moving it to a competing device ( no one at Amazon will answer my queries about this ) .
And I ’ve also been told by Amazon that supposedly Audible will do DRM - free audiobooks , but they have n’t answered repeated queries about the details of this .

Shock jocks shock .
And so it went Friday morning when WLS radio host Erich " Mancow " Muller decided to subject himself to the controversial practice of waterboarding live on his show .
Mancow decided to tackle the divisive issue head on -- actually it was head down , while restrained and reclining .
" I want to find out if it 's torture , " Mancow told his listeners Friday morning , adding that he hoped his on - air test would help prove that waterboarding did not , in fact , constitute torture .
The debate over whether waterboarding constitutes torture reached a fever pitch this week as re-ignited claims that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) knew as early as 2002 about waterboarding techniques being used , and former Vice President Dick Cheney and President Barack Obama gave " dueling speeches " Thursday .
Listeners had the chance to decide whether Mancow himself or his co-host , Chicago radio personality Pat Cassidy , would undergo the interrogation method during the broadcast .
The voters ultimately decided Mancow would be the one donning the soaked towel and shackles , and at about 8:40 a.m. , he entered a small storage room next to his studio that was compared to a " dungeon " by Cassidy .
" The average person can take this for 14 seconds , " Marine Sergeant Clay South answered , adding , " He 's going to wiggle , he 's going to scream , he 's going to wish he never did this . "
With a Chicago Fire Department paramedic on hand , Mancow was placed on a 7 - foot long table , his legs were elevated , and his feet were tied up .
Turns out the stunt was n't so funny .
Witnesses said Muller thrashed on the table , and even instantly threw the toy cow he was holding as his emergency tool to signify when he wanted the experiment to stop .
He only lasted 6 or 7 seconds .
" It is way worse than I thought it would be , and that 's no joke , " Mancow said , likening it to a time when he nearly drowned as a child .
" It is such an odd feeling to have water poured down your nose with your head back ... It was instantaneous ... and I do n't want to say this : absolutely torture . "
" I wanted to prove it was n't torture , " Mancow said .
" They cut off our heads , we put water on their face ... I got voted to do this but I really thought ' I 'm going to laugh this off . ' "
Last year , Vanity Fair writer Christopher Hitchens endured the same experiment -- and came to a similar conclusion .
The conservative writer said he found the treatment terrifying , and was haunted by it for months afterward .
" Well , then , if waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture , " Hitchens concluded in the article .

Matt Bartosik , editor of Off the Rocks ' next issue and " between blogs " blogger , knows that there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
( CNN ) -- Christian Eshiett was a rambunctious pre-teen who spent a lot of time cavorting with his friends in southern Nigeria .
He would skip school and run away from home for days , frustrating his grandfather , who oversaw the boy 's care .
Children branded as witches protest on February 26 , 2009 , in the southern Nigerian city of Eket .
" I beat him severely with canes until they broke , yet he never shed a tear , " said Eshiett Nelson Eshiett , 76 .
" One day , I took a broom to hit him and he started crying .
Then I knew he was possessed by demons .
... Nigerian witches are terrified of brooms . "
From that day two years ago , Christian , now 14 , was branded a witch .
The abuse intensified .
" They would take my clothes off , tie me up and beat me , " he told CNN in a telephone interview .
The teen is one of the so - called witch children in Eket , a city in oil - rich Akwa Ibom state of Nigeria .
They are blamed for causing illness , death and destruction , prompting some communities to put them through harrowing punishments to " cleanse " them of their supposed magical powers .
" Children accused of witchcraft are often incarcerated in churches for weeks on end and beaten , starved and tortured in order to extract a confession , " said Gary Foxcroft , program director of Stepping Stones Nigeria , a nonprofit that helps alleged witch children in the region .
Many of those targeted have traits that make them stand out , including learning disabilities , stubbornness and ailments such as epilepsy , he added .
The issue of " child witches " is soaring in Nigeria and other parts of the world , Foxcroft said .
The states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River have about 15,000 children branded as witches , and most of them end up abandoned and abused on the streets , he said .
Christian ran away from home and wandered around for two years with other children similarly accused .
He said they stole , begged for food and performed menial jobs to survive .
The plight of " child witches " is raising concern among aid organizations , including the United Nations .
" It is a growing issue worldwide , among not just African communities , but in countries such as Nepal as well , " said Jeff Crisp , head of policy development and evaluation for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees .
" We are trying to see whether it is a neglected protected issue . "
Belief in witchcraft thrives worldwide .
About 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia were locked in detention centers in March and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion , human rights organization Amnesty International said .
In 2005 , relatives of an 8 - year - old Angolan girl living in England were convicted of torturing her for being a " witch , " according to the Times Online .
Pastors have been accused of worsening the problem by claiming to have powers to recognize and exorcise " child witches , " sometimes for a fee , aid workers said .
But some are true believers , such as one minister in Lagos , Nigeria .
He pinpoints children affected by witchcraft for free , he said .
" Sometimes , we get a dream that shows us a certain person is suffering from witchcraft , " said the Rev. Albert Aina , a senior pastor at Four Square Gospel Church .
" Sometimes , you have a child who has inexplicable body marks because of struggling in the night .
They are easy to identify , but why charge when you have been given a gift by God ? "
Aina said .
Once a child is branded a witch , the stigma can last forever .
Christian was reunited with his grandfather , a former theater instructor at a university in Nigeria .
Eshiett said he let his son's child return home because he loves him and he advocates for youth education .
But , he added , he does not think Christian has been or can be freed from witchcraft .
" When you are possessed , you are possessed ; no one can deliver you from Satan , " Eshiett said , adding that his grandson is a witch because he still exhibits unruly behavior and does not take education seriously .
Aid organizations acknowledge that the belief is acceptable and popular in some communities .
" It is not the belief in witchcraft that we are concerned about , " Foxcroft said .
" We acknowledge people 's right to hold this belief on the condition that this does not lead to child abuse . "
Foxcroft , whose documentary , " Saving Africa 's Witch Children , " was broadcast last year , spoke to a U.N. panel on the issue in April .
The aid worker said he is planning a global conference in 2010 and public awareness campaigns , including addressing the issue in Nigerian movies .
The nation 's film industry , dubbed Nollywood , is a popular form of entertainment in African countries .
Government officials also have joined the fight .
Akwa Ibom recently added a clause into the Child Rights Act , saying that anyone found guilty of branding a child a witch would get up to 12 years in prison .
" This is groundbreaking , and Stepping Stones Nigeria applauds the Akwa Ibom state government for this , " Foxcroft said .
But , he added , there is more work to be done , and other groups , especially churches , have to team up to resolve the problem .
" The role of the international Christian community in this cannot be underestimated , " Foxcroft said .
" Unfortunately , the fact remains that this belief system is being spread by so - called Christians . "
CNN 's attempts to reach Akwa Ibom state officials through phone calls and e-mails were unsuccessful .
A Nigerian federal communications official declined to comment .

Flickr user Shepherd Johnson was browsing the official White House photostream one night when he decided to post a politically - charged comment .
Then another , then another .
Soon , without warning , Yahoo's photo - sharing service deleted his account , complete with 1,200 pictures .
An unrepentant Yahoo wo n't say what , exactly , Johnson did wrong .
His comments were about Barack Obama 's support of a bill allowing the government to suppress torture photos .
They were attached to seemingly relevant images from the president 's recent trip to Cairo to ring in a new era of U.S. - Middle Eastern relations .
" I thought , this is an opportunity I can use to let the administration know how I feel about some of its policies , " Johnson told us in a phone interview .
The Virginia man 's initial 10 or so comments , which went up Wednesday night , were deleted without explanation by Friday .
That night , Johnson posted roughly ten more to different White House photos , this time linking in another Flickr user 's Abu Ghraib picture , as allowed by Flickr 's comment formatting ( see Johnson 's reproduction of his comment , left , taken from his post to freedom - of - information hub Cryptome ) .
In the midst of this second round of commenting , Johnson found his account was gone .
There had been no warning of any sort from Yahoo , he said .
Johnson would later work his way up Flickr 's customer service tree , eventually leaving a message for the vice president of customer service and other bigwigs .
He even left a message for Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz — a noted fan of frank discourse — on Bartz 's home answering machine .
Johnson , who lives outside Richmond , still has no answers .
More crucially , he also does n't have access to any of the 1,200 pictures he uploaded to Flickr under his paid " Pro " membership .
Many of the pics , he said , were " completely irretrievable — I did n't back them up on any disks , I just spur - of - the - moment loaded it up and deleted the flash " memory originals .
Asked about all this , Yahoo issued us a statement ( see below ) saying its policies prevented it from discussing Johnson 's account and pointing us to Flickr 's community guidelines .
But if the company expects people to move their data to its servers , via sites like Flickr and Yahoo Mail , it 's going to have to do better than that .
Users wo n't feel safe moving their data into Yahoo's " cloud " if it can vanish without a trace with no warning .
Similarly , Flickr 's user base of photographers is notoriously sensitive to any hint of censorship , so the company would be well - advised to come up with a coherent explanation for why the most powerful man in the world needs to be so ruthlessly protected against a slightly aggressive internet commenter .
Where 's Carol Bartz 's straight talk when you need it ?

Repeat after me : Unicode is not UTF - \d{1,2}
Filed under : June 22 , 2009 , 5:23 amFiled under : Uncategorized
Stop .
Unicode is not UTF - 16 , Unicode is not UTF - 32 , and Unicode is not UTF - 8 .
Stop it .
This is just plainly wrong .
Unicode is a standard , and UTF - ( 8|16|32 ) are character encodings that support encoding Unicode data into byte strings .
UTF - 16 is capable of encoding the whole Unicode repertoire , but UTF - 16 is not Unicode , and Unicode is not UTF - 16 .
And no , it ’s not almost the same .
It ’s nowhere to be close .
Think about it , you take some beginners , and introduce them to programming .
After a while they get the pleasure to be introduced to “ Ã œ ” “ Ã¶ ” “ ? ” and their friends , and it ’s time for them to learn about the huge Unicode monster .
You point them to a great article , wait a bit , and head for a little Q&A session .
Inevitably , you will get strange formulations such as “ I see , I will encode everything to Unicode ” , or “ but how can I tell if this string is Unicode - encoded ? ” , or better “ all this time I ’ve been using UTF - 8 without knowing that it was in fact Unicode magic ? ” .
Well ,
If you think that these approximate formulations are fine , and that you should not correct your beginner programmer , you ’re just doing it wrong .
A byte string cannot be Unicode - encoded .
It cannot .
You either work with encoded byte strings , or with unicode data ( a sequence of code - points ) .
But you ca n’t “ Unicode - encode ” , it ’s non-sense .
Similarly you cannot encode a string to Unicode .
You cannot .
You decode a byte string from a source character set to Unicode data : code - point sequences .
Repeat after me :
when transforming data from Unicode to a specific character set , you are encoding Unicode codepoints into bytes , according to a specific character encoding that suits your target character set .
Unicode codepoints into bytes , according to a specific character encoding that suits your target character set .
when transforming from ( byte ) strings to Unicode , you are decoding your data : if you fail to provide the right character encoding to decode from , you will end up with borked Unicode data .
It ’s not “ okay ” to let beginners work with approximate knowledge of the Unicode buzzword .
They will eventually get confused , and you will end up losing time re-explaining over and over the same things .
Approximate formulations reflect approximate knowledge , and you should not let that be .
Approximate Unicode knowledge is the blocker , the main reason why everything we do is not ( yet ) in Unicode .
Because of these kind of approximations , we had broken Unicode support in Python until Python 3.0 , where Unicode data and byte strings were deriving from a common class .
Because of these kind of approximations , we have hundreds of beginners not understand the difference between UTF - 8 and Unicode , and not understanding why string .
encode ( ' utf - 8 ' ) can throw an error : you see , you just said that it was okay to “ Unicode - encode ” , and that UTF - 8 is Unicode , so basically they are trying to “ encode ” strings as …
Unicode and the fact that it fails is just puzzling them because Unicode was supposed to be the magical remedy to all their encoding errors .
Because of these approximations , the .NET property Encoding .
Unicode is the shortcut for what should be Encoding .
UTF16 .
There are Encoding .
UTF8 , Encoding .
UTF32 , and Encoding .
ASCII , and in the middle of those …
Encoding .
Unicode .
How can developers write such wrong things ?
Unicode is not an Encoding , UTF16 is not Unicode .
Just look at the wonderful C# construct Encoding u16LE = Encoding .
Unicode ; taken directly from the documentation : congratulations , you are assigning an “ Unicode ” value to to an “ Encoding ” type .
Crystal clear .
A good image , perhaps , to explain the fundamental type difference between Unicode and , let ’s say , UTF - 16 , would be to assimilate Unicode as an Interface , and UTF - 16 as a concrete class implementing the Unicode interface .
In one hand , Unicode does not define any implementation : it defines no data representation , only an international unequivocal way to associate a character to a code - point .
You could store a list of code - points to represent Unicode data , yes , but doing this forces you to store 4 bytes per character because of the large code - point range .
This is rather inefficient , and this is why UTF -* appeared .
The whole idea is to map Unicode data to byte strings , choosing yourself the mapping function , so that the resulting representation fits your needs .
In a way , you have many different strategies implementing the same interface , depending on your focus :
UTF - 8 focuses on minimizing the byte size for representation of characters from the ASCII set ( variable length representation : each character is represented on 1 to 4 bytes , and ASCII characters all fit on 1 byte ) .
As Joel puts it :
“ Look at all those zeros ! ” they said , since they were Americans and they were looking at English text which rarely used code points above U+00 FF .
Also they were liberal hippies in California who wanted to conserve ( sneer ) .
If they were Texans they would n’t have minded guzzling twice the number of bytes .
But those Californian wimps could n’t bear the idea of doubling the amount of storage it took for strings
UTF - 32 focuses on exhaustiveness and fixed - length representation , using 4 bytes for all characters .
It ’s the most straightforward translation , mapping directly the Unicode code - point to 4 bytes .
Obviously , it ’s not very size - efficient .
UTF - 16 is a compromise , using 2 bytes most of the time , but expanding to 2 * 2 bytes per character to represent certain characters , those not included in the Basic Multilingual Plane ( BMP ) .
I ’m not writing that every developer should know about these details , I ’m just writing that you should know about that very basic interface / implementation difference : Unicode is just an intermediate representation , not an actual encoding .
I find it awful that .NET is so misleading here .
Also , UTF - ( 8|16|32 ) are the most famous “ implementations ” , but there are several other standards , such as UTF - EBCDIC
If you ’re an experienced programmer , please do not allow those approximations .
If a code “ guru ” writes those sort of shortcuts , how will behaviors ever change about Unicode ?
Unicode is not black magic , you just have to be precise , and people will understand .
Please use the right words .
Over - simplifying concepts is not helping .
Thanks .

Schwarzenegger played the Terminator in three blockbuster films
California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in the new Terminator film - thanks to technology .
An image of Schwarzenegger , who played the killer robot in the 1984 original , was inserted from earlier films because he was too busy to shoot new footage .
The 61 - year - old 's appearance in Terminator Salvation was confirmed after a press screening in Los Angeles .
Schwarzenegger had said he was pleased by the prospect in case he wanted to " jump over again " into acting .
Governor Schwarzenegger says he has met director McG - real name Joseph McGinty Nichol - and plans to attend the 14 May premiere of the film .
Terminator Salvation , which stars Christian Bale as resistance leader John Connor , opens in the US on 21 May and in the UK on 3 June .
A review published on the Ain't It Cool News website said the film left the viewer feeling " uplifted and hopeful " .
The " brief " cameo by Schwarzenegger was " a cool moment " but Christian Bale 's performance was " a little over the top at times " , the review - which claims to be the first - said .

Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales on Democracy Now talked to independent filmmaker and journalist Kouross Esmaeli about the attacks coming from Republicans and John McCain against the President for not speaking out more forcefully on Iran .
JUAN GONZALEZ : I ’d like to ask you about the statement — President Obama is now under fire from the right for not speaking out more forcefully on behalf of the Iranian protesters .
He responded to this charge in an interview on CBS News Friday .
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA :
The last thing that I want to do is to have the United States be a foil for those forces inside Iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the United States .
That ’s what they do .
That ’s what we ’re already seeing .
We should n’t be playing into that .
There should be no distractions from the fact that the Iranian people are seeking to let their voices be heard .
What we can do is bear witness and say to the world that the incredible demonstrations that we ’ve seen is a testimony to , I think , what Dr. King called the “ arc of the moral universe . ”
It ’s long , but it bends towards justice .
JUAN GONZALEZ : That was President Obama on Sunday .
Kouross Esmaeli , Iranian American journalist and filmmaker , your response to the criticism of President Obama from the right , in terms of his inaction on the issue of the election in Iran ?
KOUROSS ESMAELI :
What is interesting about the criticisms that are coming from the right is that it ’s been coming primarily from Senator John McCain .
The Iranians know Senator John McCain as the man who sang “ Bomb , bomb Iran ” during the elections of last year .
The man holds no credibility as far as supporting Iranians or seeming like he ’s got the best interests of the Iranians at heart .
And that , for Iranians and for this issue , that discredits him altogether and discredits this whole attack on President Obama .
President Obama ’s stand , I think , has been the most sensible , and it ’s amazing that the President of the United States is taking such a sensible stand .
And that — everyone I ’ve talked to in Iran has said the same thing , that we do not need any symbol of Western , especially American , interference in Iran ’s internal politics .
And the fact that America does not have diplomatic relations with Iran really ties its hand , as far as how far he can go in really supporting Iran .
So the only thing they can do is to just scream as loud as they can , which will be immediately used by the Iranian authorities .

( CNN ) -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , just back from a secret trip to Argentina unknown to his staff or his wife , admitted Wednesday he has carried on an extramarital affair with a woman in Buenos Aires , Argentina .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford chokes up on Wednesday as he admits to having an affair .
" I 've been unfaithful to my wife , " Sanford told a news conference in Columbia , South Carolina .
" I developed a relationship with what started as a dear , dear friend from Argentina . "
His voice choking at times , Sanford apologized to his wife and four sons , his staff and supporters , and said he would resign immediately as head of the Republican Governors Association .
The affair began in the last year and was discovered five months ago , Sanford said without elaborating .
He added that he and his wife were trying to work through it .
Watch Sanford admit to the affair »
In a statement issued later Wednesday , Sanford 's wife , Jenny , said she asked him to move out two weeks earlier but was still open to a reconciliation for the benefit of their children .
" I remain willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions and to welcome him back , in time , if he continues to work toward reconciliation with a true spirit of humility and repentance , " Jenny Sanford said .
The South Carolina governor had not been seen in public since June 18 .
When questioned , Sanford 's staff told media outlets Sanford was hiking on the Appalachian Trail .
But Sanford was spotted Wednesday in Atlanta , Georgia 's Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport .
Sanford said he had been in Buenos Aires .
He said it was his fault for " shrouding this larger trip . "
" I'm a bottom - line kind of guy .
I 'll lay it out , it 's going to hurt , and we 'll let the chips fall as they may , " Sanford told reporters .
View a timeline of the events »
The affair began as a friendship eight years ago , but " over this last year , it developed into something much more than that , " Sanford said .
" All I can say is that I apologize , " he said , adding that he would appreciate a " zone of privacy " for the sake of his family .
Sanford also traveled to Argentina a year ago as part of a South Carolina Commerce Department - funded trip to South America , according to an itinerary of the trip obtained by CNN .
It was unclear if he met with the woman on that trip .
On Wednesday , Sanford said he footed the bill for his most recent trip to Buenos Aires .
The governor said earlier in the day he had traveled to Argentina twice before .
When asked if he is trying to reconcile with his wife , Sanford nodded , " I am , yeah . "
Asked if he and his wife are separated , he said , " I do n't know how you want to define that .
I mean , I 'm here and she 's there .
I guess in a formal sense we 're not , but what we 're trying to do is work through something that we 've been working through for a number of months now . "
However , the statement by Jenny Sanford said the couple was in a " trial separation " after trying to work through the problem in recent months .
" We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eye and maintain my dignity , self - respect , and my basic sense of right and wrong , " she said in the statement .
" I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago .
This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage . "
Jenny Sanford said there was no contact with her husband during the separation , and she did not know he was in Argentina in recent days .
Also Wednesday , The State newspaper of Columbia published e-mails between Sanford and a Buenos Aires resident named " Maria " from July 2008 .
It said the e-mails were acquired in December , and that the governor 's office confirmed their authenticity .
When contacted by CNN , a spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the e-mails .
" You have a particular grace and calm that I adore .
You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty , " Sanford wrote on July 10 , according to the e-mails published on the newspaper 's Web site .
" I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses , or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips , the erotic beauty of you holding yourself ( or two magnificent parts of yourself ) in the faded glow of the night 's light -- but hey , that would be going into sexual details . "
The e-mail continues , " While all the things above are all too true -- at the same time we are in a ... hopelessly impossible situation of love .
...
How in the world this lightening strike snuck up on us I am still not quite sure .
As I have said to you before I certainly had a special feeling about you from the first time we met , but these feelings were contained and I genuinely enjoyed our special friendship and the comparing of all too many personal notes . "
The long - term political fallout for Sanford , 49 , is unclear .
He has been mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , after his current second consecutive term as governor ends .
South Carolina 's constitution forbids a third straight term .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour immediately takes over as head of the Republican Governors Association , CNN has learned .

" The news revealed today hurts all of us who have gotten to know Gov. Sanford over the years and so it is with regret that the RGA accepted Gov. Sanford 's resignation as chairman , " Barbour said in a statement .
" While this news is deeply disappointing , I also know it 's important to remain focused on the future and Gov. Sanford 's resignation allows him and us to do just that . "
Shortly after Sanford 's announcement , Nathan Daschle , executive director of the Democratic Governors Association , issued a statement saying , " Our thoughts and prayers are with Gov. Sanford and his family , and I wish them the best as they try to heal this wound . "

However , the Republican leader in the South Carolina Senate questioned Sanford 's abdication of responsibility for leaving without notice last week .
" I 'm deeply disturbed that no one knew where Gov. Sanford was over the last five days , " state Sen .
Harvey Peeler said in a statement , adding : " We cannot let the governor 's personal life overshadow his public responsibility , or in this case , his negligence of gubernatorial authority . "
South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Karen Floyd pledged " every effort " to ensure that the party maintains the trust of South Carolina 's voters .
" In the hours and days ahead , I will reach out to and work with Republican office - holders , candidates , and activists to regain public confidence and win the next round of elections , " Floyd pledged .
Sanford has had a bruising year , losing his fight to turn down $ 700 million in federal stimulus money .
Sanford initially tried to require that any stimulus money pay down the state debt , a stance rejected by the Obama administration .
The South Carolina 's Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Sanford had to accept the stimulus funds .

Socialist Party of Malaysia : Together we shall restore humanity
May 1 , 2009 , Dataran Seremban , Negri Sembilan -- Socialist Party of Malaysia --
The police warned and stopped us against doing the one procession we planned for this year ’s May Day so we ended up doing three .
Workers came from three fronts to the Dataran Seremban , the venue for this year ’s May Day celebration .
It was the first time that the May Day celebration was done in Negeri Sembilan since the 1st Mei Committee ( May 1st Committee ) started organising May Day in 1994 .
Around 500 people gathered in blazing hot weather today to honour the 123 - year - old workers ' uprising in industrial countries such as Europe and United States .
Many workers and young comrades of all races and political beliefs were brought together .
The by 1st Mei Committee comprised of JERIT ( Oppressed People ’s Network ) , PSM ( Party Socialist Malaysia ) and local organisers from all parties to tell the world , as well as our own Malaysian government , that it is the workers who need to be saved and not their cronies .
The theme of this year ’s May Day was ECONOMY CRISIS : SAVE THE WORKERS , NOT THE CRONIES .
Similar voices were heard all over the world as the class struggle intensifies between the classes -- the capitalist and the workers .
At around 10 am , workers and young people from Perak , Selangor , Johor , Negri Sembilan , Kedah and other places arrived in buses .
The police had a watchful eye as they have given the organisers a permit with the condition that no rallies were allowed .
The groups came from from three directions to the venue in a festive mood with banners , placards , headbands and with many slogans e.g.
“ Implement Minimum Wage Now ' ' , ``We Want Retrenchment Fund ' ' , ``Jobs for All ” , as well as art works and theatre showing exploitation , low wages and the humiliation workers suffer under the capitalist system .
The extreme hot sun did not deter the spirit of the celebration .
PSM leaders comrade Nasir Hashim , Saraswathy , Arutchelvan , Sivarajan and many others were present to give solidarity .
May 1 is the only day that truly recognises the endless contribution of the workers and the organisers have maintained this culture of giving full tribute to workers by giving them the space to voice their views .
At least once a year , we hear the workers talking while the politicians listen .
Today we heard marginalised communities giving speeches -- Comrade Munusamy of the plantation workers ' committee , Comrade Mahendran of the factory workers ' committee , Comrade Teeja from the Orang Asal coalition , Comrade Cheng of the students ' group , Shekiren of the urban settlers ' committee and Lai Ah Lee , a farmer from Kanthan representing the farmers ' group .
They all took turns in highlighting their plight under the current ruling government that has failed to bring genuine development to these people .
And these are the most affected group while the country is undergoing global economic crisis .
Slogans of ``Long live workers ' struggle '' were heard many times in all three main languages -- Malay , Mandarin and Tamil .
The current crisis that has led workers to lose jobs , to pay being cut and big companies being bailed out by the government was illustrated by DEMA , a student group .
Their performance was the climax and with that everyone stood up to read the May Day declaration , which was endorsed by 89 civil society groups and political parties .
The declaration carries 18 demands that touch on workers ' right to minimum wage , a retrenchment fund , job opportunities , land for agriculture , food rations for the poor , the right to form unions , equal rights for migrant workers and so on .
The program came to an end at around 11.30 am with the ``Internationale ' ' led by Comrade Chon Kai of the PSM .
Today is the day of all workers around the world collectively with one voice to oppose the capitalist system and a demand equal share and equal rights .
Together we shall restore humanity !

Socialist Solidarity Greetings on May Day from the Partido Lakas ng Masa ( Power of the Masses Party ) , Philippines
May 1 , 2009 -- Around 10,000 workers and urban poor , members of the mass organisations Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino ( BMP , Socialist Labor Centre ) and Kongresso Pagkakaisa ng Maralitang Lungsod ( KPML , urban poor ) and members of the political party , Partido Lakas ng Masa ( PLM ) , marched in
Manila on May Day under the banner of " Stop Retrenchments !
Decent Work for All ! " and " Capitalism is a Pestilence !
Socialism for Change ! "
Dear Comrades ,
We greet this May Day with the working - class movement around the world facing the challenges of a capitalist system in deep crisis .
The contradictions of the system emerge as wide - open cracks visible to the masses in their day - to - day struggle for survival .
And working people and the poor are heroically struggling in their millions worldwide , against capitalism ’s ``solutions ' ' and for system change -- from the movements for democracy in Thailand and Pakistan , to the workers ' strike movement in France , to the movements for ``Socialism of the 21st Century ' ' in Latin America .
In the Philippines we face a situation where the political , social and economic system of elite rule is in deep crisis .
The current regime of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is one of the most unpopular governments to ever exist , since the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 .
The political institutions in the country are discredited and exposed as being in the pockets of the Arroyo political clan , from the Congress to the Supreme Court to the Electoral Commission .
Despite several attempts to oust the regime , including the development of a mass movement calling for her ouster and a military in mutiny led by junior officers , the regime has managed to cling onto power .
A situation of stalemate now exists .
Meanwhile the global economic crisis has hit the country with force , with a collapse in exports , zero growth forecast for 2009 and a spiralling increase in retrenchments and unemployment .
According to the International Labor Organisation in 2008 some 250,000 workers in plant and machine operation and assembly were retrenched .
If workers in electronics and garment and textiles are included the total number could be well over 300,000 retrenched last year , mostly since October when the economic crisis hit .
Meanwhile thousands of Overseas Filipino Workers are returning home as factories close overseas .
The Department of Labor and Employment figures contradict the independent research data , claiming that only some 40,000 workers were laid - off in 2008 .
This under - representation of the impact of the crisis on unemployment is typical of a long - list of lies peddled by the regime to cover up it ’s incompetent rule and intensified exploitation of the people .
In the 2009 budget , the Philippines government would spend P7391.54 per person for debt servicing while allotting only P2050.98 per person for education , P301.52 for health , P57.48 for housing and P112.80 for social services .
In a crisis situation , when large - scale economic stimulus to boost the national economy through public expenditures and wage increases is required , such a budget represents the continuation of the anti-people neoliberal economic policies that this government and the political establishment of this country is still wedded to .
In 2010 we face a national and presidential election .
The Partido Lakas ng Masa aims to intervene in these elections at all levels : from the presidential , to the Senate , Congress and local councils .
The main purpose of our intervention is to build a mass movement for system change and an end to elite rule .
Today we are actively developing alliances between the left - led basic sectors of the working class ( trade unions , rural workers and the urban poor ) , the middle class and the military rebels , to run an anti-establishment unity ticket , with candidates at all levels .
In the Philippines we call this an anti-trapo ticket and campaign , trapo meaning traditional politician , which in Filipino also means a dirty rag .
As we develop our tactics and strategy we are well aware of the need to draw lessons from the advanced movements for system change and socialism in Latin America , especially Bolivia and the “ Socialism for the Twenty First Century ” movement in Venezuela .
We acknowledge , with deep admiration and respect , that these developments in Latin America would not have been possible without the survival of the Cuban revolution -- a superb and heroic record of fifty years .
Today we live in special times .
As we face the tremendous challenges ahead , at the same time we have a historic opportunity available to this generation , to advance towards a socialist alternative .
This means that we can and must put forward the socialist alternative through concrete demands that the people can understand , while at the same time pointing to the need to struggle for system change .
The challenge is to put forward socialism as a living theory and movement , one not mired in dogma and schemas .
This approach will surely help us build the Socialism of the 21st Century .
Long live May Day !
Mabuhay !
Long live international working - class unity and solidarity !
Mabuhay !
Long live socialism !
Mabuhay sosyalismo !
Sonny Melencio , chairperson , Partido Lakas ng Masa .

Elon Musk says Tesla will be profitable by next month after slashing the costs of Roadster .
In the middle of his long blog post trashing co-founder Martin Eberhard , Musk says Tesla has " brought the Roadster material cost down from $ 140 k to approximately $ 80 k as of this month .
Combined with a steady production volume of 20 to 30 per week in the third quarter this year and a good take up rate of the higher priced Roadster Sport , we expect to cross over into profitability next month . "
Of course , there 's a lot more to a car company than " material costs . "
Tesla has to pay for labor , distribution , overhead , and all the showrooms it plans on rennovating to sell Roadsters .
So , we 're skeptical about Musk 's claim .
UPDATE : Katie Fehrenbacher at Earth2 Tech says she spoke with Tesla and they confirmed that the company wo n't be profitable .

Mark Sanford and Rick Perry host a tele - town hall Thursday that ’s being dubbed “ Tea Party 2.0 . ” | AP photo composite by POLITICO GOP govs plan Tea Party sequel
Hoping to recapture the grassroots energy of last month ’s “ tea parties , ” Republican Govs .
Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Rick Perry of Texas will host a tele - town hall Thursday that ’s being dubbed “ Tea Party 2.0 . ”
The Republican Governors Association said it is expecting 30,000 people to participate in the town hall , which will take place roughly one month after the much - publicized anti-tax tea party rallies held in hundreds of locations across the country on April 15 , the tax filing deadline .

Sanford and Perry will each speak for several minutes before opening up the town hall to up to an hour - long question and answer session .
RGA Executive Director Nick Ayers said that while the effort Thursday will be on a smaller scale than the April tea party rallies , it still represents “ a great opportunity to mobilize that support . ”
Both Perry and Sanford are favorites among the tax - averse tea party attendees .
Sanford , who attended a tea party in Charleston , gained national notice for his high - profile battle with the White House over his resistance to federal stimulus funds designated for his state .
The fate of those funds remains undecided as Sanford continues to battle with state lawmakers over how much of the $ 350 million in funds allocated for South Carolina his state will accept .
Perry spoke at three tea parties across Texas and helped promote the rallies during numerous radio and television interviews prior to the events .
The Texas governor generated widespread publicity after endorsing a state House resolution reaffirming the state ’s sovereignty , a veiled shot at the president ’s stimulus package .
“ I believe that our federal government has become oppressive in its size , its intrusion into the lives of our citizens , and its interference with the affairs of our state , ” Perry said at the time .
Perry drew praise from the conservative media for the move , but was widely derided by the left for suggesting that Texas may consider seceding from the union in protest of the stimulus .
Ayers said both governors “ heard the frustration ” of the tea party attendees and “ understand that our Republican governors are the best positioned to lead on these issues . "
The RGA , Ayers said , is hoping to use the town hall as a springboard for organizing support and fundraising for key gubernatorial races this year in Virginia and New Jersey .
“ We do n’t have to wait until 2010 to send a message to Democrats in Washington that they are spending too much and borrowing too much , ” he said .
“ We ’ll have an opportunity to do that this year . ”

It would seem that George Orwell might have been more prophetic than we perhaps gave him credit for .
Currently , our televisions cannot watch us , but at the rate things are progressing , it is only a matter of time .
After all , most PCs now come with web cams and certainly 90 % of cell phones .
But what is becoming more alarming than the proliferation of closed circuit television cameras is the increasing trend of legalized Internet censorship .
Now you might think I was talking about the crackdowns in China or perhaps North Korea and Iran , and there is no question that these governments , as part of their modus operandi do filter the content of the Internet that is available to their citizens .
In this case , however , I am talking about democratic countries , like Australia , the United Kingdom and the United States of America .
I first started paying attention to this after an episode of Search Engine ( Podcast # 10 , The Great Firewall of Australia ) .
I have blogged about this issue in the United Kingdom and have been following what I thought was a ludicrous attempt by the Commonwealth of Kentucky to seize the domain names of those companies related to on - line gambling .
That was until earlier this week .
Two things caught my attention .
First was a resurgence of an earlier proposal in the UK to collect all emails , very reminiscent of the FBI ’s Carnivore program .
But what really got my attention was a series of letters from the State of Minnesota to ISPs , directing them under law to block access to these sites by customers located within Minnesota .
These sites are systems to be used for the transmission of gambling information ..
Now , I am not a lawyer , but it does not take a lawyer to see that that is a pretty broad catch bucket .
Are we talking about blocking sites to online magazines that tell you where gambling is legal ?
Are we talking about sites that sell poker chips ?
Are we talking about the gaming available on cruises to the Caribbean ?
Clearly the intent is on - line gambling , but that is not what the words say .
The ramification is much broader and has much deeper consequences .
For example , what is to prevent a state from issuing this sort of letter blocking access any other topic that might be illegal in that state ?
I have broached this before when talking about the Pirate Bay decision .
While I can understand the State ’s position , at what point does this become a violation of free speech – at least from the prospective of the Constitution of the United States .
These trends , misguided in my mind , to use technology to prevent access to other technology , never work the way they are intended .
What bothers me more than these letters being issued is that someone thinks these sorts of measures are necessary and right .

Everything must go ... even my Festivus pole ...
I 've had enough ... corporate rat race , high rent , car payments , suicidal traffic ... I want out , and I do n't want to wait until I 'm 65 to retire ( maybe , if all goes ' well ' ) just so I can get on a cruise ship with a bunch of 65 year old retirees ( no offence to any 65 year olds or retirees ) .
So , I'm " thinking outside the box " and selling everything I own ( almost ) , quitting my high paying yet soul destroying job , cashing out my ( meager ) investments and traveling the world now , while I 'm still young enough to enjoy it ... before I bludgeon myself to death with an unresponsive laptop .
I might be out of my mind ( I 'm pretty sure my mom thinks I am ) , but that does n't mean you can't buy my stuff at a super - fantastic price .
Even if you do n't really need a particular item , you can buy it just because you want to help a fellow human escape .
If you 're feeling especially generous , you could even pay more than I 'm asking for something or just donate cash outright .
Either one is okay . :-)
Please email me if you have any questions or to arrange pick up .
If you 'd like to see anything that is n't pictured below , just let me know and I can send you a picture via email .
I have a few more things that I 'll be adding over the next couple of days as well , including my 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid with just over 16 k miles .

You think Minnesota voters have learned a lesson or two ?
In the just - concluded legislative session , Pawlenty also took a hard line that played well with Republicans far beyond Minnesota , vetoing all DFLers ' proposed tax increases and unilaterally cutting parts of the state 's budget to whittle down its gaping deficit .
Political analysts have said a run for a third term could have been risky for Pawlenty if he harbors ambitions beyond Minnesota .
Pointing out that he has never cracked 50 percent of the vote during his two previous runs , they said he could have been vulnerable next year .
And if he lost , it would have effectively ended his presidential ambitions .
In addition , if the state remained mired in economic hard times during that third term , forcing him to make potentially unpopular decisions , it could have diminished his standing among GOP White House hopefuls .
Among other potential candidates are House Minority Leader Marty Seifert , R- Marshall , and Senate Minority Leader Dave Senjem , R-Rochester .
Less well - known potential candidates from the Legislature include Rep. Laura Brod , R - New Prague ; Sen. Geoff Michel , R - Edina , and Sen. David Hann , R - Eden Prairie .
Michel said a " boatload of Republicans " have been waiting for Pawlenty to decide on a third term .
Former House Speaker Steve Sviggum and former state Auditor Pat Anderson also are considered possible candidates , as is GOP activist Brian Sullivan , who ran against Pawlenty for the Republican endorsement in 2002 .
Former U.S. Sen. Rod Grams and U.S. Rep. Mark Kennedy have been mentioned as theoretical possible candidates , as has been current Rep. Michele Bachmann .
Tim Pawlenty is , basically a failed and unpopular governor who acknowledged just last week on Minnesota Public Radio that he knew seeking a third term would be an uphill battle .
Today he announced he 'll spend his energy on something less daunting .
While we can be sure it wo n't be trying to govern Minnesota , it 's likely that he 'll throw his hat into the clown 's ring of Republicans wanting to take on Barack Obama in 2012 .
( Although a friend mentioned he could also be thinking of challenging Al Franken for the Minnesota Senate seat in 2014 , accusing him of being an absentee senator who missed a ton of votes and was n't there for Minnesotans . )
And speaking of Franken , many folks are speculating that Pawlenty 's announcement is proof that he will refuse to sign the election certification no matter what the Minnesota Supremem Court rules -- and despite the fact that 63 % of Minnesotans want Franken seated now .
Instead he will play up to right - wing zealots and obstructionists in Texas , Alabama and Georgia who want him to tough it out and not allow the Democrats that 60th seat .
Earlier today , when the rumors about his decision were starting to circulate , thereported that Pawlenty had already told GOP legislative leaders he was n't going to seek re-election .
Nationally , the GOP is in such dire straits that even a complete nothing like Pawlenty has as good a shot at any of the other kooks and loons vying for the worthless presidnetial nomination .
Ben Smith atpointed out that if Pawlenty is serious about running for president or -- more likely -- vice president , this announcement " rees him from the strictures of tough Minnesota campaign finance laws , which made presidential fundraising tough .
" Today 's goes through all the garbage likely to look at jumping into the Minnesota gubernatorial race .
They suggest Coleman might run and claim he's " the state 's most prominent Republican . "

Supporters of defeated opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi demonstrate in Tehran on Monday in protest of the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
TEHRAN , Iran ( AP ) 
Thousands of Iranians swarmed the streets of Tehran on Tuesday in rival demonstrations over the country 's disputed presidential election , pushing a deep crisis into its fourth day despite a government attempt to placate the opposition by recounting a limited number of ballots .
Iran 's supreme ruler drew a firm line against any threats to the regime , warning Iranians to unite behind the country 's Islamic system as authorities imposed severe restrictions on independent media .
After days of dramatic images of Iranians protesting the declaration of victory for hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the government said employees of foreign media could only cover events authorized and announced by the government .
PHOTO GALLERY : Mousavi supporters protest , claim election fraud ELECTION : For U.S. , ' doubts ' linger as Iran roils Q&A : Iran election was called before tally was finished Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made an extraordinary appeal in response to tensions over the disputed election , which has presented one of the gravest threats to Iran 's complex blend of democracy and religious authority since the system emerged from the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
" In the elections , voters had different tendencies , but they equally believe in the ruling system and support the Islamic Republic , " Khamenei said at a meeting with representatives of the four presidential candidates .
" Nobody should take any action that would create tension , and all have to explicitly say they are against tension and riots . "
A day after a massive opposition rally that ended in deadly clashes with pro-government militiamen , Iran 's main electoral authority said it was prepared to conduct a limited recount of ballots at sites where candidates claim irregularities took place .
Opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi has called the election an " astonishing charade , " demanding it be canceled and held again .
His representative , cleric Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour , reiterated that demand Tuesday after a meeting of the Guardian Council , calling along with representatives of two other candidates for an independent investigation of voting irregularities .
The Guardian Council is an unelected body of 12 clerics and Islamic law experts close to the supreme leader and seen as supportive of Ahmadinejad .
Mousavi said Monday that he believes the council is not neutral and has already indicated support for Ahmadinejad .
" If the whole people become aware , avoid violent measures and continue their civil confrontation with that , they will win .
No power can stand up to people 's will , " Mohtashamipour said .
" I do not think that the Guardian Council will have the courage to stand against people . "
A spokesman for the Guardian Council , Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei , did not rule out the possibility of canceling the results , saying that is within the council 's powers , although nullifying an election would be an unprecedented step .
In the afternoon , the government organized a large rally in Tehran , as if to demonstrate it also can bring people into the streets .
Thousands waved Iranian flags and pictures of the supreme leader , thrusting their fists into the air and cheering as speakers denounced " rioters " and urged Iranians to accept the results showing Ahmadinejad was re-elected in a landslide Friday .
" This nation will protect and defend its revolution in any way , " Gholam Ali Haddad Adel , a prominent lawmaker and Ahmadinejad supporter , told the pro-government crowd in Vali Asr Square .
He called on Mousavi 's supporters to accept the results and press their complaints through legal means .
" After all , in all elections there will be losers and winners , naturally , " he said .
" This should not cause a rift between the people . "
The appeal for unity failed to calm passions , and a large column of Mousavi supporters — some of them with green headbands and their faces masked against tear gas or to hide their identities — marched peacefully along a central avenue in north Tehran , according to amateur video .
A witness told the Associated Press that the pro-Mousavi rally stretched more than a mile along Vali Asr avenue , from Vanak Square to the headquarters of Iranian state television .
Security forces did not interfere , the witness said , and the protest lasted from about 5 p.m. to 8 p.m .
Other witnesses told the AP that about 100 people continued the protest in front of state TV past 9:45 p.m .
The witness spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal .
Mousavi appeared to be trying to harness the days of street rage into a more carefully directed campaign of civil disobedience .
In a message on his website , he said he would not attend Tuesday 's demonstration and urged his supporters not to resort to violence .
The website said Mousavi and his supporters planned another large demonstration along the path of Monday 's massive protest , for Wednesday afternoon .
It said they have asked the Interior Ministry for permission but did n't say whether they got a response or if they would go ahead if rejected .
Ahmadinejad , who has dismissed the unrest as little more than " passions after a soccer match , " attended a summit meeting in Russia that was delayed a day by the unrest in Tehran .
That allowed him to project an image as Iran 's rightful president , welcomed by other world leaders .
In Washington , President Obama expressed " deep concerns " about the legitimacy of the election and post-voting crackdowns but declined to term Ahmadinejad 's re-election a fraud .
" I do believe that something has happened in Iran , " with Iranians more willing to question the government 's " antagonistic postures " toward the world , Obama said .
" There are people who want to see greater openness , greater debate , greater democracy . "
After images were shown around the world of Monday 's mass protests and violence , authorities said foreign media , including Iranian employees , could only work from their offices , conduct telephone interviews and monitor official sources such as state television .
The rules prevent news outlets , including the Associated Press , from sending independent photos or video of street protests or rallies .
Also Tuesday , foreign reporters in Iran to cover last week 's elections began leaving the country .
Iranian officials said they will not extend their visas .
At least 10 Iranian journalists have been arrested since the election , " and we are very worried about them , we do n't know where they have been detained , " Jean - Francois Julliard , secretary general of Reporters Without Borders told AP Television News in Paris .
He added that some people who took pictures with cellphones also were arrested .
A website run by former vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi said the oppositionist had been arrested .
Saeed Hajjarian , a prominent oppositionist , also has been detained , Hajjarian 's wife , Vajiheh Masousi , told the AP .
Hajjarian is a close aide of former president Mohammad Khatami .
Iranian state radio said seven people were killed in Monday 's protests — the first confirmation of deaths from the demonstrations that started Saturday after the election results were announced .
It said people were killed during an " unauthorized gathering " at a mass rally after protesters " tried to attack a military location . "

The newly discovered asteroid 2009 HC82 travels on an orbit that is tilted by 155° with respect to the orbital plane of the planets , which means it travels in the opposite direction ( Illustration : NASA / JPL )
Updated at 1820 GMT on Monday
The discovery of a 2 - to 3 - kilometre - wide asteroid in an orbit that goes backwards has set astronomers scratching their heads .
It comes closer to Earth than any other object in a ‘ retrograde ’ orbit , and astronomers think they should have spotted it before .
The object , called 2009 HC82 , was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona on the morning of 29 April .
From observations of its position by five different groups , Sonia Keys of the International Astronomical Union ’s Minor Planet Center initially calculated it orbits the sun every 3.39 years .
New observations suggest it travels on a path that ventures within 15 million km of the Earth ’s orbit .

What ’s really unusual is that the calculated orbit is inclined 155° to the plane of the Earth ’s orbit .
That means that as it orbits the Sun , it actually travels backwards compared to the planets .
It is only the 20th asteroid known in a retrograde orbit , a very rare group .
None of the others comes as close to the Earth .
‘ Missed it ’
Comets , which originate on the outer fringes of the solar system , are much more likely to have retrograde orbits than asteroids .
In part , this is because passing stars or planets can kick them out of their original orbits and onto unusual paths , bringing them into the inner solar system , where we tend to see them .
Some retrograde asteroids may in fact be burnt - out comets , says Brian Marsden of the Minor Planet Center .
The size and shape of the new asteroid ’s orbit “ is very like Encke ’s comet except for inclination , ” he told New Scientist , although it shows no sign of a cometary tail .
The asteroid is now far beyond Mars , but its orbit periodically brings it fairly close to Earth .
“ It should have been easily observable in 2000 , ” says Marsden .
“ I ’m puzzled by the fact that we have n’t seen it before , because it should have been moderately bright on several occasions .
We just missed it . ”
The tree ’s branches are real but only there to support the leaves .
The sizzle is enticing but the steak is why you sit down .
The eye candy is cool , but the Web is really about words , and mostly written words at that .
The Net is richer and richer year by year , more stuff and more kinds of stuff and more channels it flows on .
And then the apparatus around the stuff , the aggregators and recombinators and crawlers and widgets .
I watch all this churn and I still think it ’s the endless stream of characters across the world ’s billions of screens that are the payload .
Consider , for example , from last month , Rob Scoble ’s Exploring the 2010 Web .
He ’s got some thoughtful things to say on the Web and how to use it .
Now cast your eyes to the right of the page .
I see the usual clutter of blog apparatus ; an opaque grid of little “ subscribe to me ” glyphs , some FriendFeed flow - of - the - moment , a few unexplained faces labeled “ Members ( 949 ) ” , then we ’re into the Facebook crud , a map , and some trailing links that really should be above the fold .
Just distractions ; none of it remotely as interesting as what he ’s got to say in the main stream of text .
It turns out that the first time I read the piece , I guess Scoble was in the middle of that WordPress rejiggering , and there was no apparatus down the right at all ; just the headline and the stream of link - rich , thought - rich , text .
I really liked it .
I was seeing , I thought , the core message getting the focus and respect it deserved , that ’s all .
I am arguing that :
Words are more valuable than pictures .
Text is more valuable than audio or video .
Twitter is more valuable than FriendFeed .
At the end of the day , how could this not be true ?
Social networking gives me the warm - and - fuzzies and YouTube shows me what happened today in Iran , but action only comes from understanding and understanding only comes from explanation and explanation only happens in words .
It ’s profoundly important , as Clay Shirky argues , that now we can all tell each other our own stories about ourselves and talk together about the big stories that everyone ’s hearing .
But that ’s all words , just words .
And by the way , I ’d rather have the text of Clay ’s speech than the video .
For things that matter , written words are unambiguously better than speech .
To start with , anything that matters is n’t just written , it ’s usually rewritten repeatedly ( and more important , condensed ) .
Plus , it has hyperlinks .
Plus , it ’s smaller and cheaper to ship around .
Plus , it ’s searchable .
Plus , it works on more devices .
( I acknowledge that only the first of these is fundamental ; but that alone would be enough ) .
Thus , the fact that plain ol ’ blogging and shiny new Twitter are still pretty well at the center of the value proposition of the serious part of the Net .
Blogging has mostly seen off podcasting , and Twitter sailed smoothly away from its richer multimedia - enriched competitors .
What matters is getting the right words , undiluted , in front of the right people .
That ’s what the Internet is for .
Everything else is ( at best ) the icing on the cake .
But the book 's authors believe that detailed contemporaneous notes of Soviet intelligence documents provide the solid proof that MI5 never found .
The notes were compiled by Mr Vassiliev , who was invited to inspect KGB files shortly after the Soviet Union 's collapse , when the intelligence service felt under pressure to prove that it had scored major coups .
Mr Vassiliev then smuggled his notes to the USA in 2001 , since when he and fellow researchers have conducted detailed cross-checks which they claim leaves no doubt as to who Eric really was .
This morning , Obama made a huge pledge to focus more money on scientific research — more than the US spent during the space race .
In fact , it 's almost as much as we spend on defense .
I believe it is not in our American character to follow — but to lead .
And it is time for us to lead once again .
I am here today to set this goal : we will devote more than three percent of our GDP to research and development ...
This represents the largest commitment to scientific research and innovation in American history .

Obama plans to funnel money into new initiatives such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy ( ARPA -E ) , which is to be a cousin of DARPA , the agency that had a large hand in the development of the internet .
The bottom line is that if you 're a fan of new technologies being developed on US soil , you should be pretty damned excited .

OTTAWA – The federal information watchdog has made a surprise decision to retire after serving less than half the usual seven - year term .
But Robert Marleau , who has openly chided the government for being too secretive , denied yesterday he was quitting as ombudsman for Canada 's freedom - of - information law out of frustration .
He also dismissed any suggestion he was pushed out , saying he 's simply ready to leave to spend more time with family .
Marleau , 61 , who took office in January 2007 , worked for the House of Commons for 31 years .
As commissioner , he quickly set about hiring new senior staff , revamping the way complaints are investigated and seeking more money to do the job .
He said in an interview that the position would now involve more lobbying to boost access to information .
He decided that was a task best left to his successor .
The Access to Information
Act allows people who pay $ 5 to request an array of federal files .
The commissioner serves as an arbiter for users by probing complaints .
Last February , Marleau released a highly critical set of report cards on the performance of federal departments and agencies and blamed failure of leadership " at the highest levels " for denying Canadians information about government .
Had Barack Obama merely addressed the question of marijuana legalization with his trademark gravitas at the Open For Questions forum , the sane among us would likely have just grumbled and sighed , disappointed but not horrified .
But Obama ’s answer to the question was mired in the same outdated War on Drugs mentality that frames this issue as a Footloose - style quarrel between stoners and respectable citizens :
There was one question that voted on that ranked fairly high and that was whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy [ audible snickering ] and job creation .
And , uh , [ Obama snickers ]
I do n't know what this says about the online audience , [ audience and Obama laugh ] but ... this was a fairly popular question .
We want to make sure it 's answered .
The answer is no , I do n't think that 's a good strategy [ laughing and clapping ] to grow our economy .
Politically , this is a staggering miscalculation by the typically savvy Obama ; why on earth would you laugh at “ the online audience ” during the first online town hall meeting in presidential history ?
Have you forgotten who helped get you elected in the first place ?
And is n’t this the candidate who finally moved us beyond the ridiculous Clinton - era tap dance around this issue , stating in the debates , “ I inhaled frequently … that was the point ” ?
As policy , however , this answer is outrageous .
The justifications for legalizing pot are many and varied , from the unbelievable stress that the drug war places on our criminal justice and law enforcement systems to the fact that such policy has done nothing to curb marijuana use over the last decade ; more people are going to jail for nonviolent crimes , while production of opium and cannabis have both doubled and the society - wide rate of use has remained at 1998 levels .
But more importantly , the economic crisis and the recent escalation of gang violence in Mexico have punctured whatever puritanical groupthink bubble remains in place to prevent this legislation from changing .
We literally can’t afford to waste money and resources fighting this worthless battle anymore .
Obama ’s tone - deaf response came within 24 hours of Hillary Clinton ’s statement from Mexico that “ Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade . ”
Thousands of people have died in Mexico City as President Felipe Calderon tries to quell gang violence there ; meanwhile , the U.S. has spent about $ 40 million annually over the last 10 years in its completely unsuccessful attempt to quash American usage .
One would think — apparently even a Clinton would think — that the proper response would be to stop fighting a financially wasteful war against a phantom problem and instead find ways to separate American drug usage from the gang culture that currently and necessarily controls supply .
This is no different from the agreed - upon need to free ourselves from reliance on foreign energy sources , and , as shown in Mexico , the security issues are equivalent —
Obama will soon spend $ 725 million to bolster border security in response to the violence .
Even more egregiously , Obama laughingly dismissed what would be an instant revenue booster , at a time when the president should be willing to entertain any possible help in that area .
A bill proposed by California state representative Tom Ammiano would legalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana for residents 21 and over , reaping an estimated $ 13 billion in the process .
Not every state has the marijuana industry that California does , but imagine if even a fraction of such growth were to reach the other 49 .
Obviously , Obama should feel free to defend a continued anti-drug policy if he sees fit .
But laughing at the issue and rejecting legalization as he would a child ’s request for more ice cream is n’t just bad politicking , it ’s an indefensibly glib treatment of an issue that is literally a life - and - death matter .
The cry for legalization has extended well beyond the pot -smoking community , and is no longer just a matter of users wishing to be left alone .
( It would be a legitimate debate even if that were still the case , of course , but a little agreement from the square community only helps the cause . )
For a great number of establishment writers and thinkers , this is no longer an outré issue of Prohibition - era “ morality ” versus societal degradation .
Unless you ’re Obama , apparently , who will likely turn out to be “ on the wrong side of history ” as the consequences of current American drug policy grow more costly and dangerous .
Cardinal
Re said the attack on Brazil 's Catholic Church was unjustified A senior Vatican cleric has defended the excommunication in Brazil of the mother and doctors of a young girl who had an abortion with their help .
The nine - year - old had conceived twins after alleged abuse by her stepfather .
Cardinal Giovanni Battista
Re told Italian paper La Stampa that the twins " had the right to live " and attacks on Brazil 's Catholic Church were unfair .
It comes a day after Brazil 's president criticised the Brazilian archbishop who excommunicated the people involved .
Brazil only permits abortions in cases of rape or health risks to the mother .
Doctors said the girl 's case met both these conditions , but the Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Jose Cardoso Sobrinho said the law of God was above any human law .
He said the excommunication would apply to the child 's mother and the doctors , but not to the girl because of her age .
' Sad case ' Cardinal Re , who heads the Roman Catholic Church 's Congregation for Bishops and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America , told La Stampa that the archbishop had been right to excommunicate the mother and doctors .
Life must always be protected , the attack on the Brazilian Church is unjustified
Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re
" It is a sad case but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons , who had the right to live and could not be eliminated , " he said .
" Life must always be protected , the attack on the Brazilian Church is unjustified . "
The abortion was carried out on Wednesday .
Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , himself a Catholic , said on Friday that he regretted what he described as the cleric 's deeply conservative attitude .
" The doctors did what had to be done : save the life of a girl of nine years old , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The fact that she was four months pregnant with twins was only discovered after she was taken to hospital in Pernambuco complaining of stomach pains .
Her stepfather was arrested last week , allegedly as he tried to escape to another region of the country .
He is also suspected of abusing the girl 's physically handicapped 14 - year - old sister .

The first quarter of the current financial year was quite shattering for many automakers and most of them had to face untoward financial troubles under the shadows of deepening recession and slow down in sales .
The Detroit - based GM have been looking towards the US Government for a bailout to avoid a possible bankruptcy and this is because of these very fears and slowdown in worldwide sales that the giant automaker had to undergo $ 6 billion loss in the first quarter of the current financial year .
The company ’s revenue cut nearly 50 % as most of the buyers had shown concerned that the company would soon announced a bankruptcy and would n’t be able to honor its various warranties .
According to GM , it has spent nearly 10 b more cash than it got in the month of January and March and it was the basic reason behind this considerable drop in the company ’s revenue .
Ray Young , GM Chief Financial Officer , says in this connection : “ Most of our consumers seemed quite scared due to bankruptcy fears and this kept them away from buying our vehicles .
These concerns deeply impact our sales and we had to bear $ 6 b loss in the first quarter of the current financial year . ”
The US government has issued a June 1 deadline to GM to complete its restructuring plan or get into bankruptcy protection .
“ The Obama administration did n’t reveal a US Govt. guarantee of Chrysler and GM warranties by the end of March , ” Young added .

In which the president discovers an American intelligence agency at Five Guys
On his trip to get a burger with Brian Williams at Five Guys this afternoon , the president appears to have learned of the existence of a Defense Department intelligence arm , the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency , from an agency employee also at the burger restaurant .
" So explain to me exactly what this National Geospatial ... "
Obama said , after the worker mentioned his employer , according to a video of the event .
" We work with , uh , satellite imagery , " the worker , Walter replied .
A POLITICO reader caught the exchange , which starts around 5:45 on this C - SPAN video .
The transcript :
Obama :
What do you do Walter ?
Walter : I work at , uh , NGA , National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency
Obama : Outstanding , how long you been doing that ?
Walter : About six years
Obama : Yea ?
Walter : Yes .
Obama :
You like it ?
Walter : I do , keeps me ...
Obama :
So explain to me exactly what this National Geospatial ...uh ...
Walter : Uh , we work with , uh , satellite imagery ..
Obama : Right
Walter : [ unintelligible ] ... support systems , so ...
Obama : Sounds like good work .
Walter : Enjoy the weekend .
Obama : Appreciate it .
According to the Defense Department :
The National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) is a Department of Defense combat support agency and a member of the national Intelligence Community ( IC ) .
NGA develops imagery and map - based intelligence solutions for U.S. national defense , homeland security and safety of navigation .
NGA provides timely , relevant and accurate geospatial intelligence in support of national security objectives .
The term " geospatial intelligence " means the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe , assess and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth .
Geospatial intelligence consists of imagery , imagery intelligence and geospatial ( e.g. , mapping , charting and geodesy ) information .

June 22 , 2009  --
When Mikhail Mazo of Buffalo Grove , Ill. , came home last week , he discovered an uneven but fresh trim of his backyard .
Not only did Mazo not want his lawn cut , but now he will be billed $ 125 for the unsolicited cut , he said .
Apparently , mowing the lawn is n't just a job for neighborhood kids anymore .
Mazo was caught up in a recession - related trend that usually involves properties that -- unlike Mazo 's home -- are still in foreclosure or are bank - owned .
As many towns face an increase in foreclosed or abandoned homes , local governments are taking action to maintain overgrown green -- and charging property owners dearly to do so .
" I was outraged by the way they did it , " Mazo said .
" In my opinion , I have the right to the quiet enjoyment associated with the ownership of my property . "
Buffalo Grove officials notified Mazo , 52 , in the beginning of June that the grass on his property violated height restrictions .
Mazo , who bought the house in November through a bank foreclosure process , cut the grass in his front lawn , but left alone the grass in his fenced backyard .
Although a village official said private residents are given time to comply , Mazo plans to contest the fee .
" We never like to get to that point , " said Ghida Neukirch , Buffalo Grove 's deputy village manager .
The problem of unwanted weeds has been exacerbated by the number of homes left uncared for as a result of foreclosure – a trend that is not unique to Buffalo Grove .
" We have a difficult time tracking down the ownership of an abandoned property , " Neukirch said .
" We 've got the renter 's name , then the renter leaves .
We 're looking at a registration program that will help our efforts a little . "
In neighboring Northbrook , Ill. , village officials will send its own workforce to mow overgrown lawns after multiple notifications -- at the homeowner 's expense .
The cost : typically $ 136 an hour , said Kelly Hamill , Northbook 's assistant director of public works .
In just the last month , the village has already mowed the lawns of 13 homes , a high figure that Hamill attributes to the number of foreclosures in the area .
Nationwide , the housing crisis may be far from over — in May , the number of homes filed for foreclosure was up 18 percent from the previous year , according to RealtyTrac .
" The city certainly does not want to be in the lawn mowing business , " said Greg Hawk , a Canton , Ohio , city councilman .
" It 's the responsibility of the property owner or holder of the mortgage to maintain the lawn . "
Hawk said grass cutting may be " the last thing we want to do , " but that 's exactly what Canton spent a quarter - of - a- million dollars doing last year .
In June , the town passed an ordinance to fine property holders liable for maintaining lawns up to $ 250 if the grass is not cut .
On mowed properties , the bill includes fees to cover the cost of city labor to groom the green .
Most of the time , homeowners are long gone and the bills end up going to the bank .
" Since we passed the ordinance , we 've gotten a lot more cooperation from banks and lending institutions mowing at their expense as opposed to us billing them , " Hawk said .
" If you do n't remind the lending institution or holder of the property of their responsibility , they tend to ignore it if there 's no penalty and no incentive for them . "
Banks , however , can't do work on the property until it has been vacated by residents .
" There is often a very protracted process before we have the authority and ability to access the property , " said Mark Rodgers , vice president of public affairs at Citigroup , one of the nation 's largest mortgage holders .
" As a result , the property may have sustained significant deterioration or damage before and during that process .
Once we are in control of the premises , we move quickly to address repairs and maintenance issues in order to market the property quickly and obtain the best sale price . "
As the owner of Cut - All Weed Mowing , Troy Grandt has contracts with three municipalities in the Chicago area to cut the grass of private homes when the property owner fails to do so .
He does n't know ahead of time which homes have been foreclosed on , but he said it 's not uncommon , especially this year , to arrive at a lot with grass between two and four feet tall , sometimes even higher .
" It 's a jungle out there , " said Glen Kelman , the president and CEO of RedFin , an online brokerage site for buying and selling homes .
" There 's all sorts of land in disrepair and spores from weeds blown over -- people get huffy about it . "
There 's a list of other consequences that come with an unruly lawn -- possible mosquito infestation , health and fire hazards , tired eyes .
" We do n't go by the number of inches or feet ; if it appears to be an eyesore , we 're going to take action on it , " said Leslie Milks , the code enforcement manager in Escondido , Calif .
California has the second highest foreclosure rate in the country , with one in every 144 homes in the state receiving a foreclosure notice .
The maintenance of foreclosed properties is a priority for Escondido officials , Milks said , adding that the city also looks out for houses with broken windows or graffiti .
" We 're pro-active with that , and we attempt to identify any foreclosed properties in need of repair and get in touch with the bank or any property management right away , " she said .
Many banks and lending institutions have established divisions dedicated to the maintenance of foreclosed properties , Milks said .
But curb appeal matters not only to banks , but to neighbors , realtors and house hunters as well .
" It 's the broken window theory -- if something 's not taken care of immediately , it will continue to add to further decay and can lead to other issues in the neighborhood , " Milks said .
Local governments , however , do n't have the resources to cover everything , Kelman said .
" What you 're seeing is a degradation of the civic environment -- there just ai n't no money , " he said .
The looming housing crisis must also deal with the declining quality of homes , Kelman said .
" The lawn is just a prelude to the house itself , " he said .
" Five seconds within walking in the door , you already have an image of the property .
If you have to hack your way to the door , then you 're not going to be in a good frame of mind when you turn in the key . "
ThoughtWorks , my employer , is primarily a software delivery company .
We build software for people , including products built for ourselves .
An important part of our philosophy is an openness to to different development platforms , so we can choose the appropriate platform for our widely varying clients .
When I joined ThoughtWorks in 2000 , Java was our overwhelmingly major platform .
Shortly afterwords we started working with .NET and these two platforms dominated our work by the middle of the decade .
A few people , however , had started experimenting with LAMP scripting languages , in particular Ruby .
The appearance of the Ruby on Rails web framework gave Ruby a big push , enough that in 2006 , we started doing some serious project work with the Ruby platform .
As I write this in 2009 , the Ruby platform has a firm share of our work , not as high as Java and C# , but a significant portion .
During these three years we 've learned a lot about Ruby in practice .
As 2009 began , I was asked to give a talk on our experiences with Ruby for the QCon conference .
To prepare for this I conducted an extensive survey of our Ruby projects and probed our Ruby leaders for their thoughts and experiences .
It 's taken me a bit longer than I 'd like to produce this article as well , but here it is .
I 've divided the article into three parts .
To start with I 'll look at the profile of our Ruby project experience , to give you a sense of what kinds of projects we 've been tackling over the years .
Next I 'll move onto several common questions about Ruby and how our experiences answer these questions .
Finally I 'll launch into some lessons we 've learned from using Ruby .
Ruby also fits in with our preference for using agile software development processes .
The agile philosophy is one of rapid feedback by building software and reviewing it regularly with the customer .
The more productive an development environment , the more frequently you can review progress , and the better the agile " inspect and adapt " process works .
Our experience selling Ruby work is that using a dynamic language like Ruby fits in well with our overall appeal .
Our strength is that we hire highly talented people who are difficult to attract to the typical IT organization .
Ruby has a philosophy of an environment that gives a talented developer more leverage , rather than trying to protect a less talented developer from errors .
An environment like Ruby thus gives our developers more ability to produce their true value .
The country split shows that the US has seen the biggest interest in Ruby work .
India has also seen a fair amount - indeed our first Ruby project was run out of Bangalore .
The UK has seen less uptake .
This probably reflects the fact that our early Ruby advocates were mostly US based and there was considerable skepticism to Ruby in the UK .
The level of involvement from India is encouraging , traditionally India is seen as a laggard in using new technologies but we seem to be doing a reasonable job of making our Indian offices be rather different .
Figure 3 looks at the projects by host country .
It 's somewhat rough and ready , as I have n't tried to properly deal with the few multi-site projects or projects that have moved ( Mingle , for example , I classed as a China although it 's history is more varied . )
Figure 2 looks at the shape a different way , looking at the effort involved in the various projects we 've been involved in for each year .
Each dot on the strip chart represents total effort ( all people ) in one project during that year .
This chart provides a good feel for how much increase we 've seen in ruby projects over the last three years .
The third project I 've called out here is Mingle , which is a particularly interesting case as it's a product from ThoughtWorks Studios - and as such we can be more public about it than we can about projects done for clients .
It 's been a long running project and also an international project : starting in Australia , moving to Beijing , and now multi-sited in Beijing and San Francisco .
There are a few projects that stand out .
By far our largest project is the one that I 'll refer to as the Atlanta project , with a peak headcount of over 40 people involved .
Another large and long running project is the Jersey project .
These two are related in that there 's been a good bit of rotation between the two , so many of our more experienced Ruby people have been on both projects .
Ruby projects are generally seen as shorter and smaller than other projects .
Sadly I do n't have comparative data for our projects on other platforms to get a better feel on whether this is true .
Certainly we can see that most projects involve less than 20 people for less than a year .
Figure 1 gives a feel for the size of the projects we 've been involved in .
The headcount here is the peak headcount of everyone involved ( ThoughtWorks , client and others ; developers , project managers , analysts etc ) .
The length is the duration that we 've been involved in the project .
During 2006 - 8 , ThoughtWorks has been involved in some 41 Ruby projects .
I define a Ruby project as a project where Ruby was the primary development language .
Ruby has appeared on other projects too , there 's a lot of recent developments using ruby for build automation or functional testing for Java projects .
Almost all these projects have involved Rails , and most of them are web site projects where Rails is at least as important as Ruby .
Questions About Ruby
Was Ruby the Right Choice ?
When looking back on our 41 projects , perhaps the most important question to ask is whether the Ruby platform was the correct choice .
One way to approach that question is to ask technical leads on the project whether , in hindsight , they think the choice was correct .
Figure 4 : Was Ruby the correct choice of platform for this project ?
As Figure 4 indicates , the vote was a very positive 36 to 5 support of the choice .
As a group our technical leads are usually not shy of indicating if they are unhappy with a technological choice .
So I see this as a firm statement of the viability of the Ruby platform as a reasonable choice .
I dug a little more into the five regretful projects .
The first thing that stood out was that in four of the five cases , the leads felt that using Ruby was n't a worse choice than the alternatives .
Ruby 's relative unusualness means that we feel that using Ruby has to come with a benefit over alternatives , if Ruby is the same as a more widely used option , then it is n't worth introducing the unusual technology .
Four of the five also reported problems due to integration with other technologies that Ruby is n't as well suited for .
.NET tools tend to integrate better with .NET technologies , for example .
Another theme that two of the projects reported was social issues - that people in the client organization were opposed to Ruby or other dynamic languages .
The one worse - off project showed these social problems - an IT organization that resisted Ruby tooth and nail ( the business sponsor in this case was a Ruby fan ) .
Indeed when I asked further about red flags for using Ruby in software project , the only clear answer was around social issues .
Ruby was generally accepted or encouraged for our software development work , but the biggest sign to avoid it was a social resistance from the client .
Is Ruby More Productive ?
When people are asked about why Ruby should be used on a project , the most common answer is for increased productivity .
One early indicator was an assessment of a project that suggested that Ruby would have yielded an order of magnitude improvement in productivity .
As a result it seemed obvious to survey the project technical leads and ask them about productivity - had ruby increased productivity and if so , by how much .
I asked them to compare this to a mainstream ( Java or . NET ) project done in the most productive way they knew how .
Figure 5 : How much did Ruby improve productivity for this project ?
( Compared to the best mainstream tools you know . )
You should take these result with some salt .
After all there is no way we can objectively measure software productivity .
These are just the subjective , qualitative assessments from the technical lead of each project .
( I did n't get a response from all projects . )
However they are still suggestive that there 's a real productivity boost going on .
This suggestion is further reinforced by staffing considerations .
Scott Conley , who manages our Atlanta office , reports that once a ruby project has got going , he expects them to need 50 % more people whose focus is on requirements preparation than would be expected for other technologies .
One thing we have seen is that you should n't expect these productivity increases to turn up right away .
I 've heard several times that people were alarmed in early weeks about the slow progress of a new Ruby team - a consequence of what I call the Improvement Ravine .
It does take time for a Ruby team to get the hang of how the platform works and during that time they 'll be slower than you expect .
The improvement ravine is a common phenomenon and a usual palliative is to ensure there are some experienced people on the team .
Our history , however , is that the most important experience here is that of dynamic languages that support the kinds of meta- programming features that Ruby does , rather than specifically Ruby experience .
As Scott Conley puts it : the difference is between efficiency risk and delivery risk .
A team with dynamic language experience but little Ruby experience will be slower initially ( efficiency risk ) but a team without any dynamic language experience can produce a knotty code base that could risk the overall delivery .
Is Ruby Slow ?
In a word " yes " .
Search around for benchmarks on the net and you 'll find numerous surveys that show that , even by the standards of scripting languages , Ruby is a tortoise .
On the whole , however , this has been irrelevant to us .
Most of our uses of Ruby are in building database backed websites .
I 've visited many projects over the decades like this , using Ruby and other technologies , nearly every project has spent time working on performance issues and in almost every case those performance issues are database access .
People spend time tuning SQL not tuning their processing code .
So since most applications are I/O bound , the use of a slow language for processing does n't make any appreciable impact to the overall performance of a system .
You 'll notice I 've used the usual pundit weasel words in the above paragraph .
Although almost every project is I / O bound , you do run into the occasional exception - and an interesting one is Mingle .
Mingle is unusual in many ways .
It 's very dynamic display means it can't use any page caching to improve performance , which immediately makes it unlike most web applications .
As a result it is n't I/ O bound and for good performance needs more hardware than many people expect ( a four core box with 2 GB of memory to support a 20 - 40 person team ) .
But the Mingle team still feel they made the right choice in using Ruby .
The Mingle team has built many features very quickly and they feel the productivity boost they got from Ruby is worth the higher hardware demands on the final product .
As with so many things , this is a hardware versus productivity trade - off - one of the oldest trade - offs in computing .
Each team needs to think about which matters .
The good news here is that Mingle has good horizontal scalability ( throw more processors at it and you get proportionally good performance ) .
Hardware scalability is often the most valuable thing you can have in these situations as hardware costs keep declining .
I should re-emphasize .
For most projects
Ruby 's speed has been irrelevant as almost all of them are I /O bound .
Mingle is an exception , not the common case .
Is a Ruby Code - base Hard to Understand ?
A concern we frequently hear about Ruby is that its dynamic typing , support for meta - programming , and lack of tools makes it liable to leave a code base that 's difficult to follow .
In general this has n't turned out to be a issue in practice for us .
The story I hear is that the fact that you can write much less code for the same functionality means that it 's easier to keep the code clean than it is for mainstream languages .
That said , it 's important to remember our context .
ThoughtWorks developers tend to be far above average in terms of ability and also very keen on highly disciplined approaches , such as Extreme Programming .
We place a high value on testing ( something that 's true of the Ruby community generally ) and these tests do much to keep the code base clear .
So I can't say whether our experiences will carry over to less able and disciplined developers .
( Even the tooling and relative control of other languages does n't stop us from seeing some pretty horrible code , so it 's open to question whether a poor Ruby code base would be that much worse . )
We have seen a common sequence of attitudes to meta-programming .
Figure 6 : Progression of feelings about meta- programming Scary and Bad : People are wary of meta - programming and do n't use it much
Scary and Good : people begin to see the value of meta - programming but are still uncomfortable with using it .
Easy and Good : as people get comfortable they begin to use it too much , which can complicate the code - base .
Easy and Bad : people are wary of meta - programming and realize that it 's very useful in small doses .
In the end the analogy I like best for these kinds of techniques is that they are like prescription drugs .
They are very valuable in small amounts but you need to ensure that you do n't overdose .
As with many things , experience is the great helper here as it can get you through this curve more rapidly .
In particularly it 's important to expect this adoption curve , particularly the over - usage .
When learning something new it 's common to over - use it at some stage because without crossing the line it's hard to know where that line is .
It can also be useful to try and build a sandbox - a relatively contained area of the code - base for people to overdo the meta - programming in .
With a suitable sandbox it 's easier to undo the over - usage later on .
Frustrated with how long it takes for your computer to boot up ?
That could change , say researchers who have made a breakthrough that could take the PC industry closer to truly instant - on capability for computer systems .
Scientists have found a way to add ferroelectric capability to silicon , which pushes the idea of building a completely ferroelectric transistor closer to reality .
" If ferroelectric transistors are ever realized , they can be turned off and back on instantly – no reboot , no 30 - second wait , no nothing , " says Darrell Schlom , lead researcher on the project and professor of material sciences at Cornell University .
" For the user the computer would be ready to be used again immediately when power is applied . "
Ferroelectric materials provide low - power , high - efficiency electronic memory and are already used in smart cards for subways and ATMs , among other things .
Integrating ferroelectrics with silicon - based circuits like those in modern electronics would enable instant - on capability , and it could also provide higher speed and lower power consumption overall , making the ferroelectric circuits an attractive alternative to flash and other memory technologies .
But integrating the two materials in a transistor has eluded researchers for more than half a century .
For the project researchers from three universities – Cornell , Penn State and Northwestern University – took strontium titanate , a normally non-ferroelectric variant of the ferroelectric material used in smart cards .
They deposited it on silicon in such a way that the silicon squeezed it into a ferroelectric state .
So far approaches to instant - on computing have been software - driven , with companies such as Microsoft promising to create better operating systems that would cut down boot up time from a few minutes to 30 - 45 seconds .
Phoenix Technologies has also attacked the problem with a super - lightweight operating system called Hyperspace designed for quick and easy access to e-mail , calendar , and other basic functions without having to boot into a fullblown OS like Windows ; Hyperspace has recently shown up in some netbooks .
But materials science researchers have been pursuing an alternative track for decades .
In 1995 , Bell Lab researchers first realized the benefits of a ferroelectric transistor .
They used glue to attach various ferroelectric materials to semiconductors , says Schlom , but the result was not what they had expected because of the intervening layer of glue .
Since then attempts to get truly nonvolatile ferroelectric transitor technology have n't succeeded .
Most have resulted in ferroelectric transistors that have data retention time , also known as operational lifetime for a memory card , of few hours to a few days .
That means they could hold data in memory for a few days ( or less ) without being powered .
It 's an improvement over volatile RAM , but significantly short of the storage industry 's ten - year retention requirement for a non-volatile memory device like a flash memory card .
But that 's changed , says Schlom .
" In subsequent work , the glue has been replaced by thinner intermediate layers , but ours is the first with no intermediate layer between a ferroelectric and silicon , " says Schlom .
" Our ferroelectric is made directly on silicon . "
Schlom says the research team is still a ways off from its goal of creating a complete ferroelectric transistor .
And he wo n't take a shot at speculating just when these transistors could become a reality .
" We have just gotten rid of all of the intermediate layers , " he says .
" There could still be trouble with electronic traps at the interface , electrical leakage through the ferroelectric since it is quite thin and manufacturability . "
But the latest breakthrough is an important step on the road to a new kind of silicon transistor , says Schlom .

India 339 for 6 ( Yuvraj 131 , Karthik 67 ) beat West Indies 319 ( Chanderpaul 63 ) by 20 runs
Scorecard and ball - by - ball details
How they were out
Yuvraj Singh celebrates his quickfire century AFP
It ended dramatically at Sabina Park , with tension contorting the faces of anxious fans , both Indian and West Indian , as the hosts pursued India 's massive total of 339 with tenacity .
West Indies chased valiantly and stayed in the game throughout despite the regular fall of wickets but , in the end , their challenge lacked an innings combining aggression with longevity , two qualities that Yuvraj Singh blended perfectly during his match - winning 131 off 102 balls .
India were succumbing to their bugbear , having lost early wickets to the short ball , when Yuvraj joined Dinesh Karthik to rebuild the innings from 32 for 2 .
His approach made up for the absence of Sachin Tendulkar , Virender Sehwag and Suresh Raina and allayed fears of weakness in the batting order .
Yuvraj revived the Indian innings by adding 135 with Karthik for the third wicket , a partnership that laid the platform for only the second ODI total in excess of 300 in Jamaica .
That two out of the three 300 - plus scores at Sabina Park were made in this match despite a slow pitch and outfield spoke volumes about the mediocrity of the bowling attacks .
West Indies ' bowling disintegrated after Jerome Taylor 's opening spell , losing discipline in line and length as they fed the Indian batsmen a diet of short or full balls .
They conceded 22 runs in extras , and bowled three front - foot no - balls resulting in free hits , largesse they could ill afford .
India 's bowlers were worse , conceding 19 runs through wides , and bowling two no-balls : Chris Gayle deposited one of the free - hits over the long - on boundary .
That they defended the target by 20 runs , was more due to the size of the total they were protecting and the West Indies ' batsmen 's ill - timed dismissals each time they got on a roll .
India seemed unlikely , however , to reach such a large total on evidence of how they batted at the start .
Taylor hurried the batsmen with pace and beat them with seam movement during his first spell .
He unsettled Gautam Gambhir with a 92 mph delivery from round the wicket that hurried the left - hander , whose feeble attempt to hook landed in Dwayne Bravo 's hands at midwicket .
Unfortunately for West Indies , the pressure Taylor created dissipated because there was none forthcoming from the other end with Lionel Baker , Dwayne Bravo and David Bernard unable to bowl economically for a sustained period .
Even the batsmen who revived India survived nervous starts : Karthik was cut in half by Baker while Yuvraj was constantly beaten by short - of - length deliveries which seamed across him .
The moment the length was full , though , the batsmen took advantage : Karthik drove Dwayne Bravo to the extra-cover boundary and Yuvraj was able to put away Baker 's full offering to the point fence .
After growing in confidence , Karthik added Twenty20 flavour to the sedate pace of 50 - over cricket , reaching his half - century with a scoop that carried for six over fine leg against Bernard .
He tried it again , on 67 , but this time he was undone by Bernard 's slower ball and scooped a catch to the wicketkeeper .
Yuvraj , however , stayed firm and the momentum swung towards India in two phases , the first of which was when the spinners came on after the 20th over .
He attacked Suleimann Benn and Gayle , pulling and slog - sweeping thrice over the midwicket boundary and India , largely through Yuvraj scored 70 runs between overs 20 and 27 .
The second period of acceleration was during the batting Powerplay , taken in the 34th over .
India began the five - over spell on 191 for 3 and Yuvraj set the tone by carving Baker to the cover boundary off the second ball before launching sixes over cover and midwicket to take 16 runs off the over .
Gayle turned to his best bowler but Yuvraj tore into Taylor 's second spell , flicking him twice off the pads for four , and hitting him for sixes over cover , midwicket and long - on .
MS Dhoni also went after him , shoveling a six down the ground .
Taylor 's two - over spell cost 37 runs and India scored 62 off the Powerplay .
Taylor never recovered from the onslaught and finished with 1 for 74 after conceding only 16 off his first five overs .
West Indies appeared hapless against Yuvraj until Dwayne Bravo found the edge of his bat as he tried to glance towards fine leg .
Bravo raised hopes of a fightback by dismissing Ravindra Jadeja first ball but useful innings from Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan steered India past 300 , and a six from Harbhajan Singh off the last ball took them to 339 .
Chasing 340 needed something special from Gayle and he began to deliver , muscling his way to 37 before top- edging a pull off Ashish Nehra to mid-on .
Morton attempted to fill the void left by his opening partner and stepped up after his departure , steering West Indies to 70 for 1 after ten overs before he was unlucky to be given out caught down the leg side for 42 .
Despite the loss of both set batsmen , Ramnaresh Sarwan ensured West Indies kept abreast with the asking - rate , using his feet nimbly against the spinners to clear the boundary .
In fact , Sarwan had just lofted Yuvraj for the most languid of straight sixes when he was run out for 45 the next ball while attempting an unnecessary second run .
It was now down to Shivnarine Chanderpaul and he too stepped up to ensure the equation did n't get out of hand , carting Yuvraj for consecutive sixes and reaching his half - century with two whips to the fine - leg boundary off Ishant Sharma .
However , Chanderpaul also fell immediately after hitting a six : he had smacked Yusuf Pathan over the square - leg boundary and was caught repeating the shot the very next ball .
Chanderpaul 's dismissal for 63 was a crippling blow and appeared to be the end of West Indies chances but they fought on determinedly .
Denesh Ramdin threw his bat around , so did Jerome Taylor and David Bernard , fraying India 's nerves to the limit .
They could n't quite complete what would have been an astonishing win , though , for they needed one of their more accomplished top - order batsmen to stay to stay a little longer .
I love animals , but I hate PETA .
Why ?
Because every effort the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals put into animal welfare is either irritating , ludicrous or does n’t make any sense .
Even
If I were a baby seal , I would n't want PETA on my side .
Here ’s just a sampling of the stupid , sensationalist , nonsensical tactics PETA uses to scare you into caring about animals : Using a Tragedy For Their Own Agenda -
Using the news buzz created by an abortion doctor 's murder to further your own political agenda ?
Stay classy , PETA .
Attacking Celebrities - Calling the fur - wearing Olson twins the “ Trollsons ” and donning Mary Kate and Ashley troll masks in front of their media appearances ?
All that tells me is that PETA would be better writing horrible puns for the Fashion Police in Us Weekly magazines than convincing people not to wear animal skins .
How about dousing fur - loving Lindsay Lohan with flour while she walks the red carpet ?
As much as I love seeing Lindsay Lohan publicly humiliated , I prefer watching her do it herself in the inane movies she agrees to star in or by passing out coke - faced in front of the paparazzi .
This tactic just makes PETA look retarded , and their victims sympathetic .
Renaming Animals -
This whole “ sea kittens ” bullshit ?
Until cats start dying three weeks after you win them at a carnival or until salmon stops being delicious , I ’m not calling a goddamn fish a kitten .
Insane Suggestions - PETA proposes that people start drinking breast milk instead of cow ’s milk , to save the poor cows .
Since when is a cow ’s tit more important than mine ?
Plus , they actually contacted 80s pop group Pet Shop Boys and asked them to change their name to Rescue Shelter Boys so as not to promote the purchase of dogs at pet stores .
My question is why have n’t they attacked the Pussycat Dolls for insinuating that all cats are slutty and lip - synch .
Comparing
You to Hitler - PETA often juxtaposes images depicting the mistreatment and death of farm animals to victims of the Holocaust .
Yes , PETA went there .
You ate a hamburger !
You ’re as bad as a Nazi !
Sex -
The closest PETA has gone to captivating my interest ( positively , anyway ) is their erotic vegetable orgy commercial banned from the Super Bowl , or those magazine ads having B - list celebrities go naked .
But that only makes me horny , not vegan .
Also , besides the occasional dallop of whip cream in bed , I prefer to keep my food and my sex separate .
PETA , of course , is made up of sociopaths who make it horrible to begin with .
Their president , Ingrid Newkirk ( who totally reminds me of this guy , but without the sense of humor ) has stipulated in her will that after her death , her body should be butchered and barbequed in a public area , while her various other limbs and organs should be sent to non-animal friendly companies , Braveheart - style .
Anyone this clearly insane should not be the President of a company .
Her underlings are just as nuts -- I ’ve met PETA members who say they ’d rather wear a coat made of human skin than of animal fur .
These are people who would much rather live on the Planet of the Apes than on Earth .
( The one from the Tim Burton movie , that was n’t Earth at all , but some weird alternate version of Earth where there were no humans . )
I am fully expecting those PETA crazies to sic their tofu dogs on me after reading this .
If they do , I ’m prepared to use this giant , savory turducken sandwich I ’m currently enjoying as a weapon to defend myself .
THE ORIGINAL KING OF IRONY ….
Anyone looking for reasoned , sensible analysis from Karl Rove is bound to be disappointed .
But since President Obama took office , the man the former president affectionately called Turd Blossom has spent most of his time acting like a child who believes it ’s “ opposite day . ”
As Ali Frick reported , Rove appeared on ( where else ? )
Fox News yesterday , arguing that the abolition of U.S. torture policies will make it easier for terrorists to recruit new members .
As Rove sees it , now that Obama has “ forsworn ” Bush - era interrogation tactics , it ’s given terrorists “ a tool to make it more attractive to recruit people . ”
The irony is , it was Rove ’s boss that made terrorist recruiting easier by using the very torture techniques Obama has rejected .
Rove ’s argument does n’t even make any sense — terrorists will find more willing volunteers to strike at the United States because we ’re not torturing detainees ?
Humane treatment of prisoners has become some kind of rallying cry for radicals ?
As Frick explained , “ Experts from FBI special agent Jack Cloonan to torture victim Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) to former Army JAG Major General Thomas Romig all agree that Bush and Rove ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” program recruited terrorists who have killed thousands of Americans .
Indeed , former military interrogator Matthew Alexander cited Bush ’s interrogation program as the most effective means to recruiting insurgents in Iraq who were battling Americans every day . ”
I ’d just add that this fits into a larger pattern with Rove .
He identifies some of the worst developments of the Bush / Cheney White House — in this case , the fact that the Bush administration made terrorist recruiting easier — and projects the same faults onto President Obama .
Consider some of Rove ’s recent arguments : Obama is guilty of using hardball political tactics ; the president looks at every policy issue “ from a political perspective “ ; the White House is making “ power grabs “ ; Obama , unlike Bush , is “ polarizing , ” because of his “ petty ” partisanship .
About a year ago , Rove accused the New York Times of having “ outed a CIA agent , ” which “ obviously puts the CIA agent in danger . ”
Rove added that disclosing the name of a CIA operative represents “ a very callous view about our nation ’s security and interests . ”
It was , at the time , one of the most ironic things I ’d ever heard .
Apparently , it was just a sign of things to come .
He describes the way he does physics as " a sort of architecture done with equations , rather than with bits of wood and steel " .
A self - confessed optimist , he says that having unsolved problems is what makes life interesting .
In the summer of 2003 , Dyson gave the annual Dirac lecture at the University of Cambridge , entitled Looking for Life in Unlikely Places .
Afterwards ,
Plus spoke to him about his life in science .

Why do you find maths fascinating ?
I 've never remembered a time when I was n't in love with calculating .
One of the first memories I have was when I was still being put down for a nap in the afternoons .
I was in the crib and not able to climb out , and I was calculating the infinite series , 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16 ... and discovered that it came out to 2 .
I remember that very vividly .
It was a big moment when I found that out .
I just loved calculating .
It 's something you 're born with - it certainly did n't come from outside as far as I know .
The kind of math that I 've done all my life is old - fashioned math .
I never became a modern mathematician , never learned any of the abstract stuff .
What I do is really nineteenth century , and it turns out of course that that is what you need for applied math .
The nineteenth century is a good place to start if you want to be useful !
Is it possible , or desirable , to do physics without maths ?
Yes .
Dick Feynman , who was my mentor as a physicist , had very little math .
He never really thought in terms of mathematics ; he had a very concrete imagination .
He drew pictures instead of making calculations , and somehow got the right answers .
But of course he was really a unique character , not only in his work but also in his personality .
He had this remarkable vision of things , he called it the space - time approach .
It meant he could reconstruct the whole of physics from his own point of view , without much in the way of equations .
Instead of writing down an equation and solving it he would just write down the answer , which other people can't do .
It was combined with some sort of geometrical pictures he had in his head .
There have been others like that - he's not the only one - but it is unusual .
I work completely from a mathematical point of view , I was just the opposite .
I have to have an equation that I can solve .
So I do it the old - fashioned way , and then of course the fun was to understand what he was doing from my point of view , which turned out to be very interesting - I was able to translate his style into old - fashioned mathematics so other people could use it .
What has your mathematical training brought to what you have done ?
My main teacher as a mathematician was a wonderful gentleman called Besicovitch who lived here in Cambridge .
He was an emigre Russian , he talked with a very thick Russian accent - he was a great character .
My style as a mathematician was strongly influenced by Besicovitch .
He worked on the borderline between geometry and set theory , both of which are kind of nineteenth century .
He did beautiful proofs which are kind of architectural .
Besicovitch 's style was to take some rather simple question and build up an enormously elaborate construction to show that such a thing worked or did n't work and then get a very simple answer at the end .
And that 's typical of the way I do physics .
It 's a sort of architecture done with equations , rather than with bits of wood and steel .

In your popular books you comment on topics that are not directly related to your work as a physicist .
So you obviously feel that mathematicians and scients have a wide role to play in society as commentators or guides .
What motivates you in this wider search for meaning and truth ?
I suppose the fact that my interests have always been very much broader than my skills !
My skills have always been just playing around with equations , but there is much more to life than equations .
I 've been interested in big human problems , and growing up through World War II I had an acute experience of war .
I was involved with the bombing campaign in World War II , so it gave me the feeling that war and peace was something we have to deal with .
So that 's always been a big driving force for me , coming to grips with the problems of war and peace .

I think the reason why scientists can deal with that is because we have an additional qualification which is nothing to do with the technical parts of science , which is that we are operating in an international community .
Science is about the most international activity there is .
We have friends and colleagues all over the world , including countries that are not supposed to be respectable .
It 's a great tradition in science that you talk to everybody and that you all understand the same things and you all understand them in more or less the same way .
So as scientists we 're setting a model for the world - how to operate a global enterprise without coming into collision .
I think that 's something we can do much better than the politicians .
I worked for a while in the United States in the Disarmament Agency which was the part of Government concerned with arms control .
That was during the Kennedy administration , so it was forty years ago .
The Disarmament Agency was just new then .
It was only about 100 people in the whole administration .
Ten of us were scientists , and the other ninety were mostly ex-ambassadors and diplomatic types and the ten scientists were doing all of the work , not because we were experts on bombs , but because we were accustomed to talking with the Russians and the Chinese and the other people who were supposed to be bad guys , and the diplomats were n't .
We really believed in coming to agreements much more than the diplomats did .
I suppose that could be true of all academics - do you think it is more true of scientists ?
Well , I would n't say that dogmatically , but I do think it is true .
Science does translate much better than , say , history or law or literature .
We can read other people 's literature , but that is for most people an effort ; most people rely on translations , so it 's very different .
In science you do n't need translations .
Do you feel that modern scientists have an ethical role to play in the world ?
Very definitely .
Of course we do n't all agree about ethics , but still the ethics of science I think is extremely important to most of us .
First of all , not claiming to know more than you know .
That 's the most important thing , that science is about uncertainty rather than about certainty .
So it 's very different from law where everything has to be in black and white , and it 's different from religion too .
This tradition of admitting when you 're wrong is very important .
In science when you 're proved wrong you just goodhumouredly say ' well , yes , I was wrong ' , which other people find not so easy .
You describe yourself as an optimist - why is this ?
The reason I 'm optimistic is easy to see ; it 's because I came through the 1930s .
I was a teenager in the 1930s , when things were from every point of view much worse than they are today .
We had a terrible economic depression , millions of people out of work , much more than now , we had Hitler to deal with , another World War coming up , which we all expected to die in - I did n't expect to survive World War II .
We all expected it to be worse than World War I , and World War I was a terrible tragedy for England .
It was really a time to despair - even little things like pollution , England was filthy then compared to what it is now .
I remember in London if you put on a clean shirt in the morning it was black by the evening around the collar and the cuffs .
The air was filthy , the water was filthy , the Thames was so polluted that nothing could live in it - well , it 's all been improved very greatly .
It took just fifty years of careful attention to detail - those pollution problems are curable .
The present generation has forgotten all that , they seem to think that just because pollution exists , it 's a disaster .
I would say the opposite , it 's an opportunity for doing better .

So there are many reasons , but I think having lived through bad times is the main reason .
World War II was bad enough , but it was nothing like as bad as we expected .
We had read Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World and he starts out with anthrax bombs - well , we expected anthrax bombs , there 's nothing new about anthrax .
It never happened , so we were lucky .
In all sorts of ways we were lucky ; of course England had a better war than many places .
But still , it was a tough war and nevertheless we survived , so , having lived through that , I can't take the present problems so seriously .
I think none of the present - day problems are as bad as what we faced then .
And you see science and technology as being part of the solution ?
It has been , yes , especially if you go to China and countries in Africa .
They have a very different view of science because they know they absolutely need it .
You can't imagine China in its present state of economic growth without modern technology , and of course China has got enormously more prosperous just in the last ten years .
They have a very positive attitude toward technology , including genetic engineering .
The same is true of the people I know in Africa .
For them , science really is a necessity of life .
They do n't have such mixed feelings about it .
Do we have a job to do as scientists here in the rich world , to persuade people that the doomsaying is n't necessarily correct ?
Yes - but I do n't try to impose my views on everybody .
It 's quite good to have some people to go around preaching gloom and doom , but I do n't happen to agree with them .
And I think it 's unfair if we try to impose those views on the Chinese and the Africans .
What have you found fun about being a scientist ?
The thing I have found most delightful is having friends all over the world .
I just spent a couple of weeks in China .
You are greeted there as a friend and colleague , and immediately you talk the same language , even if it is not Chinese !
I do n't have a word of Chinese , but still we could communicate pretty well .
Without the science I would just be a tourist and it does make a huge difference , having a professional contact .
Of course , there are other professions which have the same kind of international spread - if you 're a musician it 's the same - but not for most .
And what about the actual doing of science ?
That of course is always fun , because , especially being a theorist , I am free to jump around .
I do n't have to deal with apparatus , so if I get bored with a problem I can just scrap it and start on something else , which is what I frequently do .
So I have great freedom , and especially in astronomy , we 're never running out of problems .
At the moment , the two most vigorously active branches of science are astronomy and biology , and in both of them there is no shortage of interesting things to do , and not likely to be for the next hundred years .
There is a theorem proved by Kurt Godel in 1931 , which is the Incompleteness Theorem for mathematics .
The theorem says that if you have any finite formulation of mathematics , that is , a finite set of equations and a finite set of rules of logical inference , then you can write down statements within the language that is defined that way , and you can prove that they cannot be proved and that they can not be disproved .
So given any finite system of mathematics , there are statements within the system that you can't decide whether they are true or untrue by using the rules , which is a very powerful and profound result .
It means that any formulation of mathematics is incomplete ; there are always questions that you can't answer within the system .
In fact it means that mathematics is inexhaustible - given any particular set of rules there are questions that you can't answer .
You always have to invent new rules in order to decide new questions .
So it 's guaranteed that mathematics will never come to an end , which I think is a delightful set of affairs !
It came as a big shock to the mathematicians in 1931 , because they had had dreams of solving all the problems .
The fact that you can't solve all the problems I think is much better .
The question is does that also apply to physics and I think it does , because in some sense physics includes mathematics , and anything you can say about the physical world you can say in terms of mathematics .
Therefore if mathematics is inexhaustible then physics is also inexhaustible .
I think that 's also consoling to physicists , or it should be , that they wo n't ever come to an end of problems either .
I think you finding that consoling is probably the definition of being an optimist !
The point is that having unsolved problems is what makes life interesting .
To me the idea of solving all the problems in science or in anything else is the most gloomy prospect I can imagine .

Professor Freeman Dyson is now retired from his Professorship in Physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , where he spent most of his working life .
On 16th June , 2003 , he gave the annual Dirac Lecture at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge .
His talk , entitled " Looking for life in unlikely places : reasons why planets may not be the best places to look for life " , was recorded and edited by Bjorn Hassler and Adrian Cullum - Hanshaw of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge .

The majority of men who receive one of the standard treatments for localized prostate cancer - surgery or radiation therapy - have an excellent outcome .
But for the small group whose prostate cancer returns , a new study offers insight as to why treatment is n't effective .
The study - a collaboration between researchers at the Josephine Ford Cancer Center at Henry Ford Hospital and Fox Chase Cancer Center - shows that men with a low oxygen supply to their tumor have a higher chance of the prostate cancer returning , as found by increasing prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) levels following treatment .
" After several years of research , we were able to show that low levels of oxygen to the tumor are highly related to a patient 's outcome .
Those with lower oxygen levels to the prostate cancer did not respond as well to radiation therapy , and the cancer returned more often , " says Benjamin Movsas , M.D. , senior study author and chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Henry Ford Hospital .
Moreover , recent studies suggest the same finding also appears to apply to patients treated with surgery .
Results from the study will be presented May 31 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) annual meeting in Orlando .
Prostate cancer affects one in six men in the United States , but according to the American Cancer Society only one in 35 will die of it .
The majority of all prostate cancer are diagnosed in men older than 65 .

According to Dr. Movsas , oxygen being delivered to a tumor is critical to the treatment for many cancers .
Radiation therapy , for example , creates free radicals that damage DNA in tumors , and oxygen acts as the mediator that perpetuates the free radicals .
That 's why Dr. Movsas began his work nearly a decade ago to investigate low oxygen levels - also known as tumor hypoxia - in prostate cancer tumors while working at Fox Chase .
To measure the amount of oxygen being delivered to the tumors and surrounding areas , Dr. Movsas and his colleagues at Fox Chase used custom - made oxygen probes to test 57 patients with low or immediate risk of cancer prior to radiation therapy .
The probe was used prior to " radioactive seeds " which were implanted in the prostate .
Dr. Movsas ' initial research found that it is possible for prostate cancer tumors to have low oxygen levels .
The next step was for the team to track the long - term correlation between low oxygen levels and PSA levels following treatment .
These new findings , being presented at ASCO , ultimately reveal that a tumor 's oxygen supply can significantly predict a patient 's outcome following treatment , independent from tumor stage or Gleason score , a classification of the grade of prostate cancer .
Of the 57 patients , the study found that eight experienced an increase in their PSA levels about eight years following treatment .
" By identifying patients at risk with low oxygen levels in prostate tumors , we 're now able to build on this research and begin to explore novel treatment options for this small subset of patients .
It 's possible we 'll find that these patients will do best with a combination of radiation therapy and other novel approaches , such as angiogenesis therapy ( targeting blood vessels ) or possibly even gene therapy .
That 's where our research is taking us next , " says Dr. Movsas .
" Non-invasive methods to detect oxygen levels in tumors are also very important . "

It is a rare occasion when I get an insight for a blogpost from a comic but this is what happened as I was reading this one .
Although the part that spoke to me was just the buildup to the main even , it seems to me that the author did present the powers that struggle for dominion in all non-socialist systems quite succinctly .
So basically , every system characterized by class struggle ( thus anything other than socialism ) has the following three movements vying for control .
The Conservatives , the Progressives ( or liberals ) and the Populists ( or Socialists in recent centuries ) .
The Conservatives
The ruling elite of any society is generally conservative and thus generally belongs to such parties .
This is born out of basic self - interest .
The current ruling elite was once the progressives who have reached a position of power and through this leverage has slowly consolidated their gains by pushing for the appropriate legal or ruling system .
The best way to preserve this position of course is to oppose progressive reformation of the current system so as to conserve their profit sources and prevent future progressives from overtaking them .
That is not to say that the conservatives are comprised only of the ruling elite , although historically it has been the case .
Monarchs , Aristocracy and Feudal lords were all at some point the only conservative aspects of society , opposing transitions to another type of society , such as Capitalism .
In recent centuries however , through misinformation and propaganda the conservative agenda has managed to make limited headway in the middle and lower class .
This is generally achieved through faulty reasoning , which is why it is mostly based on irrational beliefs such as religion and nationalism , through which you can make people follow you even if it will be against their own best interest .
As such , the progressives either find it impossible to convince people through reason , and even if they do manage to attack a particular point , as they do n’t have the leverage of power , the argument can simply be ignored .
This path of a progressive becoming the conservative is the norm and examples of it abound in history , but one very recent example is none other than the success of Microsoft .
Here we have a company which in the 80s and even up until the early 90s was hailed as someone who was doing everything right , the underdog that was challenging the status quo and coming out on top , putting one over the Big Blue etc etc .
Back then , while MS was still growing , it was very tolerant of piracy ( they did n’t like it but they took only token action against it ) and against software patents .
Once Microsoft became the power in the software world however it started singing a different tune .
Suddenly patents are necessary and good , piracy must be squelched by any means necessary and political lobbying has increased hundredfold .
Looking at this change alone , it does n’t really make sense and it just feels like a company suddenly turning “ evil ” for no reason .
But from the perspective of power consolidation , the actions of Microsoft ( and other in a similar position ) make a lot more sense .
They are the type of actions any entity which gains the power takes in order to be able to retain it with the least amount of effort .
Think of that the next time you wonder why Google “ does evil ” now .
Progressives
The progressive or liberal part of any society is simply those who are moderately well off but cannot ascend to the position of ruling elite due to the barriers the previous batch of progressives – the current ruling elite , has put up .
In short the progressives are generally the middle class with great expectations .
The progressive face changes form in every epoch .
They were the artisans under the monarchs , the bourgeoisie under the aristocracy and today they are the right - libertarians , the minarchist - capitalists etc .
The “ progress ” they seek , is their progress to the top , and the “ liberty ” they ask is the liberty to rule .
Like all progressives before them , once power is in their hands they become tomorrow ’s conservatives in their attempts to retain it .
Like the conservatives above of course , their number are not limited simply to the middle class , although that is their base .
Their rationalistic rhetoric can easily demolish the weak arguments of the conservatives and draw in people with dreams of grandeur .
It is convenient that a fact which can be ignored is that there is simply not enough room at the top in they pyramidal form of all hierarchical systems .
As such , only the most capable and / or brutal progressives will achieve ruling position .
But of course , all progressives consider themselves the most capable .
It is not realistic to expect progressives or liberals to stick to their values once society has been reformed to their liking ( ie with them on top ) .
History is ample proof of that .
This is something to keep in mind when you listen to rhetoric from “ anarcho ” - capitalists about how good a society would be under unregulated capitalism .
Socialists
I use the label ‘ Socialists ’ instead of ‘ Populists ’ for while the former is a relatively recent movement in the history of mankind , ( whereas populism , or movements “ for the people ” have always existed to some degree ) populism without a socialist or egalitarian perspective has always been hijacked by the few for their own ends .
The people have always been betrayed by those liberals or Authoritarian “ Socialists ” leading them to fight “ for the people ” .
And while there have always been egalitarian ideologues , they never gathered a lot of momentum before the Marxist and Anarchist movements which presented not only a reasonable argument on why an egalitarian society is preferable but also practical methods to achieve it .
And while both Progressives and Socialists are disgruntled with the current ruling elite and rules of society , that is where their similarities end , for only the later seek a permanent end to ruling elites .
So where the Conservatives struggle to retain their rule and Progressives strive to claim it for themselves , it is only the Libertarian Socialists who wish to allow each person to achieve self - rule , and actualization .
All three currents will use populism as reasoning but only the libertarian socialists have a concrete way to achieve it .

But a kind of modernity is coming to India , with a Western emphasis on regimentation and formalization .
The flight attendants now walk down the aisles carrying out their detailed training , offering food if you want it , moving on if you do n’t .
A new breed of companies resists hiring the cousins and friends of senior managers ; they insist on children ’s educating themselves and working hard in order to inherit the family business .
More and more people faithfully pay their taxes .
And yet now when I visit America , where I grew up until moving to India six years ago , I wonder if this is where India is bound : a society that is fairer and more ordered , but in which something of the warmth of improvisation is gone .
It is especially visible in customer - service relationships .
In India , those relationships are often hierarchical and tinged by a blend of fear and reverence in the service giver ’s eyes .
But India has not yet crossed that line beyond which such transactions lose their human aspect .
Moving through America , I was struck again and again by the superficial politesse and underlying coldness of so many customer - service moments .
In restaurants , the waiters have become performers , not merely hosts seeking to tend to a guest : “ May I ask if it ’s your first time dining with us ?
Wow !
Well , it ’s wonderful to have you here .
Can I begin by telling you about our wonderful specials ? ”
And then the sparkling - or - still - water dilemma , and the practiced Disappointed Look when you want tap water .
And the 50 - percent - too - elaborate “ Are you finished enjoying that ? ”
Language was invented to connect us , but it sometimes drives us apart .
You see it , too , when you fly .
There are the airport - security officials who grimace at you with a “ What ?
You think you ’re better than me ? ” face when you ask them to replenish the stack of trays .
Or you finish your glass of water on a flight , and now you wonder about asking the flight attendant , who is now just moving forward to the next row , for a refill .
She might do it ; but she might , glaring at you in the manner of a headmistress , tell you that she has to serve other customers first and that she will get to you , sir , thank you very much .
And she is right , in a way .
Why should you drink twice before others drink once ?
The attendant ’s fidelity to her training is impeccable .
It 's the rare manager who does n't partake in quarterly or annual goal - setting exercises .
And woe to those who do n't make their goals SMART ( Specific , Measurable , Attainable , Realistic , Timely ) .
But do these goals really work ?
Researchers from four top business schools have collaborated to show that in many cases goals do more harm than good .
Worse , they can cause real damage to organizations and individuals using them .
" We argue that the beneficial effects of goal setting have been overstated and that systematic harm caused by goal setting has been largely ignored , " the researchers conclude .
Bad " side effects " produced by goal - setting programs include a rise in unethical behavior , over - focus on one area while neglecting other parts of the business , distorted risk preferences , corrosion of organizational culture , and reduced intrinsic motivation .
One example : the explosive Ford Pinto .
Presented with a goal to build a car " under 2,000 pounds and under $ 2,000 " by 1970 , employees overlooked safety testing and designed a car where the gas tank was vulnerable to explosion from rear - end collisions .
Fifty - three people died as a result .
Used wisely , goals can inspire employees and improve performance , the authors agree .
But goal setting must be prescribed in doses , not as a standard remedy to increase productivity .
They even offer a warning label and list 10 questions managers should ask themselves before starting goal setting .
The working paper , " Goals Gone Wild : The Systematic Side Effects of Over - Prescribing Goals Setting , " was authored by Lisa D. Ordóñez , Eller College of Management , University of Arizona ; Maurice E. Schweitzer , Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania ; Adam D. Galinsky , Kellogg School of Management , Northwestern University ; and Max Bazerman , Harvard Business School .
We asked Professor Bazerman to explore in more depth some of the paper 's findings .
Sean Silverthorne : So , are you against incentives and goals ?
No , my coauthors and I are not against incentives .
We believe in incentives .
And each of us has found goals useful in limited domains .
But we are concerned about the simple specification of stretch goals that permeates the goal setting and management by objectives literature .
Q : How can goal setting go wrong ?
When people focus on a specific stretch goal , and fail to perform other valued activities that are needed by the organization , goals are failing .
This is what Staw and Boettger found many years ago .
When employees care exclusively about reaching a goal , and bad things can happen if they fail , cheating goes up .
This is the most important result in the goal setting literature — found by my coauthors Lisa Ordóñez and Maurice Schweitzer .
Q : Are goals by themselves a problem , or is it the way we use them ?
When we can so easily predict the dysfunctional behavior that will ensue , I would argue that it is the goals themselves .
Far too often , people want to blame the individual .
But when organizations and governments create dysfunctional systems that can be predicted to lead to bad behaviors , I see the problem starting with the dysfunctional system .
And I see the creating of optimal systems as a key leadership function .
Q : Specifically , what is wrong with managers designing stretch goals for employees to expand their knowledge or capabilities ?
If you know the exact specific behaviors you want , stretch goals may be just fine .
But , if you want employees to engage in other pro-social behaviors ( e.g. , helping others in the organization ) and / or to act ethically , you need to be a lot more careful than simply providing a stretch goal .
Additionally , there is a growing set of research that shows " learning or mastery " goals have much more positive effects on performance and internal motivation than " performance " goals .
Q : Your paper is rife with examples of goals gone wild , everything from overcharging by Sears auto mechanics , to disappearing New York cab drivers , to Enron .
Do you see goals as a contributor to our current economic collapse ?
There are lots of culprits , which certainly include dysfunctional reward systems .
And I am sure that goals played a role .
But I certainly do not mean to blame the crisis on a set of specific goals .
Q : One side effect of goal setting that your team identified is a rise in unethical behavior .
Example : Your paper mentions that Bausch & Lomb employees falsified financial statements to meet earnings goals .
I know bounded ethicality is an area of study for you , so could you explain a little more the correlation between goals and unethical behavior ?
Sure !
The majority of my recent work is on bounded ethicality , or the ways in which even ethical people engage in unethical behavior without their own awareness .
Thus , many good people engage in sexist behavior without knowing that they are doing so .
Or they claim credit based on the false belief that their role on the team was more important than reality would dictate .
And they are affected by conflicts of interest without knowing that conflicts of interest affect them .
Similarly , good people can focus so much on reaching the stretch goal that they fail to realize how this has dumped other work on their co-workers , led the company to accept mortgages that are too risky , etc .
This behavior prompted by stretch goals is leading to unethical behavior , without the knowledge of the protagonists of the unethical action — or what we call bounded ethicality .
Also , Adam Barsky theorizes that focusing on goals actually distorts our perception of what is unethical behavior so that we are less likely to consider the ethical implications of our actions .
Q : If goal setting is so pernicious , how did it become such an embedded , accepted ( and for publishers , profitable ) practice ?
It is easy to implement .
It is easy to measure .
It is easy to document successes .
And in laboratory experiments , it has been shown to be extremely successful at improving the measured behavior .
Lisa , Maurice , Adam , and I simply argue that goals have gone wild in terms of their impact on other unmeasured outcomes .
When we factor in the consistent findings that stretch and specific goals both narrow focus on a limited set of behaviors while increasing risk - taking and unethical behavior , their simple implementation can become a vice .
Q : When are goals appropriate , and what ingredients should be included ?
Goals are appropriate when you know exactly what behaviors you want , you are n't concerned about secondary behaviors , and unethical behavior is not a big risk .
In other cases , you still might want to use goals , but we recommend doing so with caution , and our paper discusses the needed steps to take ( e.g. , strong leaders who model appropriate behavior , oversight to prevent unethical behavior , etc. ) .
Q : One of the most famous stretch goals was delivered by President John F. Kennedy : " I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth . "
Good goal ?
It was excellent for motivating behavior .
It was a stretch goal that got us going .
And as a side effect , it increased training and funding in the sciences .
It may have also increased the degree to which the United States and the Soviet Union spent limited funds on mutually unhelpful defense expenditures .
So , I think the answer is in the eyes of the beholder .
Personally , I think society might have better spent the extra funds that went to NASA .
Q : If not goals , what ?
To Read More :
Creating environments where people want to achieve , where they want to help the organization , and where they want to do so in an ethical manner .
Research shows that an even stronger effect than goals is intrinsic motivation , having individuals do an activity because they find the work rewarding in and of itself .
Given that goals can undermine this intrinsic value of work , sometimes the best solution is no specific stretch goal at all or at the very least mastery or learning goals .
I do not need someone to set a stretch goal for me .
I am happy to help make HBS , Harvard , and the broader society a better place .
And if I do not want externally imposed stretch goals , and believe that I do not need them , I think there are many others out there in the same condition .

Robert F. Furchgott , one of three American scientists awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that nitric oxide transmits signals within the human body , died May 19 in Seattle .
He was 92 .
Furchgott , formerly of the State University of New York in Brooklyn , shared the $ 995,500 prize with Louis J. Ignarro of UCLA and Dr. Ferid Murad of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston .
Their discovery led to several breakthroughs , including a new treatment for newborns with dangerously high blood pressure in their lungs and drugs for the treatment of shock .
It also helped pave the way for the anti-impotence drug Viagra .
“ The discovery of nitric oxide and its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine , ” Dr. Valentin Fuster , president of the American Heart Assn. , said at the time the Nobel Prize was announced .
“ It has allowed us to improve the treatment of certain patients ” and will probably lead to the discovery of new ways to treat high blood pressure and heart attacks , he added .
In his research , Furchgott examined the effects of such naturally occurring chemicals as acetylcholine on blood vessels and , in 1980 , concluded that they stimulated the release of a signaling molecule that caused muscles of the blood vessels to relax .
He called this signaling agent EDRF but did not know its chemical composition .
While working both independently and with Furchgott , Ignarro demonstrated that EDRF was , in effect , nitric oxide .
When Furchgott and Ignarro presented their conclusions at a conference in 1986 , the Nobel Assembly noted that “ it elicited an avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories around the world . ”
By the end of 1992 , so many new results had appeared that the journal Science named nitric oxide the “ Molecule of the Year . ”
Murad studied how nitroglycerin and other drugs used to dilate blood vessels functioned .
In 1977 , he discovered that they promoted the release of nitric oxide .
He speculated that hormones produced by the body might also act by releasing nitric oxide , but there was no experimental evidence to support that possibility .
Furchgott was born in Charleston , S.C. , on June 4 , 1916 , and , according to his lengthy autobiography on the Nobel Prize website , he developed an early interest in bird - watching , shell collecting and science in general during his childhood .
He earned a degree in chemistry from the University of North Carolina and a doctorate in biochemistry from Northwestern University .
He held teaching positions at Cornell University and Washington University , and conducted research at both schools , before accepting the post of chairman of the department of pharmacology at the State University of New York in Brooklyn in 1956 .
He was head of that department until stepping down in 1983 and continued as a professor until retiring in 1989 .
Even after retirement , he was still active in the lab .
He is survived by three daughters , four grandchildren and one great - grandchild .

Everyday , life gets easier for script kiddies .
These days everything is pretty much automated .
I came across the db_autopwn feature of the Metasploit Framework a few semesters ago and I think it 's definitely something that security professionals should know about and administrators should use as a quick way to find holes in their network .
Try it now before someone else on the Internet does .
Prerequisites
I assume the following :
You have the latest version of Metasploit Framework installed
You have MySQL , or other database server running and configured properly
How it works ( the simple version )
This command works by using some sort of database .
I will be using MySQL as I am most familiar with it , but PostgresSQL is an excellent alternative especially when dealing with large networks .
The information stored in the database can vary .
There is more than one way to get information into the database that Metasploit will be able to read .
You may choose from an NBE file from Nessus , the Nmap XML output files , or use the built in Nmap wrapper command ( db_nmap ) .
For a more thorough test I would highly recommend using a Nessus scan as it matches exploits based on actual vulnerabilities , while the Nmap results match exploits based solely on port numbers .
Really though you should be fine using the Nmap scans as long as your services are running on standard ports .
Once all the data is in the database , it 's then just a matter of executing the db_autopwn command .
It will read through the database and automatically try to exploit vulnerabilities based on the IPs on your network as well as the open ports .
Performing the Pentest
First you must load up the MySQL plugin so that connections to the database are possible .
msf > load db_mysql [*]
Successfully loaded plugin : db_mysql
Now go ahead and create a database within MySQL .
Insert your own credentials as necessary .
msf > db_create root:password@localhost/ pentest [*]
Database creation complete ( check for errors )
It says to check for errors , so why not ?
Login to the MySQL console and take a look .
$ mysql -u root - p mysql > show databases ; +--------------------+ | Database | +--------------------+ | pentest |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set ( 0.10 sec ) mysql > use pentest mysql > show tables ; +-------------------+
| Tables_in_pentest | +-------------------+ | hosts | | notes | | refs | | services | | vulns | | vulns_refs |
+-------------------+
6 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
As you can see the pentest database exists and the proper tables exist within .
Next you need to fill up the database .
I 'm going to use the db_nmap wrapper because that 's keeps this pentest very simple and quick .
You can throw any nmap options at this command as it is just a wrapper .
I do a quick scan of my entire network with the following :
msf > db_nmap - A 192.168.1.0/24
Once that finishes running find out if the hosts on your network were loaded into the database .
msf > db_hosts [*]
Time : Thu May 21 22:52:48 -0700 2009 Host : 192.168.1.1 Status : alive OS : [*]
Time : Thu May 21 22:52:49 -0700 2009 Host : 192.168.1.2 Status : alive OS : [*]
Time : Thu May 21 22:52:49 -0700 2009 Host : 192.168.1.103 Status : alive OS : [*]
Time : Thu May 21 22:52:49 -0700 2009 Host : 192.168.1.120 Status : alive OS : [*]
Time : Thu May 21 22:52:49 -0700 2009 Host : 192.168.1.140 Status : alive OS :
Your database is now set up and you can run the db_autopwn command against your network .
You can find out all the options for the command by running db_autopwn with no options .
Something that should be noted , the x switch is for use with information loaded from a Nessus scan .
It uses vulnerability references instead of relying on ports .
Here we will be relying on port numbers .
msf > db_autopwn -pb
The options I used tell the command to match vulnerabilities based on open ports and to bind using a random port .
This command may take some time to run depending on the number of ports open on each device as well as the number of hosts you are running through .
If you read the help options you will find ways to only run against certain hosts , which is highly recommended since your workstations probably do not need to be scanned as they should not have any ports available to the outside .
To find out if any exploits were successful , use the sessions command .
You should be familiar with this command if you 're using Metasploit , but to give you a hint take a look at sessions - lv to list all current shell connections as well as the exploit that allowed for remote shell access .
Then you can use - i to connect to the session numbers shell .
Why is this important ?
As I stated in the beginning , script kiddies are going rampant trying to build bot nets .
Do n't let your systems become part of this .
Just run a quick pentest because that will show you what is open and exploitable by script kiddies .
This is a great way to show improvement to your bosses as well .
That way they can stop thinking that you 're not doing anything .

Over 7 million acres of the Pantanal has gone up in smoke — roughly 50 % more than all of the land that has burned so far along the entire US West Coast .
Other ISP modifying . torrent file contents
TorrentFreak reports that an Israeli ISP , Bezeq , is actually modifying the .torrent files , as they are downloaded by their customers .
Looking back almost a year , I ’d just like to say — I told you so .
It works as follows .
When a Bezeq International customer downloads a . torrent file the ISP will intercept it and add (! ) a new tracker to it .
The additional tracker is only accessible for Bezeq International customers and it connects to a high speed web - seed hosted on Bezeq International ’s network .
Instead of blocking / throttling / capping / sending - threatening - letters or finding other ways of annoying their own customers for actually using the services they pay for , Bezeq caches popular downloads .
The ISP saves on costs for having less traffic go outside of their own network , and customers actually end up with faster downloads .
Still , this involves intercepting and modifying downloads , which makes me feel uneasy , as this could easily be turned the other way .
This concept will actually lessen the server load of hosting companies that host the file itself , well good for them .

Uhh ... nothing else appears to be relevant enough .
Gordon Brown is to promise that much of the Iraq inquiry will be held in the open in an attempt to avert a damaging Commons defeat for the Government this Wednesday .
Amid fury on the Labour back benches over Mr Brown 's initial decision to stage the inquiry in private , ministers now expect much of the evidence to be given publicly after a change of heart was forced on the Prime Minister .
The Labour rebels ' anger was intensified by the disclosure yesterday that Tony Blair , likely to be the key witness , had consulted with the Cabinet Secretary on the form of the inquiry .
They want him to give evidence under oath .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Blair 's involvement in discussions with Sir Gus O'Donnell over the nature of the hearings was confirmed by Shaun Woodward , the Northern Ireland Secretary .
" Of course the Cabinet Secretary discussed this with the former prime minister , " Mr Woodward said , " because he obviously will be one of the major witnesses who will be giving evidence to Sir John Chilcot 's inquiry " .
The backbenchers also pointed to a leaked memo yesterday indicating that the former prime minister had been considering the possibility of going to war without a second UN resolution two months before the invasion .
The note , written by his foreign policy adviser Sir David Manning , indicated that Mr Blair and US President George Bush were already discussing ways of legitimising military invasion in case the UN failed to find weapons of mass destruction .
Such documents are likely to go to the heart of the inquiry ; suggestions they could be examined in secret provoked uproar among MPs of all parties and senior military and intelligence officers .
Mr Brown has already staged a partial retreat by asking Sir John Chilcot , the retired civil servant who will head the inquiry , to hold some sessions in public .
But the concession did not go far enough to pacify Labour MPs threatening to support a Tory motion on Wednesday calling for all hearings to be held in public other than for security reasons .
Sir John will tomorrow meet David Cameron , the Tory leader , and Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , to discuss the form of the inquiry .
Ministers said yesterday that they expected the bulk of hearings to be held in public and one senior Whitehall source said : " It 's inevitable that will happen . "
Jack Straw , foreign secretary at the time of the war , said the indications from Sir John were that his hearings would be both public and private .
He said : " I have no problem with giving most of the evidence I have in public . "
Mr Straw told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show that he was sure Mr Blair would also be happy to appear publicly .
Sadiq Khan , Britain 's most senior Muslim politician , admitted the controversy over the hearings " looked awful " , blaming the furore on ignorance over the autonomy given to the chairs of inquiries .
Mr Khan , a Transport minister , told BBC1's Politics Show : " I suspect there will be many , many parts of the inquiry held in public . "
The Government is preparing to table a rival motion on Wednesday promising widespread public hearings in an effort to peel off MPs reluctant to support a Conservative motion .
Last night Labour MPs opposed to the war said they would only be satisfied by the majority of hearings being public .
Paul Flynn , the MP for Newport West , said : " We want a clear assurance that the inquiry will be open . "
Gordon Prentice , MP for Pendle , argued : " The whole way this has been done is so cack - handed and inept it is unbelievable .
" The inquiry should be open with evidence given on oath .
There must be an opportunity for the leading players to be cross-examined . "

Although indigenous people had been calling Australia home for nearly 42,000 years , the first European discovery came in 1770 by Captain James Cook .
Cook mapped nearly the entire East coast and claimed the land for Great Britain .
Cook ’s adventure was n’t all fun and games though .
Not having seen anything like it , Cook ran his ship Endevour straight into part of the Great Barrier Reef .
His journey was delayed for nearly 7 weeks as they repaired the vessel in what is now known as Cooktown , AUS .
After Cook ’s return to England , the British would use Australia as a penal colony , exiling prisoners to camps all around the island .

Via : Bloomberg :
David F. Wherley Jr. , the head of the Washington National Guard who scrambled jets over the city during the 9/11 terrorist attacks , was among those killed in the worst commuter train crash in the city ’s history , officials said .
Wherley ’s wife , Ann , was also among the nine people killed when a train plowed into the rear of a stopped train during rush hour on June 22 , Quintin Peterson , a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department , said in a telephone interview .
Both were 62 and lived in southeast Washington .
Wherley was commander of the 113th Fighter Wing at Andrews Air Force base in Maryland during the September 2001 terrorist attacks and sent up aircraft with orders to protect the White House and the Capitol , according to the 9/11 Commission report .
He commanded the District of Columbia National Guard from 2003 to 2008 , the unit said in a statement .

Beatles ' record producer and arranger George Martin — the Fifth Beatle — once said : " You 've never really heard Sgt Pepper until you 've heard it in mono . "
As it turned out after hours of listening tests , it 's completely true .
Advertisement
The first article I ever got published was an opinion piece on Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
I was 16 at the time and , needless to say , quite naive .
I was n't very much into non-Beatles music at that age , mainly because I did n't have much access to it .
It was n't until the next year that I was able to buy music regularly , having at last my own stereo system .
But back then , my music world was all about the Beatles — and crap 90s radio pop .
My dad had Sgt Pepper along with the rest of the Beatles ' records and some compilations of classic rock , from Chuck Berry to bloody Kansas , so that was my music world .
Advertisement
I could n't stop listening to Sgt Pepper .
Non stop , I played it and played it until my ears bleed and then I played it some more .
It was the stereo version , not the mono mix , and it has lived with me ever since .
Then , a few months ago I read in The Word — a very good British music magazine — that the Beatles in mono are — like George Martin implied — better than the Beatles in stereo .
Apparently , the Beatles did n't give a damn about the stereo mix , only about the mono .
In fact , they cared so little that they passed on the stereo mixing sessions :
Once the mono was done , they left the building .
So I started looking for them .
Finding the actual mono mix in the market was impossible .
Not to talk about the fact that I do n't have a turntable anymore .
For some reason , the Beatles company did n't have the mono mixes of the Beatles ' albums available either — they are going to re-release them now , it seems , remastered — so I got into Torrent to hunt them down .
I could n't find them in the first try .
I found a couple of MP3 rips , but I wanted to have FLAC rips of the original vinyls .
After some time I gave up , forgetting about the mono Beatles until the Gizmodo 's audio week .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
I thought trying it would be interesting for a feature , so I started looking for them again and got 192 kbps MP3s , which I compared to the stereo version at the same bit rate .
Since Sgt Pepper was my album , I started to listen to its songs in pairs , with my earmuff headphones on .
I was blown away .
George Martin was oh so right :
The songs do sound different .
I was so surprised , that at the beginning I freaked out .
" What ?
What ?
How ?
What the fuck ? " was in my mind all the time .
Advertisement
When Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band came up , my first impression was that the sound had more thump than the stereo mix .
A lot more thump , for a lack of a better word .
It was like someone was beating me with a hammer .
It was kind of noisy , but it filled my head and pushed me in a way the stereo version did n't .
Advertisement
Then good old Ringo — my favorite Beatle — came up singing With A Little Help From My Friends .
Same effect .
It felt weird , but so much better .
I kept coming back to the stereo versions for comparison and , before I noticed , I was thinking : " These sounds a lot weaker .
These sound artificial . "
Gone was the separation of instruments in the right and left channel too , which now feels so wrong to me .
The fact is that it was artificial , since stereo was a novelty back then :
Most people still listened to music in mono and stereo was the " new thing . "
As a result , producers overused it , just for the sake of it , like when 3D cinema came out and everything was an excuse to fire arrows and rocks and monsters at the public .

I definitely liked the way the mono version sounded — a lot more , even while I knew the stereo version till the last beat and note .
LSD came up : same result .
The sound is crisper and nearer .
The bass a lot better .
Again that special thump , even while this is such a delicate song .
Getting Better gets better , and so does the rest , Fixing a Hole , She 's Leaving Home , Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ...
I just could n't have enough .
But that was n't all .
In the mono version you can hear stuff that is not in the stereo version .
And not just bits , but quite a lot of things .
Instruments , notes , even lyrics .
Take the reprise version of Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band :
It is full of shouting — Lennon going bananas at the end , and other bits at the beginning — that is not in the stereo mix .
Advertisement
Maybe it 's the novelty of listening to a " new " take on something that I know by heart , but I doubt it .
As an experience , I like it a lot better .
So much that I 'm dying to get FLAC versions of good vinyl rips — or the remastered mono versions , as soon as they come out .
And while your taste may be different , from now on this is the version I 'm keeping in my iPod .
Listening Test :
It 's music tech week at Gizmodo .
Clearly much more needs to be done to convince bone - headed public transit employees that talking on a cell phone -- or worse , texting -- while operating a subway car or commuter train has dire consequences for them .
That it has dire consequences for passengers is already understood .
Forty - eight passengers and one text - happy driver were injured in Boston last night when the latter decided that messaging his girlfriend was more important than applying the brake that would have prevented a collision with another trolley .
Both vehicles were carrying baseball fans , including children , toward Fenway Park when the accident occurred .
In September , a Los Angeles train wreck that killed 25 people was blamed on the driver 's use of his cell phone .
" It 's difficult for me to contain my outrage , " said Daniel A. Grabauskas , general manager of the MBTA , according to the Boston Globe .
" We let our employees know there is a zero - tolerance policy for any type of electronic device . "
Grabouskas should n't be trying to contain his outrage , he should be channeling it toward any and all additional measures necessary to accomplish what this " zero tolerance policy " obviously has not .
The as - yet - unidentified driver , who has been on the job 22 months , needs to be fired as soon as the paperwork can be prepared .
His union can demonstrate their concern for public safety and common sense by backing the dismissal without the usual knee - jerk fussing .
Boston Police should file every charge they can reasonably muster .
The 48 injured passengers will sue both the driver and the state , naturally , which means that my fellow Massachusetts taxpayers and I will pay for this numbskull 's recklessness .
Although the focus here , it 's not just public transportation employees who need to give up texting while driving cold turkey .
All 50 states need to pass laws making texting while driving illegal ; 10 states -- Alaska , Arkansas , California , Connecticut , Louisiana , Minnesota , New Jersey , Utah , Virginia and Washington , and the District of Columbia , have already done so .
Causing an accident while texting should be a felony akin to drunken driving , given that that it 's as dangerous if not more so , according to one study .
Particular attention needs to be paid to dissuading teenagers , about half of whom in one survey admitted to texting while driving .
Congress needs to pass a law withholding federal highway funds from any state that refuses to crack down .
The politics should be easy here , as an astounding 89 percent of the public in one poll said they favor such laws .
One last thought :
If the driver 's girlfriend -- the one he was communicating with when he should have been avoiding a collision -- has any sense she 'll send him a text message : " We 're through . "
She can do better .
( Update , 7:45 p.m. :
That 's a good start : Head of Boston transit says operators will no longer be allowed to even bring their phones on board .
" Leave it at home .
Leave it in your car .
Leave it with a friend .
Leave it in a locker .
But you are not to get on board that bus , or board a trolley , or a train to operate that train and have a cellphone on your person or in the cab .
Period , " he said . )
SUPERIOR - Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer wants federal lawmakers to pass land - swap legislation that would pave the way for a copper - mining project in Superior .
Brewer voiced her support for the Resolution Copper Mining project Thursday during a tour of the site .
" While some states have been blessed with oil , others with valuable forest , Arizona has been blessed with rich copper reserves , " Brewer said .
" Copper has done so much over the history of Arizona to provide economic growth , and this copper project spurs economic development far into our future . "
Project backers refer to the mine as " Arizona 's low - cost stimulus plan . "
The venture is expected to generate thousands of jobs and millions a year in taxes that would flow into federal , state and local coffers .
Project backers anticipate an economic impact of $ 46.4 billion over the life of the project .
That is equal to " two NFL Super Bowls per year , " Brewer said .
The 3,000 - acre mine site in Tonto National Forest is thought to contain the largest undeveloped deposit of high - grade copper in the world .
Attempts by Resolution Copper to acquire the site have been delayed by environmentalists , Native American protests and a corruption scandal involving former Rep. Rick Renzi .
But David Salisbury , president and CEO of Resolution Copper , remains positive about the most recent incarnation of the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act .
Salisbury said the bill contains " strong provisions , " including the protection of Apache Leap , a rock formation considered sacred by native people .
Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain introduced the legislation in February .
There has been little action on the legislation since then .
The Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation
Act of 2009 includes a transfer of land from the federal government to Resolution Copper for mining .
In return , Resolution Copper would transfer to the government more than 5,500 acres of conservation lands .
Salisbury said tandem legislation may soon be introduced in the House :
His group has been in talks with Rep .
Ann Kirkpatrick , who took over Renzi 's district in January .
The company has claim to the land about 3 miles east of Superior in the historic Pioneer Mining District , where workers are installing a shaft to reach a depth of 7,000 feet .
About 680 feet have been installed so far .
Even if the land swap was fast - tracked , the first batch of copper would n't show up until 2020 .
The project is expected to have a life span of about 60 years .
" To ensure we better face the economic cycles of tomorrow , Arizona needs to establish a strong economic foundation comprised of development projects that generate sustainable economic output and new jobs , " Brewer said .
" The Resolution Copper project is the type . . . to ensure a strong economic environment for our future generations . "

Ever wonder how many trees are cut down just so you can get more junk mail in your mailbox ?
The average person in the US receives nearly 11 pieces of junk mail each week , or 560 pieces a year .
This amounts to 4.5 million tons of junk mail yearly , of which 44 % goes straight to the landfill unopened and unread .
Here are some more facts :
100 million trees are cut down each year to produce junk mail .
1 million trees offset 48,000,000 pounds of carbon emissions .
Eliminating junk mail in the US would offset 480,000 cars .
Conclusions
These numbers only reflect the amount of carbon emissions offset by the raw materials alone .
They do not take into account all of the carbon emissions created in transporting the trees from the forest to the pulp mills , much less the emissions generated in manufacturing the paper .
Nor do they take into account the carbon emissions created in distributing the junk mail via mail - trucks , planes , and cars nationwide .
It ’s safe to say that were we to include those factors in our equation , the actual emissions created through junk mail would easily be in the millions of cars , perhaps in the tens of millions .
Anyone want to work on that formula ?
How to Stop Receiving Junk Mail

London 's metropolitan police are waterboarding marijuana suspects , says a police officer .
Six members of London 's metropolitan police force are the focus of a criminal investigation after a corruption probe revealed allegations by a serving officer that detectives waterboarded suspects allegedly caught with a " large amount " of marijuana …
" [ British ] papers gave varying accounts of the exact technique used by police , with the Times saying that officers poured water on a cloth and placed it over a suspect 's face to simulate the experience of drowning , " reported the Associated Press .
" The Daily Mail said police officers repeatedly dunked the suspects ' heads in buckets of water .
The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear . "

Let 's say that Bob had a loan with Mellon Bank .
The Loan is for $ 200,000 for a house and Bob pays 6 % interest .
The house is collateral , meaning Mellon gets the house if Bob defaults .
But this house was valued at $ 275,000 , so what is the worry ?
So now Mellon Bank has " mortgage paper " , which is an asset .
They can sell the mortgage to anyone they wish .
Bob will then be required to pay the purchaser , who will get the benefit of the 6 % interest .
It 's an investment which may ( or may not ) make more money in the future .
A good idea if Mellon needs money immediately .
But ol '
Bob does n't have the money to pay this mortgage .
At the same time , the house value has greatly reduced to $ 150,000 .
Bob still owes $ 199,000 .
If Bob defaults on this , Mellon will only be able to recover a portion of their money back .
The mortgage paper has now become illiquid ( the house can't pay the mortgage ) .
Mellon is now unable to sell it .
Why would somebody pay for an asset that guarantees you will lose money ?
That mortgage has become a " toxic asset " .
The relief , though , may be temporary as the main contribution to growth was from shrinking imports ( adding 1.6 percentage points ) , not typically a sign of a robust economy .
The main drag was business investment ( shaving 1.1 points ) , a signal that the outlook for jobs is likely to darken further .
'' We 've dodged the recession bullet for the time being , but in reality we 've had five quarters of sub - trend growth and unemployment has gone up in that period , '' Commonwealth Bank chief economist Michael Blythe said .
'' So while we might not be officially able to tick off recession , to all intents and purposes , we are there . ''
The GDP figures come a day after the Reserve Bank left interest rates on hold at 3 per cent , with Governor Glenn Stevens warning the economy was '' contracting ' ' and that the central bank would slash rates further '' if needed . ''
The national accounts figures were '' stronger than the RBA was expecting , and it 's reinforcing that ' on - hold for the time being ' message , '' Mr Blythe said .
Investors , though , liked the news that Australia was not joining the list of countries in recession - for now at least .
The dollar jumped a quarter of a US cent to 82.2 US cents .
Australian stocks also gained on the news , extending their advance for the day to 0.8 per cent .
By state , NSW 's demand eased 0.2 per cent in the first quarter , seasonally adjusted .
Victoria slumped 2.1 per cent in the quarter , while Queensland 's fell 3.1 per cent .
Western Australia 's demand slumped 2.3 per cent , while Tasmania 's fell 2.5 per cent .
I do n't think we 're out of the woods yet Trade numbers for the March quarter yesterday threw many economists ' models out of whack .
A 2.7 per cent jump in exports alone added 0.6 percentage points to quarterly growth .
Combined with a 7 per cent fall in imports , Australia 's current account deficit narrowed to $ 4.6 billion from $ 6.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Excluding the farm sector , the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter .
On a year - to - year basis , the overall growth rate was 0.4 per cent .
The December quarter year - on - year growth rate was revised up , to 0.8 per cent , from 0.3 per cent .
The economy is yet to gain the full benefit of Federal Government spending , totaling about $ 52 billion before last month 's budget .
Rate cuts from the central bank - which have more than halved the official rate since September - are also yet to flow through fully .
Mortgage holders have saved about $ 1000 a month as banks passed on most of the rate cuts .
Indeed , household final spending added 0.3 percentage points to the quarterly growth tally , as families spent some of the government largesse .
Not out of the woods
Against those positives , though , are several major drags on demand , particularly from businesses that have postponed or cancelled projects .
' ' I do n't think we 're out of the woods yet , " said ICAP economist Adam Carr .
'' I still think the unemployment rate is going to rise but the data suggest the unemployment rate will be more modest . "
Still , the numbers suggest '' the economy is markedly healthier ' ' than originally expected .
Today , data from Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries showed car sales dropped 15 per cent in the year to May , an improvement from the 24 per cent fall in the year - to - April figure , but still well within negative territory .
Today , data from Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries showed car sales dropped 15 per cent in the year to May , an improvement from the 24 per cent fall in the year - to - April figure , but still well within negative territory .
Also , initial reports from David Jones and Myer 's half yearly clearance sales , suggest they have received a lukewarm reception from bargain hunters .
Other definitions of a recession exist , accounting for the slowdown Australia is experiencing .
The National Bureau of Economic Research in the US defines a recession as " a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in production , employment , real income , and other indicators . "
Australia 's economy continues to outpace most of its rivals .
The US economy shrank by 2.5 per cent in the year to March , while the euro zone contracted 4.6 per cent year - on - year .
Japan was one of the worst performers , with GDP withering by 9.7 per cent over the same period .
Loading
SuperFetch is a technology in Windows Vista and onwards that is often misunderstood .
I decided to delve into this technology to see what it is all about , and to dispel some of the myths surrounding this feature .
Very succinctly put , SuperFetch is a technology which allows Windows to manage the amount of random access memory in the machine it runs on more efficiently .
SuperFetch is part of Windows ’ memory manager ; a less capable version , called PreFetcher , is included in Windows XP .
SuperFetch tries to make sure often - accessed data can be read from the fast RAM instead of the slow hard drive .
SuperFetch ’ goals
SuperFetch has two goals : it decreases boot time , and makes sure applications that you use the most load more efficiently .
SuperFetch also takes timing into account , in that it will adapt itself to your usage patterns .
Let ’s focus on decreasing boot times first .
During the Windows boot process , the same files need to be accessed at different times .
SuperFetch records which data and files need to be accessed at which times , and stores this data in a trace file .
During subsequent boots , this information is used to make the loading of said data / files more efficient , resulting in shorter boot times .
SuperFetch performs more tasks to make the boot process more efficient .
It also interacts with the defragmenter to make sure that the files accessed during the boot process are stored on the disk in the order they are accessed in .
It performs this as a routine task every three days ; the specific file layout is stored in / Windows / Prefetch / Layout.ini .
SuperFetch ’ second goal is to make applications launch faster .
SuperFetch does this by pre-loading your most often used applications in your main memory , based on not only usage patterns , but also on when you use them .
For instance , if you have the same routine every morning ( Chrome – Mail – Miranda – blu ) , SuperFetch will pre-load these into memory in the morning .
If your evening routine is different ( for instance , it includes Word , Excel , and Super Awesome Garden Designer ) , SuperFetch will adapt , and load those in memory instead during the evening .
SuperFetch for applications basically operates in the same way as the boot variant ; it traces what files are accessed by an application during the first ten seconds of said application ’s startup , which can then be used to load the proper data in memory at appropriate times .
SuperFetch data for applications is stored in / Windows / Prefetch ( the various .pf files ) .
Windows has always included a built - in caching mechanism , but this one is quite limited .
All it basically does is keep application data in memory after its termination , which allows applications to be loaded faster right after quitting them .
This caching mechanism is helpful , but limited – for instance , a reboot obviously flushes all data in RAM .
In addition , cached data will eventually drop out of RAM if other applications push it out of RAM .
SuperFetch also has other advantages , Mark Russinovich details some of them .
SuperFetch myths
There are a lot of myths going around about SuperFetch , the most predominant probably having to do with how Task Manager reports memory statistics .
If you open Task Manager ( in Windows 7 ) , it ’ll tell you Total , Cached , Available , and Free .
The problems arise from the “ Cached ” figure , since this figure is generally substantially higher than the “ Free ” figure .
When people look at the Task Manager , and they see the figure for “ Cached ” compared to the number of “ Free ” , people assume that only very little of their memory is available for the applications they are about to launch .
What they forget is that the Cache filled by SuperFetch and the standard caching mechanism runs on a lower priority ; in other words , memory requests by applications will always supersede SuperFetch .
In other words , whatever you see in the “ Cached ” figure is actually accessible to applications .
And this brings us to the question of what to do with RAM .
I have 4GB of main memory in my main desktop machine , and I would find it a total waste if the operating system did not use it to make my computing experience smoother .
Is n’t that why I got 4GB of top - quality RAM in the first place ?
To make my machine faster ?
This is exactly what SuperFetch does .
It ’s an intelligent mechanism that uses the RAM in a machine to its fullest potential to make computing a smoother experience .
The fact that SuperFetch ( and its related technology , ReadyBoost ) actually works , has already been confirmed by Tom ’s Hardware .
The key here is that the more RAM you have , the bigger the benefit SuperFetch delivers ; according to Tom ’s Hardware , Vista ’s sweet spot was about 2GB of RAM , but even at 1GB they noticed a positive difference .
Contrary to what many Windows tweaking guides on the internet tell you , SuperFetch does not impact your every day computing experience in a negative way .
SuperFetch makes often - used applications load fast – it does n’t make other applications load any slower .
As such , turning it off , as some guides advise you to do , can only result in a slowdown , not a speed up .
Another oft - made claim is that SuperFetch will make your boot times considerably longer , and that any advantages in application launch times are nullified by an increase in boot times .
Not only is this very debatable ( since SuperFetch also works for booting the operating system ) , you also have to ask yourself : what action do I perform more often , booting , or launching applications ?
Even if there was a trade - off , it ’s probably a worthwhile one .
Reducing application load times will have a more positive impact at the end of the day than reducing boot times would .
Conclusion
SuperFetch is something all operating systems should have .
I did n’t buy 4GB of top - notch RAM just to have it sit there doing nothing during times of low memory requirements .
SuperFetch makes my applications load faster , which is really important to me – I come from a BeOS world , and I like it when my applications load instantly .
SuperFetch ’ design makes sure that it does not impact the system negatively , but only makes the system smoother .
Because it runs at a low - priority , its cache does n’t take away memory from the applications you ’re running .
Leon Panetta warned of " exceptionally grave damage " to US security CIA Director Leon Panetta has warned that releasing certain documents on the interrogation of al - Qaeda suspects would gravely damage US security .
Mr Panetta made the submission in court papers presented to a US federal judge on Monday .
The CIA chief argued that releasing CIA information describing the tough interrogation methods used would reveal too much to America 's enemies .
Civil liberties activists have brought a lawsuit seeking the details .
Dozens of cables Legal action has already led to the unveiling of memos issued by the former Bush administration which authorised harsh interrogation methods such as simulated drowning - known as water - boarding .
But the CIA is trying to prevent the release of further documents including dozens of cable communications .
These describe in detail the methods used against terror suspects and what information was obtained from them .
In his submission to the court , Mr Panetta wrote : " I have determined that the disclosure of intelligence about al - Qaeda reasonably could be expected to result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security by informing our enemies of what we knew about them , and when , and in some instances , how we obtained the intelligence . "
The CIA chief also acknowledged that the CIA destroyed 92 video tapes of detainee interrogations which took place in 2002 .
Officials have already said that some of the tapes showed the " enhanced interrogation techniques " , which critics of the measures regard as torture .
A criminal investigation is underway into why they were destroyed .
Last month the CIA turned down a request by former Vice - President Dick Cheney to release secret documents as part of a campaign to show that harsh interrogation techniques had yielded key intelligence .
President Barack Obama is also attempting to block a court decision ordering the release of photos showing American troops abusing prisoners - reversing a previous decision to allow them to be published .
Mr Obama said last month he feared that publication would further inflame anti-American feelings in Iraq and Afghanistan

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A potential victim became a compassionate counselor during a recent robbery attempt , changing the would - be criminal 's mind -- and apparently his religion .
Surveillance video shows storekeeper Mohammad Sohail holding a robber at bay with a shotgun .
Storekeeper Mohammad Sohail was closing up his Long Island convenience store just after midnight on May 21 when -- as shown on the store 's surveillance video -- a man came in wielding a baseball bat and demanding money .
" He said , ' Hurry up and give me the money , give me the money ! ' and I said , ' Hold on ' , " Sohail recalled in a phone interview with CNN on Tuesday , after the store video and his story was carried on local TV .
Sohail said he reached under the counter , grabbed his gun and told the robber to drop the bat and get down on his knees .
" He 's crying like a baby , " Sohail said .
" He says , ' Do n't call police , do n't shoot me , I have no money , I have no food in my house . ' "
Amidst the man 's apologies and pleas , Sohail said he felt a surge of compassion .
He made the man promise never to rob anyone again and when he agreed , Sohail gave him $ 40 and a loaf of bread .
" When he gets $ 40 , he 's very impressed , he says , ' I want to be a Muslim just like you , ' " Sohail said , adding he had the would - be criminal recite an Islamic oath .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- A 19 - year - old woman who was wounded by Iranian paramilitary forces with clubs escaped with her camera and shared her photos with CNN -- after tricking a paramilitary soldier into thinking she had given him the images on a disk .
Members of the Basij paramilitary block a road leading to Freedom Square in Tehran .

The woman -- whose identity is being withheld by CNN -- said Sunday that on the previous day " the streets were full of guards and policemen . "
" They were hitting everyone , and everywhere was fire because of the tear gas they throw at us , " she said .
She was walking to Freedom Square in Tehran with a group of fellow demonstrators , but the Basij -- voluntary paramilitary forces that answer to the government -- would n't let them get through , she said .
They warned the group to turn around .
" They said , ' Just run , and do n't even walk . '
We were just running away -- and we were hit , of course , " she said .
It was too crowded to flee quickly , she said .
" I said , ' I can't run .
How can I run ?
It 's so crowded in here . '

" He hit me and he was twice [ as big ] as me -- he was so big .
And I said , ' You want to hit me ? '
And he said , ' Yes ' and then he hit me with a club . "
She told CNN a Basij member hit her with a club , and then her foot was hit by a stone .
" Today I could n't go out because my foot was injured and I could n't run anymore .
And I was sure :
If I go out , I 'm going to die .
So I did n't go out today . "
The group fought back by throwing stones at the soldiers , she said .
" We had nothing to defend ourselves .
Just the smallest stones we throw at them . "
There were many women among the crowd of demonstrators trying to get to Freedom Square , she said .
" We gave the boys the stones because we can't throw them so far .
We gave them the stones , and we said the slogans . "
The young woman said many in Iran think Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is lying about the results of the June 12 election , in which incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner with more than 62 percent of the vote .
" We do n't care who is the president now , " she said .
" We had rather [ opposition candidate Mir Hossein ] Moussavi , but now when our leader says it was fair and we know that it's not , I think that it 's about our country .
We want the truth . "
The young woman sent photos of Saturday 's incident to CNN via iReport .

At one point when she was in her car , a member of the Basij stopped her and tried to get her photos , she said .
But she tricked him , giving him an empty memory card while keeping the one that held the images .
She said her father , after learning of all that had transpired , said to her , " I 'm so lucky that you 're alive . "

The global economy will contract sharply this year and recover only sluggishly in 2010 , the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday as it called on governments to sustain or even increase fiscal stimulus next year .
To be honest , I was kind of dreading it , but I knew I had to get to it sooner or later .
I was asked to sign a release form for a couple of scenes I was in in a soon - to - be - released film about the band Ministry , .
I had asked to see a screener , and it had arrived and was sitting next to my computer unopened for nearly a week .
The director called and asked what I thought .
So a few nights ago I stuck it on and ... wow !
I was shocked !
It had taken over a decade to make , and ... well , it was well worth the effort .
It 's the real thing -- the kind of no -holds - barred tell - all story that a band like the Rolling Stones can onlythey had the courage to have made .
I expect to write more about the film as we get closer to release date ( next year , I think ) .
I 'm only bringing it up now because I was reminded of one of my little scenes by a news story the following day about the IMF 's economic forecasts , a steep drop in global output and a rebound " later this year .
" Before I was a blogger , I was a president .
I ran Reprise Records , a division of AOL - TimeWarner .
One of my jobs was to do the kinds of projections that millions of businesses do that go into national and international forecasts like the dire IMF one linked above .
I spoke about the forecasting inA useless political hack from corporate headquarters -- a former hatchetman for New York Governor Hugh Carey who had been recruited by our corporation to do the dirty work involved in axing the failing Atari division of TimeWarner had done so well that he was rewarded with a sinecure , a make - believe job as the head of a nonentity , the Warner Music Group .
Technically , he was my boss 's boss .
But before he was fired , he called me and started screaming because the projected new album by Ministry had n't been delivered and he needed the 500,000 units .
Keep in mind that I had to project what the album would sell , not just before it was recorded , but .
The music business is n't like a show factory .
But the new head of the Warner Music Group did n't know that and could n't quite understand why it is n't .
I tried explaining ; he kept screaming .
Finally I fessed up :
The lead singer had been shooting smack for months and had to get into rehab before he could complete the album .
Shock was followed by accusations .
Why , he demanded , was I working with drug users ? was wondering why I was wasting my time on the phone with a clueless politician .
I told him that all artists are drug users , that it helps their creativity , and that he would have to understand that if he planned a career in the music industry .
He hung up on me , and fortunately was fired before he got around to firing me .
I suspect , though I have no way of knowing , that the projecting and forecasting that goes into putting together the numbers that the IMF -- and , more important , Wall Street -- gets from shoe factories and car companies and investment firms are more conducive to reliable predictability than the multibillion - dollar entertainment industries ' .
It allows them to put out statements like this : A lot goes into those forecasts : wishful thinking , cluelessness , all sorts of pressures , hopes for those mouthwatering bonuses you 've been reading about lately , budgets , dreams .
Science ?
Not so much , I suspect .

This had to be intentional on someones part , I googled and searched wikipedia for a Pansy Kidd with no results beyond the middle school itself ... unless the person who got a school named after them is just that obscure .
Oh nvm I found it on the school 's website they should have included her middle name : " The name of our school originated back in the early nineteen hundreds .
In 1912 a lady named Pansy Ingle Kidd came to Poteau .
She was a graduate of Indiana University with a Masters ' Degree in English and Library Science .
Pansy
Ingle became a third grade teacher until 1915 when she married Frank Kidd .
Since a regulation of the 1915 school board was not to hire married female teachers , she had to quit teaching .
Pansy did not teach again until 1921 when the regulation was finally changed .
For 40 years she taught with all her heart , and was called by many , " Dean of Poteau 's Teachers . "
Mrs. Kidd taught whatever her superintendent needed her to teach .
During her tenure she was a teacher of Science , Math , and English , Librarian , Counselor , and Principal .
She organized the beginning of the Junior High School .
This same school was later named in honor of Mrs. Kidd .
Pansy Kidd taught for 42 years , and retired in 1960 .
She lived in Poteau until her death in 1978 .
Our school is indeed proud to be named for such an outstanding educator . "

ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl gets the following out of Cheney :
KARL : Did you authorize the tactics that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ?
CHENEY : I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , as the agency , in effect , came in and wanted to know what they could and could n't do .
And they talked to me , as well as others , to explain what they wanted to do .
And I supported it .
KARL : In hindsight , do you think any of those tactics that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others went too far ?
CHENEY : I do n't .
KARL : And on KSM , one of those tactics , of course , widely reported was waterboarding .
And that seems to be a tactic we no longer use .
Even that you think was appropriate ?
CHENEY : I do .
Notice that the first statement is an absolute lie , proven by the Senate report .
The decision to torture individuals was made by Bush and Cheney before the CIA ever asked for legal cover for the torture they had been ordered to commit .
The torture and abuse was planned before even the January 2002 presidential memo that authorized torture :
In December 2001 , more than a month before the President signed his memorandum , the Department of Defense ( DoD ) General Counsel ’s Office had already solicited information on detainee “ exploitation ” from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , an agency whose expertise was in training American personnel to withstand interrogation techniques considered illegal under the Geneva Conventions .
But Cheney 's open , proud defense of a torture technique , waterboarding , that has always and everywhere been understood as torture means he stands vulnerable to war crime prosecutions .
Until he is tried , convicted and jailed , the rule of law in this country stands fatally compromised .

After months of hype , the trailer of the biopic about Coco Chanel ’s early years , Coco Avant Chanel , has finally arrived .
Starring Audrey Tatou and Alessandro Nivola , directed by Anne Fontaine .
The trailer below is all in French with no subtitles since the film opens in France on April 22 , before its U.S. debut ( which is called Coco Before Chanel ) , but that is no reason not to watch .
We ’ve retained , well , practically none of the French we learned in college , but from this trailer we can deduce that the film includes love , sex , wild parties , fighting , spectacular cinematography , and lovely costumes which Karl Lagerfeld oversaw .
A great way to help the needy people is through travel .
While travelling you can share your knowledge and ideas with people .
You can help them voluntarily .

Since the release of the Fight Night Round 4 demo several days ago , fight fans have had a few concerns as to the gameplay and overall mechanics .
It ’s nothing like Fight Night Round 3 , and a few users have been unhappy with EA .
Brian “ Brizzo ” Hayes , producer for Round 4 , has addressed some of the issues that gamers have encountered at the EA Forums :
Update : 05-15-2009
Couple of quick things that I can speak about right away .
First , for those interested in timelines , the demo was locked down about 7 weeks ago in early , early April .
As you might imagine , the final weeks of development is when a lot of the fine tuning and polishing gets completed .
For example , off the top off my head :
1. Stamina .
Stamina loss is a little higher and stamina regeneration is a little slower .
2. Punch connections .
Landed punch collisions are cleaner and hit reactions have more intensity .
3. Cuts and Swelling .
The onset is very fast in the demo .
In the final version , depending on your susceptibility to damage you find that you might have several fights without incurring any significant damage – but then when it does happen , it really affects the way your fight plays out between rounds .
4. Punch Animations .
Tweaks on many punches occurred after the demo was out the door to address performance / technique issues .
5. Gameplay Audio .
The mix in the demo is not great and we know that .
Lots of audio work was done in the final 6 - 7 weeks and it sounds much better .
6. Counter Punch Window .
The counter window is roughly the same length , maybe a little shorter in the final version .
But we tuned how often you can open it up .
They do n’t happen as often overall .
7. AI Difficulty & Exploits .
The final weeks were spent heavily invested in finding AI exploits like the hook spamming , body punch spamming , haymaker spamming , etc .
It ’s tightened up quite a bit .
Difficulty on the demo is pretty low , but we did that on purpose so people would n’t get annihilated their first few fights .
8. Foot Speed & Locomotion .
Little bit faster overall , but also behaves much better changing directions and maintaining distance to opponent when moving laterally .
9. HUD & Settings .
There is an option to turn off HUD in final game .
Options to change camera too .
Gameplay sliders to adjust power , damage , speed and CPU behaviors .
10 . Miscellaneous Hatton has his new tattoos .
Shane Mosley ’s name is spelled correctly .
As mentioned previously , several of the boxers overall ratings have been updated / balanced .
Hope that helps .
More info to come when its available .

To the Editor :
As a family physician for 47 years , I totally agree with Paul Krugman ’s May 22 column , “ Blue Double Cross . ”
Health care insurers are more bureaucratic than any government agency .
They often deny choice of doctor , and refuse to pay for care .
My experience with the government programs , Medicare and Medicaid , is that the reimbursement for services may be low , but there is one uniform set of rules to follow .
Each health care insurer has a different set of rules .
The reimbursement for services varies widely and the doctor sometimes does n’t know where to send the patient for laboratory or other tests .
Furthermore , the physician often does n’t know whether the prescriptions he or she writes will be covered .
As Mr. Krugman reports , insurance companies are still bad for your health .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - Canadian police were on the search on Monday for a brazen thief who snatched a take - away meal while making a naked run past a fast food restaurant ’s drive - though window .
An employee of a Langley , British Columbia , Wendy ’s restaurant was handing food to a customer waiting in her car when a naked man ran between them , taking off with her fries , and leaving little evidence behind , according to police .
“ Other than an age range , neither woman could provide further description , ” police said in a press release .
The man , believed to be in his 20s , jumped into a waiting van , which sped away from the scene during the weekend incident , police said .

Hi Kids ,
I received an email on Friday from Paul Sparrow @ Newseum .
He requested that reposting of Newseum front page images be discontinued on this tumblr .
I will comply to that request , so posting will be halted indefinitely starting tomorrow .
Hopefully , we can come to a resolution so that posting can continue here .
I will try and state my case as best as I can .
There seems to be a copyright issue , even though I ’ve never received a complaint directly from the listed newspapers in the past 2 years .
We ’ll see what happens .
Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films , director Edward D. Wood Jr. is a Hollywood outcast .
Nevertheless , with the help of the formerly famous Bela Lugosi and a devoted cast and crew of show - business misfits who believe in Ed's off - kilter vision , the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life .
Despite a lack of critical or commercial success , Ed and his friends manage to create an oddly endearing series of extremely low - budget films .

A team of scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s ( DOE ) Brookhaven National Laboratory ( BNL ) , in collaboration with researchers from the University of Delaware and Yeshiva University , have developed a novel catalyst which could enable efficient production of ethanol - powered fuel cells .
The scientists , whose research results were recently published in last month ’s edition of Nature Materials , say the new catalyst succeeds in accomplishing two previously unreachable steps necessary to oxidize ethanol and produce clean energy in fuel cell reactions .
Radoslav Adzic
( Credit : BNL ) Hydrogen fuel cells , which generate electricity in the process of converting hydrogen and oxygen into water , have long been known as difficult to produce , due to issues related to hydrogen production , storage , and transport .
These complications led researchers to consider using hydrogen - rich compounds , specifically liquid ethanol , in what is today known as the “ Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell . ”
“ Ethanol is one of the most ideal reactants for fuel cells , ” says Radoslav Adzic , senior chemist at BNL .
“ It ’s easy to produce , renewable , nontoxic , relatively easy to transport , and it has a high energy density .
In addition , with some alterations , we could reuse the infrastructure that ’s currently in place to store and distribute gasoline . ”
Yet despite the above advantages , ethanol does have a major setback – its molecules achieve very slow and insufficient oxidation , a process responsible for breaking the compound into hydrogen ions and electrons .
This has previously been the bottleneck point for efficient production of ethanol fuel cells , as scientists were unsuccessful in finding a proper catalyst that will be able to break the bonds between ethanol ’s carbon atoms .
Model of a ternary electrocatalyst
for ethanol oxidation consisting
of platinum - rhodium clusters on
a surface of tin dioxide .
This catalyst
can split the carbon - carbon bond
and oxidize ethanol to carbon
dioxide within fuel cells ( Credit : BNL )
The new electrocatalyst , which is made of platinum and rhodium atoms on carbon - supported tin dioxide nanoparticles , was proven capable of breaking carbon bonds at room temperature and efficiently oxidizing ethanol into carbon dioxide – this as opposed to common catalysts , which produce acetalhyde and acetic acid as their main reaction products and are thus unsuitable for power generation purposes .
“ The ability to split the carbon - carbon bond and generate CO2 at room temperature is a completely new feature of catalysis , ” Adzic said .
“ There are no other catalysts that can achieve this at practical potentials . ”
Brookhaven researchers say their ternary catalyst ’s structural and electronic properties , which were determined using x-ray absorption techniques combined with data from transmission electron microscopy analyses at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at BNL , show it to be applicable to a variety of other alternative energy solutions .
“ These findings can open new possibilities of research not only for electrocatalysts and fuel cells but also for many other catalytic processes , ” Adzic said .
The developed catalyst is currently undergoing extensive testing , as scientists are assessing its performance in a real fuel cell .
TFOT has previously covered a number of innovative technologies for power generation , including sugar - powered batteries , which were developed by Sony ; the world ’s smallest fuel cell , invented at University of Illinois at Urbane - Champaign , and a new bio - fuel powered sports car developed by the Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg .

This story really takes “ Onward , Christian Soldier ” to a new level .
An Army chaplain appears to have come up with a brilliant loophole in the military ’s clear ban on religious proselytizing and has called on his Christian soldiers to go out and spread the word of Jesus to the dirty Muslim heathens in Afghanistan .
A report by Al Jazeera English shows soldiers in Afghanistan passing around Bibles in Pashto and Dari , the languages of Afghanistan , presumably to be distributed .
The chaplain leading the discussion acknowledges that “ proselytizing ” is against military rules , but one soldier says , “ you can give gifts “ .
Check out the video :
Here ’s how the video above was summarized :
[ T ]he chaplains appear to have found a way around the regulation known as General Order Number One .
“ Do we know what it means to proselytise ? ” Captain Emmit Furner , a military chaplain , says to the gathering .
“ It is General Order Number One , ” an unidentified soldier replies .
But [ Sergeant Jon ]
Watt says “ you ca n’t proselytise but you can give gifts “ .
Crooks and Liars has more :
After revelations that some American soldiers were given Bibles and encouraged to “ hunt people for Jesus , ” the Pentagon on Monday denied allegations that the U.S. military allows its personnel to seek the conversion of Afghans to Christianity .
But while the copies of the New Testament translated into Pashtun and jaw - dropping video from Bagram may seem like exceptions that prove the rule of American prohibition on proselytizing by the military , they are just the latest episodes in the disturbing rise in influence of Christian conservatives in the United States armed services …
In word and deed , evangelicals in recent years have aggressively boosted their visibility and influence within the American military .
An early warning came in 2003 in the guise of Lt. General William Boykin .
Boykin , who later became a deputy under secretary of defense , claimed during speeches to prayer groups and breakfasts that militant Islamists sought to destroy America ” because we ’re a Christian nation . ”
General Boykin also explained to evangelical audiences that Muslims worship an ” idol ” and not ” a real God . ”
While President Bush expressed his disagreement ( noting Boykin “ ” did n’t reflect my opinion ” and “ it just does n’t reflect what the government thinks ” ) , Boykin remained on the job .
Gee , I wonder where some Muslims get the impression that the U.S. is waging a holy war against Islam ?
After all , we ’re just acting to save their dirty heathen souls from the fires of hell , right ?
One would think that these would - be soldiers cum missionaries might think the better of this idea , considering how , ahem , “ upset ” some Muslims get when they see white , Western Christians trying to convert their people away from Islam :
Taliban gunmen on a motorbike killed a Christian aid worker in the Afghan capital on Monday , and the militant group said it had targeted the woman because she was proselytizing …
Zabiullah Mujahid , a Taliban spokesman , claimed responsibility for the slaying , saying the woman was killed because she was spreading Christianity .
“ This woman came to Afghanistan to teach Christianity to people of Afghanistan , ” Mujahid told the Associated Press .
“ Our ( leaders ) issued a decree to kill this woman .
This morning our people killed her in Kabul . ”
Not to mention the fact that suborning apostasy is a crime in Afghanistan :
Doctored photos of US President Barack Obama wearing a kaffiyah ( traditional Arab headdress ) with a caption reading " Jew - hating anti-Semite " will be circulated in the coming days by Israeli right - wing activists in protest of the growing US pressure on Israel to halt settlement activity , even that which is attributed to " natural growth . "
The activists ,
Ynet has learned , plan to circulate another doctored photo showing Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad against the backdrop of a nuclear explosion .
The heading reads " Yes , We Can . "
I thought Lord of the Rings fans were crazy , but then I did some digging and discovered LOTR ai n’t got nothing on Star Wars when it comes to spending money on really cool expensive stuff .
Well , a womp rat could ’ve figured that out , but nonetheless , here are some of the most expensive but cool things I found , excluding original toys still in their original packaging .
Jabba the Hut by Sideshow Collectibles
Jabba the Hutt fans have a choice to make .
They can go with the above statue ( about $ 120 ) , throne environment ( several hundred more ) , and creature pack ( with Jabba ’s famous lizard monkey ) ( about $ 35 ) , all made by Sideshow Collectibles and SOLD SEPARATELY .
Also available are other characters seen in the mix , like Bib Fortuna ( $ 54.99 ) , Leia as Boushh ( $ 59.99 ) , and a secondary creature pack for about $ 32 .
OR , you can get this :
Gentle Giant Jabba Statue
This one costs about $ 200 , and includes that green dancer chick and a Jawa , but to me , does n’t look as good .
However , Gentle Giant does have this :
Jabba ’s Band
… which Sideshow Collectibles does n’t have , so if you go with the first version of Jabba that I suggest , and you want to fill in the blanks with the Gentle Giant band , go for it .
There are a couple of other versions of Jabba the Hutt out there , such as the one from Attakus and a 30 - inch version made by Mario Chiodo .
Han Solo in Carbonite
Not a big fan of this but have to mention it for the folks who want to get every character in that Jabba sequence .
Costs about $ 200 .
Check out the Lego version of this .
Salacious B. Crumb Life Size Figure
At no point in Return of the Jedi do I remember this dude ’s name being mentioned , and I was disappointed when I learned what it was .
The little lizard monkey that hangs with Jabba the Hutt is named Salacious B. Crumb ( ick ) .
A life - size statue was originally $ 350 but he ’s sold out and going for far higher on Ebay .
I want this , but only if I can get it for cheap .
I ’ve seen this go as high as $ 629 .
Gamorrean Guard Cold - Cast Statue
This 15 - inch Attakus statue is great .
Price range : $ 385 -$ 550 .
Ebay is your best bet .
Speeder Bike and Scout Trooper
Screw the statue , I want the real thing .
Of all the vehicles in Star Wars , the speeder bike in Return of the Jedi looks like the most fun .
Costs about $ 800 .
Luke & Yoda – Dagobah Training
There ’s something creepy about this statue .
I think it ’s because it ’s an 18 - inch version of Luke and humans just are n’t as cool as creatures or robots .
Ambush on Hoth Statue
Now this thing is friggin awesome .
It ’s got the Wampa , Tauntaun and Luke .
It ’s 18 inches high and costs about $ 300 .
This thing also happens to be available in Faux - Bronze for $ 349.99 .
Gentle Giant has another version of the Wampa for $ 230.00 , but it looks downright silly .
Luke and Han on Tauntauns
Finally , here ’s something that Gentle Giant that made that ’s cool .
Sold separately , Tauntaun statues with Luke and Han .
Gentle Giant Rancor & Handler Statue
I ’m a big fan of the Rancor and I want this .
Costs about $ 295 .
Yoda Life Size Replica
This one is made by Rubies and it is a 1:1 replica , and it do n’t get better than that .
Well worth the $ 500 for the Jedi Master .
Princess Leia as Jabba ’s Slave
I ’d like to say “ GOTTA GET THIS ” but her face do n’t look so hot .
There ’s also this version , from Kotobukiya .
Yeah , me likey this one better .
Wicket W. Warrick Statue
Unlike everyone else I know , I ’m a big fan of the Ewoks , but there ’s not really much out there for high - dollar collectors other than the Wicket W. Warrick statue , by Attakus ( It ’s sold out , so good luck finding one ) .
And this dude only stands 8 inches tall .
Where ’s the 1:1 scale of this figure ?
Where are the life - size dolls ?
There ’s a market for Ewok lovers … deliver the goods already !
Dejarik Holochess Set
This thing is kinda neat … would n’t buy it though , even though it ’s relatively cheap .
IG - 88 ArtFX Statue
This dude is kind of neat .
I had the original action figure and enjoyed it .
This statue costs about $ 100 from Kotobukiya .
There are also a number of lightsabers and weapons available in the Star Wars universe .

Masks are also a big thing in Star Wars .
Once I bought a Don Post Darth Vader mask at Target , but it ’s possibly the cheapest one out there and I only bring it out for Halloween to display by the door for the trick - or - treaters to see .
Here are some cool , better quality ones that I found , made by Rubies :
Darth Vader
Stormtrooper
Scouttrooper
Bobba Fett
Again , there are MANY other masks out there , but I ’d say these are the best quality .
Now , on to the busts .
I hate busts because they are creepy .
It ’s like chopping someone ’s head off and displaying it on your grand piano .
But for Star Wars , I ’ll list the ones that I found to be somewhat interesting , mainly because they are 1:1 scale , which is as good as it gets .
From top , left to right , Admiral Ackbar $ 500 .
Greedo $ 600 , but that ’s only good for target practice ( haha ) .
Bossk $ 529 .
Darth Maul $ 600 .
Palpatine $ 500 .
General Grievous $ 500 .
Check out what else I found :
LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collection Series Darth Maul Bust
Most of the stuff I ’ve mentioned so far is relatively cheap .
Let ’s move on to the very high dollar stuff .
Millennium Falcon & Death Star Resin Set
I like this because it has the characters hanging around , but it costs about $ 3150 .
Millennium Falcon Studio Scale Model
This one is from Master Replicas .
Costs about $ 2300 .
The most expensive item I can find is an $ 18000 bronze statue of Darth Vader , at 1:2 scale that weighs 150 pounds .
Only 30 are being made .
If you ’re too cheap to buy that , then get the $ 5000 Vader bronze statue or Boba Fett for the same price ( as if either of them deserve to be bronzed , those evil jerks ) .
Saving the best for last , as noted in a previous article , Sideshow Collectibles has 1:1 scale replicas of C - 3PO and R2 - D2 available .
Buy R2 - D2 for $ 5450 and C - 3P0 for $ 5950 .
Using GNU Screen
Posted by Steve on Sun 17 Oct 2004 at 19:54
GNU Screen is an often overlooked application which allows you to run programs in a console section , detach from them and then later resume them .
They even keep running when you logout .
Part of the reason why the program is often overlooked is because it has a very complicated description .
The GNU Screen Homepage describes it as :
" Screen is a full - screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes , typically interactive shells .
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal ... [ snip ] "
Whilst that 's a very technically accurate description of the program it does n't tell most newcomers exactly what the program does .
Essentially GNU Screen is a windowing system for the console .
When you run it inside an xterm , or a remote SSH login , you can create multiple new windows all in the same session , switch between them , or view two or more at once .
In addition to this a screen session is independent of your connection , so you can connect from one location , run things inside a screen session then detach .
All the programs keep running and you can later reconnect and resume working right where you left off .
It 's the attaching and detaching that makes screen so useful as it allows you to start long running programs , leave them running in the background and later on come back to them .
This is very useful for things like console based IRC clients ( irssi - text for example ) .
Lets start with an example which make it easier to understand what 's going on .
If you run screen you will see the following text :

Send bugreports , fixes , enhancements , t- shirts , money , beer & pizza to screen@uni-erlangen.de [ Press Space or Return to end . ]
Press space and you will be presented with what looks like an ordinary shell window .
To test this run a command or two , for example :
skx@lappy : ~$ ls /tmp gconfd - skx keyring - 9hZRfE mapping - skx orbit - skx ssh- MDkRIT1001 skx@lappy : ~$
There you can see I 've run the command ls / tmp , and you can see the output .
Now we get to see the power of the program .
Press Ctrl+A , then d .
You will see a message saying that your screen session has been detached , and will be back at your original prompt :
skx@lappy : ~$ screen [ detached ] skx@lappy : ~$
So what happened to your shell ?
Well it 's still there !
Simply run screen - R and you will be back at the session you d etached from .
This shows you the basics of using the program , you 've learnt how to run a copy of screen , run a command inside of it and detach from it ( Ctrl + A d ) then reconnect ( screen - R ) .
This allows you to do a lot already , connect to a host from your office via ssh , start up screen and run your favourite text based IRC client .
At the end of the day you can detach from it - leaving it stil there to return to from your home machine .
But we 've only scratched the surface of what screen can do , remember we said that it could run multiple windows ?
Lets create another one .
Press Ctrl + a then c ( for create ) .
You 'll have a new fresh shell session .
Toggle between the two shells you should have by pressing Ctrl + a then Ctrl + a again .
You should see that you 're switching between two independent shell sessions .
If you press Ctrl + a then " you 'll see a list of the windows you have available to switch between .
This window list shows the window number on the left , along with the name of the window .
By default the windows will be named after the shell you are running , for example bash .
To rename the current window use Ctrl + a then A .
When it comes to time to close a window you have two choices , you can either type exit in the shell session to close it which will close that window too , or you can use Ctrl +a k to kill the current window .
As well as using one window to switch between you can display two , or more , windows at the same time !
Use Ctrl + a and S ( Capital 's ' for split ) and your window will split in two .
You can move between the two halves of the window with Ctrl + a and TAB .
By default the new window will be empty , but you can switch another window into that place by using Ctrl + a repeatedly , as we 've already covered .
To make it more obvious which window you 're currently working in you can setup a small status bar across the bottom of the window which show you how many windows you have open , and which one you are working with .
To do this create a file . screenrc in your home area and place the following inside it :
# An alternative hardstatus to display a bar at the bottom listing the # windownames and highlighting the current windowname in blue .
( This is only # enabled if there is no hardstatus setting for your terminal ) hardstatus on hardstatus alwayslastline hardstatus string " %{.bW} %-w % {.rW}%n %t%{-}%+w %= %{.. G} %H %{.. Y} %m/%d %C%a "
( You can override all the default settings in your local file , or update the global file in /etc / screenrc to affect all users ) .
To sum up we 've seen that screen is a very powerful tool for executing commands that run for a long time , and running multiple programs all at the same time in a single session .
We 've not covered all the options , just enough to get started with .
Running man screen will give you lots more options .
Here 's a list of all the commands we 've covered :
Katie Sokoler
Most people consider me a gadget reviewer .
But in my heart , I consider my specialty to be the intersection of technology and culture .
The real fun always begins at the clash of online and offline .
There was no greater proof than the events of last Saturday on Roosevelt Island , a skinny strip in the East River next to Manhattan .
You may not have heard of Improv Everywhere , but you ’ve probably seen some of this group ’s public stunts on YouTube .
Remember the one where everyone in Grand Central Terminal froze simultaneously , baffling passersby ?
Or the immortal Food Court Musical
Well , last Saturday , the group staged its sixth annual MP3 Experiment , and it was open to anyone who wanted to play along .
My son and I did .
We joined a couple of other sixth graders and parents .
We followed the Web site ’s instructions : ( 1 ) Wear a blue , red , yellow or green T - shirt with a white T - shirt underneath .
( 2 ) Download the MP3 Experiment audio file and load it onto our iPods–but do not listen to it .
( 3 ) Go to Roosevelt Island .
At precisely 4 p.m. , press Play .
The fun began long before we got to the island ; you could identify participants by their double T - shirts and iPods on the commuter train from Connecticut , in Grand Central and on the subways .
Nobody knew what to expect , which was all part of the experience .
My little group of six settled down on a grassy slope by the river .
Participants were everywhere , all over the island–probably 3,000 of us altogether .
We waited until 4:00 exactly .
We hit Play .
A male voice , slowed down and processed to sound boomy and authoritative , said : “ My name is Steve , and I ’ll be your omnipotent voice today . ”
As happy , cool , electronic music played , he began giving us instructions .
Wave to Steve in the sky .
Do some warmup stretches .
High - five each other .
Square - dance with each other .
Find a normal person who ’s not a participant , and form a single - file line behind him as he walks .
Fall to the ground for a “ 15 - second power nap . ”
Through all of this , you could n’t stop laughing .
Part of it was the weirdness of seeing 3,000 people acting in perfect unison , even though externally , there was n’t a sound .
Part of it was the cleverness of the script , and Steve ’s complete irreverence .
( “ Did you know that the art of square dancing was invented right here on Roosevelt Island ?
It probably was n’t , but we ’re going to square dance anyway . ” )
Eventually , we were told to walk to the huge grassy field on the southern tip of the island .
While we marched , we heard a recitation of a bizarre fractured fairy tale called “ Peters and the Wolves . ”
We also played a game of “ Steve Says , ” which is just like Simon Says except–well , you get it .
( “ Steve Says , hop on one foot .
Steve says , wink at someone you find cute .
Now go grab that person ’s rear end .
Hey now –Steve did n’t SAY to grab that person ’s rear end !
I hope nobody got groped ! ” )
Once on the field , we played freeze tag .
( “ Yellow shirts , you ’re it ! ” )
We told secrets .
( “ If you ’re wearing a red or yellow shirt , please take off your headphones .
I ’m going to tell a secret to the other group . ” )
Eventually , we were issued inflatable baseball bats and sledgehammers and pitted against each other in a huge war–no hitting heads or below the belt .
( Well , some of us were ; there were only 1400 inflatable weapons , not nearly enough for everyone . )
Then , the best part .
In the middle of the war , Steve said : “ Wait , wait –stop the music !
Stop !
Everyone – what are we doing ?
Why must we hit each other with inflatable objects every MP3 Experiment ?
Why ca n’t we work together ?
Why are we fighting amongst ourselves ?
It ’s time to unite !
Everyone –remove your colored shirt to reveal your white T - shirt underneath .
We are all on the same team ! ”
The wolf–one of Improv Everywhere ’s founders dressed in a head - to - toe furry costume–burst onto the field .
This , Steve said , was “ our common enemy . ”
He directed us to bludgeon HIM to death instead .
Then , as triumphant music played , Steve announced : “ We ’ve done it !
We ’ve put our T - shirt colors aside , and worked together for the common good !
Congratulations , everyone !
Now , let ’s all celebrate together in the best way possible : in slow motion ! ”
Everyone high - fived , jumped up and down , and back - slapped–in slow motion , as “ Chariots of Fire ” - ish music played .
It was hilarious .
The weather was absolutely perfect , the crowd was young and fun , and the whole thing was orchestrated , planned and written exceptionally well .
( And Tyler Walker ’s score was fantastic – 47 solid minutes of cool music . )
Cameramen were visible here and there ; a video will be up in “ a few weeks . ”
That YouTube element , of course , is what makes Improv Everywhere possible to begin with .
But the video will only be a pale imitation of the real thing .
What a totally , totally cool idea : part mass hypnosis , part party , part comedy club … like a political rally , but with more to do .
If there ’s a seventh MP3 Experiment next year , find a way to be part of it .
Scotland Invests $ 8 Million in Seaweed and Algae Biofuels
April 6th , 2009 by Derek Markham
The BioMara research project investigating the feasibility of using microalgae and seaweed to produce biofuels was launched on Friday by Scotland ’s Energy Minister , Jim Mather .
“ Effectively , seaweed harvested off a beach in the Outer Isles could be heating a crofter ’s kettle for their cup of tea the next morning . ” – Laila Sadler , spokesperson for BioMara
Funded by the European Union ’s INTERREG IVA Programme , Highlands and Islands Enterprise , the Crown Estate , Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government , the project falls right in line with the call for 10 % of transport fuels from renewables by 2020 .
“ Conventional biofuel crops compete for land and fresh water with farming and nature .
What we need is fast - growing , easily utilised plants which thrive in environments not used for agriculture or conservation Marine algae could be part of the solution .
Seaweeds grow rapidly , harness carbon dioxide and have simple structures which make them easily converted to fuel . ”
– Dr Michele Stanley , lead scientist
The challenge of biofuels is finding fast - growing , easily utilized plants which thrive in places not used for agriculture or conservation , so a seaweed / algae biofuels industry could be a big jump for the UK .
Scotland also has a quarter of Europe ’s tidal and offshore wind energy resource , so it clearly has a competitive advantage in developing other offshore renewable energy sources as well .
“ Much research and development is needed to unleash the potential for algal biofuels .
As well as seaweeds , we will investigate which strains of microalgae are most suitable for oil production and cultivation on an industrial scale .
BioMara will investigate every part of the energy - supply chain , from cultivation of the algae to fuel utilisation in remote communities . ”
– Stanley
The $ 8 million ( €6 million ) project will pursue biofuel production and utilization in remote , rural communities .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosures in April exceeded even March 's blistering pace with a record 342,000 homes receiving notices of default , auction notices or undergoing bank repossessions , according to a regular industry report .
One of every 374 U.S. homes received a filing during the month , the highest monthly rate that RealtyTrac , an online marketer of foreclosed properties , has recorded in four - plus years of record keeping .
" April was a shocker , " said Rick Sharga , a spokesman for Realty Trac .
" I would have bet on a dip because March foreclosures were so high . "
Instead , filings inched up 1 % from March and rose 32 % compared to April 2008 .
There were 63,900 bank repossessions , the last stop in the foreclosure process .
More than 1.3 million homes have now been lost to foreclosure since the market meltdown began in August 2007 .
The increasing foreclosures will force RealtyTrac to rethink its forecasts , according to Sharga .
" We had been predicting 3.4 million filings for the year , " he said , " but we 'll blow those numbers out of the water . "
The lion 's share of April 's filings were in the early stages of the process , such as notices of default , according to James Saccacio , Realty Trac 's CEO .
Bank repossessions actually fell 11 % for the month , compared with March .
That 's due , according to Saccacio , to the many legislative and company moratoriums that have prevented the foreclosure process from starting on delinquent loans .
Because fewer loans entered the process in past months , there were fewer getting all the way to repossession .
But now that those moratoriums are over , the volume of foreclosure filings is increasing .
" It 's likely that we 'll see a corresponding spike in [ repossessed properties ] as these loans move through the foreclosure process over the next few months , " Saccacio said in a prepared statement .
Ten states accounted for 75 % of all foreclosure activity , and they fell generally into two categories : one - time bubble markets and the Rust Belt .
California easily outpaced every other state with with 96,560 filings .
Other hard - hit former boom states were Florida , Nevada and Arizona .
Those Rust Belts states with the most filings were Illinois , Ohio and Michigan .
Georgia , Texas and Virginia filled out the rest of the top 10 list .
Nevada , with one filing for every 68 households , had the highest foreclosure rate in the land .
Florida , with one for every 135 households , ranked second ; and California , with one for every 138 , was third .
Las Vegas continued to be the worst - hit metro area .
It had more than 14,000 filings in April , one for every 56 households and 20 % more than in March .
The Cape Coral - Fort Myers , Fla. , area was second with one in 57 , a 31 % month - over - month rise .
Merced , Calif. , where home prices have plunged almost two - thirds from their peak , had the third - highest rate .
Five other California metro areas ranked in the top 10 : Modesto was fourth , Riverside - San Bernardino fifth , Bakersfield sixth , Vallejo seventh and Stockton eighth .
Miami and Orlando rounded out the list .
Raised expectations
Not helping , of course , is the steady erosion of home prices .
The National Association of Realtors reported record home price losses Tuesday .
" [ The home price decline ] will lead to more foreclosures , " said Mike Larson , a real estate analyst for Weiss Research .
The loss of home value put many more mortgage borrowers underwater , meaning they owe more on their loans than their homes are worth .
That increases foreclosure rates in two ways : Underwater borrowers have no home equity to draw on to pay for unexpected expenses such as big medical bills or major car or home repairs .
That 's makes them more likely to miss payments .
And when home values fall far below mortgage balances , homeowners often walk away from their loans .
" There has been much more ' deed - in - lieu - of foreclosure ' activity lately , " said Sharga .
This is a transaction in which borrowers simply tell their banks that they 're not going to pay their mortgage and hand back their keys , and deeds , to their lenders .
" People are making the rational financial decision to walk away from underwater homes , " he said .

The fragment of skull belonged to a young adult male
Part of a Neanderthal man 's skull has been dredged up from the North Sea , in the first confirmed find of its kind .
Scientists in Leiden , in the Netherlands , have unveiled the specimen - a fragment from the front of a skull belonging to a young adult male .
Chemical variants known as isotopes in the 60,000 - year - old fossil suggest a carnivorous diet , matching results from other Neanderthal specimens .
The North Sea is one of the world 's richest areas for mammal fossils .
But the remains of ancient humans are scarce ; this is the first known specimen to have been recovered from the sea bed anywhere in the world .
For most of the last half million years , sea levels were substantially lower than they are today .
Significant areas of the North Sea were , at times , dry land .
Criss - crossed by river systems , with wide valleys , lakes and floodplains , these were rich habitats for large herds of ice age mammals such as horse , reindeer , woolly rhino and mammoth .
Even with this rather limited fragment of skull , it is possible to securely identify this as Neanderthal
Jean - Jacques Hublin , Max Planck Institute
Their fossilised remains are brought ashore in large numbers each year by fishing trawlers and other dredging operations .
According to Professor Chris Stringer , from London 's Natural History Museum , some fishermen now concentrate on collecting fossils rather than their traditional catch .
" There were mammoth fossils collected off the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts 150 years ago , so we 've known for some time there was material down there that was of this age , or even older , " Professor Stringer , a museum research leader , told BBC News .
Indeed , some of the fossil material from the North Sea dates to the Cromerian stage , between 866,000 and 478,000 years ago .
It had been " only a matter of time " , he said , before a human fossil came to light .
Professor Stringer added : " The key thing for the future is getting this material in a better context .
" It would be great if we could get the technology one day to go down and search ( in the sea floor ) where we can obtain the dating , associated materials and other information we would get if we were excavating on land . "
Private collection Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) were our close evolutionary cousins ; they appear in the fossil record some 400,000 years ago .
These resourceful , physically powerful hunter - gatherers dominated a wide range spanning Britain and Iberia in the west , Israel in the south and Siberia in the east .
Our own species , Homo sapiens , evolved in Africa , and replaced the Neanderthals after entering Europe about 40,000 years ago .
The specimen was found among animal remains and stone artefacts dredged up 15 km off the coast of the Netherlands in 2001 .
Neanderthals were our close evolutionary cousins
The fragment was spotted by Luc Anthonis , a private fossil collector from Belgium , in the sieving debris of a shell - dredging operation .
Study of the specimen has been led by Professor Jean - Jacques Hublin , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
" Even with this rather limited fragment of skull , it is possible to securely identify this as Neanderthal , " Professor Hublin told BBC News .
For instance , the thick bony ridge above the eyes - known as a supraorbital torus - is typical of the species , he said .
The fragment 's shape best matches the frontal bones of late Pleistocene examples of this human species , particularly the specimens known as La Chapelle - aux - Saints and La Ferrassie 1 .
These examples , which were both unearthed in France , date from between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .
The North Sea fossil also bears a lesion caused by a benign tumour - an epidermoid cyst - of a type very rare in humans today .
The research links up with the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain 2 ( AHOB 2 ) project , which aims to set Britain 's prehistory in a European context .
Dutch archaeologist Wil Roebroeks , a collaborator on this study , is also a member of the AHOB 2 research team .
Carnivorous diet Dr Mike Richards , from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , analysed different forms , or isotopes , of the elements nitrogen and carbon in the fossilised bone .
This shed light on the types of foods eaten by this young male .
The results show survived on a diet dominated by meat .
" High in the food chain , ( Neanderthals ) must have been quite rare on the ground compared to other mammals , " said Wil Roebroeks from the University of Leiden .
A CT scan shows the find super - imposed on another Neanderthal skull
The results of the stable isotope analysis fit with what is known about other examples of this species , though other research suggests that in Gibraltar , on the southern coast of Iberia , some Neanderthals were exploiting marine resources , including dolphins , monk seals and mussels .
Researchers decided against carbon dating the specimen ; this requires the preservation of a protein called collagen .
Professor Hublin explained that while there was some collagen left in the bone , scientists would have needed to destroy approximately half of the fossil in order to obtain enough for direct dating .
Professor Roebroeks told BBC News : " Dutch scientists - geologists and archaeologists alike - are hoping this find will convince governmental agencies that the Netherlands needs to invest much more in that ... archive of Pleistocene sediments off our coast - and off the coast of Britain . "
He said this submerged repository contained " high resolution information on past climate change and its environmental consequences , points of reference for how rivers ' worked ' before any human interference and now , as this find shows , remains of people who once roamed these landscapes . "
Extreme ways Chris Stringer said that studying the landscape beneath the North Sea was crucial for a better understanding of prehistoric movements of humans into the British Isles .
" We have Neanderthals at Lynford ( in Norfolk ) 60,000 years ago , though we only have stone tools .
This specimen might indeed be the kind of Neanderthal that was crossing into Norfolk around that time .
It will help us understand our British sequence when we can much more precisely map what 's under the North Sea , " he said .
Professor Hublin said the individual was living at the extreme edge of the Neanderthals ' northern range , where the relatively cold environment would have challenged their capabilities to the limit .
Neanderthal remains have been found at only two sites this far north .
" What we have here is a marginal population , probably with low numbers of people , " Professor Hublin explained .
" It 's quite fascinating to see that these people were able to cope with the environment and be so successful in an ecological niche which was not the initial niche for humans . "
While these hunting grounds would at times have provided plentiful sources of meat for a top carnivore , Neanderthals living in these areas would also have been at the mercy of fluctuations in the numbers of big game animals .
Periodic dips in populations of mammals such as reindeer could have caused local extinctions of Neanderthal groups which hunted them , Dr Hublin explained .

May 29 , 2009 —
The increased risk for violent crime associated with schizophrenia is largely due to the subgroup of patients who are also substance abusers , according to a study in the May 20 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Seena Fazel , MD , from the University of Oxford , Warneford Hospital , in the United Kingdom , and colleagues report that schizophrenia without substance abuse was associated with a slightly increased rate of violent crime compared with the general population ( odds ratio , 1.2 ) , but persons who had schizophrenia with comorbid substance abuse were more than 4 times as likely as the general population to have a violent - crime conviction .
" The other main finding is that there is familial confounding of the relationship between violent crime and schizophrenia , and that occurs through substance abuse , " Dr. Fazel told Medscape Psychiatry .
" In other words , unaffected siblings had increased rates of violent crime compared with the general population , and this appeared to be mediated through higher rates of substance abuse than general population controls . "
Contrary Findings
Other reports have found a 4 - to 6 - fold increased risk for violence associated with schizophrenia , which has led to the view that schizophrenia and other major mental disorders are preventable causes of violence and violent crime , according to the investigators .
To examine this relationship , the investigators analyzed data from nationwide Swedish registers of hospital admissions and criminal convictions from 1973 to 2006 .
Risk for violent crime in patients after diagnosis of schizophrenia ( n = 8003 ) was compared with that among general population controls ( n = 80,025 ) .
Potential confounders , including age , sex , income , and marital and immigrant status as well as substance abuse , were measured at the beginning of the study .
To study familial confounding , the researchers also investigated risk of violence among unaffected siblings ( n = 8123 ) of patients with schizophrenia .
The researchers found that among patients with schizophrenia , 1504 ( 13.2 % ) had at least 1 violent offense compared with 4276 ( 5.3 % ) general population controls ( adjusted odds ratio , 2.0 ) .
The rate of violent crime in individuals diagnosed as having schizophrenia and substance abuse ( 27.6 % ) was significantly higher than in those without substance abuse ( 8.5 % ) , which resulted in adjusted odds ratios of 4.4 for violent crime in schizophrenia with substance abuse and 1.2 in schizophrenia without substance abuse .
The risk increase among those with substance abuse was significantly less pronounced when unaffected siblings were used as controls — 28.3 % of those with schizophrenia had a violent offense compared with 17.9 % of their unaffected siblings — suggesting significant familial , either genetic or early environmental , confounding of the association between schizophrenia and violence .
More Routine Attention to Substance Abuse Needed
This is " an important question that needs further research and synthesis of the evidence .
In terms of managing the risk , it highlights the importance of reviewing the substance - abuse problems regularly and treating them , " Dr. Fazel said .
Coauthor Niklas Långström , MD , PhD , who is head of the Center for Violence Prevention at the Karolinska Institutet , in Stockholm , Sweden , advised routine assessment and treatment of substance misuse in individuals with schizophrenia .
" This might require modifications of already - existing treatment modalities — pharmacological , psychosocial , and psychotherapeutic , " he said .
Dr. Långström also noted that these data , in addition to those from studies by forensic psychologist Eric B. Elbogen , PhD , from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine , in Chapel Hill , suggest that the American Psychiatric Association guideline recommending violence risk assessment for all patients with schizophrenia should be reconsidered .
" We should focus on the individuals with additional problems .
Address risk factors that increase the risk for violent behavior among all individuals , independent of whether they suffer from schizophrenia or not , " Dr. Långström said .
" These include substance misuse , violence proneness reflected also in family history , negative affect , impulsivity , and cognitions that support the use of violence . "
Asked to comment on the study findings , Dr. Elbogen said the large sample size gives the study findings weight .
Treatment Not Optimal
" This is an important study because it includes over 8000 patients with schizophrenia , which affects only 1 % of the population , " he said .
Most important , he added , it highlights the additional violence risk associated with comorbid schizophrenia and substance abuse and the importance of addressing both issues .
" The main weakness is that it is not clear that the people with schizophrenia in this study are representative of all people with schizophrenia , which affects how generalizable the conclusions are , " he said .
The inclusion criteria required hospitalization with discharge diagnoses of schizophrenia on at least 2 separate occasions .
" These strict criteria might have selected for a relatively sicker group of patients with schizophrenia , and the impact might be that the risk of violence associated with schizophrenia in most patients without comorbid substance abuse might be even smaller than these researchers found .
" In clinical practice , asking a patient with schizophrenia if he or she has a history of substance abuse or dependence is an important screen , because it alerts you to be concerned about the patient 's potential risk for violent behavior , " he added .
" Unfortunately , " he added , " because of how mental - health services are typically structured , most patients get either mental - health services or substance - abuse services , but not both .
The result is that those at highest risk are getting only half of what they need . "
The authors disclose no conflicts of interest .

Round four of mankind 's epic battle against the walking , talking , killer machines starts tonight with the opening of Terminator Salvation .
But humanoid robots are n't confined to the movies .
Turns out the U.S. military is backing research into robots that act like people , as well .
Today , the American armed forces ' main ground robots , the Foster - Miller Talon and iRobot 's Packbot , look like boxes with caterpillar tracks .
It 's a nice , stable design .
And it works well – which is why the military has sent thousands of 'em over to Afghanistan and Iraq .
But these robots do n't easily fit into a world that we humans have constructed for creatures that operate like us .
Door handles only work if you have something like a hand – and it has to be at the right height , too .
Wheels and tracks get stuck on obstacles that legs just jump over .
So it makes sense , sometimes , to shape a machine like a man .
One of the American military 's leading humanoid robots is Petman .
Its job will be to testing chemical protection clothing for the U.S. Army .
Petman is being built by Boston Dynamics , famous for its alarmingly lifelike BigDog robotic pack mule .
Unlike earlier suit - testing robots , which needed external support , Petman will stand – and walk – on his own two feet .
" Petman will balance itself and move freely ; walking , crawling and doing a variety of suit - stressing calisthenics during exposure to chemical warfare agents , " the company promises .
" Petman will also simulate human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature , humidity and sweating when necessary , all to provide realistic test conditions . "
A sweating robot ?
I had a flashback to the first Terminator movie :
" The 600 series had rubber skin .
We spotted them easy .
These are new .
They look human .
Sweat , bad breath , everything …. "
Petman needs to precisely simulate human movement , and the makers say it will be " the first anthropomorphic robot that moves dynamically like a real person , with natural , agile movement . "
The mecha-man is described as " BigDog 's Big Brother . "
In fact , his bottom half is simply a pair of BigDog legs .
The program will consist of 13 months of design and 17 months of construction .
The finished product being delivered in 2011 .
( Will they have to deliver Petman , or will they just give him the address and send him off ? )
Meanwhile , Bucknell University researchers have received a $ 1.2 million grant for research and development of military robots , including a 5 - foot - tall bipedal walker .
" It would move over curbs , up stairs and around rubble , " says Keith Buffinton , professor of mechanical engineering .
" It could be used for surveillance and to gather information in areas you would not want to risk human life . "
The machine is already taking its first steps and is said to be better at balancing than a human .
Professor Steven Shooter says they 'll be able to give the robot a head ( complete with cameras ) and " arm - like devices to assist with balancing . "
It 's unlikely that killer robots are walking among us just yet .
But in a few years someone with a rather mechanical gait who refuses to take off his motorcycle helmet may not be quite what he seem .
Bonus feature ... and spoiler alert ...
There are new non-human Terminators in the new movie as well , including a variety of riderless motorbikes called Moto - Terminators .
Once again , science fiction is only just ahead of science fact .
In 2005 , one of the competitors in Darpa 's Grand Challenge for robot vehicles was an unmanned motor bike called Ghost Rider .
This was based on a 90 - cc dirt bike outfitted with sensors , gyros for steering and video cameras for eyes .
The designer , Anthony Levandowski of University of California , Berkeley , said that the two - wheel layout made it more maneuverable than the big Jeeps and trucks fielded by other competitors .
It also as kept costs down .
The whole thing cost just $ 150,000 , which puts it in the bargain basement for military robotics .
An article in Berkeley Engineering 's newsletter later said that Levandowski " hopes to keep Ghostrider alive by continuing to refine its subsystems , like the obstacle avoidance software , for potential use in unmanned scouting and surveillance operations . "
Of course unmanned craft like the Predator also started out on scouting and surveillance duty – before someone decided to arm them .

My brother Adrian bought me a new jacket .
I think it is pretty cool , though I would be a bit nervous about buying something like this for myself .
Whenever I put it on , though , I start to think I'm Dean Winchester .
I am super excited for my copy of T - Minus : Race to the moon by Jim Ottaviani , who writes these amazing scientist biography comics .
One of my very favourite books is his Suspended in Language : Niels Bohr 's Life , Discoveries , And The Century He Shaped .
A comic book biography of Niels Bohr .
It 's so well done , sometimes funny , always engaged with the man 's life and engaged too with his ideas .
There are others , a biography of Oppenheimer that I liked a lot , but the story of Niels Bohr won me over in a way I had n't felt since I first read The Man who Loved Only Numbers about Paul Erdos .
I have a weakness for a good biography .
( okay , one more : Have you read Hackers : Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy ?
It 's so amazing .
It 's a book about the kids who invented the first multi user operating systems .
About the people who pushed video games further and further , and about the first personal computers .
It 's a book about people who get obsessed with ideas and do n't let go , and I love it . )
Cat Cooler
Initial Idea
It was hot that day .
Very hot .
So hot that the cats were getting all melty .
They also were seeking out the coolest spots they could find : lying on the wood floor instead of on the rug .
Suddenly , I thought , hey --- would n't it be nice to give them an especially cool - feeling place to lie down on ?
Here was my first idea :
Important points include :
roughly cat - sized
resting surface has high heat transfer coefficient ( Al is good , Cu is better but way more expensive ) , and thus " feels cool " even when it 's the same temperature as the room air
room for air circulation underneath , which allows
evaporative cooling from the " wick " ( dishtowel ) , which cools the resting surface further
A quick trip to Crate And Barrel outfitted me with the materials I needed for a prototype : an uninsulated baking sheet , dish towel , and a " cooling rack " .
Once home , I began construction immediately .
I wet the dish towel with cold water and wrung it out so it would n't drip .
I put the cooling rack on the floor , placed the damp towel on top of it , and then put the cookie sheet on top of the towel .
The top of the cookie sheet felt cool to the touch .
It was time to start Phase I Clinical Trials .
Phase I Clinical Trials
In Phase I , I wanted to test the cat cooler on small group ( one cat ) for the first time to evaluate its safety and identify any side effects .
The Phase I cat was selected , lifted up from where he was lying on the hardwood floor , and placed on the cat cooler .
The cat cooler seemed safe , and no side effects were observed .
Subjectively , the cat seemed to respond positively to the treatment .
Time for Phase II Clinical Trials .
Phase II Clinical Trials
In Phase II , my goal was to try the cat cooler on a larger sample ( a slightly larger cat ) , to determine the efficacy of the treatment .
This time , the cat cooler was placed under the coffee table -- an area that the cats normally do not like in hot weather , but do like in moderate or cool weather .
I theorize that this is due to the low heat transfer coefficient of the carpeting ; even if the rug is the same temperature as the hardwood floor in the dining room , or the tiles on the bathroom floor , the rug feels hotter .
Luckily , the Phase II cat is more adventurous than the Phase I cat , and the Phase II cat immediately investigated the cat cooler , climbed onto its surface , and settled down right there .
The Phase II cat remained on the cat cooler for quite some time , perhaps half an hour .
Given that the cat would not have stayed on the rug under the coffee table given the heat , but that he did stay on the cat cooler under the coffee table , I believe that the cat cooler was at least somewhat effective .
Admittedly , there were no " control " cats , but if you 've ever lived with a cat , you understand why .
Ongoing : Phase III Clinical Trials
In Phase III , we 'll be using an even larger sample ( a very large cat ) , to confirm the effectiveness of the cat cooler treatment , and to compare the current design of the system with some alternatives as well as other commonly used treatments .
I now find myself wondering how much of a difference the evaporative cooling ( towel , water , cooling rack , air gap ) actually makes .
Perhaps simply putting down an aluminium or copper baking sheet by itself would be sufficient ; either material would feel cooler than a rug , a wood floor , or even bathroom tiles .
On the other hand , the evaporative cooling mechanism also actually lowers the temperature of the surface .
I definitely want to try offering the cats their choice of both conventional and liquid - cooled cookie sheets , and see which they prefer .
I have subsequently also tried more extreme cooling .
In one case , I placed ice chips between two damp towels between the cooling rack and the cookie sheet .
In another case , I set a small fan blowing under ( and over , and around ) the cat cooler , to force more evaporation , and thus more cooling .
In both cases , exactly zero cats were interested in participating in the trials .
The ice chips seemed to make the resting surface too cold , and the fan was too loud , forceful , and fur - ruffling .
I suspect that a small ( solar powered ? ) hobby motor with a small fanblade , could be placed under the cooling rack to force some evaporation without causing the fur to fly .
I 'll post more results as I get them , but I 'm optimistic .
Opinion
The Strangest Drought Ever /
What kind of water crisis is this ?
I experienced the Bay Area droughts of the 1970s .
I vaguely recall taking navy showers and reciting , " If it 's yellow let it mellow , if it 's brown flush it down . "
And I remember the dry times of the late 1980s when I was always in short sleeves and did n't own an umbrella for years .
Now those droughts made sense .
But this year , rain is pouring down , storm after storm is moving in , yet at the same time we are constantly reminded we face a water shortage that was recently teetering on " the worst drought in state history . "
Meanwhile , many of us are patching the roof , trying to keep a deluge from leaking into the kitchen .
In the past few weeks , we 've entered a new kind of pattern as predictable as a rainstorm in January .
( I mean a January in Portland since January in the Bay Area is more like January in Phoenix these days . )
Every time we have rain , there will be some flooding , a few trees will fall and then , as we 're clearing the muck from our submerged yards , the water experts proceed to inform that the drenching was very nice , but no no no , we are not out of the drought woods yet !
Sometimes their unwavering repetition can sound like a cranky parent .
Recently I was driving up I - 80 to go sledding in the 15 - feet of snowpack -- that apparently has been only marginally helpful -- and about every five minutes the kids are whining , " Are we there yet ? "
And I reply , " No . "
And five minutes later they ask again and I say , " No . "
And five minutes later we do it all over again and at some point I realized I sounded a lot like the guy in the paper telling me not to water my sidewalk .
And , it 's not going to end .
Just this week , we heard from the experts who had trudged up to some remote Sierra cabin to measure snowpack .
And apparently , to speak scientifically , there are piles of the stuff !
Rainfall has nearly caught up to normal too .
But quit thinking you can stop worrying .
The reservoirs are still half empty and March could be a disaster and let 's not even get started about how bad January was .
Quite often these warnings are accompanied by vague threats of mandatory rationing for urban water users , which make everyone shudder and worry they 're going to be sitting in the shower , shivering and sponging themselves off .
And this can be a little confusing when gale force winds are almost knocking your doors down .
So maybe the state should just take us out of our misery and put all of California on mandatory rationing .
The suspense is too much .
Go on , make us save the gray water in the tub to put on the plants which are already drowning in the downpour .
At least we wo n't have to worry about having to , gasp , save water .
But the state does n't work that way .
Even when the governor declared a water crisis last week , he would n't order mandatory rationing for water districts .
Apparently the state prefers to suggest , hoping individual districts take the mandatory step .
So we end up walking around in this strange limbo of being soaked , but being constantly reminded of the water - less horrors we may face .
What will surprise thousands of urban dwellers is they may already be living with the dreaded mandatory rationing without even knowing it .
I have been for months and had no idea until a week ago .
I 've been showering when I want , washing dishes the same old way and then one day I called East Bay MUD to ask why we did n't have rationing if this shortage is so horrible .
And the very polite EBMUD person informed me we had in fact had 20 percent mandatory ratioining since last August .
Well , that was embarrassing .
So , yes , I felt like an idiot , but here is why I and many others had no idea forced reductions were in place :
Even while there is mandatory 20 percent rationing , some of us do n't have to reduce one drop !
This really is a strange water crisis .
As I was told , if you use under 100 gallons a day , you do n't have to cut usage at all during mandatory rationing .
And , we , a house with four people in it , use 70 gallons a day total .
Who knew ?
We actually got a reward for being good water users .
A whole dollar !
( Which is hardly a big incentive to save but neither is the meagre two dollars you Õre fined if you exceed your allotment by 748 gallons ! )
So if your district begins mandatory rationing , it very well may not affect you , and if you do have to ration , there are plenty of tips out there to make it pretty easy .
Not that any of this is going to cure our current state of being the wettest dry state in history , but we should 've known this would be a bizarre water crisis from the get go .
After all , one of the most accurate predictions of how this season 's weather would play out did n't came from any weather expert .
It came from a guy who usually writes about camping .
And how'd he know ?
The birds and the onion skins told him .
Go figure .

Obama Wants " Best Care " For His Family
ABC News : Dr. Orrin Devinsky , a neurologist and researcher at the New York University Langone Medical Center , said that elites often propose health care solutions that limit options for the general public , secure in the knowledge that if they or their loves ones get sick , they will be able to afford the best care available , even if it 's not provided by insurance .
Devinsky asked the president pointedly if he would be willing to promise that he would n't seek such extraordinary help for his wife or daughters if they became sick and the public plan he 's proposing limited the tests or treatment they can get .
The president refused to make such a pledge , though he allowed that if " it 's my family member , if it 's my wife , if it 's my children , if it 's my grandmother , I always want them to get the very best care .
A transcript is available below .
DR .
DAVINSKI : If your wife or your daughter became seriously ill , and things were not going well , and the plan physicians told you they were doing everything that could be done , and you sought out opinions from some medical leaders in major centers and they said there 's another option you should pursue , but it was not covered in the plan , would you potentially sacrifice the health of your family for the greater good of insuring millions or would you do everything you possibly could as a father and husband to get the best health care and outcome for your family ?
PRESIDENT OBAMA : ... does she get hip replacement surgery even though she was fragile enough that they were n't sure how long she would last whether she could get through the surgery .
I think families all across America are going through decisions like that all the time .
and you 're absolutely right that if it's my family member , my wife , if it 's my children , if it 's my grandmother , I always want them to get the very best care .
but here 's the problem that we have in our current health care system .
Is that there is a whole bunch of care that 's being provided that every study , every bit of evidence that we have indicates may not be making us healthier .

The 1908 Tunguska event has always been mysterious and intriguing because no one has been able to fully explain the explosion that leveled 830 square miles of Siberian forest .
But the latest research has concluded that the Tunguska explosion was almost certainly caused by a comet entering the Earth ’s atmosphere .
And how researcher Michael Kelly from Cornell University came to that conclusion is quite interesting :
He analyzed the space shuttle ’s exhaust plume and noctilucent clouds .
“ It ’s almost like putting together a 100 - year - old murder mystery , ” said Kelley , a professor of Engineering , who led the research team .
“ The evidence is pretty strong that the Earth was hit by a comet in 1908 . ”
Previous speculation had ranged from comets to meteors .
Noctilucent clouds are brilliant , night - visible clouds made of ice particles and only form at very high altitudes and in extremely cold temperatures .
These clouds appeared a day after the Tunguska explosion and also appear following a shuttle mission .
The researchers contend that the massive amount of water vapor spewed into the atmosphere by the 1908 comet ’s icy nucleus was caught up in swirling eddies with tremendous energy by a process called two - dimensional turbulence , which explains why the noctilucent clouds formed a day later many thousands of miles away .
Noctilucent clouds are the Earth ’s highest clouds , forming naturally in the mesosphere at about 55 miles over the polar regions during the summer months when the mesosphere is around minus 180 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 117 degrees Celsius ) .
The space shuttle exhaust plume , the researchers say , resembled the comet ’s action .
A single space shuttle flight injects 300 metric tons of water vapor into the Earth ’s thermosphere , and the water particles have been found to travel to the Arctic and Antarctic regions , where they form the clouds after settling into the mesosphere .
Kelley and collaborators saw the noctilucent cloud phenomenon days after the space shuttle Endeavour ( STS - 118 ) launched on Aug. 8 , 2007 .
Similar cloud formations had been observed following launches in 1997 and 2003 .
Following the Tunguska Event , the night skies shone brightly for several days across Europe , particularly Great Britain — more than 3,000 miles away .
Kelley said he became intrigued by the historical eyewitness accounts of the aftermath , and concluded that the bright skies must have been the result of noctilucent clouds .
The comet would have started to break up at about the same altitude as the release of the exhaust plume from the space shuttle following launch .
In both cases , water vapor was injected into the atmosphere .
The scientists have attempted to answer how this water vapor traveled so far without scattering and diffusing , as conventional physics would predict .
“ There is a mean transport of this material for tens of thousands of kilometers in a very short time , and there is no model that predicts that , ” Kelley said .
“ It ’s totally new and unexpected physics . ”
This “ new ” physics , the researchers contend , is tied up in counter - rotating eddies with extreme energy .
Once the water vapor got caught up in these eddies , the water traveled very quickly — close to 300 feet per second .
Scientists have long tried to study the wind structure in these upper regions of the atmosphere , which is difficult to do by such traditional means as sounding rockets , balloon launches and satellites , explained Charlie Seyler , Cornell professor of electrical engineering and paper co-author .
“ Our observations show that current understanding of the mesosphere - lower thermosphere region is quite poor , ” Seyler said .
The thermosphere is the layer of the atmosphere above the mesosphere .

Police surveillance of a peaceful protester was ruled unlawful today in a decison that lawyers say will change the way demonstrations and protests are policed .
Judges ruled that specialist ­surveillance units from the Metropolitan police had breached the human rights of Andrew Wood , an arms trade campaigner , when they photographed him and stored the pictures on a police database .
One judge said there were ­unresolved civil liberties questions about the way images were taken and retained in " the modern surveillance society " .
Lord ­Justice
Dyson said there were " very serious human rights issues which arise when the state obtains and retains the images of persons who have committed no offence and are not suspected of having ­committed any offence " .
The judgment is a blow to the Met , which has been criticised over the way it polices protests since last month 's G20 ­demonstrations and the death of Ian Tomlinson .
Tonight , human rights lawyers said the ruling could force police to delete thousands of images of protesters stored on their database unless they have grounds for suspecting them of criminal activity .
Anna Mazzola , of the solicitors Hickman & Rose , said : " The judgment of the court of appeal should act as a stark ­warning to the Metropolitan police that the ­circumstances in which they can justify taking and retaining photographs of ­members of the public who have ­committed no crime is highly circumscribed . "
The case follows an investigation by the Guardian , which revealed police have been targeting thousands of campaigners in surveillance operations and storing their details on a criminal intelligence database for up to seven years .
Parts of the ­Guardian 's investigation , which included information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , were submitted in evidence to the court of appeal .
Yesterday , Wood , who was represented by the human rights group Liberty and who was a member of the Campaign Against Arms Trade when he was photographed leaving a meeting in 2005 , said he was delighted with the ruling .
" The Human Rights Act is part of the essential checks and balances which help to ensure that we can properly participate in a democratic society without repressive state intervention , " he said .
" The police do n't just uphold the law - they must abide by it . "
The case went before the high court last year when judges ruled against Wood .
But yesterday two of the three judges ruled in his favour , saying there had been a ­" disproportionate interference in the human right to privacy " .
Dyson said : " The retention by the police of photographs taken of persons who have not committed an offence , and who are not even suspected of having committed an offence , is always a serious matter .
The only justification advanced by the police for retaining the photographs for more than a few days after the meeting was the possibility that the appellant might attend and commit an offence … that justification does not bear scrutiny . "
Lord Collins added that the substantial police presence which confronted the arms campaigners had a " chilling effect " on people who had been lawfully ­protesting .
A third dissenting judge said the Met had acted reasonably .
The judgment does not ban specialist police cameramen , known as forward intelligence teams , but it does mean the long - term retention of their pictures must be justified on a case - by - case basis .
The photographs of Wood were taken in April 2005 as he emerged from the Millennium hotel , London , where he had attended the annual general meeting of Reed ­Elsevier plc , the parent company of Spearhead Exhibitions Ltd , which runs trade fairs for the arms industry .
He had gained access to the meeting by buying a share in the company .
He has no criminal convictions and has never been arrested as a result of any campaigning activities .
Last night the Met said the ruling did not mean it was unlawful to use " overt surveillance " , which it said was " truly valuable in public order policing " .
Chief Superintendent Ian Thomas , the officer in charge of the Met 's public order branch , said the police would continue to use surveillance .
But he added that the judgment ­provided a " valuable set of guidelines " .
A Response to Ipsos Reid , Part III
This is Part III in a three part series .
For Part I , click here .
For Part II , click here .
A Response to Ipsos Reid , Part III : Comparing Ipsos Reid to the other polling firms using 2 methods and with control tests .
In Part I of the Paulitics response to Ipsos Reid , I showed two graphs of the level of support given to the Conservative and New Democratic Parties in all polls conducted in 2009 by all polling firms .
As you can see below , the graphs tell a startling tale of just how radically out of step Ipsos Reid ’s estimations of the Conservative and New Democratic Parties seem to be when compared to other polling firms .
I asked Mr. Wright to explain these data as I ’m sure we would all be very interested in learning why we are seeing these trends .
So far , the response has been : Crickets .
Nothing .
Deafening silence .
Now , a quick disclaimer :
As I ’ve mentioned before , these graphs do n’t necessarily mean that Ipsos Reid has bad data .
What these graphs mean is that either every single other polling firm in the country on average has bad data or Ipsos Reid has bad data .
As always , I invite my readers to critically consider for themselves what Occam ’s razor can tell us about this impasse .
Now , to be fair to Ipsos Reid , I started thinking about possible explanations for these graphs since Mr. Wright did n’t seem keen to offer his own explanations .
One thing I noticed was that I was using the overall average of all polls conducted by all firms in 2009 and then calculating an overall average as if the movement up and down of the Conservative and New Democratic Parties was n’t a factor .
( Mr. Wright was doing this too , but keep in mind we ’re being charitable here ) .
This method could possibly be a flawed method if , for instance , polling firm “ x ” released a whole slew of polls in January when Party “ A ” was enjoying high levels of support from all polling firms and then polling firm “ x ” did n’t release a poll in early February when Party “ A ” was down in support .
Taking an overall average without taking into account differences over time could thus yield a favourable or an unfavourable view of polling firm “ x ” .
For instance , if we used this methodology in the hypothetical example of the “ Purple Party ” described below , we would wrongly conclude that polling firm “ x ” grossly over - estimated the support of the “ Purple Party ” when in fact , they look to be more or less right on the money .
So , I decided to analyse every 2009 Ipsos Reid poll against the 3 polls conducted before and after so that we ’re taking into account what ’s happening in party support right then and there and not several months earlier when things might have been different .
I then calculated each 7 poll grouping ’s standard deviation so that I could then calculate something called a “ z - score ” for each Ipsos Reid poll .
For those of you not conversant in z - scores do n’t worry , I have also calculated the “ z - score percentile ” as an easy way to understand what ’s going on in each of the polls .
The way this works is that if something is exactly average , it would be in the 50th percentile ( because 50 % is right in the middle ) .
If something is extremely unlikely at one end of the spectrum , you ’ll get a very very low number ( like something being in the 5th or 6th percentile ) and conversely something extremely unlikely at the other end of the spectrum , you ’ll get a very very high number ( like something being in the 96th or 97th percentile ) .
So the name of the game here is that Ipsos Reid wants to see medium range percentile numbers and wants to avoid really high and really low percentiles in the following tables because if the numbers are really high or really low that would suggest that Ipsos ’s data is way off the mark .
Here ’s what I found :
Ouch .
So what does this mean ?
Well , the data in the tables above show 2 outliers at the 95 % confidence interval , 5 outliers at the 90 % confidence interval ( including the 2 at 95 % ) and 7 total outliers at the 80 % confidence interval ( including the 5 at 90 % and the 2 at 95 % ) .
On the face of it , that seems like a lot of outliers especially considering I only analysed a total of 10 Ipsos Reid data points .
But , again to be fair to Ipsos Reid , maybe we would see roughly the same large number of outliers if we did this to any polling firm ’s data in this way .
I mean after all , 7 polls is not a particularly large population .
So , I decided to run the exact same calculations on Nanos ’s numbers , Ekos ’s numers and Strategic ’s numbers as a control group .
You can look through the tables of each of these calculations here , here and here .
As you can see , it ’s not even close .
Nanos , which had 8 total data points , had zero ( 0 ) outliers at the 95 % confidence interval , zero ( 0 ) outliers at the 90 % confidence interval , and only one ( 1 ) outlier at the 80 % confidence interval .
Strategic , which had 12 total data points ( more than Ipsos and Nanos ) , still had zero ( 0 ) outliers at the 95 % confidence interval , zero ( 0 ) outliers at the 90 % confidence interval , and only one ( 1 ) outlier at the 80 % confidence interval .
And lastly , Ekos , which had 6 total data points , had no outliers at either the 95 % , 90 % or 80 % confidence intervals .
So , to put this another way , only 7.7 % of Nanos , Ekos and Strategic ’s 2009 Conservative and NDP data points are outliers at the 80 % confidence interval .
Conversely , a whopping 70 % of Ipsos Reid ’s 2009 Conservative and NDP data points are outliers at the 80 % confidence interval
Also , none ( 0 % ) of Nanos , Ekos and Strategic ’s 2009 Conservative and NDP data were outliers at the 90 % confidence interval whereas 50 % ( ½ ) of Ipsos Reid ’s data were outliers at the same interval .
If you are like me , and like to view findings like this in ‘ pretty graph form ’ , here you go :
Oh , and just for fun , I also ran the same basic calculations for each Ipsos Reid poll compared to the entire set of 2009 polls and came up with almost the exact same results .
You can see the tables for these calculations by clicking here .
The evidence supporting my initial contention is mounting and the responses we ’ve gotten from Mr. Wright have been a mixture of snide , sardonic comments , fallacies and silence .
I believe we all deserve better than that .

Researchers from the University of California gained control over a well - known and powerful network of hacked computers for 10 days , gaining insight into how it steals personal and financial data .
The botnet , known as Torpig or Sinowal , is one of the more sophisticated networks that uses hard - to - detect malicious software to infect computers and subsequently harvest data such as e-mail passwords and online banking credentials .
The researchers were able to monitor more than 180,000 hacked computers by exploiting a weakness within the command - and - control network used by the hackers to control the computers .
It only worked for 10 days , however , until the hackers updated the command - and - control instructions , according to the researchers ' 13 - page paper .
Still , that was enough of a window to see the data - collecting power of Torpig / Sinowal .
In that short time , about 70G bytes of data were collected from hacked computers .
The researchers stored the data and are working with law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation , ISPs and even the U.S. Department of Defense to notify victims .
ISPs also have shut down some Web sites that were used to supply new commands to the hacked machines , they wrote .
Torpig / Sinowal can pilfer user names and passwords from e-mail clients such as Outlook , Thunderbird and Eudora while also collecting e-mail addresses in those programs for use by spammers .
It can also collect passwords from Web browsers .
Torpig / Sinowal can infect a PC if a computer visits a malicious
Web site that is designed to test whether the computer has unpatched software , a technique known as a drive - by download attack .
If the computer is vulnerable , a low - level piece of malicious software called a rootkit is slipped deep into the system .
The researchers found out that Torpig / Sinowal ends up on a system after it is first infected by Mebroot , a rootkit that appeared around December 2007 .
Mebroot infects a computer 's Master Boot Record ( MBR ) , the first code a computer looks for when booting the operating system after the BIOS runs .
Mebroot is powerful since any data that leaves the computer can be intercepted .
Mebroot can also download other code to the computer .
Torpig / Sinowal is customized to grab data when a person visits certain online banking and other Web sites .
It is coded to respond to more than 300 Web sites , with the top targeted ones being PayPal , Poste Italiane , Capital One , E - Trade and Chase bank , the paper said .
If a person goes to a banking Web site , a falsified form is delivered that appears to be part of the legitimate site , but asks for a range of data a bank would not normally request , such as a PIN ( personal identification number ) or a credit card number .
Web sites using SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) encryption are not safe if used by a PC with Torpig / Sinowal , since the malicious software will grab information before it is encrypted , the researchers wrote .
Hackers typically sell passwords and banking information on underground forums to other criminals , who try to covert the data into cash .
While it 's difficult to precisely estimate the value of the information collected over the 10 days , it could be worth between US $ 83,000 to $ 8.3 million , the research paper said .
There are ways to disrupt botnets such as Torpig / Sinowal .
The botnet code includes an algorithm that generates domain names that the malware calls on for new instructions .
Security engineers have often been able to figure out those algorithms to predict which domains the malware will call on , and preregister those domains to disrupt the botnet .
It is an expensive process , however .
The Conficker worm , for example , can generate up to 50,000 domain names a day .
Registrars , companies that sell domain name registrations , should take a greater role in cooperating with the security community , the researchers wrote .
But registrars have their own issues .
" With few exceptions , they often lack the resources , incentives or culture to deal with security issues associated with their roles , " the paper said .

This is not meant for Linux user 's consumption ... rather it is meant to pass along to your friends that still use windows .
It has some irrefutable arguments within .
Idiot ...
That 's a fairly strong word .
I can't think of a situation where most people would not find it offensive .
Or rude .
Let me tell you something else that is rude , the offensive part I will leave to personal opinion .
Asking a friend to repeatedly fix your computer .
Not " fix " as in something inside the computer broke like a hard drive or a power supply .
I 'm talking about your forays into Myspace and astalavista.box.sk .
I 'm talking about having to repeatedly clean the garbage off your computer so it will run halfway decently again .
You seem to have no shame when it comes to this .
I personally stopped " fixing " Windows computers three years ago .
That includes my wife 's computer .
Ahem ... now my ex-wife , but that goes a bit farther than the scope of this discussion .
See , many of us have found a way to run our computers where we do n't have to worry about that crap anymore .
Ever .
Many of us have told you of this miraculous operating system and have went as far as to offer to install it on your computer for you ... free of charge .
Many of our motives are far from altruistic .
We 're sick of cleaning up your messes .
If we install GNU / Linux and Free Software on your computer , we simply wo n't have to be bothered again .
I do n't speak for all Linux Users ... but enough of them to hear the applause in the background .
And trust me ... it is a bother , whether we verbalize it or not .
In 2004 , a variant of the Sasser worm infected my three - city network , and by the time the dust settled , it had cost me $ 12,000.00 in business .
My machines were fully protected and fully patched .
See , that 's the problem with Windows exploits .
These viruses and worms mutate quicker than the anti virus software makers can issue the fixes .
In my case , Symantec was 72 hours away from fixing this variant ... I was one click away from disaster .
It 's convenient to blame the virus writers and anti virus software makers but ultimately it is your fault you get this crap on your machine .
You are using a system that not only allows it ... it fosters it .
Let it be known that by reading further , you will learn that you have a choice in how you operate your computer .
A free - as - in - cost and free - as - in - no - restrictions choice .
You will no longer be able to identify yourself as a victim .
The cost I incurred was in business loss .
Today 's viruses are not in it for the mischief ... they are in it for the money .
Take a look at this .
These people are not going to stop .
They are stealing billions of dollars a year by infecting your computers .
There is too much money in this for them to even think about taking a break .
What 's worse , they are operating out of Russia and Nigeria for the most part ... we can't get to them to stop them .
Yeah ... it's not going to happen to you is it ?
Right .
It was n't going to happen to me either .
Linux is an alternative operating system much like Microsoft Windows ... and no , it 's not a " program " .
" Programs " run within an operating system .
Think of it as a walnut .
The shell of the walnut is your operating system .
The goods within the walnut shell are the programs .
I 'll not bore you with the details .
If you are interested in finding out why Linux is safer and better , you can go here , here and here .
There is a fairly comprehensive explanation as to why you do n't need anti virus software here .
Here is an article from a long - time Mac and Windows user who has seen the superiority of Linux and has put it on is own computer .
But this is n't a lesson on computer usage .
It 's a wakeup call for common sense .
Did you know that most computer repair shops , once they " repair " your system ; project future profits on the fact that you use Microsoft Windows ?
They know for a fact that you are going to need them again in six months .
They put their kids through private schools and upper - crust colleges because you are a Microsoft Windows User and are not able to adequately protect your computer .
It 's getting harder and harder to do so .
And do n't look to Windows 7 for your salvation ... you will still need to laden your system with the same anti virus garbage and registry cleaners you did with XP and Vista .
There 's an even money chance that they are going to fail anyway .
So you 've paid for what ?
There is however , a thin line between being a victim and being an idiot .
If you do not know you have a choice and bad things happen to you , then you are a victim .
If you know you have a choice and still insist on personally using a system over and over again that will ultimately lead to the same problems ....
I think the descriptor of idiot is fair .
You disagree ?
You know that Windows is the problem ... you know that it 's just a matter of time before you have to do it all over again .
You know you have an alternative but you insist on putting the source of the problem back on your computer .
You may be uncomfortable with the term " idiot " ... you give me another name for it then .
And if you have to use it at work ... I understand .
Unfortunately , as flawed as it is , it is still a Windows world .
The good news ?
Slowly but surely businesses across the globe are making the switch .
Even those that are not yet Linux companies are letting some employees run their choice of operating systems on their work computers .
That choice is Linux .
Look .
Here is the way it is .
When you buy a new computer , chances are it will have Microsoft Windows on it .
That did n't come free ... the price of the computer is jacked up anywhere from $ 100.00 to $ 300.00 to pay Microsoft .
It 's known as the Microsoft Tax .
Microsoft has entered into deals with many of the computer manufacturers to insure that Windows is on about every machine they sell .
The kicker here ?
Those agreements are secret and you and I can not see them .
We 've written about this before .
Microsoft has a virtual monopoly on new computer sales .
Now there are independents such as zareason.com that sell nothing but GNU / Linux computers and they are great folks to deal with .
In fact , I have never encountered service like Earl and Cathy Malmrose provide .... and for the most part , they provide it for free .
Dell has also begun selling Linux computers .
Do you think Dell would sell a system on their machines that would cause them to lose money or damage their reputation ?
When you call Microsoft for support , the first thing they ask for is a credit card .
So suppose you have bought a new computer and here comes the first 90 days ... you start getting popups saying your anti virus protection is about to expire and if you want to continue to " be protected " , you need to renew your subscription .
What ?
Yep ... now some anti virus companies go an entire year before they expire but still ... eventually you are going to be frightened into shelling out more money in exchange for your peace of mind .
In other words , you have to purchase software to insure the software you 've already purchased is going to work .
Did you read that carefully ?
And you are ok with that ?
If I did that , I 'd be in jail by now ... and so would you .
Linux amputates that part of the computing experience completely .
Some people cannot get their head around the fact that they do n't need to pay this extortion anymore .
You have no idea what a sense of liberation this brings .
Now some of you are sure to comment :
" I 've run Windows for years without a problem . "
Congratulations .
You wanna Google it and see how many others have not ?
I suppose as long as your computer is ok , then all is right with the world .
We can open most any attachment without fear ... we can visit websites that will bring a Windows machine to its knees ... and we do n't notice anything .
And please ... do n't be foolish and say that Linux is too hard for the normal Windows user .
We have 10 and 12 year - olds picking it up in a couple of hours ... they never look back .
Entire nations have already or are in the process of switching to Linux .
Many countries in Asia and South America have made the switch .
India is booting out Microsoft in their schools and migrating to Linux as we speak .
So .
You 've been told .
You do have a choice ... and it does n't cost you one thin dime .
If you choose not to at least look into it , and trust me , most of you wo n't .... don't ask us to come fix your infected computers .
We know which side of that thin line you stand .
EDIT : A friend of boh was kind enough to send us this faux - sign ... just seemed to fit the theme of the day .
All - Righty

Wrap-up
The setup for a Pogoplug seems straightforward enough : just plug in any NTFS , FAT32 , non-journaled HFS + , ext2 , or ext3 drive into the box , plug the box into a router , follow a quick setup guide , and away you go .
Easy enough , right ?
Yes -- but not without a few minor hitches .
Our first problem was a basic one -- why do we need to physically plug this into a router ?
Not only did it make finding a spot for the box and the drive that much harder , but in an age where everything is going wireless , this seems like a bit of a step backwards .
Secondly , when it came time to input the access code for the Pogoplug -- inconveniently located on the side of the adapter -- we had to run over to where our router was situated and copy it down .
Kind of a pain , given how many other ways there are to handle something like this .
Regardless , once that code went in and we created an account on the company 's " My Pogoplug " page , we were all set .
The Pogoplug definitely works as advertised .
In fact , we can't think of another box that makes it this easy to get web access to your data .
Once you log into your account , you 're presented with your drive just as if you 're browsing to it on your desktop ( though obviously via a web interface ) .
The layout of the site is clean and simple , and makes navigating your content fairly simple .
From the portal , you can browse files , view some video or image files , listen to audio , and download those files to your local drive .
If you have write access , you can also do basic management like deleting , renaming , or moving files .
You can also pick specific folders and share them with others , providing a quick way to give access to files for viewing or downloading .
The app sends a link to the people you choose to share with , and you can also create an RSS feed of particular folders .
Additionally , you can download a small piece of software that lets you mount the networked drive as you would anything else on your computer , and there 's an iPhone app that lets you get at those files in almost exactly the same way you would via the web .
The iPhone app does n't seem to be bug free ; it did n't display entire lists of files properly , though on the upside , it allows you to listen to some audio in the background ( of the Pogoplug app that is ) , view compatible image and video files , and download files locally to the phone ( though they 're only viewable in the app ) .
All - in - all , we like the Pogoplug a lot , but we do have a couple of quibbles .
Mainly , we wish this were a WiFi enabled device , which would spare some cables and setup pain .
Additionally , it would be nice to see a device of this nature with multiple USB ports instead of just the one -- yes , you can attach a hub , but you 're already dealing with a mess of lines as it is .
Still , for $ 99 , the ability to turn a random drive into not only a network - accessible device , but a remotely - accessible device is huge , and we plan on putting it into heavy rotation around here .

Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .
Find out more .
The Resource Expert Droid
A ( very ) long time ago , I wrote the Cacheability Engine to help people figure out how a Web cache would treat their sites .
It has a few bugs , but is generally useful for that purpose .
However , as I ’ve got more involved in using HTTP for non-browser things , it ’s become apparent that more than caching is important when you ’re examining a resource to see how it behaves ; things like partial content , syntax checking and other esoteric but important details .
Very often , I ’d find myself manually debugging a RESTful Web service with telnet — and as they say , that does n’t scale .
Looking back at that decade - old code , I decided that rather than fixing it up ( “ lipstick ” and “ pig ” are two words that come to mind ) , I ’d rewrite .
The result , after quite a few evenings and weekends , is the Resource Expert Droid .
In a nutshell , RED is a framework for testing HTTP resources ; it fetches responses , analyses them , and then based upon the responses it may interact with the resource more to see how it behaves .
In this manner , it ’s very purposefully encouraging RESTfulness .
Note that I say “ resources ” , not “ servers . ”
Since a single server can serve you content in a number of different ways ( think plain files vs. CGI vs. mod_autoindex ) , you need to test on a per-resource granularity when you have problems .
Of course , this observation is n’t new .
A few examples for fun ( please take it easy on these ! ) :
Make sure you hover over the messages in the list for a full explanation of each .
REDbot is Open Source , and hosted at Github .
It ’s nowhere near finished yet , there ’s still lots more to do ( see the issues list ) , but contributions and suggestions are more than welcome .
LOS ANGELES — Trent Reznor was backstage one afternoon last summer , fooling around with his iPhone to stave off boredom before a show , when he realized that fans standing in line outside were broadcasting photos from the scene using their iPhones .
So he took the obvious next step : Using Twinkle , the same Twitter app the fans were using , he started sending out photos from backstage .
And so an idea was born .
" We started thinking , ‘ Hey , this could be pretty cool , ’ " Reznor recalls .
A few days from now , the results should be up on Apple ’s App Store for anyone to use .
The free Nine Inch Nails app , scheduled for release as soon as it gets final approval from Apple , is a mobile window on all things NIN : music , photos , videos , message boards , even — thanks to a GPS - enabled feature called Nearby — the fans themselves .
Nearby is " kind of like Twitter within the Nine Inch Nails network , " says Rob Sheridan , Reznor ’s long - time collaborator .
" You can post a message or a photo by location , and if you ’re at a show you can see conversations between other people who are right there . "
Fans have had their curiosity stoked by hints about the iPhone app that have shown up on Reznor ’s Twitter feed .
" We ’re all waiting for it , " says Brandon Dusseau , a Milwaukee - based web designer who ’s one of the founders of NinWiki , one of the group ’s leading unofficial fan sites .
" I ’m sure it will get tons of downloads , and I ’m hoping it will be a really cool resource .
But all I know is , it ’s coming out soon . "
In an exclusive interview at Reznor ’s home , a coolly modern structure high above the Westside region of Los Angeles , Reznor and Sheridan previewed the new app and explained how it fits in with their plans for survival in a post - label world .
The iPhone app is the culmination , at least for now , of a process that began a year - and - a - half ago , when Nine Inch Nails succeeded in extracting itself from its contract with Universal Music Group’s
Interscope label .
" When we found out we ’d been released it was like ,
‘ Thank god ! ’ " says Reznor , trim and beefy in black jeans and a black T - shirt .
" But 20 minutes later it was , ‘ Uh - oh , now what are we going to do ? ’
It was incredibly liberating , and it was terrifying . "
Since then , Reznor has pioneered a new , fan - centered business model that radically breaks with the practices of the struggling music industry .
His embrace of " freemium " pricing , torrent distribution , fan remixes and social media seem to be paying off financially even as they have helped him forge deeper connections with the Nine Inch Nails faithful .
It ’s something he never could have done before , even on an indie label .
" Anyone who ’s an executive at a record label does not understand what the internet is , how it works , how people use it , how fans and consumers interact — no idea , " he declares .
" I ’m surprised they know how to use e-mail .
They have built a business around selling plastic discs , and nobody wants plastic discs any more . "
Meanwhile , the entire system that for a lucky few turned those discs into hits — rock radio , MTV , music mags , CD megastores — has crumbled , and label execs have no idea where to turn .
" They ’re in such a state of denial it ’s impossible for them to understand what ’s happening , " Reznor says .
" As an artist , you are now the marketer . "
And the only marketing vehicle that makes sense is the net .
Reznor and Sheridan had used it successfully before , in the alternate - reality game they created with 42 Entertainment to explain NIN ’s 2007 album , Year Zero .
But what else should they do ?
The Radiohead experiment — offer downloads online and ask people to pay what they want — struck him as an invitation to be insulted .
So after selling music for nearly 20 years , Reznor decided to give it away .
He would expand NIN ’s website into an all - inclusive resource fans could use to find not just tour dates but photos , video , music — " a one - stop shop for every bit of information you could ever want , " he says .
Everything in the shop — including The Slip , his most recent album — would be free .
" I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again : I do n’t think music should be free , " Reznor says .
" But the climate is such that it ’s impossible for me to change that , because the record labels have established a sense of mistrust .
So everything we ’ve tried to do has been from the point of view of , ‘ What would I want if I were a fan ?
How would I want to be treated ? ’
Now let ’s work back from that .
Let ’s find a way for that to make sense and monetize it . "
Over the past year , NIN.com has quietly evolved into a series of interlocking services designed to deliver maximum benefit to the fans at minimal expense to the artist .
To build it out , Reznor decided to use off - the - shelf resources — Blogger , Twitter , FeedBurner , Flickr , YouTube — rather than trying to duplicate what other people had already created .
" They ’re going to do a better job than we are , " he explains , " and they ’re going to have a lot more resources to put into it . "
" We ’re using what people are already using every day anyway , " adds
Sheridan , a smaller figure with a three - day growth of beard and pale , wolf - blue eyes .
" It ’s media on the fans ’ terms , how they want to use it , instead of trying to be like this " — he wraps his arms around his torso as if trying to hold himself in — " which is the old - media strategy . "
Under the circumstances , it made little sense to try to manage what went up on the site .
Why would they , when they had an army of people who ’d relish the job ?
" We ’ll never outdo a community of obsessive fans , " Reznor says .
" People who have the same maniacal completion problem that Rob and I have playing videogames — let them funnel that shit into making our website cool . "
To put the fans to work , NIN ’s tech team — a Glendale , California , outfit called Sudjam — used the APIs for Flickr and YouTube to enable users to connect their NIN accounts with their accounts on those sites .
That meant users could tag items on Flickr and YouTube and have them pop up on NIN.com , where other users will find them neatly ordered and ready for viewing .
Sudjam expects to do the same for Photobucket and Vimeo shortly .
Obviously someone has to supervise all this , but Reznor has crowdsourced that function as well .
NIN.com is mostly governed by fan moderators — unpaid superfans who enjoy special privileges on the site .
" It becomes a source of pride for them , " says
Sheridan , " to make sure everything is what it says it is . "
Next up : Incorporating a wiki into the site .
The most likely candidate is NinWiki , which was built on MediaWiki , the open source software written for Wikipedia .
By putting a fan wiki together with NIN. com ’s media galleries , which at last count comprised some 30,000 photos and videos , the utility of the data the two sites possess could increase exponentially .
" Here ’s this tour date from three years ago , " Sheridan hypothesizes .
" Through MediaWiki , the fans have entered in a set list .
Each song is clickable , so you can see every show that song was ever played at .
And it ’s tied into our image and video database , so you can also see every video that song appears in . "
By making available — for free , of course — the individual tracks that make up the master recordings of his songs , Reznor has even crowdsourced the remix function .
He released multi-track versions of his songs as early as 2005 , but
Interscope was n’t happy with the idea of putting fan remixes online .
Now that he ’s been sprung from the label , that ’s no longer an issue .
At last count , NIN.com had 11,000 fan remixes available for streaming or download .
Thanks to an XML feed , you can even subscribe to them as a podcast .
" I doubt I ’ll ever pay someone to do a remix again , "
Reznor says , " because there ’s some amazing stuff just coming out of bedrooms . "
Free downloads can cost a lot of money to deliver , especially when the options include better - than - CD sound quality .
So for the higher - quality offerings , Reznor turned to BitTorrent — " the domain of pirates , " he acknowledges , " but it ’s also a great technology that is free . "
Pirates are no longer the enemy anyway : " Our battle is against download costs . "
To cover the costs of recording and distributing the album , Reznor also offered The Slip as a limited - edition CD for $ 10 .
Even as he urged fans to download and share the album online , he sold 250,000 numbered copies of the CD .
The album is also available on iTunes for $ 9.90 .
" So we managed to permeate the marketplace , " Reznor says , " and we also managed to monetize the album . "
The one part of NIN.com that Reznor had custom - built is the piece that sits at the center of it all : the database of fan info that has been harvested from the registration process that ’s required to take full advantage of the site .
That database , created by Sudjam , is what makes the tie-ins with Flickr and YouTube work , but it ’s also given Reznor 2 million e-mail addresses — which adds up to a pretty powerful distribution network .
" If The Slip had X
number of downloads , we know who those people are and we ’ll reach out to them with the next thing we have , " he says .
A concert coming up in Atlanta ?
It ’s a simple matter to send out e-mails to everyone within a hundred - mile radius of the city .
" That seems to be the most valuable thing you can get — a way to reach people , " Reznor says .
Peter
Jenner , one - time manager of Pink Floyd and The Clash and retired head of the International Music Managers ’ Forum , agrees .
" There ’s an enormous value in having a relationship with your fans , " he says .
" More value even than in selling your records .
I think old Trent ’s a sharp cookie . "
Taking that connection mobile was the logical next step .
" We created an app , " Reznor says , " that reformats the website to make almost everything on it available in an iPhone - able version and also adds location - based awareness .
This now brings it into the real world , where you can find people if you choose to . "
When the band toured Europe last year , Sheridan regularly updated the site by posting pictures he ’d snapped onstage .
It was great , Reznor says : " People felt included .
People kind of felt like they were getting postcards from us . "
The iPhone app takes that a big step further .
NIN.com has a Google Earth plug - in that fans can use to see conversations and photos from across the planet , or at a specific location .
A feature on the iPhone app ’s Nearby tab will enable them to post messages and photos from their iPhones to the website and have them pop up in Google Earth .
All this is a long way from the powerlessness Reznor felt when he was starting out in Cleveland in the 1980s .
" One of the biggest wake - up calls of my career was when I saw a record contract , " he says .
" I said , ‘ Wait — you sell it for $ 18.98 and I make 80 cents ?
And I have to pay you back the money you lent me to make it and then you own it ?
Who the fuck made that rule ?
Oh !
The record labels made it because artists are dumb and they ’ll sign anything ’ — like I did . "
Reznor is still experimenting , and it remains unclear how effective his methods will be for less - established bands .
But by spurring him to try new ideas , ending his label affiliation has given him a tentative new business model as well as a new form of engagement with his fans .
If the labels had tried to connect with fans online instead of dragging them into court , he figures , the music industry would n’t be collapsing today .
But no matter ; he ’s moved on .
" My quest in life now is to surround myself with smart , innovative people , " he says , " instead of the gangster types who have exploited artists over the years . "

It speaks for him : JW Clark , 7 , who has autism , uses an iPhone application called Proloquo2go as a communication tool .
Leslie Clark and her husband have been trying to communicate with their autistic 7 - year - old son , JW , for years , but until last month , the closest they got was rudimentary sign language .
He 's " a little bit of a mini- genius , " Clark says , but like many autistic children , JW does n't speak at all .
Desperate to communicate with him , she considered buying a specialized device like the ones at his elementary school in Lincoln , Neb .
But the text - to - speech machines are huge , heavy and expensive ; a few go for $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 .
Then a teacher told her about a new application that a researcher had developed for , of all things , the iPhone and iPod Touch .
Clark drove to the local Best Buy and picked up a Touch , then downloaded the " app " from iTunes .
Total cost : about $ 500 .
A month later , JW goes everywhere with the slick touch - screen mp3 player strapped to his arm .
It lets him touch icons that voice basic comments or questions , such as , " I want Grandma 's cookies " or " I 'm angry — here 's why . "
He uses his " talker " to communicate with everyone — including his service dog , Roscoe , who listens to voice commands through the tiny speakers .
It 's a largely untold story of Apple 's popular audio devices .
It is not known how many specialized apps are out there , but Apple touts a handful on iTunes , among them ones that help users do American Sign Language and others like Proloquo2 Go , which helps JW speak .
The app also aids children and adults with Down syndrome , cerebral palsy and Lou Gehrig 's Disease , or ALS — even stroke patients who have lost the ability to speak , says its co-developer , Penn State doctoral student Samuel Sennott .
Using the iPhone and Touch allows developers to democratize a system that has relied on devices that were too expensive or difficult to customize , Sennott says .
" I love people being able to get it at Best Buy , " he says .
" That 's just a dream . "
He also says that for an autistic child , the ability to whip out an iPhone and talk to friends brings " this very hard - to - quantify cool factor . "
Sennott wo n't give out sales figures for the $ 149.99 app but says they 're " extremely brisk . "
Ronald Leaf , director of Autism Partnership , a private California - based agency , says he prefers to help autistic children such as JW learn how to navigate their world without gadgets .
" If we could get children to talk without using technology , that would be our preference , " he says .
Clark says the app has changed her son's life .
" He 's actually communicating , " she says .
" It 's nice to see what 's going on in his head . "
Among the revelations of the past month :
She now knows JW 's favorite restaurant .
" I get to spend at least every other day at the Chinese buffet . "

South Korean soldiers walk past a barbed wire fence as they change guards at a watch post near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in Paju , about 45 km ( 28 miles ) north of Seoul , June 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea has outlined a plan to counter a possible missile attack by North Korea , including airstrikes on a missile base , Seoul ’s Yonhap News reported on Sunday citing military sources .
A scenario by the South ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted to President Lee Myung - bak on Saturday included a plan to counter - attack in case North Korea fires a missile targeting the South ’s battleships in the contested waters off the west coast , Yonhap said .
The response under the contingency plan would be joint attacks from surface , air and sea against the North ’s missile base , it said .
In late May , South Korea and the United States raised the military alert level for the peninsula after the communist North ramped up tensions by war threats , missile launches and a nuclear test .
The South ’s navy earlier in June also deployed a guided - missile vessel near the sea border off the west coast .
The Yellow Sea has been the site of two deadly clashes between the two rival Koreas in the past 10 years .
South Korean president Lee said on Saturday that his government would not back down to the North ’s threats , saying the South has a strong defense .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s decision not to prosecute CIA interrogators who used waterboarding on terrorism suspects amounts to a breach of international law , the U.N. rapporteur on torture said .
“ The United States , like all other states that are part of the U.N. convention against torture , is committed to conducting criminal investigations of torture and to bringing all persons against whom there is sound evidence to court , ” U.N. special rapporteur Manfred Nowak told the Austrian daily Der Standard .
Nowak did not think Obama would go as far as to seek an amnesty law for affected CIA personnel and therefore U.S. courts could still try torture suspects , he said on Saturday .
Obama has affirmed his unwillingness to prosecute under anti-torture laws CIA personnel who relied in good faith on Bush administration legal opinions issued after the September 11 attacks .
Obama said he had ended harrowing techniques used against detainees by Bush - era CIA personnel , but that U.S. intelligence agents still operated in a dangerous world and had to be confident they could perform their jobs .
Nowak , an Austrian , suggested an investigation by an independent commission before suspects were tried and said it would be important for all victims to receive compensation .
Human rights advocates have attacked Obama ’s decision , saying charges were necessary to prevent future abuses and hold people accountable .
Some U.S. lawmakers have called for public investigations .
The four memos Obama released approved techniques including waterboarding , week - long sleep deprivation , forced nudity and putting insects in with a tightly confined prisoner .
His administration also said it would try to shield CIA employees from “ any international or foreign tribunal ” -- an immediate challenge to Spain where a judge has threatened to investigate Bush administration officials .

US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday he had found " a lot of confidence " in the US economy among Chinese leaders he met on his two - day visit here .
In other circles , however , skepticism was widespread .
When Mr. Geithner told a student audience Monday that Chinese assets invested in Treasury bonds were " very safe , " his intended reassurance drew loud and dubious laughter .
A survey of 23 top Chinese economists , published in the daily Global Times on the eve of his arrival , found that 17 feared that Beijing 's huge dollar holdings put China in " a very dangerous position . "
America 's largest creditor
As China has amassed vast foreign - exchange earnings from its worldwide exports over the past decade , it has become America 's biggest creditor , holding $ 768 billion in Treasury bonds and almost as much again in other US dollar assets .
That makes China highly vulnerable to a fall in the dollar 's value , which some experts say is likely if the Obama administration 's loose credit policy and ballooning deficit lead to inflation .
Premier Wen Jiabao worried aloud last March about the value of Chinese dollar investments .
Geithner worked hard here to convince Chinese leaders and analysts that " we are very committed to make sure that when recovery is established , we go back to living within our means , that we bring our fiscal deficits down , " as he told Chinese state TV on Tuesday .
Geithner also said Tuesday that the US would " do everything that is necessary to try to make sure we 're sustaining confidence in US financial markets , not just in the United States but around the world . "
The Treasury secretary 's reassurances were not enough for Xu Xiaonian , a professor at the China - Europe International Business School in Shanghai .
" Talk is cheap , " he scoffs .
" If the US really wants to convince China that Treasury bonds are a safe investment , we need to see some credible measures , " such as inflation - linked interest rates .
Chinese officials did not comment on Geithner 's reassurances , but they echoed his insistence that Washington and Beijing must work more closely together if they are to pull the world out of the current financial and economic crisis .
" We should strengthen strategic mutual trust and deepen pragmatic cooperation , " said Vice Premier Wang Qishan , Geithner 's counterpart at high - level talks planned for this summer in Washington .
Those talks , he added , will " send a message that China and the United States are cooperating substantively . "
China likely to keep buying Treasury bonds
Nor do many analysts here believe the Chinese government will stop buying Treasury bonds , even if they now appear a riskier investment than in the past .
" Stabilizing the US dollar conforms to Chinese interests , " says Shen Jiru , a prominent economic commentator here .
" If China sold its bonds , the value of the dollar would fall , " he adds .
A 10 percent drop would cost Beijing $ 120 billion .
Ordinary citizens , however , appear to have little sympathy for such arguments , to judge by comments on Internet chat rooms .
" It 's a big joke that China 's money will disappear with nothing to be gained , and the beneficiary still says that the money is safe , " wrote one Internaut from Hebei Province on Sina.com , a popular Internet portal .
" Do n't trust Uncle Sam , " warned another .
" Why do they enjoy the pleasures and we pay the bill ? "
( Johannesburg ) - The Angolan government should immediately end the unlawful detention and torture of people suspected of rebel activities in the oil - rich enclave province of Cabinda , Human Rights Watch said in a report released today .
In the 27 - page report , " ‘ They Put Me in the Hole ' : Military Detention , Torture , and Lack of Due Process in Cabinda , " Human Rights Watch shows a disturbing pattern of human rights violations by the Angolan armed forces and state intelligence officials .
Between September 2007 and March 2009 , at least 38 people were arbitrarily arrested by the military in Cabinda and accused of state security crimes .
Most were subjected to lengthy incommunicado detention , torture , and cruel or inhumane treatment in military custody and were denied due process rights .
" The Angolan armed forces are committing serious human rights violations in Cabinda , " said Georgette Gagnon , Africa director at Human Rights Watch .
" Angola 's security concerns do not justify torturing people or denying them their most basic rights . "
Human Rights
Watch 's report is based on first - hand , in - person interviews in March 2009 with 20 detainees at the civilian prison at Yabi in Cabinda , as well as court records and other sources .
Many of those detained were residents of villages in the interior of Cabinda who were arrested during military raids that followed armed attacks attributed to the Liberation Front of the Enclave of Cabinda ( FLEC ) , a separatist guerrilla movement .
They were eventually charged with state security crimes for alleged involvement in armed attacks attributed to the separatists .
The detainees gave Human Rights Watch consistent accounts of being mistreated in military custody .
One said : " They took me - tied up - to the military garrison in Caio and put me in a hole full of water .
I stayed there for 19 days ... I insisted I was innocent . "
Another detainee said : " The military beat me , squeezed my testicles and my tongue with a pincer , telling me to ‘ say the truth . '
I cried in pain . "
Court records show that confessions obtained under torture were used as evidence during judicial proceedings and that defense lawyers were given no prior access to this " evidence . "
The government should drop all cases brought against citizens based on unlawful confessions , such as those obtained under torture , Human Rights Watch said .
Torture is prohibited by international human rights law at all times , and international due - process standards prohibit confessions obtained under duress from being used as evidence .
Human Rights
Watch called on the Angolan government to ensure that the armed forces promptly transfer individuals detained for security crimes to the competent civilian authorities , hold them according to international standards for pretrial detention , and provide a prompt and fair trial .
The government should investigate all allegations of serious human rights violations by members of the military and intelligence services , and prosecute alleged perpetrators , Human Rights Watch said .
The Human Rights Watch report provides further details of the high - profile case of Fernando Lelo , a former Voice of America correspondent who was convicted of national security crimes in an unfair trial in September 2008 .
The report also draws attention to cases that have attracted much less public attention and risk being overlooked .
There are cautious signs of improvement : unlike Lelo and soldiers convicted along with him , all other detainees charged with state security crimes are to be tried before a civilian court .
In May 2009 , a judge of the Cabinda civilian court acquitted four such detainees for lack of evidence ; the Cabinda prosecutor has filed an appeal , which is pending .
" A court acquittal for lack of evidence is a positive sign , but unless the detainees tortured receive compensation and the military officials responsible are punished , there is little to guarantee against future abuses , " Gagnon said .
" The Angolan government should promptly review the unfair conviction of Fernando Lelo and his co-accused , ensure full due - process rights to those accused of state security crimes , and provide effective remedies to the victims of torture . "
A 2006 peace agreement signed by the government of Angola and a faction of the separatist guerrilla movement sought to end formally the armed conflict in Cabinda , which has endured since Angola 's independence in 1975 .
The Angolan government claims that the war in Cabinda is over .
However , sporadic attacks on government forces and expatriate workers have continued , and a FLEC group has threatened to increase activities ahead of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations , which will also be held in Cabinda .
The first International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) red list of oceanic sharks names 64 species as endangered .
Sharks are vulnerable because they take decades to mature and produce few young
Overfishing threatens to drive a third of the world 's open - ocean shark species to extinction , say conservationists .
Hammerheads , giant devil rays and porbeagle sharks are among 64 species on the first ever red list for oceanic sharks produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
Sharks are vulnerable because they can take decades to mature and they produce few young .
The scalloped hammerhead shark , which has declined by 99 % over the past 30 years in some parts of the world , is particularly vulnerable and has been given globally endangered status on the red list , which means it is nearing extinction .
In the Gulf of Mexico , the oceanic whitetip shark has declined by a similar amount .
Scientists estimate that shark populations in the north - west Atlantic Ocean have declined by an average of 50 % since the early 1970s .
Announcing the red list of open - ocean or " pelagic " sharks and rays today , scientists called on governments to set limits for catching the animals on the high seas and to enforce strict bans on " finning " – the practice of catching sharks , cutting off their fins and throwing the bodies back in the water .
" Despite mounting threats , sharks remain virtually unprotected on the high seas , " said Sonja Fordham , deputy chair of the shark specialist group at the IUCN and policy director for the Shark Alliance .
" The vulnerability and lengthy migrations of most open - ocean sharks call for coordinated , international conservation plans .
Our report documents serious overfishing of these species in national and international waters , and demonstrates a clear need for immediate action on a global scale . "
Pelagic sharks are usually caught on the high seas in tuna or swordfish fisheries .
In 2007 , 21 shark - fishing nations reported catching more than 10,000 tonnes of shark .
The top five – Indonesia , India , Taiwan , Spain and Mexico – accounted for 42 % .
At one time , sharks were considered worthless bycatch , but they are increasingly being fished on purpose to serve emerging markets for their meat and fins , which are used in soups and can fetch more than £ 100 per kilogram .
In places such as China , shark - fin soup could once only be afforded by the elite , but the growing numbers of middle - class people in the country has driven up demand .
To satisfy the growing market , some fishermen have taken to finning sharks .
There are bans on this practice in operation around the world , but Fordham said the coverage is patchy and , in any case , enforcing the bans is difficult due to a lack of policing on the high seas .
" The overarching problem for sharks is that , for a variety of reasons , they 've been considered low priority and they 're traditionally low value compared with something like the tuna , " said Fordham .
" Also public image feeds into that – I do n't know if there are people clamouring for their conservation . "
Most species of pelagic shark take many years to mature and have relatively few young when they do reproduce .
The IUCN 's report highlights a study by scientists in Canada which showed that the population of porbeagle sharks , classified as vulnerable in the red list , has been so affected by fishing that it will take at least 100 years to recover .
Yet the government still allows the animal to be fished in its waters .
The global dusky shark popualtion , also classed as vulnerable by the IUCN , could take up to 400 years to recover because the animals are not sexually mature until around 20 years of age and usually raise only one offspring at a time .
Fordham said that because many of the sharks on the red list are at the top of the food chain , their extinction could also cause major local ecological problems .
" We know that most of these species are top predators and we know that removing the top predators usually has negative consequences to the system as a whole . "
In 2007 , Julia Baum of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California , who is also a member of IUCN shark specialist group , published a study showing how a major decline in the numbers of predatory sharks in the north Atlantic after 2000 had allowed populations of cownose rays , which are their prey , to explode .
The rays in turn decimated the populations of bay scallop off North Carolina .
" There was a fishery for bay scallops in North Carolina that lasted over a century uninterrupted and it was closed down in 2004 because of cownose rays , " she said last year .
Conserving threatened shark species might not be difficult .
Last year , Peter Klimley of the University of California , Davis , found that scalloped hammerhead sharks migrate along fixed " superhighways " in the oceans , speeding between a series of " stepping stone " sites near coastal islands ranging from Mexico to Ecuador .
Focusing marine reserves around these hotspots might be a cost - effective way to conserve the species .
The IUCN sharks red list is published a few days before Spain is due to host an international meeting of the managers of tuna fisheries , where many of the sharks are caught .
Scientists are also meeting in Denmark this week to produce advice for authorities on how to manage populations of Atlantic porbeagle sharks .
" The completion of this global assessment of pelagic sharks and rays will provide an important baseline for monitoring the status of these keystone species in our oceans , " said Roger McManus , vice - president for marine programmes at Conservation International .

The ante went up Thursday in a battle over chicken - naming rights on city streets .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter Thursday morning to Mayor Ron Littlefield , saying the group would double the amount of a donation the city received from KFC Corp. to fix potholes on city streets .
KFC gave $ 3,000 , and PETA is offering $ 6,000 .
The catch would be that they want to put an evil depiction of KFC founder Col.
Harlan Sanders on the road with the tagline , " KFC Tortures Animals , " the group said Thursday .
" We want Chattanooga residents to know what their road repairs really cost , " said Nicole Matthews , PETA spokeswoman .
" It 's the lives of around 360 million chickens . "
On Wednesday , city crews were spraypainting temporary chalk logos that said " Re- freshed by KFC " on potholes filled with KFC - purchased asphalt .
City officials said they possibly could repair up to 500 potholes with the money .
Richard Beeland , spokesman for Mayor Ron Littlefield , said Thursday the city would not accept the offer from PETA .
" We are not going to place ourselves into the middle of an argument between PETA and the KFC Corp. , " he said .
Mr. Beeland said it also would be inappropriate to accept PETA's " awkward requirement " that maligns KFC .
KFC offered the same donations to Louisville , Ky. , Topeka , Kan. , and Warren , Ohio , officials .
Ms. Matthews said the group made the same offer to Louisville , Ky. , and also to a city in California that applied for the KFC donation .
Warren , Ohio , also received a $ 6,000 counter - offer , along with an offer to feed city workers vegetarian lunches , according to news reports .
KFC spokesman Rick Maynard said Thursday that " PETA 's reputation speaks for itself . "
He noted that all of PETA 's effort to give money to cities in response to KFC has failed .
" They 've made the offer , " he said .
" Nobody 's accepted it . "
Poor Mr. Polar Bear .
When he's not jumping from melting ice chunk to ice chunk trying desperately not to drown , he 's avoiding the floating Russian nuclear power stations and their potential toxic waste .

You read that correctly , fellow Net denizens .
Coming soon , Mr. Polar Bear and his brethren will be sharing real estate with a ring of floating , self - sustained nuclear power stations .
It 's all part of Russia 's — and the world 's — ongoing thirst for energy .
Environmentalists are understandably outraged over the impact said stations could have on an already endangered area of the globe , and if polar bears could talk , I imagine they'd be outraged too .

Said a rep from Bellona , a Scandinavian environmental watchdog group , " [ The plan ] is highly risky .
The risk of a nuclear accident on a floating power plant is increased .
The plants ' potential impact on the fragile Arctic environment through emissions of radioactivity and heat remains a major concern .
If there is an accident , it would be impossible to handle . "
Oh , and there 's this fear that Russia will simply dump the radioactive waste into the Arctic Sea anwyay , which they 've done before on several occasions .
To date at least 12 nuclear reactors from decommissioned Russian submarines have been dumped , along with more than 5,000 containers of solid and liquid waste .

Joe Nocera writes about Thursday ’s New York Revie / PEN event on the economy , but fails to mention what I found the most depressing aspect of the whole thing : further confirmation that we ’re living in a Dark Age of macroeconomics , in which hard - won knowledge has simply been forgotten .
What ’s the evidence ?
Niall Ferguson “ explaining ” that fiscal expansion will actually be contractionary , because it will drive up interest rates .
At least that ’s what I think he said ; there were so many flourishes that it ’s hard to tell .
But in any case , this is really sad : John Hicks knew far more about this in 1937 than people who think they ’re sophisticates know now .
In any case , I thought it might be useful to re-explain why our current predicament can be thought of as a global excess of desired savings — which means that fiscal deficits wo n’t drive up interest rates unless they also expand the economy .
Here ’s what I imagine Niall Ferguson was thinking : he was thinking of the interest rate as determined by the supply and demand for savings .
This is the “ loanable funds ” model of the interest rate , which is in every textbook , mine included .
It looks like this :
where S is savings , I investment spending , and r the interest rate .
What Keynes pointed out was that this picture is incomplete if you allow for the possibility that the economy is not at full employment .
Why ?
Because saving and investment depend on the level of GDP .
Suppose GDP rises ; some of this increase in income will be saved , pushing the savings schedule to the right .
There may also be a rise in investment demand , but ordinarily we ’d expect the savings rise to be larger , so that the interest rate falls :
So supply and demand for funds does n’t tell you what the interest rate is — not by itself .
It tells you what the interest rate would be conditional on the level of GDP ; or to put it another way , it defines a relationship between the interest rate and GDP , like this :
This is the IS curve , taught in Econ 101 .
Now , we usually explain how this curve is derived in a different way : we say that given the interest rate , you can determine investment demand , and then through the multiplier process this determines GDP .
What you ’re supposed to understand , however , is that the derivation I ’ve just given is just a different way of arriving at the same result .
It ’s just different presentations of the same model .
So what determines the level of GDP , and hence also ties down the interest rate ?
The answer is that you need to add “ liquidity preference ” , the supply and demand for money .
In the modern world , we often take a shortcut and just assume that the central bank adjusts the money supply so as to achieve a target interest rate , in effect choosing a point on the IS curve .
Which brings us to the current state of affairs .
Right now the interest rate that the Fed can choose is essentially zero , but that ’s not enough to achieve full employment .
As shown above , the interest rate the Fed would like to have is negative .
That ’s not just what I say , by the way : the FT reports that the Fed ’s own economists estimate the desired Fed funds rate at - 5 percent .
What does this situation look like in terms of loanable funds ?
Draw the supply and demand for funds that would obtain if we were at full employment .
They look like this :
In effect , we have an incipient excess supply of savings even at a zero interest rate .
And that ’s our problem .
So what does government borrowing do ?
It gives some of those excess savings a place to go — and in the process expands overall demand , and hence GDP .
It does NOT crowd out private spending , at least not until the excess supply of savings has been sopped up , which is the same thing as saying not until the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap .
Now , there are real problems with large - scale government borrowing — mainly , the effect on the government debt burden .
I do n’t want to minimize those problems ; some countries , such as Ireland , are being forced into fiscal contraction even in the face of severe recession .
But the fact remains that our current problem is , in effect , a problem of excess worldwide savings , looking for someplace to go .

Beach police are searching for an 18 - year - old white man in jail on public intoxication charges who they say was accidentally released when he pretended to be a 34 - year - old black man .
Richard Daniel Wines , 18 , of Mount Holly , N.C. , was sentenced to five days in jail Saturday morning after pleading guilty to a public intoxication charge .
But when jail officers were releasing other inmates later that morning , Wines claimed to be Jonathan Jermain Gardner of Myrtle Beach .
Wines was freed at 10:42 a.m. and was given Gardner 's valuables , the report states .
`` It was an error to release him , and we 're handling it internally , '' said Capt .
David Knipes , spokesman for the Myrtle Beach Police Department .
Jamie Varn , the officer who released Wines , is on duty pending the results of the investigation , Knipes said .
Officers who release inmates have certain procedures they must follow before allowing an inmate to leave the jail , Knipes said .
`` They are supposed to verify the information on the booking card , '' Knipes said .
`` They ask your name , date of birth , Social Security number , address ... and any number of identifying factors .
In this case , that did not happen . '' Gardner , who also was jailed on a public intoxication charge , said Monday he was going to talk to jail officials about how the mistake happened .
`` I do n't understand it , '' said Gardner , who was released from jail Saturday afternoon .
`` They 're supposed to ask you for your Social Security number and whatever .
As far as I 've been told , they did n't do any of that .
And they gave him all of my valuables .
'' Officers released Gardner 's property to Wines .
That included $ 2 in change , a silver necklace , a gold - colored wedding band , a pair of gold - studded earrings and Gardner 's S.C. identification card , the report states .
During the release procedure , Wines signed Gardner 's booking card with Gardner 's name , the report states .
Detention officers discovered the mistake at 3:30 p.m. , the report shows .
Officers conducted a head count of the inmates and learned that Wines was listed as incarcerated but was not at the jail .
Gardner told officers that he was sleeping and he did not hear his name originally called when he was to be released , the report shows .
Additional charges are pending against Wines , police said .
Since the overwhelming election victory for incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad there have been reports of opposition members being arrested , newspapers being censored and banned and internet sites being blocked .
OPPOSITION Hundreds of thousands of defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi took to the streets on Monday , 15 June , defying a protest ban .
Gunfire was heard and at least one person is reported to have been killed and many wounded .
Until his appearance earlier at Monday 's rally , Mr Mousavi , had not been seen in public since Friday 's poll , sparking fears he was under house arrest .
Reports of the protests have been censored on TV and in the newspapers
His wife , Zahra Rahnavard , earlier attended a rally of students in Tehran .
Overnight on Sunday dozens of students were arrested during a protest at their university .
Iran 's deputy police chief , Ahmad Reza Radan , told the official Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) that about 170 people were arrested over the weekend .
Reports said that among the opposition politicians and activists rounded up were Mohammad Reza Khatami , brother of former President Mohammad Khatami .
AFP names Behzad Nabavi , a former deputy parliament speaker , Mohsen Mirdamadi , who headed parliament 's foreign policy commission under Khatami , and Khatami 's government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh as having been detained .
Radio Free Europe spoke to the wife of religious activist Taghi Rahmani , who described how her husband was taken away in a car by security forces from their home on Sunday night .
However , a number of news agencies , including the Associated Press , say that a number of people were released on Sunday and Mohammad Reza Khatami is mentioned as being among them .
It is not known how many remain in custody .
DOMESTIC MEDIA
There has been a filtering of many web sites , censorship of newspapers before printing , and restrictions on the broadcast of news of the three losing candidates , according to the reformist newspaper Aftab-e Yazd .
Sarmayeh , another reformist newspaper , has reported that Kalameh Sabz ( Green Word ) , the paper run by Mir Hossein Mousavi , was nowhere to be found in Tehran on Monday .
The Associated Press is quoting an unnamed editor as saying that the paper was blocked at the printing house because the authorities were upset with statements by Mr Mousavi reported in it .
Sarmayeh 's censored article on Green Word also discussed the suspension of Velayat , a newspaper circulating in Qazvin , a town to the west of Tehran .
According to Reporters Without Borders , a Paris - based group that campaigns for press freedom , a number of leading journalists had been arrested .
They included Reza Alijani , Hoda Sabaer , Ahamad Zeydabadi and Taghi Rahmani .
There is no word of about 10 other journalists who have either been arrested or gone into hiding , the group says .
Over the last few days , fours of the main pro-reform newspapers have been closed or prevented from questioning the official election results .
Two Farsi - language TV stations were partially jammed on Sunday .
Reporters Without Borders said the editor of the news website Nooroz , Said Shariti , has been arrested and 10 or so pro-opposition websites have been censored .
The organisation reports that the internet has been very slow , as has the mobile phone network .
YouTube and Facebook are hard to access and pro-reform sites such as Khordadeno , AftabNews and Ghalamesabz have at times been completely inaccessible .
FOREIGN MEDIA
There have also been reports of a clampdown on independent media .
The Saudi - funded Arabic TV station al - Arabiya said its offices in Iran were shut down for " unknown reasons " for one week .
Reporters Without Borders says the Farsi - language satellite broadcasts of Voice of America were blocked over the weekend .
Access to the BBC's Persian - language satellite TV channel and the BBC 's news website has been curbed .
German television network ZDF said on Sunday that its reporter in Iran and other reporters were being " prevented from doing their jobs in a massive form " .
The network said it was unable to show a broadcast feed from the network 's correspondent depicting protests .
Italian state TV RAI said one of its crews was caught in a street clash .
An Iranian interpreter was beaten by riot police and officers confiscated the cameraman 's videotapes .
A spokesman for the Swedish network SVT said its reporter in Iran had been asked to " leave Iran as soon as possible because the elections are over " .

Until recently , I was an officer with a large sheriff 's department in the southeast .
I was called into IAD after a rumor surfaced in the jail that was supposedly started by a local known prostitute and whom I have had numerous runins with while working a sidejob at the bus station .
This rumor was heard by a corrections officer and passed up the chain of command .
That is when I was called into IAD .
I was told that supposedly this prostitute had told a C.O. that I had picked her up and paid her for sex in the back of a cruiser while working at the bus station .
She had not signed a complaint against me , and was unable to be located to be interviewed ( how convenient ! ) .
I was read the Garrity Warning and signed a form that I had been advised and understood my rights under Garrity .
I was asked and truthfully denied that I had ever had sexual contact with her or any other prostitute , never had sex in a county vehicle , in uniform , or while on duty .
I advised the IAD Lt that I had been cursed and threatened by this crackhead prostitute on more occasions than I could count and that the only thing I could PROVE is that I had never used a cruiser while working at the bus station .
He asked if I would submit to a " voluntary " polygraph and I immediately agreed .
After all , I had been truthful and had nothing to hide .
An " independent " polygraph examiner was called in and I was sent to wait in the lobby while he set up .
The Lt. talked to the examiner for approximately an hour while I was in the lobby .
I was called in , and hooked up to the machine after the test was explained and he went over the questions that would be asked .
When the test started , the questions were asked in random order , the 5 or 6 relevant questions , and some questions he said were profile questions , ie Have you ever lied to a supervisor , have you ever lied to get anyone in trouble , etc .
He said these were FBI profile questions that are asked of everyone .
The questions were asked 3 different times with a break in between .
I was sent back outside to take a break , and felt confident that I had passed , since I had been TRUTHFUL in my answers to every question .
I was called back in after about 15 minutes and told that I had failed on all the relevant questions !
Then the Lt. and the examiner both started asking fishing questions like " has one of these prostitutes ever groped you " , have you ever fondled one of them , etc .
Then he was rather condescending and telling me that " hey , we are all human " , etc. and asking " what have you ever done that maybe you are n't being truthful about ? "
I told them both that I had no idea why I had failed and that I had nothing to tell them , because I had been truthful with them .
One of the things that puzzle me is that he was telling me that I scored - 5 on this question , - 3 on this question , and so on , and that meant I was n't being truthful on any of them .
He said I scored - 6 ( I think ) on the question of having sex in a county vehicle and I told him that I could prove that I had never used a cruiser on a side job , and he told me " I believe you on that question but not the rest of them .
Well , if the machine said I lied on all of the questions , how can he say he believes me on one of them that I supposedly lied on , and does n't believe me on the rest ?
Would n't that contradict the accuracy of the entire test ?
I was immediately terminated and my badge , ID , etc was immediately collected .
Needless to say , I am still in shock over the whole deal .
I had enough confidence ( maybe naivete ) in the system to believe that since I was telling the truth , all would be cleared up .
What the hell happened ?
Is this a common occurrence with polygraph tests ?
The only other time I have taken a polygraph was in the 80's as an applicant with a police department in Virginia .
I took the test and 3 weeks later was told to come in to retake the test .
I was not told why , and after the second test , I moved on to the next phase .
If someone could shed some light as to what might have happened , I would greatly appreciate it .
Thanks .

Lobért , 41 , walked up to the stage in a white strapless gown , gloves and veil .
Earlier this week , she wrote on her MySpace blog : " I am getting married .
It 's about time . "
She had worked as a prostitute for 11 years , making as much as $ 500 an hour .
She said she hit rock bottom when she overdosed on cocaine and everything went black , according to an ABC interview posted on her Web site .
She asked Jesus to help her and became what many jokingly call a " porn- again Christian . "
Lobért says her mission now is to save the souls of women who sell their bodies .
She often spends time at night on Las Vegas streets handing out Bibles to prostitutes and seeking to convince them there is a better way to make a living .
The Hookers for Jesus Web site describes the organization as " an international , faith - based organization that addresses the realities of human sex trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation linked to pornography and the sex industry . "
Before he administered the vows , Pastor Benny Perez said Lobért was a shining example of Christ 's love for everyone .
Fox , 47 , is a longtime member of Stryper , which stands for Salvation Through Redemption , Yielding Peace , Encouragement and Righteousness .
The band 's albums include " Reborn : and " In God We Trust . "

Die deutsche Musikindustrie will nach französischem Vorbild ein Internetverbot für Urheberrechtsverletzer auch in der Bundesrepublik .
Die in Frankreich beschlossene Einführung von Verwarnungen und Zugangssperren für illegales Herunterladen aus dem Internet zeige , wie man mit massenhafter Verletzung des Urheberrechts effizient umgehen könne , erklärte der Vorstandsvorsitzende des Bundesverbandes Musikindustrie , Dieter Gorny .
Die Musikindustrie macht vor allem illegales Kopieren von urheberrechtlich geschützter Musik für einen Großteil der Milliarden - Einbußen verantwortlich ; Tauschbörsen und nicht lizenzierte CD - Kopien hätten das Geschäftsmodell eines gesamten Industriezweiges ins Wanken gebracht .
Ein qualitativ geschäftsfähiges
Internet könne nur im Zusammenspiel von technischer Infrastruktur und Inhalten entstehen , erklärte Gorny nun .
Diese Erkenntnis vermisse er in der deutschen Politik .
Wer den massenhaften Diebstahl von Musik , Filmen , Hörbüchern , Games und Software im Internet in den Griff bekomme , könne der Kreativwirtschaft einen internationalen Wettbewerbsvorteil verschaffen .
In Frankreich hatten beide Parlamentskammern beschlossen , den Internetzugang von Urheberrechtsverletzern zu verbieten , sollten Verwarnungen zuvor nicht fruchten .
Das Gesetz sieht eine Sperre des Internetzugangs von bis zu einem Jahr beim dritten Verstoß gegen das Urheberrecht vor ( Three - Strikes - Modell ) ; die gesperrten User müssten zudem die Gebühren ihres Internetproviders während der Sperre weiterbezahlen .
Zudem soll nicht eine richterliche Entscheidung , ob tatsächlich eine Urheberrechtsverletzung vorliege und wie sie zu ahnden sei , für die Internetsperre maßgeblich sein .
Vielmehr soll eine Behörde , HADOPI ( Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Oeuvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet ) genannt , auf Hinweis der Rechteinhaber oder - verwerter hin tätig werden .
Das EU - Parlament hatte sich zuvor dafür ausgesprochen , dass Eingriffe in die Grundrechte der Nutzer nur nach einer Gerichtsentscheidung verhängt werden dürfen .
Internet - Sperren , die durch eine Behörde oder andere staatliche Organisation ohne richterliche Überprüfung verhängt würden , sollen damit ausgeschlossen werden .
Kritiker sehen mit der französischen Lösung das Grundrecht auf Informationsfreiheit verletzt und halten sie angesichts der technologischen Entwicklung für unpraktikabel .
Die deutsche Musikindustrie ist aber schon seit Längerem Anhänger des französischen Three - Strikes - Modell .
Im März hatte der Musikindustrie - Verband angekündigt , wieder vermehrt wegen Urheberrechtsverletzungen vor die Gerichte zu ziehen : Der Musikindustrie bleibe nichts anderes übrig , solange die Diskussion über das Aufsetzen eines Systems einer " abgestuften Erwiderung " auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen mit Warnhinweisen und Internetsperren hierzulande in eine Sackgasse geraten sei , meinte Gorny bei der Vorstellung der Jahreszahlen der Branche .
Damals hoffte er allerdings auch noch , dass das französische Vorgehen in eine europäische Regelung Eingang finde .

The presence of the American military has also been a significant factor in the nation ’s stability , along with the active participation of the largely Sunni neighborhood watch groups , known as the Awakening .
But now the American military is stepping back and the Sunni guards , many of them former insurgents , are watching the government with skepticism , uncertain whether they have a political voice .
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Maliki will be able to keep violence to an acceptable level .
“ All this is against al - Maliki , ” said Muayad Hamed , a doctor who has watched the politics of Shiite neighborhoods because he has worked on projects in Sadr City and other Shiite communities in Baghdad .
“ The rumor on the street is that after 30 June there will be more attacks to show that al - Maliki cannot work without the Americans and that all his power came from the Americans , ” he said .
The scene on Wednesday evening at Imam Ali hospital , the largest in Sadr City , was one of mourning and chaos .
Relatives and friends of the victims jammed the doors , pushing and shoving as they pleaded with hospital employees to let them search for loved ones .
Many of those who had managed to enter received only sad news .
Women wailed in grief as they discovered that their sons or husbands had been killed .
One , Um Ali , blamed the government .
“ Where are the promises of the government ; they said we are going to do things better , ” she said as she waited to see her sons , both of whom had been badly wounded .
“ Look at what they ’ve done .
They have done nothing for us .
It just goes from worse to worse . ”
Others accused the people they thought had carried out the attacks .
“ People who do n’t fear God did this , the terrorists , ” said Ali Abbas , near tears as he stood next to one of his brothers , who was badly wounded .
He said he believed that another brother had also been hurt in the attack .
Haider Kadhim , 34 , who had a badly injured leg , spoke in a low tone as if he could not believe what happened .
“ Me and my friend went to the market because there was no electricity at home and it was too hot , ” he said , “ so we went out and were just hanging out , and now I ’ve lost my friend .
He died .
“ We should have stayed home , ” he said .
Whether you 're driving 20 miles or 2000 , being able to find gas , grab a bite to eat , keep up with the news or check the map for your location are all essential to a good journey on the road .
With the right iPhone apps , you can avoiding sticky situations like running out of gas or getting lost miles from home .
Recently , I drove across the country ( Chicago to San Francisco ) and got to experience the usefulness of iPhone apps on the road .
From finding the nearest gas station to learning about the local scene , the iPhone was integral to my journey .
The following are 11 of the most useful iPhone apps if you plan to embark on a road trip , or even just a drive across town :
i Phone apps for finding things
1. MapsBuddy : MapsBuddy is a popular application that makes searching on Google Maps easy .
MapsBuddy provides quick shortcuts for finding gas stations , restaurants , post offices , and everything you 'll need for the road .
2. SimulTravel GPS :
If you 're looking for a hotel for the night , a great app is SimulTravel GPS - it locates hotels near your location in a snap and provides prices and detailed information on each hotel .
3. Urbanspoon : Looking for food nearby ?
Then Urbanspoon is your best bet .
Urbanspoon helps you find great restaurants based on your cravings .
The key to its usefulness during road travel is its ability to show you restaurants nearby , no matter where you are .
4 . Yelp :
Yelp , the popular reviews - based social network , is also an iPhone app .
It will detect your current location and give you reviews of hotels , restaurants , and even gas stations nearby .
5 . Where To? : Another great app for finding things , Where To helps you find places of interest ( i.e. zoos , spas , shopping centers ) .
It does cost $ 2.99 , but is worth it just for the " Surprise Me ! " feature , which will help you pick where you want to stop if the group or family can't decide .
i Phone apps for information on the road
6. Road Trip :
The most comprehensive road travel app of them all , Road Trip allows you to track mileage , fuel prices , graph out trip expenses , and even export the data to CSV .
It costs $ 4.99 , but there is also Road Trip LITE , which is free .
7 . The Weather Channel :
The weather can change in a snap , and thus you need to be prepared with knowledge .
Although the iPhone has a standard weather app , The Weather Channel will provide you with weather conditions for your exact location , as well as radar maps and long - term forecasts .
8. WifiTrack :
If you 're on the road , there are things that you 'll need to do that require Internet on your computer .
But why pay for Wi - Fi when it can be found for free ?
WifiTrack helps determine the strength of WiFi hotspots and helps you find the ones that do n't require you to pay .
This app costs $ 0.99 , so an alternative is Free Wi-Fi , which has less features and different functionality , but saves you a dollar .
Miscellaneous Useful Applications
9. Road Trip Fun :
If you 're bringing kids on the road , you need an easy way to entertain them .
How about some games ?
Road Trip Games provides simple explanations for dozens of classic road games like I Spy and Where 's the Alphabet ?
10 . Flashlight :
If you 're stopped at night and need to find something in the car , you 're going to need a flashlight .
This free app turns your phone into a flashlight ( there are many color options , too ) , and it could come in handy .
11 . Tweetie :
If you 're a Twitter addict like me , having Twitter on the road is essential for keeping up with the latest news , trends , and memes .
Tweetie is not only great for the road because of its easy - to - use interface , but because of its integration with TwitPic , so you can send your friends and family pictures of you on the road .
It also has a location feature for nearby tweeters if you 're in the mood for an impromptu tweetup .

Mr Steinbrück suggested Germany should build up its service sector The German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück has told the BBC that Germany must begin to reduce its dependence on foreign trade .
Germany was ranked by the World Factbook as the biggest exporter in the world last year .
But the downturn in global trade caused by the credit crisis has hit it hard .
The German government expects the country 's economy to contract by 6 % this year , largely because of very steep falls in exports .
Some economists have argued that Germany had relied far too heavily on foreign trade , which made it rich in the boom times but left it vulnerable to a global crisis .
Its finance minister Peer Steinbrück has now admitted in an interview with the BBC that the current balance between foreign and domestic markets must start to change .
Promoting services " We have to strengthen our internal , our domestic demand in Germany ... to reduce this dependency on foreign trade , " he said .
He suggested that the service sector would have to be promoted and that education and training should be given to young people to meet the needs of Germany 's ageing population .
But Mr Steinbrück remained very cautious about the size of the change .
At present , 45 % of the country 's earnings comes from international trade .
He would not be drawn on how much that might be reduced .
" I ca n't figure out a concrete number , " he said .
" That would be crazy . "
And he emphasised that he still wanted Germany to remain in the " Champions ' League " of exporters .
Asked whether the bottom of the economic cycle had now been reached , Mr Steinbrück shrugged his shoulders and said nobody knew .
" If you can find someone who knows , " he said dryly , " give me his number . "
He suggested that some indicators pointed to things getting a little bit better , but warned that the world still faced very unsafe times .

" If you were forced to eliminate one of these musicians from your life forever , whom would you KEEP and WHY ?
Radiohead vs. The Beatles . "
This is the message that greeted me as I logged into Facebook one innocent morning .
It was not a complete surprise since my friend David had been conducting a sort of survey / game which might be best described as a NCAA Basketball Tournament meets “ If you were stuck on a desert island with only one album ” game ( except he does n’t limit it to just one album ) .
David posts the match up , his friends vote by commenting on his status , and the Artist / Band with the most votes moves onto the next round .
When I saw that David ’s game had pitted The Beatles against Radiohead I soon discovered that I could not fit my response into a tiny Facebook comment field .
This battle bubbled to the surface a comparison I had heard before : that Radiohead is “ The Beatles of Modern Times . ”
So Instead , I indulged myself in the type of analytic yet casual writing I imagine one might expect from a freelance writer for some hip music magazine — and so it goes :
I would have to keep The Beatles and I think our friend Kelly Wells nailed the MAIN reason why :
“ The fab four touched on nearly every emotion and subject matter in ways both beautiful and creative .
To top it all off , they did it in something like 4 years and 12 ( ish ) albums .
They invented the video …
They pioneered musical feats that enabled Radiohead ”
Now Radiohead can’t help the fact that The Beatles invented half the techniques and styles used to today , but this does n’t explain how The Beatles ( compared to Radiohead ) were just more versatile and touched on a wider range of moods and subjects .
To make this point self evident :
Where is the happy Radiohead song about the sun or just about love ?
One could argue that Radiohead purposefully avoids “ cliche ” or “ happy ” themes in an attempt to do something new ( which they certainly have ) .
But exploring new musical territory should n’t exclude one from expressing an entire side of the human existence or finding a new way to twist an old cliche ( see Björk ) .
Granted , versatile does n’t automatically mean better , but if you pull it off like The Beatles did , then engaging your audience in a full range of experiences certainly seems like a selling point .
So how were the Beatles able to create such versatile music ?
I believe this stems from the dynamic of having three “ Songwriters ” in the band ( sorry Ringo , we still love though ) .
The reason I put “ Songwriters ” in “ quotes ” is because I think the term has really lost it ’s meaning over the years and clarifying its definition greatly pertains to the question at hand .
Specifically , this definition of “ Songwriting ” relates to my assertion that , since “ The Bends ” and “ O.K. Computer , ” Radiohead has not written much in the way of “ Songs ” ( which is fine ) — more on that later .
From listening to Radiohead ’s recent music and by drawing on my personal experiences with creating music , I am led to believe that their workflow is this :
1 ) The band comes up with some compelling idea in rehearsal .
2 ) Thom experiments with different vocal melodies over the top
3 ) Subject to cognitive preferences for the familiar , the band agrees to stick with the first melody
Thom is able to remember enough to repeat .
4 ) Everyone feels like an equal collaborator and all is harmonious in Radioheadlandia .
As I said before , this is a perfectly legitimate work - flow , and makes for some incredible music ( point in case , all of “ Kid A ” or perhaps George Harrison ’s “ Love You To ” ) .
But when it ’s the only work - flow in your composing toolbox , it will limit your versatility .
It seems to me , then , that the vocal melodies of recent Radiohead “ Songs ” are quite literally Thom ’s visceral reaction to hearing the music , NOT a carefully crafted melody .
So in my view ( and arguably by definition ) , Radiohead ’s recent music is n’t “ Songwriting ” ;
It ’s certainly “ Composition , ” but perhaps not “ Songwriting ” it ’s not particularly melodic .
Yet has Radiohead deliberately chosen a visceral style ?
Yes and no .
I believe that after “ O.K. Computer ” Radiohead looked to move in a different direction .
But perhaps
Thom ’s songwriting inspiration had also started drying up or the band wanted to write more collaboratively so that they could share more of the publishing profits .
Either way , it ’s clear that , as a “ Songwriter , ” none of the other members of Radiohead have contributed as fruitfully as Thom .
And if you look at a band as a microcosm of society , it does n’t take a genius to see how this implied conflict between whether to showcase or obscure
Thom ’s role as the primary writer merely outputs music that reflects this implicit conflict .
The opposite configuration , therefore , is what I believe made The Beatles so miraculous : their music reflects their equaled songwriting capabilities and friendship .
As history shows , they also had their differences , which is possibly why their unique arrangement only lasted so long .
But while it lasted , The Beatles ’ collaboration was pure , it was beautiful and it sonically maps life ’s possibility for harmonious existence .
In fact , aside from their individual talents , I am quite certain that what caused The Beatles to be such a unique success , was EXACTLY their ability to allow all members to reach their full potential , without letting any one member feel diminished as a result .
So much so , that I dare you to think of any other band that had a similar arrangement of EQUALLY skilled songwriters .
There are a lot of great songwriters alive today , but are they truly up for the life challenge of a REAL collaboration ?
The Beatles were , and that I believe , is what made all the difference .
NATIONAL POLITICS & POLICY | Health Insurers Offer To End Practice of Charging Women Higher Premiums for Individual Policies
[ May 6 , 2009 ]
Health insurers would be willing to end the practice of charging women higher premiums than men for individual insurance policies if the government agrees not to establish a public insurance plan , America 's Health Insurance Plans President Karen Ignagni said Tuesday , the New York Times reports ( Pear , New York Times , 5/6 ) .
Ignagni made the proposal at a Senate Finance Committee hearing that focused on ways to cover uninsured U.S. residents as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the nation 's health care system .
President Obama and congressional Democrats support the creation of a government - run insurance program that would compete with private insurance plans .
This is concerning for several reasons .
First I was not aware of the practice of charging women more - and this can be from 25 % to 50 % more .
But I find this a somewhat cynical attempt to peel off constituencies supporting the public option by offering to make concessions conditional on dropping the public option .
Other offers so far include stopping the practice of refusing policies to the sick .
( They have n't actually offered to pay for needed treatment . )

FARMINGDALE , N.Y.  Phil Mickelson sat in the second - floor locker room behind the 18th green and tied his shoelaces .
The locker room that serves the Bethpage State Park golf courses is small and narrow , and when Mickelson stood , he bumped an attendant trying to gather a towel from the floor .
“ Oh , I ’m so sorry , ” Mickelson said .
Fifty yards away on the 18th green , Lucas Glover was celebrating his victory in the 109th United States Open .
Mickelson finished two strokes back , and was in second place at the event for the fifth time .
Mickelson took a watch from his pocket and wrapped it around his wrist .
He then shook hands with two locker room attendants and said : “ Thank you for everything .
You guys do a great job .
I ’m sorry we took an extra day of your time . ”
Mickelson removed his golf cap and walked to the simple men’s room at the end of the hall .
He splashed his face with water , pushed his wet hands through his hair and stared at the mirror above the white porcelain sink for a long second .
I just read an interesting debate in the National Education Association 's monthly magazine , , which unfortunately did n't post the article on its website .
Whether you take the teacher 's or the student 's perspective in this debate , the question is whether teachers should be able to require their students to participate in social - networking sites , or whether doing so is an invasion of privacy ?
John Damon , a professor from the University of Nebraska - Kearney , argues that social - networking is a private activity that should be kept separate from teaching and learning .
Damon admits to " friending " some of his former students on Facebook and MySpace .
He says that it would be rude to refuse friend requests and that such contacts " seem to me a normal part of human interaction " .
However , " requiring such use as a part of course requirements is an entirely different matter " .
In the end , he asserts , the downsides for students to online social - networking include the potential for " unwanted entanglements " , and for teachers , " unwarranted claims of harassment " .
On other side of the debate , Patrick Bishop , a professor from Ferris State University , argues that the question is n't whether to use social - networking technology in the classroom , but how .
" As educators , we are called to lead change , not just keep pace , " he says , and " navigating the world of social - networking is a necessary skill in the current marketplace " .
Bishop admits to requiring his Public Relations students to create a Twitter account and join HARO ( Help A Reporter Out ) , and portions of his course are covered via Wetpaint , a wiki - blog hybrid .
He quotes one of the best education blogs , , in saying , " We are living in exponential times ... preparing students for jobs that do n't exist yet , using technologies that have n't been invented , in order to solve problems we do n't even know about " .
So which side do you come down on in this debate ?
I , for one , believe the answer lies in the specific details of the class in question .
If someone asks a great chess master , " What is the best move possible to make in chess ? " , the truth is that there is no one move that can be deemed The Best ; there are only moves that might be better than others given the particular circumstances that a player finds himself in at a particular moment .
Thus , in a vacuum , you might argue that teachers absolutely should be able to require their students to participate in social - networks , or , conversely , that they absolutely should n't .
However , when applied to a particular circumstance , the answer might become a lot more clear .
For example , should a Computer Science class on Web Programming require that online social - networking be integrated into the curriculum ?
Absolutely .
Should a fourth grade English teacher require the same thing ?
Absolutely not .
As always , teachers need to strike a delicate balance between empowering their students while simultaneously acknowledging the other responsibilities their positions afford them as well .
A group of Italian and American investigators has published a new instrument for assessing cognitive and physical functioning ( the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire , CPFQ ) , in the current issue of Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics .
It is a brief scale to measure cognitive and executive dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders .
The internal consistency of the CPFQ was assessed by computing Cronbach 's coefficient based upon the average intercorrelation of the 7 items of the CPFQ in a sample of depressed outpatients and by factor analyzing data from the same sample to confirm that the scale is unifactorial and measuring a single construct screening scores and pretreatment baseline scores .
Sensitivity to change of the CPFQ was assessed by computing the dependent t test for the subjects in the active treatment condition in the second sample of depressed outpatients .
Finally , convergent validity for the CPFQ was assessed in two different ways .
Test - retest reliability of the CPFQ was assessed in a different sample of depressed outpatients by computing Pearson 's correlation coefficient between pretreatment .
The investigators found that the CPFQ is a unifactorial scale , with strong internal consistency .
It has good temporal stability as indicated by high test - retest reliability .
The CPFQ was also found to be sensitive to change with treatment and displayed convergent validity by significant correlations with other measures of sleepiness , fatigue , apathy and neuropsychological functioning .
Although , as expected , the CPFQ was significantly correlated with a measure of depression , the moderate correlation ( r ~ 0.30 ) indicates that the CPFQ is measuring a different construct .
In summary , the CPFQ is a unifactorial scale , with strong internal consistency , good temporal stability and sensitivity to change with treatment .
Further studies will be needed to assess the validity and reliability of this instrument in other psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions associated with cognitive dysfunction .

All the world wants to know the results of today 's presidential election in Iran , not least the Republican Guard supporters of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
But will it make a difference , either to the Iranians or to the rest of the world ?
Of course the West wants to be told that this dramatic poll will change Iran 's desire for nuclear facilities .
Whatever it is , this election is not about nuclear power .
It may be about presidential arrogance and stupidity and fear , or about responsible government or unemployment or the economy .
But the West should abandon hope of any real change in Iran 's nuclear strategy .
Mirhossein Mousavi may talk more sense to the Americans – if he wins – but the nuclear facilities will keep functioning .
It is all a matter of pride in Iran – where pride is a special quality .
And the thick , dark skin of clerical rule that covers Iran will remain , scratched occasionally perhaps , but unable to bleed or to re-imagine history or to reform a nation which so badly needs the change that only Mousavi , among the candidates , dreams of .
Government for and by the dead – symbolised in the continued " supreme leader " ethos that old Ayatollah Khomeini constructed before his death , has effectively sealed off Iran from those human rights which obsess the West .

Only one month ago , a 22 - year - old woman was dragged shrieking to the gallows as she pleaded with her mother on a mobile phone to save her .
Delara Darabi was hanged for a murder supposedly committed – if indeed she was guilty – at the age of 17 .
In any Western election , this would cause an earthquake , the resignation of governments , the destruction of whole political parties .
In Iran , the most serious scandal involving a woman during this election has been an apparently slanderous remark by President Ahmadinejad about the university qualifications of Mousavi 's wife .
Is there something sick in all this ?
Or is savage childishness the word we are looking for ?
Mousavi is at least backed by the saintly ex-president Mohamed Khatami – the West 's rejection of his rule brought us the triumph of the oddball Ahmadinejad , another victory for America at the time – and this might just give Mousavi the 50 per cent plus one seat for a clear win .
But the Basiji and the Iranian Republican Guard Corps ( IRGC ) scream about velvet and green revolutions à la Ukraine , as if threatening a coup to overthrow a coup .
It is interesting to remember that only a month ago , the corps stated that " on the eve of elections , the IRGC , as a matter of policy , does not let its official and contractual personnel nor the special Basiji interfere in election affairs , including support for or against a particular candidate . "
A month is clearly a long time in Iranian politics .
True , the campaign has given us some spectacular television bust - ups in which Ahmadinejad 's loopy views on the world – not to mention his doubts about the Jewish Holocaust – have been held up to ridicule by Mousavi .
But does that have them laughing in the millions of villages and hundreds of cities across Iran where the poor last gave their vote to the humble man who is the incumbent President and claimed a " halo " shone around him at the United Nations , causing his listeners not to blink for 25 minutes ?
Iranian politics has always produced a weird combination of sacred old men and smart economists – occasionally in highly unsacred coalition – and Mousavi 's steady hand as prime minister during the Somme - like Iran - Iraq war may add to his popularity .
But this was a war fought largely by the Basiji and the Republican Guards – as Ahmadinejad is well aware – and which Iran lost .
And now to find on the very eve of the election that Ahmadinejad is threatening to jail his opponents because of what he claims are their Hitler - like lies is surely moving towards infantilism of a unique kind .
It is certainly odd that Ahmadinejad denies Hitler 's greatest crime and then accuses his opponents of being Hitler .
If Hitler did n't kill the Jews of Europe , which crimes , one wonders , was Iran 's weird President thinking of ?
These images show members of the Ku Klux Klan as they want to be seen , scary and secretive and waiting in the wings for Barack and his colour - blind vision for America to fail .
Anthony Karen , a former Marine and self - taught photojournalist was granted access to the innermost sanctum of the Klan .
He does n’t tell us how he did it but he was considered trustworthy enough to be invited into their homes and allowed to photograph their most secretive ceremonies , such as the infamous cross burnings .
When he talks about the Klan members he has encountered he tends not to dwell on the fate of their victims .
Karen ’s feat is that he takes us to places few photojournalists have been before , into the belly of the beast .
The scenes he presents portray a kinder , gentler Klan .
The mute photographs present an organisation that is far less threatening than the hate group of our popular imagination .
Consciously or otherwise , his photographs hold our imagination in their grip while doing double duty as propaganda for the extremist right , much as Leni Riefenstahl ’s work did for the Nazis .
Today the Klan is a mere shadow of what it used to be and there are at least 34 differently named Klan groups .
“ They are a fairly low - rent bunch of people , many of whom use their local organisations as a way of raising money for themselves , ” says Mark Potok , director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Alabama .

Photographs of the Klan folk in their hooded regalia are n’t all that rare .
The archives of America ’s newspapers contain plenty of front - page photographs of lynchings throughout the past century .
Three years ago , James Cameron , the last survivor of an attempted lynching died , thankfully of natural causes .
The older generation of Black Americans grew up hearing about Klan lynchings whispered over the dinner table but never mentioned outside the home .
At the Klan ’s height , around the turn of the 20th century , some 30 to 40 lynchings a year were being recorded .
It is believed that there were in fact many more unrecorded deaths , especially in the cotton - growing south where the deaths of black field - hands were often not recorded .
Karen ’s photographs show an entirely different side of the far right .
He presents a 58 - year - old , fifth - generation seamstress he calls “ Ms Ruth ” and he has photographed her running up an outfit for the “ Exalted Cyclops ” or head of a local KKK chapter .
She gets paid about $ 140 for her trouble .
Karen tells us that she uses the earnings to help care for her 40 - year - old quadriplegic daughter , who was injured in a car accident 10 years ago .
Karen ’s images of the Klan and its supporters regularly appear on the recruiting websites of the far right .
Out of context , the images of hooded Klansmen and their families tell us little of the real story – the inexorable rise in the number of extremist organisations in America .
The number of hate - crime victims in the US is also rising and as America ’s middle and working class gets thrown out of work , the hate groups behind the crimes are flourishing .
As people lose their homes to foreclosure and , without the benefit of a safety net , find themselves slipping into poverty , there is already a search for scapegoats underway .
Immigrants from central and South America have become particular targets as the grim economic times take hold .
Anyone who doubts the capacity of the modern KKK for violence need look no further than the recent case of 43 - year - old Cynthia Lynch of Tulsa , Oklahoma .
She had never been out of her home state before she travelled to Louisiana to be initiated into the Klan .
She was met off the bus by two members of a group that calls itself the Sons of Dixie and taken to a campsite in the woods 60 miles north of New Orleans .
There , Lynch ’s head was shaven and after 24 hours of Klan boot camp , including chanting and running with torches , she had had enough and asked to be taken to town .
After an argument , the group ’s “ Grand Lordship ” , Chuck Foster , is alleged to have shot her to death .
He was charged with second - degree murder and is awaiting trial .
Just as shocking is that the event happened in Bogalusa , a backwoods Louisiana town that was once known as the Klan capital of the US .

In the 1960s the Klan operated with impunity in Bogalusa and once held a public meeting to decide which black church to burn down next .
Local Klan members were suspected of ambushing two black policemen in 1965 , killing one and wounding the other .
No one was ever tried for the crimes .
Despite all its notoriety the Klan has been a spent force for decades with nothing like the clout it once wielded .
At its peak the KKK boasted four million members and controlled the governor ’s mansions and legislatures of several states .
Since the 1930s the KKK has been in a state of disorganisation and today it probably has 6,000 members .
But the economic crisis is swelling their ranks and already , a month after the inauguration of the first black president , the tidal wave of interracial harmony that greeted Obama ’s election is starting to recede .
“ Things are certain to get worse , ” says Potok .
“ The ingredients are all there : a dire economy that is certain to get worse ; high levels of immigration ; the white majority that is soon to turn into a minority and a black man in the White House . ”
More than 400 hate - related incidents , from cross-burnings to effigies of President Obama hanging from nooses have been reported , according to law - enforcement authorities and Potok ’s organisation , which files lawsuits against hate groups aimed at making them bankrupt .
Late last year , two suspected skinheads who had links to a violent Klan chapter in Kentucky were charged with plotting to kill 88 black students .
They were then going to assassinate President Obama by blasting him from a speeding car while wearing white tuxedos and top hats .
They were never going to succeed , given the huge security net around Obama , but the fact that they had planned such an outlandish attack may be a harbinger of things to come .
“ There is a tremendous backlash to Obama ’s election , ” says Richard Barrett , the leader of the Nationalist Movement , another white supremacist group .
“ Many people look at the flag of the Republic of New Africa that was hoisted over the White House as an act of war .

After a Lutheran school expelled two 16 - year - old girls for having “ a bond of intimacy ” that was “ characteristic of a lesbian relationship , ” the girls sued , contending the school had violated a state anti-discrimination law .
In response to that suit , an appeals court decided this week that the private religious school was not a business and therefore did not have to comply with a state law that prohibits businesses from discriminating .
A lawyer for the girls said Tuesday that he would ask the California Supreme Court to overturn the unanimous ruling by a three - judge panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal .
The appeals court called its decision “ narrow , ” but lawyers on both sides of the case said it would protect private religious schools across California from such discrimination suits .
Kirk D. Hanson , who represented the girls , said the “ very troubling ” ruling would permit private schools to discriminate against anyone , as long as the schools used their religious beliefs as justification .

“ It is almost like it could roll back 20 to 30 years of progress we have made in this area , ” said the San Diego attorney .
“ Basically , this decision gives private schools the license to discriminate . ”
John McKay , who represented the Riverside County - based California Lutheran High School , said the ruling correctly acknowledged that the school ’s purpose was to “ teach Christian values in a Christian setting pursuant to a Christian code of conduct . ”
The girls were expelled in their junior year for “ conducting themselves in a manner consistent with being lesbians , ” said McKay , who added that the girls never disclosed their sexual orientation during the litigation .
Hanson said the girls had been “ best friends ” and , citing their privacy , declined to discuss their sexual orientation .
They are now in college , he said .
The dispute started when a student at the school told a teacher in 2005 that one of the girls had said she loved the other .
The student advised the teacher to look at the girls ’
MySpace pages .
One of the girls was identified as bisexual on her MySpace page , the other ’s page said she was “ not sure ” of her sexual orientation .

McKay said the website also contained a photograph of the girls hugging .
According to the principal , who called each girl out of class separately , both admitted they had hugged and kissed each other and told other students they were lesbians .
The girls said they admitted only that they loved each other as friends .
The principal “ just looked at me like I was a disease and I was so wrong , ” one of the girls later said .
They were identified in the legal proceedings only as Jane Doe and Mary Roe .
In ruling in favor of the school , the appeals court cited a 1998 California Supreme Court decision that said the Boy Scouts of America was a social organization , not a business establishment , and therefore did not have to comply with the Unruh Civil Rights Act .
That case also involved a discrimination complaint based on sexual orientation .

“ The school ’s religious message is inextricably intertwined with its secular functions , ” wrote Justice Betty A. Richli for the appeals court .
“ The whole purpose of sending one ’s child to a religious school is to ensure that he or she learns even secular subjects within a religious framework . ”
The school is affiliated with synods that believe homosexuality is a sin , the court said .
The school ’s “ Christian conduct ” code said students could be expelled for engaging in immoral or scandalous contact , on or off campus .
In addition to their discrimination claim , the girls complained that the school invaded their privacy and detained them unlawfully .
The girls complained the principal sat “ very close ” to them and asked them if they were bisexual , if they had kissed each other , and whether they had done anything “ inappropriate , ” the court said .
Mary
Roe said , “ He got very close to me and he said , ‘ Have you ever touched [ Jane Doe ] in . . . any inappropriate ways ?
And he looked me up and down when he asked that . ”

But the court said there was no evidence that the principal had a prurient interest in the girls .
“ It is hard to imagine how he could have determined whether they had a homosexual relationship without asking the questions that he in fact asked , ” wrote Richli , appointed to the court by former Gov. Pete Wilson .
The school also did not break the law when it disclosed the girls ’ “ suspected sexual orientation ” to their parents , the court said .
The parents , “ in light of their right to control their children ’s upbringing and education , had a right to know why ” they were being expelled , the court said .
Hanson said the entire episode was “ very traumatic ” and “ humiliating ” for the girls .
Advertisement
Shannon Price Minter , legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , said the ruling was based on “ the particular circumstances of this school . ”
“ Labeling a young person or telling her she is ‘ sinful ’ can be psychologically devastating , ” Minter said .
“ Regardless of one ’s religious beliefs , all adults have a responsibility to treat young people with compassion and respect . ”
School officials could not be reached for comment .
Timothy J. Tracey , litigation counsel for the Center for Law & Religious Freedom , said the ruling “ preserves the right of Christian schools in California to make admission and discipline decisions consistent with their religious beliefs . ”

Conspiracy theories have been around for generations but the internet has been a catalyst for thousands of theories about the world we live in , who is running it and why .
With the MPs expenses scandal giving rise to an even closer examination of who governs us and the lengths to which people will go to cover things up , it ’s no wonder that bloggers , tweeters and online chatrooms are boiling over with conspiracy theories .
From alien landing cover-ups to murder plots and tin foil hats , here are ten historical conspiracy theories still advocated today .

Over the past nearly four years , nearly 2,600 posts have appeared on Scholars & Rogues , almost all researched and written by the 15 folks whose names appear on our writers ’ bio page .
S&R writers have devoted thousands of hours to the task of filling this space .
These are skilled people with diverse interests and even more diverse points of view .
Three are college professors .
Also writing for S&R have been or are an Hispanic activist from Texas ; a foreign affairs writer who specializes in nuclear deproliferation issues and civilian casualties resulting from armed conflict ; a gay staff cartoonist ; a management consultant specializing in organizational behavior whose clients include 20 percent of the Fortune 500 ; an ex-pat South African economist ; three experts in popular culture ; a former director of the Berkeley Stage Company and statistical demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau ; a professional stage actor ; two stay - at - moms ; a photographer ; and occasional guest columnists .
However , we all share one trait :
We are volunteers .
We do n’t get paid .
We have other lives , other responsibilities , other people dependent on us to make a living .
As business models go , ours sucks .
Modest ad income and passing the hat means S&R remains a labor of love .
But can love be a sustaining force for the online medium in the absence of profit ?
In the Beginning of Blogging , it was all so exciting .
Thrilling , even .
Putting up a post , watching the stats , seeing who read your work , where they were — and how many read your stuff .
Generate those hits .
Yeah .
That was heady stuff .
Is it still ?
Most individual and group blogs are dependent on volunteers .
It ’s rare that a Huffington Post can raise $ 37 million to sustain the enterprise .
( Of course , HuffPo has “ volunteers ” too , does n’t it ? )
The print newspaper industry continues to collapse in terms of revenue , profitability , and numbers of paid , professional journalists .
So the dominant use of volunteers to inaugurate and maintain sites featuring commentary and / or advocacy journalism becomes an increasingly important public - interest issue .
Most S&R writers are ideologically progressive but rarely hew to party lines .
As the S&R mission statement says :
Scholars & Rogues is a diverse band of thinkers , social analysts , activists , grousers , jesters , and troublemakers .
We ’re different in many ways , but we share a general belief in progress , a conviction that smarter is better , and a passionate distaste for convention .
That statement mirrors the intent of many capable bloggers .
Many ( but perhaps not most ) bloggers seek to simply make things better .
We have particular issues or problems that occupy our blogging attention .
We are exceedingly dependent , though , on the research of others ( those paid professional journalists whose stories we link to ) to support points made in our posts .
But those posts , which leaven “ objective ” journalism with ( usually lucid ) commentary , add substance to debates of public interest .
Yet the majority of bloggers are not paid for their work .
What will become of community blogs such as S&R as the corps of volunteers 1 ) lose interest , 2 ) lose access to reliable , verifiable information produced by journalists , 3 ) lose equal access to the Web as politicians favor corporate control of the Internet or 4 ) just need to spend more time at the day job in a bad economy to make ends meet ?
Note that newspapers , in the early days of online news Web sites , had links where volunteers could post community news .
Now , that did n’t work out so well , did it ?
Let ’s hope community blogs fare better .
Volunteerism is the principle means of support for community blogs such as S&R .
Many such blogs , blogs populated by smart , capable people ( see our blogroll ) , no doubt face the same pressure the volunteers at S&R do : Keep pumpin ’ out the posts .
Keep the conversation going .
Keep the debate fresh and focused .
But it ’s difficult , as a volunteer , to pump out as many posts as I ’d like .
( I do like to get eight hours ’ sleep each night . )
At some point , as B.B. King would sing , “ The thrill is gone . ” I hope most of us are n’t there yet , but it ’s increasingly a problem faced by those bloggers who believe in candid , civil , and common - sense conversations in the public sphere — yet have family and job responsibilities elsewhere .
Damnation must have been one of those games that looked great on paper , mainly because no one would actually want to make something this rotten .
Somewhere during its execution something went terribly , terribly wrong .
A steampunk action / platformer set in an alternate United States where the Civil War still has n't ended certainly sounds exciting , but the problem is that Blue Omega Entertainment released a game that not only fails to take advantage of such a unique premise , but it 's also ugly , marred with poor design decisions , and rather broken in certain areas .
As soon as the game 's first cut scene is over , it 's easy to tell that Damnation will not provide players with an enjoyable experience .
Players are dropped into a battle against a wealthy industrialist who is bent on conquering both halves of the warring United States ; his immense army consists of steam - powered robots , drug - addled super soldiers , and legions of brainwashed citizens .
That might sound interesting , but there 's little actual backstory provided about the game 's world , and things stay vague - at - best all the way through .
It 's a shame , too , because the ruined cities , steam - driven technology , and existence of magic all seem like interesting plot points that are just never capitalized on .
Title Damnation Developer Blue Omega Entertainment Publisher Codemasters Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform Xbox 360 ( reviewed ) , PlayStation 3 , PC
The game 's production values are n't endearing , either .
While the concept art was probably amazing , based on often - interesting character and environment designs , Damnation 's graphics are about as ugly as you 're likely to find on the current generation of consoles .
Even though the Unreal Engine was used , character models look like something you 'd find on a previous - generation title , and it is n't entirely uncommon to have textures constantly pop up and disappear in certain parts of levels .
On top of that , there is not a single redeeming feature to the game 's dialogue : hearing lines like " See to it that his death does not come easily ; I want him to remember it , " is bad enough , hearing it delivered with the always terrible voice - acting is just painful .
Of course , the game 's play mechanics are no better .
Shooting sequences are rarely fun , as your party members often get taken out quickly and require you to frequently revive them , enemy AI is atrociously weak , and the vehicle sequences are absolutely unremarkable .
There is one thing done somewhat right , and that 's the platforming sequences .
Many of the large environments present multiple paths for players to take , which requires a kind of slow - paced free - running to navigate through .
It 's rather interesting to see what different routes can be taken , and it's often gratifying to pan the camera around and realize just how far you 've progressed , but then you 'll have to engage in some more obnoxious combat in order to keep on going .
There are many more problems with Damnation , including a wonky camera , poorly - placed save points , and load sequences that inconveniently interrupt action - heavy portions of the game .
If you could n't tell , this game feels like an incredible waste of a premise with a great deal of promise , and it should be avoided in stores .
Verdict : Skip
Enterprises over the next few weeks will get a better view of their future multicore chip options as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices prepare to move quickly on their road maps .
Intel officials on May 26 are expected to offer details of their eight - core Nehalem EX processors for high - end servers with four or more sockets .
The chips , which will run 16 threads simultaneously , are expected to ship in systems later this year or in early 2010 .
The Nehalem EX is the bigger brother to the Nehalem EP chip - now called the Xeon 5500 Series - for systems with two sockets , which was released March 30 , along with a host of systems running it from vendors such as Hewlett - Packard , Dell , IBM , Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu .
Like the Nehalem EP , the EX will offer such features as an integrated memory controller - similar to what AMD has been offering on Opteron for six years - and a chip - to - chip interconnect , plus enhanced virtualization capabilities and better energy efficiency .
The new high - end Xeons will become the top choice from Intel for high - end servers .
Currently the chip maker offers the six - core " Dunnington " chip , which was released last fall .
For its part , AMD is preparing to officially release its own six - core processor , code - named " Istanbul , " in June .
Initially the company planned for a rollout later in the year , but officials announced in late April that they had moved up the release date .
With its accelerated schedule , AMD began releasing the chip to OEMs in May , with Istanbul - powered systems expected in June .
AMD 's rollout comes as the company works its way through a tough global economy that is battering many technology vendors .
AMD posted a first - quarter loss of $ 416 million , and in early May announced a reorganization that includes merging its CPU and graphics chips business , which President and CEO Dirk Meyer said will be a key differentiator for AMD down the road .
AMD recently got a win when the European Commission fined Intel $ 1.45 billion for antitrust violations .
AMD officials applauded the decision , while Intel officials said they would appeal .
The fine just feeds into what has been a heated competition between the two companies since AMD launched its first Opteron chip in 2003 .
John Spooner , an analyst with Technology Business Research , said enterprises will welcome the new multicore processors from both companies as they look for ways to increase the performance of the IT environments while driving down costs .
Having more cores is one way to do that .
" IT managers are very savvy about technology , and they will view increasing core counts as a positive ; really a way to get the most out of a machine , " Spooner said in an IM interview .
" Value for their dollar - especially these days - is vital , so IT managers will choose the options that work best for them .
Whether that 's six or eight cores really depends on the application . "
He said AMD 's introduction of the six - core Istanbul chip could be a boon for the company in the two - socket server space , though not so much in the higher - end systems with four or more sockets , where Nehalem EX will play .
" Having a six - core option for the mainstream , two - socket market gives AMD something of an advantage in the marketing department , " Spooner said .
" I think that , on paper , more cores is better and that will likely get AMD in the door in a lot of situations where IT managers will want to evaluate Istanbul to see if it provides them with that extra value for the dollar .
It remains to be seen if six - core Istanbul will beat out four - core Xeon 5500 / Nehalem . "
For those higher - end systems , it may be a tougher sale , Spooner said .
" There , swapping processors essentially costs nothing , " he said .
" It 's a few hundred or a few thousand dollars . "

New research that uses an innovative approach to study , for the first time , the relative contributions of food and exercise habits to the development of the obesity epidemic has concluded that the rise in obesity in the United States since the 1970s was virtually all due to increased energy intake .
How much of the obesity epidemic has been caused by excess calorie intake and how much by reductions in physical activity has been long debated and while experts agree that making it easier for people to eat less and exercise more are both important for combating it , they debate where the public health focus should be .
A study presented on Friday at the European Congress on Obesity is the first to examine the question of the proportional contributions to the obesity epidemic by combining metabolic relationships , the laws of thermodynamics , epidemiological data and agricultural data .
" There have been a lot of assumptions that both reduced physical activity and increased energy intake have been major drivers of the obesity epidemic .
Until now , nobody has proposed how to quantify their relative contributions to the rise in obesity since the 1970s .
This study demonstrates that the weight gain in the American population seems to be virtually all explained by eating more calories .
It appears that changes in physical activity played a minimal role , " said the study 's leader , Professor Boyd Swinburn , chair of population health and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention at Deakin University in Australia .
The scientists started by testing 1,399 adults and 963 children to determine how many calories their bodies burn in total under free - living conditions .
The test is the most accurate measure of total calorie burning in real - life situations .
Once they had determined each person 's calorie burning rate , Swinburn and his colleagues were able to calculate how much adults needed to eat in order to maintain a stable weight and how much children needed to eat in order to maintain a normal growth curve .

They then worked out how much Americans were actually eating , using national food supply data ( the amount of food produced and imported , minus the amount exported , thrown away and used for animals or other non-human uses ) from the 1970s and the early 2000s .
The researchers used their findings to predict how much weight they would expect Americans to have gained over the 30 - year period studied if food intake were the only influence .
They used data from a nationally representative survey ( NHANES ) that recorded the weight of Americans in the 1970s and early 2000s to determine the actual weight gain over that period .
" If the actual weight increase was the same as what we predicted , that meant that food intake was virtually entirely responsible .
If it was n't , that meant changes in physical activity also played a role , " Swinburn said .
" If the actual weight gain was higher than predicted , that would suggest that a decrease in physical activity played a role . "
The researchers found that in children , the predicted and actual weight increase matched exactly , indicating that the increases in energy intake alone over the 30 years studied could explain the weight increase .
" For adults , we predicted that they would be 10.8 kg heavier , but in fact they were 8.6 kg heavier .
That suggests that excess food intake still explains the weight gain , but that there may have been increases in physical activity over the 30 years that have blunted what would otherwise have been a higher weight gain , " Swinburn said .
" To return to the average weights of the 1970s , we would need to reverse the increased food intake of about 350 calories a day for children ( about one can of fizzy drink and a small portion of French fries ) and 500 calories a day for adults ( about one large hamburger ) , " Swinburn said .
" Alternatively , we could achieve similar results by increasing physical activity by about 150 minutes a day of extra walking for children and 110 minutes for adults , but realistically , although a combination of both is needed , the focus would have to be on reducing calorie intake . "
He emphasized that physical activity should not be ignored as a contributor to reducing obesity and should continue to be promoted because of its many other benefits , but that expectations regarding what can be achieved with exercise need to be lowered and public health policy shifted more toward encouraging people to eat less .

On the issue of Iran 's disputed nuclear program , all four candidates stick to the official line that their country has the right to pursue any kind of nuclear research it wants .
Mr Mousavi , however , is thought to be more willing to negotiate on the matter with the West , and has given public assurances that Iran has no plans to build a bomb .
According to the less alarming forecasts of the GIEC ( Intergovernmental group on the evolution of the climate ) , the ocean level should rise from 20 to 90 cm during the 21st Century with a status quo by 50 cm ( versus 10 cm in the 20th Century ) .
As a solution to this alarming problem architect Vincent Callebaut came up with this ecotectural marvel .
He called this project “ Lilypad “ , but this ecotectural marvel is also called as “ Floating Ecopolis for Climate Refugees ” .
The idea of Lilypad Project is to create a series of floating self - sufficient ocean - going eco-city islands .
Each one would be able to house 50,000 residents and would support a great deal of biodiversity .
Collecting pools located in their centers would gather and filter water for use on board .
These would be places for adventurers and refugees alike as water levels rise around the world and threaten many , particularly island , habitats .
Vincent Callebaut hopes that Lilypad will make the transition from design to reality around the year 2100 .
The main deck with three marinas , the submarine performing arts center and the gardens of phytopurification .
The three mountains are ecological niches , aquaculture fields and biologic corridors .
The floating structure in “ branches ” of the Ecopolis inspired of the highly ribbed leave of the giant lilypad of Amazonia Victoria Regia .
Entirely autosufficient , Lilypad takes up the four main challenges launched by the OECD in March 2008 : climate .
biodiversity , water and health .

Shares of Canwest Global Communications are essentially worthless and should be avoided by investors as Canada 's biggest media company fights to restructure its massive debt amid a severe advertising downturn , analysts said Monday .
Canwest has another debt deadline looming Tuesday , by which time it must pay $ 30.4 million ( U.S. ) in interest to holders of its 8 per cent senior subordinated notes .
The payment was originally due March 15 , but the company missed it .
If it does n't pay Tuesday , the investors can demand the repayment of about $ 761 million of outstanding principal on the notes .
This could further exacerbate the crisis facing the company .
" Given the significant liquidity challenges facing the company , we see no residual value in the shares of Canwest , " BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Casey wrote in a note to clients .
While critical , the looming interest payment is only the tip of the iceberg for Winnipeg , Manitoba - based Canwest , which has a debtload of about $ 3.7 billion ( Canadian ) , some of it dating back to its 2000 acquisition of newspaper assets from Hollinger International .
The company is in talks with both the noteholders and its banks to restructure its debtload and recapitalize its balance sheet .
Meanwhile , lenders have clamped down on the amount of credit they are willing to advance to the company .
" Based on these major liquidity challenges , it seems unlikely to us that Canwest can continue in its current form , " Casey wrote , adding that timely and successful asset sales also seem unlikely .
The recession continues to severely depress the advertising market , which is the lifeblood of Canwest 's stable of newspapers and television stations .
It has also dampened the appetites of potential buyers of Canwest 's assets .
Canwest owns a chain of Canadian daily newspapers , including the flagship National Post , as well as Canada 's Global TV network .
It also has television operations in Australia , through its stake in Network Ten .
Last week , Canwest posted a net loss of $ 1.44 billion for the three months ended Feb. 28 .
This included a $ 1.19 billion writedown related mostly to its publishing operations .
" We see no compelling reason to own , let alone buy Canwest shares , which we would continue to avoid , " National Bank Financial analyst Adam Shine wrote in a note .
Analysts have previously said that Canwest could file for bankruptcy protection , but the company thus far has continued to negotiate with its creditors rather than involve the courts .
" We continue to believe there is significant risk Canwest is forced into bankruptcy protection or to sell assets at unfavourable prices or a massive debt restructuring , " GMP Securities analyst Jason Jacobson wrote to clients .
" Either way , we believe Canwest equity value is very limited . "
His target price on the shares is zero .
A Canwest spokesman had no comment on the status of the creditor talks Monday .
A HISTORY OF DEBT
Canwest is considering selling five conventional TV stations and has agreed to sell its stake in sports broadcaster Score Media .
It has already sold the New Republic magazine in the United States to a group of private investors .
However , no large - scale asset sale that would make a significant dent in Canwest 's debtload has materialized so far .
A big part of its debt dates back to the $ 3.2 billion newspaper acquisition from Hollinger International in 2000 .
The deal made Canwest the country 's biggest publisher of daily newspapers .
It included 13 big-city dailies as well as 126 community newspapers , Internet assets and a 50 per cent stake in the National Post .
The company later bought full control of the Post .

In 2007 , Canwest expanded its television holdings by partnering with an affiliate of U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs to buy specialty - TV group Alliance Atlantis Communications for $ 2.3 billion .
Canwest is controlled by the Asper family of Winnipeg .
In November , it cut 560 jobs at its newspapers and television stations to slash costs and cope with the advertising slowdown .
Canwest shares were down 1.5 cents at 30.5 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday .

In microchip design , as in life , small things sometimes add up to big things .
Dream up a clever microcircuit , get it sculpted in a sliver of silicon , and your little creation may unleash a technological revolution .
It happened with the Intel 8088 CPU .
And the Mostek MK4096 4 - kilobit DRAM .
And the Texas Instruments TMS32010 digital signal processor .
In " 25 Microchips That Shook the World , " IEEE Spectrum offers a list of some of the most innovative , inspiring , and intriguing integrated circuits .
The list includes chips that have become enduring objects of worship among the chiperati : the Signetics 555 timer , for example .
Others , such as the Fairchild 741 operational amplifier , became textbook design examples .
Some , like Microchip Technology 's PIC microcontrollers , have sold billions , and are still doing so .
A precious few , like Toshiba 's flash memory , created whole new markets .
And one , at least , became a geeky reference in popular culture .
( Question :
What processor powers Bender , the alcoholic , chain - smoking , morally reprehensible robot in " Futurama " ?
Answer : MOS Technology 's 6502 . )
For each chip , we describe how it came about and why it was innovative , with comments from the engineers and executives who architected it .
As a bonus , we asked eminent technologists about their favorite chips .
Ever wonder which ICs have a special place in the hearts of Gordon Moore , Carver Mead , Morris Chang , Vinod Khosla , Jeff Hawkins , Steve Jurvetson , Sophie Vandebroek , Dave Ditzel , or Lee Felsenstein ?
Additional online material related to the article includes 13 runner - up chips that did n't make the list and more favorite picks by other luminaries .
What did the Magic do right in Game 6 ?
On Wednesday , after two straight narrow defeats at the hands of the Celtics , I asked , “ Why ca n’t the Magic finish games ? ” I referenced an article by John Carroll , where he said the problem was four - fold :
1 . The Magic do n’t fully commit at the defensive end .
2 . They refuse to pound the ball inside .
3 . They fall in love with the three - point shot .
4 . They do n’t trust their coach the way the Celtics do .
I focused on # 2 , and threw in a couple of other problems :
5 . Poor late - game play from Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis .
6 . They do n’t have a guy who can consistently get to the hole .
So what was the difference in the Magic ’s win in Game 6 ?
1. Check …they held the Celtics to just 75 points , 13 in the fourth quarter .
2. Check … Dwight Howard attempted 16 shots and 12 free throws ; both are series highs .
3 . No change … the Magic were just 6 of 26 for the game .
4 . It ’s hard to gauge how much they trust Stan Van Gundy on a game - to - game basis .
They responded with good defense and a strong game plan to feed Howard the ball , so they must trust his instruction to a certain extent .
5 . What about Turkoglu and Lewis ?
Here are their fourth quarter stats :
Lewis : 2 - 5 ( 0 - 1 3PT ) , 8 points , 3 rebounds , steal , assist
Turkoglu : 1 - 5 ( 1 - 3 3PT ) , 3 points , 2 rebounds
So Lewis and Turkoglu went a combined 3 of 10 for 11 points and five rebounds in Game 6 .
They shot 3 of 15 for a total of 11 points ( combined ) in Game 4 and Game 5 .
Turkoglu did n’t play particularly well , but the one shot he hit in the fourth quarter was HUGE .
It came with 1:23 remaining and the Magic clinging to a three - point lead .
Lewis clearly played well .
He shot just 40 % in the quarter , but he got to the line twice for four more points , had an assist , a steal and drew an offensive foul on Kendrick Perkins .
6. Check …Courtney Lee and Rafer Alston each had key driving layups in the fourth quarter .
To win close games down the wire , you have to have a player ( or two ) that are effective at getting into the lane and finishing .
Alston and Lee stepped up in the fourth quarter for the Magic .
On the whole , the Magic did a better job across the board , save for some very suspect three - point shooting .
But can they post a repeat performance in Game 7 in front of a very hostile crowd ?

The Giraldi quote [ " Edmonds 's claims have never been pursued , presumably because there are so many skeletons in both parties ' closets ... " ] goes much deeper than the sordid affairs of Hastert and Harmon .
It helps to explain a reluctance to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the government 's involvement in torture that goes back more than 50 years .
There are , indeed , a lot of skeletons to unearth .
Thank you so much Sibel for this excellent piece and for the integrity you long - ago displayed in stepping forward when so many others who saw what was happening and knew it was wrong , put career and self first .

What a great OpEd !
It gets right to the heart of so much that is wrong in our government .
All we usually hear - depending on whether we are on a " left " leaning or " right " leaning site is that all the ills are directly caused by the other .
This piece puts it in perspective .
BOTH sides are culpable ; BOTH sides have corruption ; BOTH sides have those who work for their own selfish interests .
It is going to be interesting to see whether this piece is reviewed objectively , as it was obviously written .
Good work , Sibel & Brad

Thank you so much for this op - ed .
It gives credence to some of our worst fears but reassures us that we are not all ' just ' suspicious and paranoid .
There are too many overlapping scandals on the one hand and failures to pursue them for happenstance to be at work .
I will go farther - into crazy territory for which I expect only ridicule .
If the whole system is a house of cards , predicated on everyone keeping silent for fear any one actual investigation will bring it down because it is so pervasive and , over time intertwined and incestuous ; how then is this miasma of corruption protected against the honorable public servant like Paul Wellstone or a 3rd party that blunders into the milieu like the DC Madame , Deborah Jeane Palfrey ?
Just how far is this criminal enterprise willing to go to protect itself ?
Is there another dot that needs to be connected ?

yes I understand what you mean by " even those who are ' clean ' tend to choose ' protect your fellow ' route "
but what I meant is sometimes even the individuals that have skeletons in their closet find the courage to say to themselves enough is enough and do the right thing even if it damages their careers or incriminates them .

" How to make that happen ?
Wish I knew "
We all do .
Let ’s take a look at the recent presidential race :
Out of desperation , many bought into words - empty & hollow words , but not the facts right before our eyes .
I am not going to even bother mention McCain - just way too obvious .
But in case of the then Presidential Candidate Obama : why did many totally disregard his track record ?
Whether on secrecy , immunity to Telecom , national security whistleblowers , … ( I can list many many more issues ) : he was either on the wrong side , or , cowardly , no side .
Why do we expect miracles ?
A man who never stood up to any of those horrendous abuses of the Bush Administration , not even once , is suddenly makes promises of ‘ change ’ and sells it .
Let ’s look at the representatives : while all the polls show the lack of trust / approval , the same people keep getting elected .
Years after years after years .
We heard all the loud screams on , let ’s take , Pelosi , and guess what ?
She was reelected .
The MSM plays a big role in determining the ‘ visible ’ candidates .
They put forth the two sides of the same dirty coin , so no matter how many times we toss we get the same ‘ head ’ ‘ head . ’
Any candidate of ‘ real change ’ gets to be represented by the MSM as either a ‘ ga ga ’ or an ‘ extremist , ’ or ‘ whatever . ’
The safe bet would be : pick a candidate covered least or none by the MSM .
I know it sounds outrageous , but this is how I view it ;-) I am open to others ’ views / suggestions on this …

Sibel , ajeffersonian , and others ,
An organization called the " Campaign for Liberty " , also sometimes called C4L for short , has managed to motivate many people into a grass roots movement that is very active in creating real change .
Building on the widespread appeal of Ron Paul during his presidential campaign , they have managed to turn that energy into a grass roots movement .
This is from one of their handouts :
" Gain a foothold in political life at every level of government by expanding our precinct
leader program . "
They are GOP , but not like some of the current corrupt members of Congress .
The point I 'm trying to make is that C4L has started and is successfully implementing the type of change in government at all levels that Sibel has mentioned .
So there is hope for this type of grass roots approach and the C4L demonstrates that people are aware of the corruption and they want change and are getting involved and it can work .
If you 're curious what they 've done so far and how they achieved it their website is : http://www.campaignforliberty.com

How do we change that ?
Again , I really do n't know .
I think I know what should be done , but expect that the chances are slim to none .
Elections should be completely publicly financed ; that way a candidate does not have to start out by immediately selling out to the money - men , the AIPACs , those who get their hooks into anyone accepting their " donations " .
We just had a vivid demonstration in the Harman case of what happens then .

I am somewhat familiar with C4L from following Ron Paul 's activities , and I applaud what they are trying to do .
Time will tell whether they really can go up against entrenched money successfully .

Thank you , Sibel .
You truly deserve the Medal of Freedom ; sad that it 's been so debased these past eight and more years .
I 'll go farther than Lottakatz : I have no doubt that certain deaths have been far too convenient to be accidental .
In fact , Russ Baker 's just published a great book , ' Family of Secrets , ' that details the Bush family 's decades - long involvement with deaths of this kind .
Not to mention a lot of other crimes .
At this point , I feel like it's not a case of everyone knowing where everyone else has buried their skeletons .
I feel like the representative and executive branches , and much of the judicial branch , now rest on nothing but skeletons , and the whole mausoleum is creaking and swaying .
Sibel 's right .
The kind of change necessary to recover our country will have to come from without , because our government is too systemically corrupt to do anything but keep gorging itself until nothing 's left but ruination and pig sh*t .

I know of a former senior staff person at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , who had been the top staff person dedicated to money laundering issues .
His name left the masthead of the Fed 's monthly ' Federal Reserve Bulletin " in August 2001 , having left the Fed for Citigroup in mid-2001 .
I had seen him give a talk on money laundering issues a few years earlier , and I remembered his talk for being curious a bit becuase his first slide listed a number of crimes and the number of times there were convictions or arrests for a group of people , and then he asked the audience , a group of bankers , who they thought the group was .
It was Congress .
I wondered why he did that at the outset of the talk , and over time wondered if he was trying to show how he had the goods on people .

While people intuitively sense they are being screwed by their politicians , they really do n't have mainstream , common knowledge , concrete corruption examples , just policy failures .
So it seems we usually blame it on the other party .
Having more facts on the actual corruption on both sides is the only way for us to make any progress in addressing this rather than just flopping from hte " left " to " right " , election after election .
I believe real change can happen when people are conscious of what is happening .
Your courage , persistance , and reporting go a long way towards helping with that .

One of the big problems in all this is the rank partisanship , from both sides , that prevent people from seeing though the facade of our ' two party ' regime .
Congress has been controlled mostly by Democrats and the Presidency has been controlled mostly by Republicans for the past 50 years , but barring a few minor differences , both sides have essentially the same policies .
I think part of the problem now is that many of the ' Progressives ' who latched on to Sibel Edmonds back during the Bush years are so sure that this was just more Evil Republican Tricks that they can't get their head around why everything did n't turn up roses as soon as Obama was elected .
The answer is that Obama is one of them .
Indeed , most of Washington D.C. , of either party , is " one of them . "
" Progressives , " who spend their lives pining for new and bigger government programs , have never understood what Lord Acton wrote in 1887 , that " Power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
And yes , that includes " Progressives . "

Sibel ,
Once again you are the voice more Americans need to hear , which is why the powers that be keep trying to find ways to confine it .
Obama champions himself as a leader that will do what the people want , and that is how change will happen .
I think what he needs to realize though , that for this to effectively happen that one thing that he really needs to do unilaterally and not wait for us to tell him , is to fix the media situation .
We currently have a media so broken , as you point out , that communication between Obama and the people is uselessly corrupted .
We have to find a better way of communicating the REAL issues to the people , so we can have a more informed populace that is capable of offering opinions in an informed fashion of what should be done .
AND we need a better way for Obama to hear what the people themselves want .
The polling , etc. that the media runs today is so lame in terms of really getting to the bottom of how people really feel about what 's needed .
Otherwise , we'd have things like single payer health care , to someone else besides Timothy Geitner in his cabinet .
As AJeffersonian pointed out , we also need public campaign financing too as a root of a lot of the other problems of influence peddling that is so cancerous right now .
Perhaps one thing we can do now is lobby HEAVILY for a candidate to replace Souter that is a constitutionalizt in the sense of not going after abortion , but to go after the real " judicial activist " ruling ( er make that court clerk activist ruling of " corporate personhood " .
WE definitely need to get Russell Feingold or others on the Judicial Committee to ask questions regarding this .
Someone I think that might make a good nominee to campaign for might be Erwin Chemerinsky , who 's a great constitutional scholar , and also has a ruling in the Nike case with an opinion against the legitimacy of " corporate free speech " .
If we can find some way to get Chemerinsky and more like him later when other nominations re made to replace folk like Ruth Bader Ginsberg , then perhaps that would be a good start towards invalidating corporate " free speech rights " which stand in the way towards comprehensive public campaign financing , etc .
Folks on SCOTUS would be harder for the likes of AIPAC lobbies to buy off .

What thing is it that gives this evil mindset to men and women .
It can all be summed up by one question .
Why do I as a human with my life / god given rights have to pay for land ?
This is where it starts and builds from there .
Yeah sure pay for the building , but who owns the land ?
A . We do .
So why am I paying someone else for my land ?
A . You are being raped from birth .
When people take it on themselves to understand just what money really is then we may get somewhere .
So to all the idiots , this .
Money is a measure of your claim on society .
It is where the spiritual and physical worlds collide , for it requires trust .
Unless the money itself is of value ie Gold Vs Paper ( Fiat ) currency .
Then no trust is needed .
When you run a paper currency supposedly backed by a countries industrial and populaced strength with interest then you are open to missrepresentation of the real value of said wealth , I use todays world as evidence of this .
You are able to be swindled that little more easily and that is what has happened .
We do not need reserve banks to print our money and we do not need interest .
Without interest I put it to you that the money lords will lose all their power , power that you ignorantly give them as atested by your granparents submission , now laying at your feet .
Now making their lives and deaths insignificant as to will yours be unless you smarten up .

At the deepest level , Congress is controlled by Zionist - run pedophile rings .
Look underneath the crisscrossing flows of illusory monies , and claims of dual citizenship ( lol ) , and you will see a network for trafficking in children ( and secondarily drugs ) .
The kidnapped children are used as sex slaves for Zionist blackmail operations .
Gay Edgar Hoover was doubtless blackmailed as well , though he tried to return the favor .
I believe Mark Glenn and Mike Rivero got the Harmon schmozzle right , when they proposed that the release of the Harman tapes was done to prevent prosecution of the arrested AIPAC spies , and prevent embarrassment of Israel .
They argue that the release of the Harman - AIPAC tape was orchestrated by AIPAC ( the accused ) .
It was designed as a shot across the bow of the FBI agents who were prosecuting the two high level officers of AIPAC ... for espionage .
The Harmon " sample " was " put out there , " as an example of the kind of " blowback " that one should expect to see , if the AIPAC officers were prosecuted .
This was all just weeks before Netahyahoo ( sp ? ) is scheduled to come DC , doubtless to blackmail President Obama , who probably needs no more blackmailing than Bush or Clinton did .

I thought Sibel Edmonds situation would be buried forever , I should have known Brad will never let it go .
As far as what to do to fix the " Situation In America 2009 ? "
1 . All electronic vote tabulation devices , and electronic voter registration devices got to be outlawed from the top down nationally .
A much more serious punishment for election crimes and fraud , " like death . " ( because your choice to commit crimes to place leaders who cause our son's and daughters death - - it 's that serious . )
2 .
a.)
The Corporate media be stripped of their press passes when dealing with elections .
( You want to make a profit , do n't do it with our elections .
No more of this Whitehouse press corps crap .
Get a bigger place than that stupid ass 200 + year old building , that only has seating for the same pieces of crap .
We need new faces , real questions and answers .
You want to cover our elections , do it non-profit , you do n't need a press pass , your no better than I am even though your ego tells you you are elite .
I ought to be able to fly to Washington DC and attend every press conference coming from my government , no lottery for spots , punishment for uncomfortable questions , and no pre-screened questions ! )
b. )
Force them to make their public file available online and accessible to all US Citizens and Citizens of all it's districts and territories .
( Sick of town hall meetings ?
Lies ?
Spin ?
Blacklisted stories ?
Revoke their station license , and frequency renewal . )
c. ) FCC needs to be run by engineers , not politics and fascism .
No longer allow this position to be an appointed position with no public oversight .
3 . The United States Constitution must be restored .
Those who violated their oath of office jailed .
Unconstitutional laws rescinded .
4 . The " Federal Reserve " must be re-worked with only upstanding people running it .
Or it must be deactivated altogether .
You wear two hats , or revolving doors and your gone for life !
5 . No more bailouts .
PERIOD .
And those bailed out , should now be owned by we the people --- not the government , not the treasury !
WE pay for it , we own it .
Or cram down .

Specifically ridding the system by lifetime ban ( including proxy ) of the negroponte 's , the oliver norths 's , the kissinger 's of our highest agencies .

We are a nation of followers .
Michelle Obama is doing a good thing planting an organic garden .

Obama is evidently being blackmailed by the Clintons .
We have a Clinton administration with Obama as the figure head .
He should lead US in confessing his sins / whatever so he can not be blackmailed .
Then as a country , we could all confess to something .
The apostle Paul believed in it ... Bill Wilson believed in it ... took it a step further than Paul and said make ammends for wrong doing .
Then we could apologize and make ammends to Native Americans , descendants of slaves , Vietnamese , Iraquis ... we just need Obama to get the ball rolling .. It would keep us busy and most of all the black mailers would have to regroup and write a whole new play book .
I can just see the Sunday morning political shows starting out with confessions .
How they over came addictions like shopping , gambling and what not as they made ammends .
Then we would have more concise and clear commentary on MSM as an added advantage .
Howard Dean and a few others who are clear would not be such stand outs .
They would be welcome for their ideas ... no more risk of showing everybody up .

I do not believe that anyone in Washington has the courage or honesty to tackle the web of crimes that is so well laid out by Ms. Edmonds .

SIBEL EDMONDS you are a legend amongst mortals , your courage exceeds the best American soldier on any battlefield in the world .
They rely on " the state of the art " weapons and support to " do their duty " .
Where you have only two things on your side , personal courage and determination .

It may be politically incorrect to criticize Sibel , but I find it strange that she quotes John Kerry , the enabler of the Bush administration and fellow Skull and Bones member who refused to challenge Ohio .
Also , Sibel 's story is about warning gov officials about drug deals and Middle East terror threats but that was n't what 9/11 was about and Sibel never makes any mention that the so called terrorists were in the end just patsies .
It 's been proven scientifically now that the WTC was a demolition job with military grade explosives .
I 'd appreciate it if Sibel updated her story .

On the bright side , the MSM is folding ; one newspaper at a time .
The network news programs are losing share .
CNN , FOX , MSNBC , etc. will / are also seeing fewer ' eyeballs ' .
So , I think the question is , " What ' news ' system will replace the MSM ? "
The Daily Show needs the others for material , so that wo n't do .
How will people find credible news sources ?
How will they be able to determine the credibility of any single source ?
In sum : The MSM / propaganda machine is dying .
What will rplace it ?
As to the blackmail of congress , I have long suspected that the Bush administration , at a minimum , took advantage of the anthrax investigations to ' bug ' congress .
It 's just would fit their modus operandi.o96F6

Unfortunately for the blackmail theory , Rep. Harmon is not playing the role of the blackmail victim .
On the contrary , she is insisting that the tapes of her be released in full .
There 's also the fact that the blackmail scenario reads like a bad movie script .

Sticking your head up too far gets it blown off .
Most in Congress , even those that are ' clean ' , know this to be true .
No one wants to be a martyr .
The only way this changes is if a few are willing to die to make the change ; once " they " kill a few people that poke their heads up , the stakes become high enough for those living cushy lives in the halls of power to " wake up " .. until then , they will just keep their heads down and live a pampered life and do " what they can " .
Hell , even talking about this kind of thing , in this day and age , could be twisted into " domestic terrorism " and people disappeared .
Truly dark times we 're living in .
Times when the wealth gap is growing faster than ever before , times when the poor are dying in the streets ( globally ) , times when everyone is scared enough to " shut up and do what you 're told " .
Our Founding
Fathers were lucky ; they had a country ( physically separated ) they could stake a claim to , rally people to defend , and make something of .
We , today , are stuck trying to clean up the entrenched mess .. a far more daunting task .
And the kicker is , most Americans today simply do n't care , so long as they keep their supply of iTunes and internet porn flowing while taking a break from Facebooking .
none the less , thanks for this , Sibel

An important detail about Dennis Hastert 's knowledge of the Harman wiretap was provided by Congressional Quarterly .
According to CQ , Hastert learned of the wiretap from a " CIA - connected ' whistleblower ' in 2006 . "
He did not learn of it in the expected way .
Under a decades - old agreement between Congress and the CIA , the head of U.S. intelligence was supposed to brief the top House Republican and Democrat if one of their members became ensnared in a national security investigation .
Why not ?
Because John Negroponte , then head of ODNI " blocked then CIA Director Porter J. Goss from briefing Hastert , " according to the account the whistleblower gave the former Republican House speaker .
Goss 's successor , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , " also had not informed Hastert about the wiretap . "
Hastert 's attempts to get answers from Alberto Gonzales also went nowhere .
It sounds like top intelligence officials , who presumably had access to the complete file on Hastert , did n't trust him with the information .
This supports the credibility of Sibel Edmonds ' claims .
But , then , why was no further action taken against a security threat ?
Once again , we are left with troubling questions that can only be answered through a formal investigation .

Your post truly outlines the depth of corruption that permeates every inch of Washington .

Is there a paper in Britain or elsewhere that is interested ?
A substantial story from an outside source would force at least some of this out into the open but , to repeat , the decadent , corporate - run media here will never touch it .

IT ’S ALL ABOUT BLACKMAIL …
Hastert ’s first response to the Foley scandal was that it was a " CONSPIRACY by the Democrats . ”
That 's the right word , Mr. Hastert , but the wrong attribution .
The CONSPIRACY has been among the Republican Leadership , the Republican National Committee , and even the Justice Department , all the way up the chain to the Oval Office .
ALL OF THEM KNEW .
ALL OF THEM .
Bush , Cheney , Fibby , Feith , Rove , Gonzales … ALL OF THEM .
This was not supposed to come out .
They thought they had the lid on this .
All of them are crooks in one form or another , clearly all of them have been AND REMAIN subject to blackmail - all of which endangers the national security of our country .
Their ONLY recourse at this point is to take down the Democrats too - all of who are guilty of other crimes - all of which are known to Mr. CIA himself , the REAL President of the Shadow Government , GHW BUSH - W's old man .
AIPAC has always strived to ensure that only men of low moral character enter into the political arena .
This ensures that through Comverse Wiretaps and other means at their disposal , Israel is always able to get its way on the Hill .
Remember when Israel invaded Lebanon and the United States inexplicable had nothing to say about it ?
Many of these co-conspirators knew about 9/11 in advance too .
With the revelation that Rice knew all about it , and LET IT HAPPEN , combined with the fact that Rumsfeld advised against pursuing the leads , and Cheney actually ran the command bunker on 9/11 , ordering that nothing be done to stop the aircraft approaching the Pentagon , which they tracked on radar for the final fifty miles ( at least ) .
Now you know why everything that did n't make sense before , makes total sense now .
This is not just a matter of ethics and morality .
This is a matter of national security .
BLACKMAIL has been rampant throughout our Government .
BLACKMAIL – Rove style : 10.12.06 HOW ROVE TWISTED FOLEY'S ARM :
It seems increasingly clear that the GOP congressional leadership , eager for every safe incumbent in the House to run for re-election , looked the other way as evidence accumulated that Mark Foley had a thing for pages .
Holding onto his seat became more important than confronting him over his extracurricular activities .
But there 's more to the story of why Foley stood for re-election this year .
Yesterday , a source close to Foley explained to THE NEW REPUBLIC that in early 2006 the congressman had all but decided to retire from the House and set up shop on K Street .
" Mark 's a friend of mine , " says this source .
" He told me , ' I 'm thinking about getting out of it and becoming a lobbyist . ' "
But when Foley 's friend saw the Congressman again this spring , something had changed .
To the source 's surprise , Foley told him he would indeed be standing for re-election .
What happened ?
Karl Rove intervened .
According to the source , Foley said he was being pressured by " the White House and Rove gang , " who insisted that Foley run .
If he did n't , Foley was told , it might impact his lobbying career .
" He said , ' The White House made it very clear I have to run , ' " explains Foley 's friend , adding that Foley told him that the White House promised that if Foley served for two more years it would " enhance his success " as a lobbyist .
" I said , ' I thought you wanted out of this ? '
And he said , ' I do , but they 're scared of losing the House and the thought of two years of Congressional hearings , so I have two more years of duty . ' "

CIA PIMPS Prostitution , Blackmail , and Political Corruption
By Agents of the United States Sex Slavery , Forced Prostitution , Human Trafficking , extortion , blackmail ―of the most egregious kind ―of U.S. Citizens by the U.S. Government Brothel of Bureaucrats
My name is Robin Head , previous owner of Playboy Escorts in Houston , Texas .
I was approached by various law enforcement agency's , FBI , ATF , etc ... who wanted me to abet them in entrapping " State and political officials " having sex so they could extort , control and blackmail them , not to charge them with misdemeanor prostitution .
At the same time , women at my service were being tricked and trafficked overseas to Bangkok and called me collect from a jail in Vienna .
A madam from Alabama was found hanging in a federal jail cell in nearby Brazoria County .
When I refused to abet in the extortion , I was thrown in jail , no bond , a ' Life ' sentence filed on me , and then my son and family were harassed and attacked endlessly in some kind of gang like Mafia style .
I went to the FBI , but it was like reporting the devil to the witch , they said they would help me but only if I would help them , again , to set up officials .
They had no interest in the corruption aspect .
Some very high profile names were involved , people seen on TV news commentary .
Who are these agents with this monstrous agenda and what do they want ?
This is not a left / right wing thing it is a most vicious entity in this country .
This country has become as fearful as any other 3rd world country when it comes to reporting crime to officials just exactly like in Russia , Iraq , Africa , Mexico , etc ... where it is the officials that are the perpetrators of the crimes , kidnapping , ransom , drugs , and it is dangerous to report to them .

We have no leaders that care for this nations wellbeing or the wellbeing of its citizens .
Since this miracle of the internet , many Americans have seen , clearly , the actual truth about these treasonous representatives .
As Sibel points out , we sure as hell can't get the truth from the Main Stream Media , which is , as almost everyone now realizes , nothing more than the equivalent of the old Soviet News Agency TASS .
Yes , Harman , Pelosi , Hastert , and hundreds of other so called " Americans " who represent Americans , should be investigated .
But who will do it ?
We know what the problem is .
It is the American citizenries own apathy , arrogance , and possibly even cowardice , that makes it possible for the above mentioned criminals to get away with what they do .
Americans have no say in their nation or its fate .

Ex -Italy Pres - 9 -11 Was
CIA / Mossad Operation
By the Staff of American Free Press
4 -15 -9 Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga , who revealed the existence of Operation Gladio , has told Italy 's oldest and most widely read newspaper that the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks were run by the CIA and Mossad , and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies .
In what translates awkwardly into English , Cossiga told the newspaper Corriere della Sera : " All the ( intelligence services ) of America and Europeknow well that the disastrous attack has been planned and realized from the Mossad , with the aid of the Zionist world in order to put under accusation the Arabic countries and in order to induce the western powers to take part in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Cossiga was elected president of the Italian Senate in July 1983 before winning a landslide election to become president of the country in 1985 , and he remained until 1992 .
Cossiga 's tendency to be outspoken upset the Italian political establishment , and he was forced to resign after revealing the existence of , and his part in setting up , Operation Gladio .
This was a rogue intelligence network under NATO auspices that carried out bombings across Europe in the 1960s , 1970s and ' 80s .
Gladio's specialty was to carry out what they termed " false flag " operations - terror attacks that were blamed on their domestic and geopolitical opposition .
In March 2001 , Gladio agent Vincenzo Vinciguerra stated , in sworn testimony , " You had to attack civilians , the people , women , children , innocent people , unknown people far removed from any political game .
The reason was quite simple : to force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security . "
Cossiga first expressed his doubts about 9 - 11 in 2001 , and is quoted by 9 - 11 researcher Webster Tarpley saying " The mastermind of the attack must have been a sophisticated mind , provided with ample means not only to recruit fanatic kamikazes , but also highly specialized personnel .
I add one thing : it could not be accomplished without infiltrations in the radar and flight security personnel . "
Coming from a widely respected former head of state , Cossiga 's assertion that the 9 - 11 attacks were an inside job and that this is common knowledge among global intelligence agencies is illuminating .
It is one more eye - opening confirmation that has not been mentioned by America 's propaganda machine in print or on TV .
Nevertheless , because of his experience and status in the world , Cossiga cannot be discounted as a crackpot .

Post # 75 : I ca n't speak for " knowing " what happened with 9/11 .
It still is a burning question for me , but I 'm open still to many explanations , except that the official explanation is hard to accept at face value .
I know many of us here have beaten up the show 24 for it 's unrealistic treatment of torture and how that might have affected our policies towards torture .
I 've been told that there are new writers , and of course this year Janeane Garafalo is in the show too .
This season 's plot focuses on deep , deep , corruption and subterfuge in our government and other high places in this country .
I think there was a scene last night that was beautiful and symbolic at so many levels at what 's wrong with our country now .
SPOILERS ahead , scroll down this space if you want to still watch later ...
Towards the end of the episode , Jack Bauer is riding along with FBI agent Renee Walker en-route to what appears to be a Muslim suspect 's house to arrest / question him about an upcoming terrorist attack .
On the way Jack finds out that this Muslim suspect is being set up by Chloe on the cell phone to LOOK like he 's the culprit when it is others domestically that are making it appear as if it is a Muslim - centric act .
They have the Muslim cleric of this suspect riding in the car with them who they have in handcuffs , thinking he 's part of the terrorist cell .
Jack ( on the now found to be innocent suspect ) to Renee :
" An innocent man is so easy to control .
All they needed was a Muslim .
They could create whatever background they wanted . "
Jack ( to cleric as he moves to uncuff him ) :
" Give me your hands . "
Cleric :
" I 'm surprised . "
Jack :
" Well , you were right . "
Cleric :
" What about Jabran ( the terrorist suspect ) ?
My experience with the authorities and police is that they will go to any lengths not to admit they were wrong .
Even at the expense of an innocent man 's life .
At least you did n't do that !
Please know that I forgive you ! "
Jack :
" I 'm not asking for your forgiveness . "
Cleric :
" Then I hope that you can at least forgive yourself . "
Jack :
" I gave up on that a long time ago . "
Cleric :
" It 's never too late to turn towards God , Mr. Bauer . "
Even though I 'm an agnostic , it so shows who the real evil people are , and who 's being made to look evil in this one scene .
You need to watch the show up to this point .
But it had me saying that 24 finally turned a corner for me .

Dear Sibel , I have for years believed that the anthrax scare after 9 - 11 was a two part design .
First and most important to get house , Senate , and Judicial leaders out of their offices and secondly to implicate Arabs as perpetrators of terrorist acts .
The first worked flawlessly and the moon suited bio-technicians went into the offices to search for anthrax if the press is to be believed .
Perchance they discovered some offshore accounts , photos , membership in a ‘ leather club ’ , many the mistresses and second families .
Links to various questionable organizations dressed up to look bad .
In short these people could now be leaned upon to be stalwart citizens and vote for various Patriot bill type things and these signs of indiscretion could be withheld , not leaked or what not .

Recently there was an " election " in Haiti .
When all non-corporate candidates were removed from the ballot , only 3 % of Haitians voted .
In 2008 we had a Presidential election here in the U.S.
The choice was between two corporate candidate and some third parties who would have had no power in Congress even if they 'd won .
Just prior to the election 90 % of Americans expressed outrage at the bailouts , so the two corporate candidates , Obama and McCain , cooperated to push through the bailouts leaving voters who opposed the bailouts with a ballot choice between bailouts and bailouts .
Americans reacted by saying it was n't about the bailouts , it was whether we wanted bailouts with somebody whose Veep shoots wolves , or bailouts with somebody whose Veep does n't shoot wolves .

In 2000 when the Supreme Court nullified an election , and in both 2000 and 2004 when Congress swore in a President without even bothering to finish counting the popular vote , it was clear to anyone with half a brain that the popular vote was merely symbolic and not the final say .
It can be overridden by the Electoral College , by Congress rejecting Electoral votes , by Supreme Court intervention , or by the winning candidate conceding .
During eight years of Bush , and during Pelosi 's reign , it became clear to anyone with half a brain that we have no way to hold government officials accountable .
We can wait until the next rigged election and try to vote for a different corporate candidate , but we cannot control who gets on the ballot , the super - delegates of the political parties do that , and we cannot directly remove anyone from office .

Haitians have a long history of being exploited by the United States .
They have no illusions .
Americans still cherish the illusion of democracy and the illusion of free and fair elections -- even those who know better .
If you do n't like what the system is doing , do n't insert new people into a corrupt system , stop delegating your power to a corrupt system .

Yes , Mark , and look at Haiti !
If ever there were a country that needed a functioning government it is Haiti ... and 3 % of Haitians voting is not the way to accomplish that .
Clearly .
Most of them were n't boycotting , per se , but attending to more pressing things , like baking mud cookies to stave off the pain of starvation .
People like that just have the worst time getting to the polls .
I truly love your point about stop delegating your power to a corrupt system , but , for Haiti , they need precisely to insert new , decent , people into their system to make it functional , to change it .
The same thing applies here , except the system keeps coöpting them , making it impossible for them to do anything but try to delude themselves they can still do good while following the , corrupt , system .
Do you think the proponents of this corrupt system would object to a boycott of the vote ?
Do you think they'd be embarrassed by it into suddenly , say , prosecuting torturers ?
What the hell do you think would be the upshot of a boycotted election ?
The sudden resignation in humiliation of the pigs at the trough ?
Do you think the legions of lobbyists running things would all stick out their lower lips and say , oops , we 're sorry and we promise never to buy another official ?
WHAT is the result you expect ?
They are out there doing everything in their power to prevent people from voting so they can just eliminate the hassle of fair elections altogether with those filthy machines and your proposal is an outright guarantee they will succeed .
Do you think it would ever even hit the news that there were too few people at the polls ?
Are you kidding ?
They would be leaping for joy and the talking heads would be delivering their election shtick full blast , as though everything were the picture of our vaunted democracy , all being hunky - dory in America .
While I can agree that even when our votes work , they still end up failing , there is no chance to change that if we do n't make elections as clean and reliable as humanly possible .
If we do n't like what the system is doing , and all the means open to us to repair that have been rendered ineffectual , we find new ways to repair that , not just hand over all our power by boycotting elections .
OUR GOVERNMENT IS WELL AND TRULY BROKEN , BUT IT WILL NEVER BE REPAIRED BY WALKING AWAY FROM IT .
A bully menaces you , takes your lunch every day .
You say , simple , just give up lunch .
I say , no , poke him in the nose and eat your lunch .
You 've been stumping for this psychedelic " solution " for a long time , without ever making a peep about how you suppose boycotting elections will actually effect positive change .
No matter how many lefties you ever cite , it still feels to me just as though you 're one of Gingrich 's GOPac droids in dreadlocks , that your other job must be bitching about ACORN on Hannity 's show .

Comment # 88 : Perhaps one place where we can " pressure " the system more now is in Obama 's selection to replace Souter , and in future court selections like that .
Get out and VERY vocally demand that if senators are going to ask a candidate questions about their adherence to the constitution , then they MUST ask if the notion of " corporate personhood " and " corporate free speech " is constitutional , which anyone like Thom Hartmann would be able to point out it is n't from the head note of the court decision that * manufactured * this notion in that " court clerk activist " decision back in the 1800's that supposedly gave corporations these rights .
If we can get a judge to commit to follow the constitution and in these cases perhaps overturn this notion of corporate personhood , that might be the first step at least towards paving the way towards meaningful public campaign financing legislation later , if we have the court tearing down these rights .
Erwin Chemerinsky has had a history of speaking out against corporate free speech in the Nike court case .
I think he'd be a good candidate to champion here .
If enough people speak up , it will be that much more either the Senate and Obama have to fall into line with , or get exposed for the corporate slaves they are .
Feingold might be a good person to pressure on the Judiciary Committee to ask this question .

Sibel 's indefatigable efforts to expose beltway corruption are to be applauded .
If the revolving doors do n't stop spinning , it wo n't only be congresspersons and other government officials who are all bought and sold .
Did anyone see that former Lt. Col Karen Kwiatkowsky has chimed in with Sibel , only instead of calling it blackmail , she 's calling it " horsetrading " :
" The recent revelations about Rep. Jane Harman attempting to make secret deals with AIPAC officials and the dropping of the espionage case against its former employees --- which was dropped last week --- reveals the reality of how much of official Washington actually works .
It 's not about doing what the people want , and it is n't about national security or rule of law .
It 's about horsetrading and Harman herself is a relative amateur .
Instead of these recent events propelling us to really lift the curtain on how this country makes foreign policy in the Middle East , we 're being hurried along so that the general establishment consensus on Israel can continue .
It would have been good to have a trial , including having Bush administration officials and Congressmen and women testifying in court , and bringing at least some of the real process to light . "
Whether it 's blackmail , horsetrading , or ( as I used to call it ) " special interest corruption " , high treason or just excessive loyalty ( which is the trickiest virtue as it changes into a vice at some point ) , it 's one heck of an evil system that needs to be defeated .
I disagree with Will Rogers that it can be addressed by just changing the faces .
The terrible pay - to - play system is taking otherwise good people and turning them into corrupted Blagovichs .
Elections are therefore only changing the deck chairs on the Titanic unless there are fundamental reforms that stop the revolving door .

All branches of government have been compromised and corrupted , but it does n't stop there .
It 's in the educational system ( a sore subject for the successful ) , the financial world , entertainment , sports , religion , disease management , medicine , military , and the media - or any other set or subset thereof .
That is what they do , being control freaks , is to penetrate and infiltrate any movement which might pose a threat to the scammery .
The New World Order comes into view when you remove inhibitions about coincidence - there is none .
The thousand points of light blind the core constituency to the insider fraternity of a thousand names , and their agenda for total control .
There are secrets that are only held at the highest levels , and these are the most vile and sinister practices , unimaginable to the milk - toasts who never look beyond appearances .
Conspiracy theories have proved to be factual ; the evidence is overwhelming and can only be understood by assembling the scattered fragments .
The rampant denial ( that the dots do n't , wo n't , and never will connect ) is endemic as well , and any effort to wake the herd is met with necessary and sufficient force to suppress the expose ' .
There is NO way to look at all the facts if a sacred preconceived notion is left unchallenged .
You 've heard the language of control a thousand times , and you continue to comply to the code .
The big picture is that the corruption is systemic and endemic .
It is in control , ergo no accountability .
There are intentional gatekeepers , who purposely spread discord and disinformation , and there are plenty of gatekeepers who fail to report the whole truth , out of some unwarranted fear of what might happen if one domino is tipped over .
Remember , it is not the Government that is corrupt , but a shadow government of shady deals and misplaced loyalty and lack of faith in what is right .
It may be out of some misplaced loyalty to a country that is under increasing threat , but is severely hijacked by , and for , treasonous intent ... including , and epecially , the media , and all those private citizens who refuse to resolve the unanswered questions that sprout like dandelions ( I like dandelions ) in the news field .
Incrementalism is the slow stalking of the herd by the predatory few , waiting to pounce when a violent event , staged for maximum psychological impact , is unleashed on the unsuspecting , who are immediately presented with the false trail of nonexistent evidence .

EXCELLENT !
Particularly the parable " my Justice Department is looking into certain activities you 've been engaged in . "
There is certainly no lack of " activities " to look into .
Let me count the ways ...
The hubris that permeated the Bush / Cheney administration during Rove 's heady " permanent Republican majority " created a brittle shell of imaginary immunity .
Feeling empowered by 9 - 11 and unfettered by the fear that the future would catch up to them so quickly , they engaged in all sorts of certifiable chicanery .
The chronology of events , in retrospect , is awfully hard history to revise .
And that chronology alone is evidence enough to set any respectable tin-foil hat a -tingling .
And now , the transparencies of " cui bono " from that wild - west - in - Washington - era are well illustrated in the words " Hastert will now be " principally involved " on a $ 35,000 - a- month contract providing representation for Turkish interests .
That seems to be the current arrangement for those serving foreign interests while on the job in Congress --- to be paid at a later date "
This is the sleazy process proving itself before our very eyes .
Hastert 's current professional progress will be something to watch closely as it unfolds .
Lott , too .
We can watch the term " payback " in action , live , before our very eyes .

and the rest of them will always either vote " democrat " or " republican " and enjoy the bipartisan screw - over ...

I hold the following truths to be true : 1 . Bradblog investigative watchdog journalism be it on the subject of elections , voting machines , or other pertinent points of interest is 1 of the best on the net .
2 . The highest levels of Federal government are run by a group of super corrupt super rich few for decades .
It is not Repubicans against Democrats and as you have discovered , they are in complete control of their US corporate mass media .
3 . Only a complete purging of the Federal government could remove the stranglehold these oil barons and investment bankers have on US government , the military industrial complex , and the Federal Reserve that is not even a government entity although called FEDERAL .
I am an environmentalist and have written a new concept record about saving the oceans now in a state of emergency and the world water system .
It can do something no other rock recording has accomplished by bringing about social change and give US people the word up since most other US mass media sources are completely controlled .
It is also balance record about love and life as well as informing world people through music .
There is a song called " United " that makes reference to what happened to you .
I posted an extremely rough unmixed demo at www.myspace.com/kabongband.
It was made for the band to learn the song but never to be released ever .
If you want to check it out , at 3:00 minutes into the song , the lyrics are " 25 high level officials stole the bomb to sell their enemies .
A total US media blackout allows these criminals to walk around free - the Sibel Edmonds 's story .. we 're gonna take away this control . "
The final studio version will be much much better with guitars , bass , and drums .
I am not even the lead singer although I 'm singing and playing guitar on this track since I penned the song .
I need a loan or some financial help to get this record called Treeson recorded .

Contrary to the industry 's position that visible drink labels will promote responsible drinking , young people are , instead , using these visible standard drink labels to increase or even maximize the amount of alcohol they consume at the lowest cost possible .
According to a new study , young people in Australia have very high awareness of standard drink labeling .
However , this was predominately to help them choose the drinks that would get them drunk in the shortest time possible .
The labels also served as guides , ‘ advising ' them on which drink would reduce the time needed to get drunk and the least amount they would need to drink - hence getting the best ‘ value ' for their money .
The study examines the young people 's perceptions of standard drink labeling , the purposes for which they use the labels and the potential impact on their alcohol consumption .
" Participants generally agreed that they notice drink labels and take in account what to purchase and consume .
While earlier research with adult beer and alcohol drinkers has shown that standard drink labeling enables them to drink safely and responsibly , this motivation is not evident in the consumption choices with young drinkers and might even be counter - productive " , said co-author Professor Sandra Jones from the Centre for Health Initiatives , University of Wollongong .
Heavy episodic drinking is a major health issue for Australia , as it is for most developed countries .
It has been estimated that , from 1993 - 2002 , over 2500 young people aged 15 - 24 have died from alcohol - attributable injury and disease , with another 100,000 hospitalized .
Professor Jones adds , " There is a need to consider the deeper implications about alcohol packaging and marketing as they have real potential to impact and reduce alcohol - related harms .
There is still an important role for standard drink labeling as long as it is combined with other policies addressing the price , availability and marketing of alcohol - which are of proven effectiveness in reducing alcohol related harm . "
Lady Gaga walks into the room carrying a teacup .
Nothing unusual there , you might think .
But this is n't just any old teacup .
Since an unfortunate incident a few weeks ago when it was briefly separated from its owner , the cup is , on the fame stakes , up there with Gaga herself .
It might even have eclipsed her .
I would n't be at all surprised if has its own book deal .
The saga began when Gaga took the teacup , a pretty purple number with flowers on the outside , on to Jonathan Ross 's TV chat show .
Hours later she was snapped by the paparazzi still carrying it .
And the following evening she took the cup with her to a restaurant where , after a few cocktails , she accidentally left it behind .
As it was subsequently reported , Gaga " kicked up a stink " and demanded that a taxi be sent back to the restaurant to retrieve it .
The following morning , Gaga 's publicist , who was in the midst of spring - cleaning his bathroom , found himself fielding calls from showbiz journalists about the alleged hissy fit .
Meanwhile , staff at her hotel were besieged by reporters looking for witnesses .
On Monday the red -tops all carried articles on " Lady Gaga 's Teacup Tantrum " and , inevitably , the " Storm in a Teacup " .
On Google , there were 50,000 related stories , including earnest blogs pondering the merits of the teacup as fashion accessory .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
For Gaga it 's all grist to the mill in the weird world of pop stardom , a ridiculous moment of unpredictability in her otherwise regimented existence .
While it 's still unclear whether a tantrum actually took place , she certainly does n't seem like the kind of person who would easily lose her cool .
Despite spending her every waking hour in the eye of a publicity storm , she is a remarkably composed presence .
" This is what I have chosen , or rather it has chosen me , " she states huskily , settling down on a sofa .
" This is what fame is . "
We meet at a recording studio just off London 's Oxford Street .
Outside in the reception , Gaga 's retinue of stylists , personal assistants , publicists , pluggers and managers sit staring at their Blackberrys , all plotting her next move .
It 's 10.30 in the morning .
She has already put in appearances on BBC Breakfast news and Radio 1 .
Later she is due at Capital Radio where she will play songs in front of a select audience of fans .
Then it 's straight on a plane and back to her native New York where the whole merry - go - round will start over again .
With the record industry suffering from the combined effects of an internet revolution and global recession , there 's a sense that Gaga is the goose that laid the golden egg .
Apparently it 's not enough that she has reached number one in 20 countries with her single " Poker Face " , or been nominated for a Grammy for the song " Just Dance " , or sold 1.9 million copies of her debut album , The Fame .
The more impressive the statistics , it seems , the more intense the schedule .
But if it 's hard work being an über-cool , multi-million - selling post - modern pop icon , Gaga is n't going to be caught grumbling .
I spend a good 10 minutes trying to get her to admit that the interviews , the television appearances , the costume changes , the rictus smiles , are beginning to wear her down .
After all , nobody spends years trying to make it as an artist in order to be quizzed about a teacup on breakfast telly , do they ?
" You know , I have such an appreciation for where I am in my life because I 've struggled and because I could n't get signed , and because I could n't get played on the radio , " she says serenely .
" There are times when it can be a lot to deal with but always when I get up in the morning I try to find that very joyful place that reminds me that I would die if someone took it all away .
If someone did that I would n't be a person anymore . "
Gaga is 23 , though with her white hair , radioactive tan and pale - pink frosted lipstick , she appears oddly ageless , as if she 's been cryogenically frozen and is still in the process of defrosting .
Today she is wearing a white shoulder - padded jacket , black leggings , vertiginous platform sandals and a huge harlequin - style hat .
And let 's not forget her trademark : the false eyelashes , so heavy - duty that her eyes do n't seem to open properly .
Gaga is notorious for her outré appearance , of course .
On the Brit Awards she performed with the Pet Shop Boys in a porcelain bikini , while on her recent tour she appeared on stage in a clear plastic bubble dress .
On Friday Night With Jonathan
Ross she rocked a toga - style number made entirely of red vinyl Post - It notes .
Gaga claims she would look like this whether she was famous or not .
The eyelashes hardly ever come off ; she even sleeps in them .
" Whenever I have a lover I leave them in their apartment on the pillow , " she coos .
" Kind of like a keepsake . "
Gaga , who took her name from the Queen song " Radio Gaga " , has a steeliness and ambition that is at once impressive and terrifying .
Not for nothing has she been compared to that other hugely successful mistress of provocation , Madonna .
But the difference is that Gaga has created a persona that is so strong it has overwhelmed her entirely .
" Right now the only thing that I am concerned with in my life is being an artist , " she states .
" I had to suppress it for so many years in high school because I was made fun of but now I 'm completely insulated in my box of insanity and I can do whatever I like . "
As Gaga sees it , she 's is a living subversion of the modern pop diva .
She talks loftily about her art .
Her stage designs are not sets , they 're installations .
She is not a pop star , she 's a performance artist .
Her idols are those who have blurred the boundaries between popular art forms , from Piet Mondrian and Andy Warhol to David Bowie and David LaChapelle .
" My ideas about fame and art are not brand new , " she says .
" We could watch Paris is Burning [ Jennie Livingston 's 1990 documentary about New York drag artists ] , we could read The Warhol Diaries , we could go to a party in New York in 1973 and these same things would be being talked about .
I guess you could say that I 'm a bit of a Warholian copycat .
Some people say everything [ in music and fashion ] has been done before , and to an extent they are right .
I think the trick is to honour your vision and reference and put together things that have never been put together before .
I like to be unpredictable , and I think it 's very unpredictable to promote pop music as a highbrow medium . "
Gaga 's articulation of her position is certainly rare .
This is not , one imagines , the kind of conversation you would get from Britney Spears .
But listening to her album The Fame , a disco-tinged , sexually charged critique of modern pop culture , it 's hard to distinguish Lady Gaga 's sound from that of her chart - friendly contemporaries , from Pink to Christina Aguilera .
Her songs are undoubtedly catchy but there is a gulf between how she perceives them and what the rest of us actually hear .
What really sets Gaga apart from her contemporaries is that she is responsible for every part of her act .
She directs her own shows , designs the sets , chooses the clothes and writes the songs .
She never , ever lip - synchs .
Despite her coterie of creatives back home , whom she calls the " Haus of Gaga " , she retains complete control over everything .
If Gaga has spent the past two years fending off suggestions that she is nothing more than the product of a record - company brainstorm , she is not offended : " It 's exactly the kind of discussion that I want to start . "
But in deconstructing the cliché that is the modern pop star while enjoying all the benefits that the role affords , is n't there a sense , I ask , that she has had her cake and eaten it ?
" It 's not parody , it 's commentary , " Gaga replies coolly .
" To use the words ' have your cake and eat it ' implies something devious .
For me , I just think I 'm very good at what I do . "
Still , there are moments when Gaga 's conceptualising can be a little hard to follow .
" I do n't ever want to be grounded in reality , " she explains when I ask if her persona is really sustainable 24 hours a day .
" In my show I announce , ' People say Lady Gaga is a lie , and they are right .
I am a lie .
And every day I kill to make it true . '
It 's the dream of my vision , it 's the lie that I tell , whether it's an umbrella or it's a hat or it's the way that I shape my lipstick .
And then eventually it becomes a reality .
My hair bow was a lie and now it 's true . "
Quite .
What is clear is that Gaga is a very modern artist , not just in her sound and look , but also in how she courts the media .
If her every moment is a performance , then the paparazzi are her enablers , instantly beaming images of her around the world .
Since her rise to fame , barely a day has passed without Gaga appearing in the papers buying fish 'n 'chips in a fluorescent leotard or stepping out for the night in her PVC catsuit .
Gaga lets out a little sigh at the mention of the photographers who are currently loitering around the front door .
Put on a baggy sweater and you could lose them , I say .
She looks at me aghast .
" That 's a very dangerous precedent , and it 's not fair to my fans .
They do n't want to see me that way just like I do n't want to see Bowie in a tracksuit .
He never let anyone see him that way .
The outlet for my work is not just the music and the videos , it 's every breathing moment of my life .
I 'm always saying something about art and music and fame .
That 's why you do n't ever catch me in sweatpants . "
The eldest daughter of an internet entrepreneur and his business - partner wife , Gaga – born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta – was brought up in New York .
She was a proficient pianist at five ; by the time she was 11 she was all set to go to the prestigious Julliard School in Manhattan , though she decided it was n't for her .
Instead she went to the Convent of the Sacred Heart , also attended by Paris and Nicky Hilton .
She was , she says , " focused , determined .
I was always in a band , or in a musical .
I did n't really fit in but I had friends because I 'm a nice girl and fun to party with . "
From the age of 14 Gaga was playing at New York clubs , which I note must be illegal until she tells me that she was chaperoned by her mother .
Really ?
" These were jazz bars not sex clubs , " she explains .
" They would have open mic nights so my mother would take me along and say , ' My daughter 's very young but she 's very talented .
I 'll sit with her as she plays . ' "
An A - grade student , Gaga got a place at NYU 's Tisch School of Arts a year early at 17 .
But she abandoned it after one year in favour of what she saw as a more honest education , plying her trade on the Lower East Side club scene .
Immersing herself in the seamier side of life , she dabbled in drugs and worked as a burlesque singer .
During performances she would frequently set light to cans of hairspray .
But she never stopped playing gigs .
" There was this one night where I had had a couple of drinks , " she remembers .
" I had new material and I had on this amazing outfit .
So I sat down , cleared my throat and waited for everyone to go quiet .
It was a bunch of frat kids from the West Village and I could n't get them to shut up .
I did n't want to start singing while they were talking , so I got undressed .
There I was sitting at the piano in my underwear .
So they shut up . "
It was then , she says , that Lady Gaga was born .
" That 's when I made a real decision about the kind of pop artist that I wanted to be .
Because it was a performance art moment there and then . "
She pauses and thinks .
" You see , you can write about it now and it will sound ridiculous .
But the truth is that unless you were in the audience in that very spontaneous moment , it does n't mean anything .
It 's , like , she took her clothes off , so sex sells , right ?
But in the context of that moment , in that neighbourhood , in front of that audience , I was doing something radical . "
Gaga 's pop ascendancy began in earnest a year later when the R&B star Akon heard her music and asked her to help him write some songs .
" I was like the weird girl who dressed like a zoo animal , the trash glamour in a roomful of urban hip - hop cats , " she smiles .
" They 'd be , like , ' Gaga , what do you think of this lyric ? ' and I 'd twist it all up and all of a sudden it was edgy . "
Overnight she became a pop writer for hire , producing songs for the likes of Britney Spears , the Pussycat Dolls and New Kids on the Block .
Was it frustrating , writing for other people when were trying to make it as a singer yourself ?
" Honestly no , I loved it , " she replies .
" I got real joy from hearing Britney Spears sing my melodies .
As much as I can sit here and talk about art , there 's still something quite remarkable about writing a song when you 're 20 and hearing a pop superstar sing it . "
All the while , Gaga was putting together her own album .
She had been signed by Def Jam records but was dropped shortly after .
Next she signed with Interscope , though this time it was the radio stations that were proving resistant .
" They would say , ' This is too racy , too dance - oriented , too underground .
It 's not marketable . '
And I would say , ' My name is Lady Gaga , I 've been on the music scene for years , and I 'm telling you , this is what 's next . '
And look , " – she gestures grandly around her – " I was right . "
It 's getting on for midday and our time is up .
Gaga is due a half - hour break before going to Capital Radio .
Time for a power nap , I ask ?
" No , I 'm going to work on my songs , " she says sunnily and , picking up her teacup , teeters out of the room .
When it 's time to leave , Gaga puts on her shades , opens her umbrella and , flanked by her security men , climbs into a people carrier .
The publicist and I hop in a car behind .
As we set off a photographer appears from nowhere on a scooter , and dices with death as he tries to stay close .
There are at least 20 more paparazzi waiting outside the radio station , all of whom look desolate when the people carrier disappears , Gaga and all , into the tradesman 's entrance .
Ten minutes later , Gaga is settled at the keyboards in the studio .
The audience files in and the retinue return to their Blackberrys .
Gaga performs three songs , including a classical version of her hit " Poker Face " , during which she hoists a leg on to the keyboard and plays piano with her heels , and " Paparazzi " which she dedicates to " those buggers outside " .
It 's a witty , stylish performance that easily proves her worth as a performer .
But watching as the mostly teenage fans mouth along to every word , I wonder to what extent the performance - art concept is really appreciated .
" I have found that my work has to be both deep and shallow , " said Gaga when I put this to her earlier .
" All of my songs have meaning , all of my clothing has iconography buried into it .
But by the same token , it 's just as special if you look at it in its shallowest form .
A quick moment of melody , a beautiful dress .
People think , ' Gaga 's so sweet ' , or ' Gaga sucks ' .
The point is that it 's memorable .
For commercial art to be taken seriously as fine art is a very unusual and difficult task .
I think that a lot of people do n't get it and a lot of people do n't know what to make of me .
And , you know what ?
I 'm OK with that . "
Lady Gaga 's album , ' The Fame ' , is out now on Polydor .
Her new single , ' Paparazzi ' , will be released in June .
She will be playing Manchester Academy on 29 June , Oasis in Swindon on 6 July and 02 Academy in Brixton on 14 July .

A drug originally developed to fight stomach ulcers is the key component of a stem cell therapy that could help patients who need bone marrow transplants after aggressive chemotherapy .
A clinical trial is underway at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston to evaluate the new medical procedure , which could potentially help some terribly ill people recover from the collateral damage from cancer treatment .
" One of the treatments for leukemia is to give high doses of chemotherapy , which gets rid of the leukemia , but it also gets rid of the immune system , ” said oncologist Leonard Zon of Children 's Hospital in Boston .
“ And I need to replace the immune system , otherwise the patient will die . ”
The usual way to treat a damaged immune system is a bone marrow transplant , but suitable donors are often hard to find .
So , for the last five years , oncologists have been treating some patients with an infusion of blood from umbilical cords , which is easier to match .
“ You rely on the stem cells in that cord blood unit to find their way to the bone marrow , and essentially take hold , engraft , and start generating red cells , white cells , and immune cells , ” said Pratik Multani of Fate Therapeutics , which is sponsoring the trial .
But cord blood also has problems .
Each dose contains enough stem cells to rebuild the immune system of a child , but not enough to heal an adult .
Older patients require at least two units of blood , and that can cause some serious problems .
“ Two cords go into a person and their immune systems are different , because they come from two different babies , ” said Zon .
“ The immune systems start fighting each other , and then over a three month period one of them usually wins out .
And nobody thinks that this fighting of the immune systems is a good thing . ”
So Zon 's team began hunting for chemicals that would encourage stem cells to multiply and then migrate into bone marrow , so that adult cancer patients would only need one dose of cord blood to recover .
They tested 2,500 different chemicals on zebrafish embryos and found that one of the chemicals , which had previously been tested for treating ulcers , made the zebrafish stem cells divide and collect in the bone formation areas .
“ In the early 80 ’s the chemical had been given to patients who have high stomach acid , ” said Zon .
“ There were five clinical trials with this chemical , and it actually worked and had a good safety profile . ”
The drug never made it to market because more effective antacid treatments got there first .
In the first experiment , which started last month , the scientists thawed two units of cord blood , incubated one of them with the almost - forgotten chemical and gave a patient both the treated and untreated infusions .
Eleven more patients will undergo a similar procedure .
Months later , they will check to see which set of stem cells stood their ground .
If the treated cells win out , and the patients are healthy , there is a good chance that the chemical does give stem cells a boost .

LOS ANGELES  AT&T , one of the biggest corporate sponsors of “ American Idol , ” might have influenced the outcome of this year ’s competition by providing phones for free text - messaging services and lessons in casting blocks of votes at parties organized by fans of Kris Allen , the Arkansas singer who was the winner of the show last week .
Representatives of AT&T , whose mobile phone network is the only one that can be used to cast “ American Idol ” votes via text message , provided the free text - messaging services at two parties in Arkansas after the final performance episode of “ American Idol ” last week , according to the company and people at the events .
There appear to have been no similar efforts to provide free texting services to supporters of Adam Lambert , who finished as the runner - up to Mr. Allen .
Since then , angry supporters of Mr. Lambert have flooded online chat boards with messages claiming irregularities in the competition ’s voting .
One dominant myth of the US auto industry is this : American consumers want small ( fuel - efficient ) cars .
In reality : Not so much .
This runs counter to the claims ( honest or otherwise ) of various elected officials , and their auto industry buddies .
To this day , I 've yet to see any clear data that suggests Americans are demanding small , fuel - efficient cars , at least not over any meaningful period of time .
But here is some data that shows the exact opposite :
What we see here is that over the period I examined , the popularity ( as measured by new sales ) of small cars decreased 49 % , from ~ 40 % of new car sales in 1990 to just over 17 % in 2007 , while Large SUV sales increased 2,575 % , and Midsize SUV sales increased 392 % over the same period .
By 2007 , these latter two categories accounted for 28 % of US new auto sales in 2007 , about the same combined market share as medium and large cars .
Contrary to the loud noises coming from Washington D.C. , Detroit , and elsewhere , this chart proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Americans are not , in fact , fans of the small car .
Still do n't believe me ?
Then perhaps you 'd care to see what Small Car sales look like compared to gas prices :
Despite regular conventional gas prices increasing 113 % ( 4.3 % CAGR ) since 1990 , new car sales still decreased , as evidenced by the relatively significant negative correlation between the two .
Interesting , huh ?
Let 's take a closer look :
Over the horizon encompassed by this data , the trend away from Small Cars is undeniable , however , I say this with the caveat that it appears over short time periods , this trend slows , or over very - short time periods , may even reverse .
As the above chart shows , when gas prices spiked ~ 30 % in 2000 , small car sales increased 9 % , however , they subsequently decreased 37 % while gas prices doubled .
I would like to examine the more recent data showing gas prices spiking in 2008 , but unfortunately , such does n't appear to be available yet ( if it is , please let me know ! )

Pioneering mathematical engineers have discovered for the first time a rigid structure which exists within the centre of turbulence , leading to hope that its chaotic movement could be controlled in the future .
Dr Sotos Generalis from Aston University in Birmingham , UK and Dr Tomoaki Itano from Kansai University in Osaka , Japan , believe their discovery of the Hairpin Vortex Solution could revolutionise our understanding of turbulence and our ability to control it .
This rigid , set structure , named after its hairpin like shape was found within Plane Couette flow .
This is a prototype of turbulent shear flow , where turbulence is created in fluid flow between the space of two opposite moving planar fluid boundaries , when high - and low - speed fluids collide .
Everyone from Formula
One drivers experiencing drag , through to aeroplane passengers suffering a bumpy flight , will have experienced clear - air turbulence , the mixing of high - and low - speed air in the atmosphere .
This newly found turbulent state is constituted by a number of elements found in a coherent flow structure and has been described by the research team as a " tapestry of knotted vortices . "
While structures , known as wall structures have been found on the ‘ edge ’ of turbulence , an elusive middle or wake structure has never been discovered , until now .
Dr Generalis believes that finding a regimented structure within the very heart of Couette flow could prove invaluable to controlling turbulence and the effects of turbulence between two moving boundaries , in the future .
This could include working machinery parts , medical treatment involving blood flow , and turbulence in air , sea and road travel .
“ Ten years ago scientists believed turbulence was in a ‘ world ’ of its own , until we began to find ‘ wall structures ’ on its side .
We believed a middle or wake structure might exist , and now we can prove there is regimented structure at the very centre of turbulence .
This new discovery paves the way for the ‘ marriage ’ between wake and wall structures in shear flow turbulence and provides a unique picture of the Couette flow turbulent eddies only observed but never understood before .
The team ’s findings of this missing central link have been published in Physical Review Letters and come after nearly five years of research , created by thousands of computer generated shear flow models .
The result was obtained by replicating the exposure of two opposite plates to hot and cold conditions , moving from a static to dynamic position .
The research team are now aiming to find if similar structures exist within other cases of turbulent fluid flow .
“ The hairpins expose an all new ‘ view ’ of the transition to turbulence and it is our aim to ‘ unify ’ this idea discovered in Couette flow , into other areas of shear flow in general , ” added Dr Generalis .
The Department of Defense has identified 688 American service members who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans this week :
GRIEMEL , Jarrett P. , 20 , Specialist , Army ; La Porte , Tex. ; 25th Infantry Division .
HERNANDEZ , Roberto A. II , 21 , Specialist , Army ; Queens ; 16th Military Police Brigade ( Airborne ) .
I ’ve been pondering this question intermittently a lot recently , as it relates to a couple of talks I ’ll be giving over the next month of or so .
Last night I spoke at the very inspiring FISH@6 Youth Innovation night ( hosted by Future Journeys ’ Janine Cahill ) on innovation in journalism - or innovation in the kind of social analysis journalism I tend to do , at least - and came up with the following model of where we ’ve come from and what we ’re working towards .
I do n’t claim to have all the answers , but these are some of the principles I ’ve been trying to apply to my own work .
Old model : Heritage media mastheads have all the cred .
Emerging writers establish themselves as voices worth listening to / employing by being picked up by these mastheads on a regular basis ( which yes , is basically how I launched my career ) .
New model : Heritage media still matters - for now , at least , it ’s the biggest microphone around - but a new media presence is essential , too .
Rather than sending everything off to the biggies ( or only writing those pieces that can be shaped to be picked up by a major newspaper , magazine , TV station etc ) , writers choose the most appropriate media through which to communicate their ideas , with the most successful ones being genuinely multi-platform .
Big magazines and newspapers are both a great venue and provide the financial infrastructure for considered , smart , well - thought out writing ( as Emily Gould once quipped , “ insightful conclusions cost $ 2 / word … [ b ] log posts ramble and peter out [ sometimes ] ” ) ; social media is better for the quick responses and niche stuff , as well as - importantly - serving as a direct line to people who care about the things you write about .
As more people - particularly young people - go online for their information , the internet will increasingly serve as both an incubator of new talent , and even a core , financially viable platform for some - think Gala Darling .
I realise this is already happening to some extent , particularly in the US , but I have n’t encountered ( m ) any young Australian journos who see this as a serious option .
Old model : Authority is derived from a writer / editor ’s distance from the audience - think Anna Wintour , the byline - less editorials in newspapers , and the general gatekeeper - oriented attitude of most heritage media .
( This is not without reason - as most bloggers and anyone who ’s worked for a big media company knows , you get a lot of weirdos contacting you . )
New model :
The most influential writers are those for whom communication is a genuinely two - way street - who act as an audience to their audience and respond to them in return , like Andrew Sullivan .
In new media , disseminating ideas is about building relationships , both with your audience and with other writers - whether heritage or independent .
These will often be the same people , as people who care enough about ideas to want to seek them out online are also likely to care about them enough to want to write about them themselves .
Old model :
Thought leaders are those with the loudest microphones ( ie newspaper columnists , magazine editors and so on ) .
Often , as Jillian York commented on Twitter yesterday , they ’re only interested in communicating with others they have identified as fellow elites .
New model :
Thought leaders are those who actively participate in the conversation , and whose contributions are judged as valuable by other participants .
These may be heritage media employees ( and they ’ll continue to have an advantage so long as they hold those loud microphones ) , but they , like everyone else , will be judged more on the substance of what they have to say rather than simply the fact that we can hear them .

Best Buy is using one of Chad ’s photos from Improv Everywhere ’s Best Buy prank on their corporate job application site .
Hilarious !
See for yourself : http://www.bestbuy-jobs.com/careers/
I think one of two things happened :
1 ) a lazy graphics intern just did a google image search for “ best buy employees ” ( we are the first three photos ! ) and grabbed our photo not realizing what it was .
2 ) an awesome Best Buy employee purposefully used the photo subversively .
I hope it ’s 2 .
Maybe we should send them a cease and desist to return the favor ?
Also , I still get about one email a week from someone writing to Improv Everywhere thinking they ’re contacting Best Buy .
( We ’re on the front page of a “ best buy ” search and have at times been as high as # 2 . )
The prank lives on !
As I wrote HERE , Sprint is pulling a dick move ( Definition ) with the Palm Pre and SERO Plan holders … well today I went to Sprint.com for some reason or another and saw this ad …
I find this funny because to get the Palm Pre , they want me to upgrade to a plan that is $ 30 - $ 40 more a month than I pay now for the exact same service .
A increase of $ 360 a year .
So on one hand they say throwing away $ 475 is bad , but on the other say say throw away $ 360 - $ 480 just to be able to buy a phone for $ 200 .
Ha .
Currently I pay $ 35 a month .
A new 2 yr contract at $ 65 a month , plus $ 200 for the phone , comes to approximately $ 1760 for the full 2 years .
My $ 35 a month plan , if I bought a new $ 200 phone ( as long as it is n’t the Palm Pre ) , for 2 years , would cost me about $ 1040 .
Yeah , thanks , but I do n’t feel like spending $ 760 more .
That ’d be rubbish , right Sprint.com ?
Bastards .
There is history between geeks and facial hair .
See : 1978 .
The very first staff photo of Microsoft includes several bearded members totaling 7 out of 9 men , mostly programmers .

And I presume it was n't 8 out of 9 because young Bill Gates looks incapable of sprouting much at this time .
( The talented female programmer on the bottom center of the photo , Andrea Lewis , was respectfully left out of this count . )
Snopes.com explains the photo was used in a email chain that went around asking if people would have invested money with such odd looking folks .

Apple 's geeks have had a relationship with their mustaches , too .
Although from an earlier era then when the photograph of mustached Steve was taken , Andy Hertzfeld , early employee , tells a story at folklore.org about the belief that a bushy upper lip was an asset when gunning for a promotion .
In It 's The Moustache That Matters , Burrell , official a lowly tech , who was so amazing that he was filling in on engineering work for Woz , could n't get the raise he deserved .
Until he grew a ' stache .
It obviously was n't a matter of talent or technical skill , since he was already far more accomplished in that regard than most of the other hardware engineers .
It was n't a matter of working harder , since Burrell already worked harder and was more productive than most of the others .
Finally , he noticed something that most of the other engineers had in common that he was lacking : they all had fairly prominent moustaches .
And the engineering managers tended to have even bigger moustaches .
Tom Whitney , the engineering VP , had the largest moustache of all .
So Burrell immediately started growing his own moustache .
It took around a month or so for it to come in fully , but finally he pronounced it complete .
And sure enough , that very afternoon , he was called into Tom Whitney 's office and told that he was promoted to " member of technical staff " as a full - fledged engineer .

But facial hair was in style at the end of the 70s , when these companies were being birthed .
What about in recent decades ?

Modern geeks , like those in the Python beard Flickr group , carry on this tradition .
And here 's an entire blog post arguing that languages developed by bearded programmers have higher success rates , with plenty of recent examples .

This is n't exactly conclusive evidence that mustaches make for more successful geeks , but it is strange correlation .
Not that it always looks good .
I found this post on Deviant art with illustrated advice to geeks on how they can avoid looking like scumbags .

And Jesus Diaz teased me mercilessly for ruining the precious apple prom by arriving unshaven to a town hall event .

There 's even a site asking people to try and guess if the photos displayed belong to programmers or serial killers , some of the examples sporting fine facial handlebars .
But I do n't believe any of us think looking good is the point here .

Being mustachio-ed myself , and putting on the amateur psychologist 's hat , I 'd say that facial hair could have its appeal in several ways .
As a young teen I was always very slight , and had to eat a lot to even fit into regular clothes .
One time , my mother , always great at creating embarrassing moments , asked a salesperson at the mall if there were any women 's jeans that fit me .
With softer , cherubic features , facial hair helped me feel more masculine , even when it was just a weak sliver .
Now , as I round 30 , it just works in a different direction .
That is , to hide face and neck fat .
I guess facial hair just makes the ugly , better .
Or at least hides it .
Or makes it hairier .
Now , do n't get me wrong .
I think geeks are beautiful on the inside , but there are n't as many geek supermodels as there are ones with mustaches .
Unkempt , long facial hair on geeks might also signal an obsessive tendency to ignore everything but whatever a geek is geeking out on , whether that be blogging , designing , engineering , programming or making , at the sacrifice of haircuts , shaves , and showers .
Although not necessarily in his moustache phase , early Apple employees complained about Steve Jobs ' hygiene , finally getting someone to mention that he needed to bathe more often .

But I could be reading into this a bit much .
And as I can only speak for myself , in the end , I 'll stick with the theory that , I probably just want to be like Mario .

In a decision that has privacy advocates and others scratching their heads , a federal judge has ruled that LifeLock has been breaking California law for years by placing fraud alerts on its customer 's credit profiles .
The decision is a blow to the burgeoning identify - theft protection industry , and means that companies that experience data breaches may no longer be able to offer victims free subscriptions to such services – a standard damage - control tactic in recent years .
Consumers can still place fraud alerts by contacting one of the three U.S. credit reporting agencies directly .
Bo Holland , founder and CEO of Debix , a competitor of LifeLock , called the ruling " dramatic and unexpected . "
" It causes a real shift in the industry , " he told Threat Level .
The pre-trial partial summary judgment comes in a lawsuit filed last year against LifeLock by Experian , one of the nation 's three credit reporting bureaus .
Experian claimed LifeLock is trying to " game the system " of fraud alerts to make a profit .
LifeLock , a controversial company that gained notoriety for publishing its CEO 's Social Security number in advertisements , charges $ 120 a year to consumers to place fraud alerts on their credit profiles , among other services .
The company also offers a $ 1 million guarantee to reimburse the expenses of any customer who suffers losses from identity theft while subscribed to LifeLock .
Under the 2003 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act , or FACTA , fraud alerts are available for free to any consumer who believes he may have been a victim of identity theft , or is at imminent risk of it .
With a fraud alert on a consumer 's credit profile , banks and other businesses are required to make a reasonable effort to check with a consumer before opening a new line of credit in his or her name .
The consumer normally has to contact a credit reporting bureau directly to place the alert , and then repeat the process every 90 days for as long as the risk remains – a minor hassle that LifeLock and other companies have been happy to help consumers avoid , for a fee .
On its face , the business model appeared consistent with FACTA , which allows fraud alerts to be placed by third parties acting on behalf of the consumer .
But in its lawsuit , Experian complained that LifeLock ( .pdf ) " surreptitiously placed hundreds of thousands " of alerts on Experian files " by posing as the consumer , " even when there was no suspicion of identity theft .
LifeLock then renewed the alerts every 90 days .
Claiming it was losing " millions of dollars every year " processing such requests , Experian asked a judge to rule that LifeLock was engaging in unlawful and unfair business practices under California 's Unfair Competition Law .
U. S. District Judge Andrew Guilford granted the motion ( .pdf ) last week , finding that federal lawmakers , in writing FACTA , did not intend for consumers to be able to contract with a business to place fraud alerts .
To reach his conclusion , Guilford examined the legislative history of the law and determined that Congress intended only that a family member , guardian or attorney should make the request on behalf of a potential fraud victim , not " companies and entities such as credit repair clinics . "
The judge 's ruling opens the door for Experian to seek damages from LifeLock , and for the judge to issue an injunction barring the company from placing fraud alerts with any credit reporting agency .
LifeLock did not respond to a call for comment .
Experian , in a statement sent to Threat Level , called the ruling " not just positive for Experian , but for consumers . "
Paul Stephens , director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , found the ruling odd , but says consumers have n't lost anything .
" They still retain the right to make an independent judgment as to whether or not it is appropriate to place a fraud alert on their credit reports , " he says .
But Chris Hoofnagle , director of information privacy programs for the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology , says the ruling is a disappointment .
" The idea that we could some day see a market where we pay $ 10 a month to a company to opt us out of junk mail , to monitor our credit , to do all sorts of privacy - enhancing steps that we do n't have time to take ... for that market to emerge , LifeLock 's business model and similar ones have to be legal , " Hoofnagle says .
LifeLock is n't the only company impacted by the ruling .
Debix , which offers fraud alert services at an annual subscription of $ 24 , says it will have to cancel its fraud alert placement service .
But Debix sees hope in a relationship it has established with Experian competitor TransUnion .
Beginning in September , Debix plans to sell a version of TransUnion 's credit monitoring service , which provides customers with alerts whenever someone inquires about a customer 's credit history , attempts to open a new credit account in the customer 's name or makes a change to the customer 's address .
Under that service , TransUnion monitors inquiries and changes made to credit accounts in its own database , as well as the databases of Experian and Equifax .
It will feed an alert to Debix whenever there is activity on one of its customer 's accounts , and Debix will notify the customer .
The company will pay TransUnion a fee for every customer it signs up for monitoring .
Holland says Debix currently has about 400,000 customers signed up for its now - outlawed fraud - alert service , which will end in 90 days .
After that , Debix will provide those customers with free credit monitoring for the duration of their subscriptions .

It ’s funny how sex factors into the way people describe the state of their relationships .
Studies show that , when things are going well , sex contributes only 15 percent to the overall satisfaction of a relationship .
But if things are n’t going well , it contributes 85 percent to the overall dissatisfaction .
Sex has many advantages to both people involved .
Here are just a few .
1. Because you said so
Even though you may not have promised to “ love , honor , and have sex once a week ” when you made a commitment to your relationship , it was understood that sex would be part of that bargain .
Imagine how the marriage rates would go down if people said , “ I ’ll marry you , but do n’t expect sex . ”
If you polled one thousand people on the street and asked them , “ Is it reasonable to expect to have to have sex when you are married ? ” the overwhelming majority would say yes .
If you expect a monogamous commitment from your partner , then it stands to reason that you will be a cooperative sex partner .
2 . Sex helps you forget
Oxytocin , which triggers orgasm , has an amnesic effect that lasts up to five hours .
So for a period of time you forget that he maxed out your Visa card or she was an hour late getting home from work .
Women get an additional benefit .
During orgasm that parts of the brain that govern fear , anxiety , and stress are switched off .
( Faking orgasm gives no such benefit . )
3 . Sex rewires you for pleasure
Every time you share a positive experience with your partner , your brain comes to associate him or her with pleasure .
You can transform any relationship simply by increasing the number of enjoyable times you share together .
4 . Sex puts the “ P ” back in partnership
Passion is what separates your relationship with your intimate partner from those with girlfriends and buddies .
Yes , you two are best friends and confidants , but without sex you will not have passion .
The following are from a 1997 study in the British Medical Journal -
5 . Heightened sense of smell
After sex , production of prolactin surges , causing stem cells in the brain to develop new neurons in the brain ’s smell center ( olfactory bulb ) .
6 . Weight loss
Rambunctious sex burns a minimum of two hundred calories , about the same as running fifteen minutes on a treadmill .
British researchers determined that the equivalent of six Big Macs can be worked off by having sex three times a week for a year .
7. Reduced depression
Prostaglandin , a hormone found in semen , modulates female hormones .
Orgasm releases endorphins , producing a sense of well - being and euphoria .
8. Pain relief
During sex , levels of oxytocin surge five times their normal level , releasing endorphins that alleviate pain .
Sex also prompts production of estrogen , which reduces the pain of PMS .
9 . Healthier heart
Women who have more sex have higher levels of estrogen , which protects against heart disease .
10 .
Cure for the common cold
Once - a - week sex produces 30 percent higher levels of immunoglobulin A , which boosts the immune system .
11 . Better bladder control
Sex strengthens the pelvic muscles that control the flow of urine .
12 . Peppy prostate
Some urologists believe they see a relationship between infrequency of ejaculation in men and cancer in the prostate .
In this case solo sex works just as well , but why out on all the other benefits ?
13 . Shiny hair , glowing skin
For women , extra estrogen from orgasm makes hair shine .
Sweat produced during sex cleanses the pores and makes skin glow .
Serotonin produces the after glow of sex .
14 . Calming effect
Sex is ten times more effective than Valium , with no side effects .
15 . Relief for a stuffy nose
Really .
Sex is a natural antihistamine .
It can even help combat hay fever and asthma .
16 . Firmer tummy and butt
Regular sex can firm your tummy and butt , plus improve posture .
17 . Boosts immune system
Endorphins stimulate immune - system cells that fight disease .
18 . Forever young
Sex actually slows down the aging process .
It lowers cortisol levels in the bloodstream , which reduces stress and slows down the aging process .
19 . Protection against Alzheimer ’s and osteoporosis
Women who have more sex have higher levels of estrogen , which protects against Alzheimer ’s and osteoporosis .
20 . Euphoria
Who would n’t want more ?
The best way to get a natural high is sex !
The last time an Academy Award - nominated actor followed up their nomination for an Oscar with the role of a comic book villain , we got Halle Berry in Catwoman .
Thankfully , I do n’t think we have that problem with Mickey Rourke as he takes on the role of Whiplash for next summer ’s Iron Man 2 .
Director Jon Favreau tells USA Today , who also premiered the first picture of Rourke in costume at right , that Whiplash , aka Ivan Vanko , has built his own power suit similar to Iron Man ’s , though his comes with a pair of powered whips .
Favreau states , “ The technologies are definitely related , and that ’s part of the core theme of the film . ”
As to whether Vanko works for Tony Stark ’s business rival Justin Hammer ( Sam Rockwell ) , Favreau remained tightlipped .
There are few additional story details except for that the fact that the picture is from a scene where Whiplash shows up at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix .
With Iron Man ’s suit of armor being true to the comics , will we see Rourke don the leather domination gear of the four - color version of the character ?
Probably not , but I do n’t think that fans will complain over that .
Favreau has won himself a lot of cred with fans with the first film and I doubt he ’ll blow it with the follow up .
Iron Man 2 hits theaters next summer .

In the Illusion of Sex , two faces are perceived as male and female .
However , both faces are actually versions of the same androgynous face .
One face was created by increasing the contrast of the androgynous face , while the other face was created by decreasing the contrast .
The face with more contrast is perceived as female , while the face with less contrast is perceived as male .
The Illusion of Sex demonstrates that contrast is an important cue for perceiving the sex of a face , with greater contrast appearing feminine , and lesser contrast appearing masculine .

What ’s all this nonsense about torture ?
Now , I ai n’t no Einstein , but it seems to me , if it makes us safer , it ’s a no - brainer !
In fact , maybe what we gotta do is torture a whole lot more .
I ’m not talkin’ about droppin ’ bombs on people from Predator drones .
That ’s a kind of torture if you get your limbs blown off or a beam thru your skull .
But , it ai n’t personal enuf .
It ’s what you call “ collateral damage . ”
What we gotta do is intentional damage — up close and personal .
And let ’s not stop with the so - called “ terr’ists . ”
Let ’s not pussy - foot .
I think everyone can agree that child - molesters should be tortured , right ?
If they do that kind of stuff once , they ’re probably gonna do it again .
Just like the terr ’ists !
And it ’s gotta be tortured outa them .
We gotta be intentional .
That also means we gotta figure out their intentions !
So , if we water - board ‘em a coupla hundred times , maybe they ’re gonna get the point , confess their sins — and tell us what they ’re thinking , what they ’re planning !
We gotta clean out that hornet ’s nest in their brains .
Cut ’em off at the pass .
( Or before the pass , if you know what I mean . )
Now if somebody ’s contemplatin’ that kind of stuff , it ’s too bad .
I do n’t care a rat ’s ass if their daddy was mean to ‘ em or their mama did n’t give them enuf cuddlin’ .
What ’s right is right !
Then there ’s the stem - cell research guys .
( I ’ll get to the abortion “ doctors , ” in a minute . )
These research types ( yeah , women , too ! ) do n’t even give the little embryo a chance to grow , a chance to feel the warmth of mama ’s womb .
Suppose somebody had done that to them ?
Well , turnabout ’s fair play I ’m sayin ’ .
I say we get into their bone marrow and do some jiggering .
Inject them with something chemical that ’s gonna make ’em feel like jello on a hot griddle .
As for them “ doctors ” that do abortions — hell ’s too good for ‘ em .
I say we put ’em in a little crawl space , get these giant forceps–and we crush their skulls .
Do unto others , and all that .
’ N’other thing : crime ’s gotten outa hand since 9/11 .
There was some break while the criminals was layin ’ low , bein ’ cowards and all , but they been comin ’ back full force .
So , let ’s not shut down Guantanamo !
Let ’s build a whole shebang more all over the world , carve out niches of land in commie regimes like Castroland , send these misfit criminal types there and let the locals at ’em .
Send ’em to central Asia .
They know how to boil people in oil over there .
They been doin ’ it since Jesus was in Bethlehem .
“ What else ? ” you ask .
… You got all this garbage on TV now .
You got “ cartoons ” with foul - mouthed characters .
Whaddaya gonna do ?
You ca n’t whup Homer Simpson .
You ca n’t get to ’em cause they ain’t real , but you can get to the “ creators ” –if you know what I mean .
You got this show called “ American Idol , ” too .
They got this guy wearing black nail polish !
What kinda message is that sendin ’ to the kids ?
Well , I say we extract his fingernails one by one — just like the Nazis used to do !
I say we learn ’em good .
And that Simon Cowl judge - guy is an arrogant S.O.B .
We oughta put him on the rack , see how much “ stretchin ” his ego can take !
Let ’s not forget our Congress , either .
You got Barney Frank and Nancy Pelosi .
I hear there ’s some stuff they do with electricity in sensitive parts (! ) that oughta shut those traitors up .
And as for that white - black , smiley guy who stole the election —
I ’d put him through some “ changes ” I would .
If you know what I mean !
All those guys that sold this country down the drain — yeah , bankers and CEO’s .
What are we bailin’ them out for ?
We oughta be bailin’ them in .
Right in the sewer !
Ain’t they done enuf already ?
Ain’t they hurt the people good enuf ?
I say we strapado them !
Put ’em in the Iron Maiden !
We gotta quit this pussy - footin ’ .
We gotta make examples of these vermin .
Give ’em gladius and sword and trident and net and let ’em fight to death in the football stadiums and on the baseball diamonds .
And the ones that win — we ’ll make them figh again until old age or disease or mortal wounds finish ’em off .
Then we ’ll hang their corpses from the nearest bridge .
We ’ll pike their heads !
And we ’ll show the world : we mean business !
We ’ll show them how tough democracy can be !
I ain’t sayin ’ it ’s pleasant for the torturer , but there ’s some people who do n’t mind it so much .
Good , salt - of - the - earth folks like Lindsay England , for example — gonna smile for the camera while they tie up the scumbags and put out their cigarettes in the scumbags ’ flesh .
And good , honest patriots like Mr. Cheney and Rush Limbaugh .
They ai n’t gonna flinch .
They ’re gonna do what they gotta do .
( And if we gotta rape the bastards , humiliate them before their Muftis and Allah–there ’s plenty of cops who know where to put their billy clubs ! )
We gotta get less “ sensitive ” about these things if we ’re gonna win this War on Terror !
We ca n’t let these Mueslis win or we ’re gonna be back in the Dark Ages !
War is hell as General Sherman said–and he oughta know !
We gotta get some kick - ass backbone if we ’re gonna save our country from all the garbage out there .
Cause some things are worth savin ’ and doin ’ everything you gotta do to save ’em .
Some things ya just gotta do whether you like it or not .
But there ’s some people do n’t mind it so much and we oughta use their talents !

Over the last couple of days I ’ve had some time to think , but not much time to do .
The first thing I ’ve been thinking about is how to test the redirection of requests based on request type for my theoretical new site .
The way this is meant to work is that you publish your data with a URI that looks like :
http://%5Bmy site ] / resource / [ ID of the item ]
If someone makes a request to this URI the server inspects what type of request it is , if it is a “ application / rdf+xml ” request then it is redirected to :
http://%5Bmy site ] / data /[ ID of the item ]
If it is a request of type “ text / html ” then it is redirected to :
http://%5Bmy site ] / page / [ ID of the item ]
This allows the you to publish the data with one common URI , but provide different views on the data depending on how it is requested .
There are other schemes out there , but this one fits in nicely with the URI rewriting functionality of the .
Net MVC framework so it ’s what I ’m planning to run with .
One thing I ’m not sure about is if I make a HTML request to the RDF specific URI ( or vice versa ) , should I be courtious to redirect the request to where I think it should go or at this stage are we past the point of hand holding ?
I ’m probably going to go with the former unless I find out something different .
As well as thinking about these things I was thinking about how to test it .
I ’ve previously mentioned the data browsers Disco and Tabulator .
Disco has been my favourite because I found it easy work with , it ’s very straight forward , go to the site , give it a URI , it does the rest .
The drawback with it is that it only works with URIs that are public , if I ’m still testing the basics of my application , I do n’t want it out there for the whole world to see .
So I gave Tabulator another go and I do n’t see how I got it wrong before .
It too is very straight forward .
It ’s a Firefox add - in ( yet another one … ) so anything you can point your browser can see , it can work with .
Need to test if your redirection is working OK ?
Simply go to Tools -> Data Browser ->
Make Firefox request RDF and toggle as required .
While I was perusing the web I also came across this great introduction to linked data .
It ’s written from the standpoint of someone working with library data ( I told you they love this stuff ) which colours the examples but it does a good job of laying down the foundations .

I believe that the introduction of flat panel HD - TVs for the mass consumer market was delayed by at least five years because of industry squabbling over HDMI standards .
We hear over an over again how it is necessary to " protect " the content producers from this an that .
But think about it , how many HD - TVs would have been sold without the bickering .
The imposition of DRM results in LOST sales ad lost opportunities that hurt business .
[ Comment at 04/21/2009 12:01 PM by Steve R. ]
Steve : I am far from being a flat panel television expert .
Here is a brief history of high definition television .
Where does HDMI fit in ?
[ Comment at 04/21/2009 01:30 PM by Lonnie E. Holder ]
I am not an expert either , but we delayed our purchase of an HD - TV until the HDMI connector was provided .
Below is an overview .
One thing about the overview , the previous standard DVI was implemented before HDMI , but the usual " someone " said it DVI could n't be used since it was an open standard whereas , HDMI was designed to " fight " piracy , so it had to be used instead .
HDMI - High - Definition Multimedia Interface High Definition ICT downgrade delayed Unfortunately , I have to go now .
I have not yet run across a story which discusses yet another delay in the release of HDMI .
But , these articles a least point out how an established industry standard ( DVI ) was junked because it was open in favor of a DRM encumbered HDMI cable .
[ Comment at 04/21/2009 01:57 PM by Steve R. ]
it 's going to be AT LEAST 10 YEARS before we have decent online movies on demand Do n't we have that already , with BitTorrent and The Pirate Bay ? :-)
[ Comment at 04/21/2009 05:29 PM by Cabalamat ]
I think you mean HDCP , not HDMI .
HDCP is a DRM system that works over either DVI or HDMI .
HDMI is just a connector that combines audio with DVI video .
[ Comment at 04/21/2009 05:34 PM by Jesse ]
Jesse :
Do you know whether HDCP caused a five year delay in the release of HDTV ?
[ Comment at 04/22/2009 05:06 AM by Lonnie E. Holder ]
Still looking .
No smoking gun yet .
Wikipedia page on HDCP Wikipedia page on HDMI Jesse is correct that HDCP provides the DRM system , but when conducting searches it seems the two are so intertwined that they are considered " one " technology , even though they are n't .
[ Comment at 04/22/2009 08:36 AM by Steve R. ]
Actually , I do n't believe HDCP delayed the introduction of HDTVs .
Why not ?
Because plenty of HDTVs were released without HDCP before the standard was finalized !
That was the problem : if you were one of the early HDTV adopters , not only did you pay an exorbitant price , but you ended up with a TV set that was ( needlessly ) incompatible with hardware that came later .
You might discover that your $ 10,000 TV could n't display HD movies at full resolution because the players intentionally limited the quality of analog component outputs or non-encrypted digital outputs .
Some of this was mitigated by the industry promising not to do anything too draconian with HDCP until 2010 .
Still , if you laid down enough money for your TV to buy a quality used car , you probably were n't planning to throw that TV away just a few years later .
[ Comment at 04/22/2009 07:33 PM by Jesse ]
I guess my perceptions were simply near sighted .

The authors say their find confirms that a passage in the Atharva Veda , a set of Sanskrit hymns written around 1550 B.C. , indeed refers to leprosy , a reading that had been doubted because until now the oldest accepted written accounts of the disease were from the sixth century B.C .
Image Possibly the oldest skeletal evidence of leprosy includes tooth loss and root exposure on this 4,000 - year - old mandible .
The bacterium that causes leprosy seemed to have spread worldwide from a single clone , biologists reported three years ago .
But for lack of sufficient samples , they could not tell whether the bacterium was disseminated when modern humans first left Africa about 50,000 years ago , or spread from India in more recent times .
Other biologists have contended that because the bacterium is not very transmissible , requiring prolonged intimate contact between people , it would not have started to spread until around the third millennium B.C. , when people started living in dense populations in cities and long - distance trade sprang up .
Helen D. Donoghue , an infectious disease specialist at University College London , said the new finding was fascinating and fit in with the theory that Alexander ’s army had brought leprosy back from its campaigns in India .
This was the right period for leprosy to have spread from India to Europe , Samuel Mark , an anthropologist at Texas A&M , argued in an article in 2002 .
But he doubted that Alexander ’s troops were the mode of transmission .
More likely , in his view , is the possibility that leprosy arrived with women imported as slaves by ship from India to Egypt .

Know your rights , and be smart !
The Iranian authorities have ordered the family of Neda Agha Soltan out of their Tehran home after shocking images of her death were circulated around the world .
Neighbours said that her family no longer lives in the four - floor apartment building on Meshkini Street , in eastern Tehran , having been forced to move since she was killed .
The police did not hand the body back to her family , her funeral was cancelled , she was buried without letting her family know and the government banned mourning ceremonies at mosques , the neighbours said .
" We just know that they [ the family ] were forced to leave their flat , " a neighbour said .
The Guardian was unable to contact the family directly to confirm if they had been forced to leave .
The government is also accusing protesters of killing Soltan , describing her as a martyr of the Basij militia .
Javan , a pro-government newspaper , has gone so far as to blame the recently expelled BBC correspondent , Jon Leyne , of hiring " thugs " to shoot her so he could make a documentary film .
Soltan was shot dead on Saturday evening near the scene of clashes between pro-government militias and demonstrators , turning her into a symbol of the Iranian protest movement .
Barack Obama spoke of the " searing image " of Soltan 's dying moments at his press conference yesterday .
Amid scenes of grief in the Soltan household with her father and mother screaming , neighbours not only from their building but from others in the area streamed out to protest at her death .
But the police moved in quickly to quell any public displays of grief .
They arrived as soon as they found out that a friend of Soltan had come to the family flat .
In accordance with Persian tradition , the family had put up a mourning announcement and attached a black banner to the building .
But the police took them down , refusing to allow the family to show any signs of mourning .
The next day they were ordered to move out .
Since then , neighbours have received suspicious calls warning them not to discuss her death with anyone and not to make any protest .
A tearful middle - aged woman who was an immediate neighbour said her family had not slept for days because of the oppressive presence of the Basij militia , out in force in the area harassing people since Soltan 's death .
The area in front of Soltan 's house was empty today .
There was no sign of black cloths , banners or mourning .
Secret police patrolled the street .
" We are trembling , " one neighbour said .
" We are still afraid .
We have n't had a peaceful time in the last days , let alone her family .
Nobody was allowed to console her family , they were alone , they were under arrest and their daughter was just killed .
I can't imagine how painful it was for them .
Her friends came to console her family but the police did n't let them in and forced them to disperse and arrested some of them .
Neda 's family were not even given a quiet moment to grieve . "
Another man said many would have turned up to show their sympathy had it not been for the police .
" In Iran , when someone dies , neighbours visit the family and will not let them stay alone for weeks but Neda 's family was forced to be alone , otherwise the whole of Iran would gather here , " he said .
" The government is terrible , they are even accusing pro-Mousavi people of killing Neda and have just written in their websites that Neda is a Basiji ( government militia ) martyr .
That 's ridiculous – if that 's true why do n't they let her family hold any funeral or ceremonies ?
Since the election , you are not able to trust one word from the government . "
A shopkeeper said he had often met Soltan , who used to come to his store .
" She was a kind , innocent girl .
She treated me well and I appreciated her behaviour .
I was surprised when I found out that she was killed by the riot police .
I knew she was a student as she mentioned that she was going to university .
She always had a nice peaceful smile and now she has been sacrificed for the government 's vote - rigging in the presidential election . "
The Americans have been arming the insurgents in Pakistan , said the Peshawar Frontier Post in an editorial .
As a U.S. report just acknowledged , Pakistani tribal lands are awash in American weapons .
This ca n’t be an accident .
We ’ve been wondering how these new insurgent leaders -- such as Baitullah Mehsud -- with no links to the tribal areas could suddenly have so much " money , arms , and war equipment pouring in clandestinely . "
And we wondered why one militant , Naik Mohammed , was killed by a U.S. drone after he had signed a peace pact with the Pakistani army .
The answer is now clear : The U.S. is trying to cause a civil war in Pakistan .
" It is a diabolical act , aimed at our country ’s very existence . "
Canada 's foreign
policy , as that country which is closer geographically , economically , and
militarily with the US than any other , has long been circumscribed by the whims
of the world 's lone Superpower .
Part of the
' hidden wiring ' of the US - Canada relationship is premised on the belief that
there is a role for Canada in places where the US carries a lot of
counter - productive baggage .
New records obtained by The Dominion show just how
actively intertwined Canada 's foreign policy is with the US - led ' democracy '
promotion project in Venezuela .
Successive
Canadian governments , beginning with Paul Martin's Liberals and increasing
under Harper 's
Tory minorities , have pushed full steam ahead with efforts to
expand Canada 's democracy promotion efforts globally .
Canadian leadership in
the regime change and military occupation of Haiti ( 2004 - present ) gave rise to
a renewed emphasis on the region as an emerging regional power , which carries
on under Harper .
Democracy
promotion is seldom discussed in the Canadian public sphere , even while it has
been the subject of a multitude of federal level conferences , reports , and
parliamentary hearings over the last five years .
Over that same time , Canada
has increasingly been integrating its instruments of democracy promotion with
those of the US .
During his
presidential campaign , Barack Obama quietly pledged to increase funding for the
controversial National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , despite scaling back the
rhetoric used to describe continuing US aims to promote global , Western - style
democracy .
Obama has already fulfilled this pledge .
His Omnibus
Appropriations
Act allocates $ 115 million for NED 's operations , increasing by
$ 35 million the amount requested by Bush for 2009 .
All told , the requested 2009
budget for US democracy programs is the highest ever at $ 1.72 billion .
By
contrast , Canada spent upwards of $ 650 million on democracy promotion in 2008 .
The NED was
formed in 1983 as a new tool to advance US foreign policy and business
interests around the world .
Nominally independent , NED receives the majority of
its budget from Congress , and each of its grants must be approved by the US
State Department .
" One of the
NED 's first major successes ... was helping to overthrow the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua , " writes journalist Bart Jones in his authoritative
biography of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
According to Jones , a couple of
decades later " the NED was rapidly infiltrating [ Venezuelan ] society in a way
reminiscent of the Nicaragua experience . "
Channelling money and resources to
opposition NGOs has been a prime strategy of the NED in Venezuela .
Following a
short - lived coup d'etat against Chavez in April 2002 , Venezuelan - American
attorney Eva Golinger and investigative journalist Jeremy Bigwood obtained a
treasure trove of documents through Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests .
These documents , released in conjunction with Golinger 's 2004 book , The Chavez
Code : Cracking US
Intervention in Venezuela , exposed NED 's active role in the
attempted subversion of Venezuela 's democracy .
One of several
Canadian NGOs whose activities are complementary to those of the NED is the
Canadian Foundation for the Americas ( FOCAL ) .
Established by the Mulroney
government in the 1990's , FOCAL is almost entirely dependent on government
funding and is accountable to Parliament .
A 2004
evaluation of FOCAL conducted by Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade Canada ( DFAIT ) and Canadian International Development
Agency ( CIDA ) wrote :
Stakeholders
from every sector and from the academic community in particular , indicated that
FOCAL is already perceived as ' the right arm of the government , ' echoing the
perspective and beliefs of its funding bodies , rather than a truly independent ,
non-governmental organization .
" The US has
been using Canadian and European foundations more frequently in recent years to
filter funding to Venezuelan and other NGOs and political parties that promote
their mutual interests , " said Golinger , whose most recent book is The
Imperial Web : Encyclopedia of Interference and Subversion .
" It 's a way of
covering up US meddling and making the sources of foreign funding for political
objectives more difficult to detect .
Canada has been a major ally of the US in
this respect , particularly in the case of Venezuela . "
Negative
perceptions of the US indicate the necessity of " shifting responsibility for
the [ democracy ] campaign to more local actors or other Western allies , " wrote
Raymond Gastil , one of the theoreticians behind the US shift to democracy
promotion , in 1988 .
Although far
from the first such instance , Canada began to take on such " responsibility "
towards Venezuela in January 2005 .
DFAIT invited the head of a key opposition
group in Venezuela , Sumate 's Maria Corina Machado , to meet Ottawa lawmakers and
officials , as well as to give a briefing on political rights in Venezuela .
Machado openly
supported the 2002 coup against Chavez .
In 2004 , she was charged with
conspiracy to commit treason for allegedly using NED funds to campaign against
Chavez in a recall referendum organized by the opposition .
According to
records obtained by The Dominion through Access to Information request FOCAL's
chairman John Graham joined Machado in Washington , D.C. for a high level
meeting in 2005 .
In attendance were former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice
and Roger Noriega .
" An exchange of ideas as regards the relationships between
the civil society and the governments for the strengthening of democracy in the
region , " was the stated purpose of the meeting .
Shortly after
Graham 's meeting with Rice and Machado , the NED approved a $ 94,516 grant for
FOCAL to carry out democracy promotion work in and around Venezuela .
Using the NED
funds , FOCAL was to commission a series of papers and organize a number of
meetings in Ottawa , Venezuela and Ecuador " to discuss how to better
collaborate in promoting an informed civil society that can strengthen democracy
in the region . "
But after
Stephen Harper 's Conservatives took power in early 2006 , FOCAL abruptly
cancelled the activities that were supposed to take place in Venezuela .
" After
discussing this project with various people ... [ we ] came to the conclusion that
it was not in anybody 's interests to organize such an activity while being
financially associated with the NED , " reads a heavily - censored memo sent by
DFAIT official Flavie Major in July of 2006 .
" [ S]ince
the project was originally drafted the internal context in Venezuela has
shifted , as has the domestic context in Canada , which could potentially alter
the priority and focus of Canada 's engagement in Venezuela , " indicates a
separate document obtained through a US FOIA request .
An example of
the changing political context in Venezuela is the 2006 draft Law on
International Cooperation , which was to have limited the ability of local NGOs
to receive funding from foreign governments .
Although the law has yet to be
enacted , Western - backed NGOs and their donors have launched a campaign to " push
back " against what they describe as a " backlash " against democracy promoters in
the region .
By late 2006 ,
the Conservatives proclaimed that democracy promotion was a " fundamental part "
of Canadian foreign policy objectives , and " an eminently worthy and
intrinsically Canadian endeavour . "
One indication of the Conservative's
commitment was through the appointment of a former NED board member as a top
advisor to Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay .
In late 2007 ,
the Canadian government gave the NED $ 198,168 to produce a major report , titled
" Defending Civil Society : A Report of the World Movement for
Democracy . "
The report attacks Venezuela for its efforts to limit Western - funded
manipulation of its internal politics :
Venezuela's
would - be caudillo Hugo Chavez has a peculiar notion of democracy .
His
‘ Bolivarian revolution ' appears to be based on Chavista [ sic ] monopolizing the
country 's political institutions , from an absence of parliamentary opposition
to a hand - picked judiciary .
In these circumstances ... civil society provides the
only countervailing power to the Chavista state and to Chavez 's Castroite
aspirations .
DFAIT seems to
have based their own talking points on Venezuela around the NED 's line .
" Hugo Chavez has a history of weakening democratic institutions .
Minister
Kent is committed to furthering the Government 's Americas strategy which is
dedicated to promoting and enhancing democracy , freedom and the rule of law , "
wrote a spokesperson for Canadian Minister of State for Latin America , Peter
Kent , in an e-mail statement to The Dominion .
" Hugo
Chavez has a history of concentrating power in the Executive which has
undermined democratic institutions in Venezuela .
Since taking office a decade
ago , we 've seen the politicization of the judiciary and harassment by
government officials of the state controlled media and NGOs , " wrote Kent's
spokesperson when asked to substantiate her claim about Chavez ' anti-democratic
tendencies .
One of the ways
that Canada has tried to avoid drawing attention to its support for the
Venezuelan opposition and collaboration with the NED is by carrying out
activities outside of Venezuela and coordinating them through embassies .
Indeed , such methods have a theoretical basis that Canada helped design .
In conjunction
with the NED - linked Council for a Community of Democracies and the US State
Department , DFAIT contributed $ 70,000 in financing to the publication of A
Diplomat 's Handbook for Democracy Development Support , in April 2008 .
Canada has one
of the few foreign services that train its diplomats in democracy promotion .
The US Foreign Service Institute has already ordered at least 400 copies of the
Handbook , which aims to provide diplomats with " encouragement , counsel , and a
greater capacity to support democrats everywhere . "
" We have over
many , many years and will continue to work with the United States in this
regard in advancing our common goals , certainly to the benefit of both
countries and to the benefit of the world in general , " Canada 's Consul - General
in New York , Dan Sullivan , said during a launch event for the Handbook in early
2008 .
One example of
the Handbook in action is Canada 's funding of the Venezuelan NGO Justice and
Development Consortium ( Asociación Civil Consorcio Desarrollo y Justicia ) .
This
group , which also receives funding from the NED , has made a name for itself by
working to unite reactionary opposition movements throughout Latin America .
In November
2007 , DFAIT gave the Justice and Development Consortium $ 94,580 " to
consolidate and expand the democracy network in Latin America and the
Caribbean " at an assembly held in Panama City in the spring of 2008 .
This
meeting , co-hosted by the Canadian Embassy in Panama and the NED , attracted
prominent members of ( often NED funded ) opposition movements in Venezuela ,
Cuba , Bolivia , and Ecuador .
It was convened in response to " the usher[ing ]
in [ of ] a new era of populism and authoritarianism in Latin America . "
Flying in the
face of the North American read of Venezuelan democracy is the latest report by
the non-partisan Chilean Latinobarometro , which shows that 79 per cent of
Venezuelans polled are satisfied with their democracy .
" Venezuela
has a poor image in the rest of the world ... but the perception of Venezuelans
is positive , " states the report .
" They say they like their democracy as it is
now or , at least , much more than the citizens of other countries like their
democracies which , by contrast , are not criticized by the outside world for
lack of freedom and harassment of institutions . "
Colombia , Peru ,
Mexico , and Chile are considered Canada 's strongest allies in the region , and
are also countries where people 's support for their government tends to be
lower than it is in Venezuela .
The subversion of Venezuelan democracy and the
laissez faire attitude towards the regimes of Felipe Caldéron in Mexico , Alan
Garcia in Peru and Álvaro Uribe in Colombia demonstrates that building popular
democracies is not the sought after end result of democracy promotion
activities .
The governments
of Colombia , Peru , Mexico and Chile have already entered into Free - Trade deals
with Canada , and each receives high levels of Canadian outward foreign direct
investment , particularly in the extractive sector .
Canadian trade
with Venezuela is second only to trade with Brazil in South and Central
America .
Venezuela is the tenth - largest provider of Canada 's considerable
foreign oil needs .
In 2008 , Canada imported $ 1.36 billion worth of Venezuelan
crude .
The North Atlantic Refinery in Newfoundland , home of Premier Danny " Chavez "
Williams , refines the oil .

Rep. Donna Edwards speaks at a press conference .
Her vote on Israel has troubled some Jewish constituents .
Should Edwards be shvitzing ?
Rep. Donna Edwards ( D - Md. ) knocked off incumbent Al Wynn in a 2008 primary by tapping into liberal resentment of the Democratic congressman and portraying him as a tool of K Street who had lost touch with his suburban Maryland constituents .
But after just a year on the job , Edwards herself is facing grumbling from within her own party , not to mention the possibility of a primary opponent with support from an alienated constituency : the suburban Washington - area Jewish community .
Advertisement
“ The relationship between the Jewish community and Donna Edwards got off to a rocky start , ” said Ron Halber , executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington .
“ I would be lying if I told you there was n’t concern . ”
At issue is Edwards ’ support for Israel .
Jewish leaders say tensions began to rise in January , when the House voted on a nonbinding resolution “ recognizing Israel ’s right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza ” and condemning Hamas for its attacks on the Jewish state .
The resolution , introduced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , passed 390 - 5 with overwhelming bipartisan support .
But Edwards balked at supporting the measure , joining 21 other members who voted “ present . ”
At the time , Edwards said the “ House voted on the wrong resolution at the wrong time ” and that she chose not to back the resolution because Congress ought to instead support the United Nations ’ call for an immediate cease - fire in the Middle East .
Her explanation did little to quell the controversy , and in the weeks after Jewish leaders complained that an Edwards - sponsored forum on the Israel - Palestine conflict failed to include a hawkish , pro-Israel voice and that the first - term congresswoman was unresponsive to requests to organize a meeting with suburban Washington Jewish leaders to discuss the vote .
“ The fact that she did not vote in favor [ of the resolution ] is cause for concern , ” said Rabbi Stuart Weinblatt of the B’nai Tzedek synagogue in Potomac , Md. “ It certainly raises questions for our community . ”
“ It appears from that vote that she has reservations about support for Israel that others don’t , ” said Rabbi Ari Sunshine of the B’nai Shalom synagogue of Olney , Md .
Even so , Edwards remains a favorite of the progressive left since capturing the 4th District seat last year , winning attention for her opposition to President Barack Obama ’s request for an additional $ 100 million in funding for the war in Afghanistan , her arrest during an April protest outside the Sudan Embassy and her push to ease travel restrictions to Cuba .
“ She is , in fact , supportive of what all her supporters thought she would do , ” said John Willis , a former Maryland secretary of state who is now director of the University of Baltimore ’s Government and Public Policy program .
“ All those support groups are probably very happy with her . ”

“ She has a pretty progressive district , and I think she was probably elected more for her style , ” said Len Lucci , a Prince George ’s County - area Democratic activist .
“ I do n’t know if those stands are going to hurt her . ”
Still , even in a strongly Democratic seat where her progressive voting record is an asset , there ’s reason to think that Edwards could be courting trouble with her Israel stance —
Jews make up as much as 15 percent of the district ’s active Democratic electorate , according to Maryland - based pollster Keith Haller .
And it would not be the first time that a progressive - minded African - American incumbent ’s position on Israel helped fuel a challenge that ultimately led to the lawmaker ’s defeat in a primary .
In 2002 , Artur Davis ousted incumbent Rep. Earl Hilliard ( D - Ala . ) after Hilliard voted against a resolution backing Israel ’s fight against terrorism .
In 2002 , then - Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( D - Ga. ) lost her seat in a primary in a contest widely viewed as Middle East policy proxy fight .
After her defeat , McKinney ’s supporters bitterly blamed “ the Jewish lobby . ”
There are already signs that the Jewish community is preparing to back a primary challenge to Edwards .
Last month , Maryland Del. Herman Taylor attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in Washington — in no small part , he said , to gauge support for a run against Edwards .
“ I have a lot of friends in the Jewish community , ” Taylor told POLITICO .
“ There seems to be a lot of people not completely thrilled with her lack of support for Israel . ”
“ I do think there are people who would like to back a pro-Israel candidate against Donna Edwards , ” said Larry Fishbein , the president and publisher of the Washington Jewish Week newspaper .
“ She is certainly opening the door to another candidate who would be more receptive to the Jewish vote . ”
Jewish leaders complain that Edwards is emerging as a far less reliable ally to Israel than Wynn , who during his time in office was a staunch supporter of the annual U.S. aid package to Israel .
In 2005 , he called on Egypt to condemn Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s statement that “ Israel must be wiped off the map . ”
During his 2008 campaign against Edwards ,
Wynn received $ 24,500 from the pro-Israel lobby , according to contribution records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
“ He was very receptive to the Jewish concerns , very responsive to the Jewish community , ” said Weinblatt .
Edwards ’ allies are quick to argue that while her less hawkish position on Israel may not be well - received by Israel hard - liners , her approach aligns well with the progressive base she has developed in her district .
And they note that the Jewish community itself is divided on her positions .
“ We consider her to be extremely pro-Israel , ” said Jeremy Ben - Ami , executive director of J Street , a pro-Israel organization that endorsed Edwards in her 2008 race and favors a dovish approach to the Middle East conflict .
“ She is very interested in finding a way to bring peace to Israel through diplomacy . ”
Edwards traveled to Israel over Congress ’ Memorial Day work period , accompanying fellow Democratic Reps. Brian Baird of Washington and Peter Welch of Vermont .
She said in a statement last week that the trip “ only reinforced ” her commitment to a two - state solution .
“ From Israel to the West Bank to Gaza , it is evident that most people of the region want our president to lead in this opportunity for a lasting peace , ” Edwards said .
Edwards also said she was planning on holding a town hall meeting in her district in the coming weeks to discuss her trip and the conflict in the region .
Halber , the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington , said that while the differences between the Jewish community and Edwards are not irreconcilable , the two sides were not off to an agreeable start .
“ It has really raised eyebrows in the Jewish community , ” said Halber .
“ For the Jewish community , which is very politically active , it stands out . ”
The CPU support picture for Windows 7 was blessedly simple , at least until this week , when Microsoft complicated things for one corner of its upcoming OS .
This new wrinkle was the discovery that Windows 7's recently announced XP Mode would only work on processors that supported either Intel 's VT or AMD 's AMD - V .
The vast majority of AMD 's lineup , except for Sempron , has AMD - V and will work , but the Intel situation is much more complicated , and in some ways , worse .
In a nutshell , Intel 's VT-x and AMD 's AMD - V work by introducing a set of instructions that make x86 fully virtualizable without the use of binary translation .
This was originally supposed to have speed advantages , though when VT first made its debut the transitions in and out of the hypervisor were slow enough that BT arguably still had the edge .
But this has n't been true for some time , and now VT is the way to go if you 're rolling out a new x86 - based virtualization package , like Microsoft 's hyper - V or Virtual Iron 's software .
( For more on the issue of performance and VT versus binary translation , see this thread , where some Intel and VMware folks go a few rounds on the topic . )
But VirtualPC , the virtualization package that Microsoft bought and on which XPM is based , is a binary translation solution , just like VMware .
So the question then becomes , why did Microsoft mandate VT support for XPM ?
I do n't know the answer to this , nor do I know why Intel does n't include VT support across its entire lineup .
A handy list put together by Ed Bott * gives you an idea of how spotty VT support is even among Intel 's more recent parts , and that list still does n't include Atom , which includes non-VT supporting entries in its line .
As you can see , quite a few users wo n't be able to use XPM when Windows 7 comes out , especially on the corporate desktop , where many companies have opted for cheaper , non-VT parts .
[* Ed : I had originally attributed the list to Tom 's Hardware , but it comes from Ed Bott .
That 's my fault for not reading closely enough . ]
OK , when I said I did n't know why Intel does n't support VT on all its parts , that was just rhetorical .
I actually do know why — it 's just that it 's a really boneheaded move on Intel 's part .
Intel uses VT for product segmentation , regarding it as a high - end feature and charging more for it .
This is very annoying if , like me , you believe that everyone will shortly be running a hypervisor on every device that is n't a mobile phone ( and eventually phones will get them too , if VMware has its way ) .
But as annoying as this approach to product segmentation is , it makes a certain amount of sense given Intel 's situation in the post - clockspeed era .
Throughout most if its history , Intel has done product segmentation mainly by speed bin .
But in a power - sensitive world where the clockspeed gap between bins is much closer together , Intel is left to differentiate on features and core count .
So their insistence on doing product segmentation with VT is understandable , but it still stinks .
Ultimately , though , the primary question that remains to be answered is why Microsoft is requiring VT support for XP Mode .
It 's likely that Redmond 's reasons will become more clear as Windows 7 gets closer to release and more details of XPM come out , but until then , I 'd love to hear everyone 's take on this .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Three suicide attackers shot their way onto the grounds of a five - star hotel in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar and set off a car bomb , killing at least seven people and wounding dozens , officials said .
Pakistani police gather at the five - star hotel destroyed by a car bomb .

Peshawar Police Chief Safwat Ghyour said about 40 people were wounded in the attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel , which is often frequented by foreigners and diplomats .
The blast inflicted severe damage on the building , which is surrounded by a security wall , and destroyed dozens of cars in the parking lot , police and witnesses said .
The information minister for Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province , Mian Iftikhar Hussain , put the death toll at 11 , with at least 50 wounded .
A local official , Sahib Zada Muhammad Anis Khan , said one of the dead was a Nigerian national who worked for the United Nations .
Qhazi Jamil , senior superintendent of Peshawar police , told CNN three gunmen in a pickup fired on security guards at the hotel 's entrance gate and forced their way inside before setting off the bomb .
Hussain and the chief of Peshawar 's bomb - disposal squad said the bomb contained about 500 kilograms ( 1,100 pounds ) of explosives .
Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province , which has suffered a spate of bombings on civilian targets in the wake of the Pakistani military 's ongoing military offensive against Taliban militants .
Sajjan Gohel , an international security analyst at the Asia - Pacific Foundation in Britain , said the blast appeared to be a response to the government 's offensive .
" It has been criticized very heavily in the tribal areas because of the fact that the Pakistani military has been using helicopter gunships against the Taliban , which has resulted in very high civilian casualties , " Gohel said .
He said people in the region are sympathetic to the Taliban , the Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington by its al Qaeda allies .
" This is where winning hearts and minds is so key and important , which the military are failing to do , " he said .
However , hundreds of Pakistani villagers who have formed an anti-Taliban militia are currently fighting to remove the Islamic militants from their region of northwestern Pakistan , military spokesman Maj .
Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN .
Abbas told CNN the Pakistani military is supporting the villagers , who turned against the Taliban after a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers left at least 40 dead .
The Pearl Continental is owned by the same group as the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad , which was destroyed in a suicide truck bombing in September .

Now the review : Great work !
But I do take issue with two things : the supposed precepts of 1 ) not flushing a toilet with someone else 's unflushed poop in it , and 2 ) not making any " noises " when relieving oneself .
As to the first , that only makes more probable the backlog and ensuing chaos and breakdown of civilization that one is trying to avoid .
As for 2 ) An old Latin precept ( from the Salerno school ) states " Antiquo more mingens pedit absque pudore , " i.e .
" According to ancient custom a urinating person passes gas without shame , " or more loosely , it 's OK to fart and pee at the same time .
Now if that 's true for peeing , a fortiori one can definitely POOP and pass gas at the same time ( and who can control the sound volume of that , esp when sitting on the toilet ? )
Also , viewers may not realize that Abraham Maslow , described somewhat favorably in the video , is also considered to be the " Father " of the modern " self - improvement " movement , with all the moral relativism , bogus " self - esteem " and " values clarification " teaching , and basically much of the moral anarchy we see in our hurting world .
He deserves to be more than just " knee - deep in butt pudding , " as poor , innocent Sammy unfortunately found himself here .
For more on Maslow , see www.culturewars.com/CultureWars/1999/torches.html, also E. Michael Jones ' new book , " The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and its impact on World History . "
A lengthy review is at Robert Sungenis ' website . )
Maslow was never shy in proposing sexual activity as a form of social engineering .
By 1967 , Maslow was referring to the self - actualization which encounter groups were supposed to bring about as “ S. A. stuff , ” which had become , in turn , just part of the “ Esalen - Dionysian ” enterprise .
One year before his death , he could now detect in all of these activities the odor of “ insanity and death ” ( May 17 , 1969 journal entry ) .
Over the weekend , we learned that Steve Jobs recently had a liver transplant , but that his return to Apple was imminent .
Today , the company ’s iconic leader is out with a statement , at least in press release form .
Complimenting an announcement that more than one million of the iPhone 3G S have been sold since the device hit stores on Friday , Jobs is quoted as saying " Customers are voting and the iPhone is winning .
With over 50,000 applications available from Apple 's revolutionary App Store , iPhone momentum is stronger than ever . "
While that might sound like usual Jobs bravado , it ’s certainly not disconnected from reality .
Palm
Pre , considered by many analysts to be one of the hottest challengers to the iPhone , moved somewhere between 45,000 and 100,000 devices in its first weekend in stores .
Meanwhile , the Pre has an embarrassingly small number of apps available when compared to the iPhone numbers that Jobs cites .

Orissa has been the worst affected state Photo : Sanjib Mukherjee
A severe heatwave has claimed the lives of nearly 100 people across India , reports say .
The eastern Indian state of Orissa appears to be the worst affected with 58 people dying from heat stroke , according to local officials .
Unofficial figures in the Orissa media put the number of dead closer to 200 .
Many parts of India have recorded temperatures of over 40 C as weather officials say the monsoon , expected at this time of the year , has been patchy .
Orissa disaster management minister Surjya Narayan Patro has said that the federal government should declare the heat wave as a " national calamity " so that the relatives of the dead are compensated better .
Most of those affected in the state are the poor , rickshaw pullers , daily wage workers and farmers .
' Drought - like situation ' Orissa has traditionally borne the brunt of heatwave deaths in India - 2042 people died of heat strokes in the state in 1998 alone , our correspondent Sanjaya Jena in Bhubaneswar says .
The death toll has come down over the years as people have been careful about leaving home in the scorching heat , officials say .
Last year , 68 people died from the heat in Orissa , down from 236 deaths in 2005 .
Many cities in Orissa like Sambalpur , Titlagarh and Jharsuguda have been recording temperatures above 44C .
Hospitals have opened special wards for heat stroke victims , and mobile ice vans are patrolling some of the cities , officials say .
In northern Bihar state , local newspapers have reported that seven people have died from heat strokes , though there is no official confirmation , our correspondent Amarnath Tewary in Patna says .
A Bihar farmer , Sanket Upadhaya , said that the continuing heat had caused a " drought - like situation in the state " .
In neighbouring Jharkhand , 17 people have reportedly died from the heat in the last three days alone , as scorching temperatures enveloped the cities of Gumla , Palamau and Bokaro .
A heat wave is scorching India Meteorologists say monsoon rains in Bihar have been delayed by three weeks and are over 90 % below normal .
In southern Andhra Pradesh , six people have died from the heatwave sweeping parts of the coastal region .
The temperature has been hovering around 44C in some places in the state , says our correspondent Omer Farooq in Hyderabad .
Schools which opened recently after summer recess are working only till noon because of the heat .
The monsoon rains in the state have been 90 % below normal till now , meteorologists say .
Chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy has asked government departments to arrange for special prayers for rains .
A cloud seeding operation is also planned to begin next month if the rains are delayed further .
Unofficial reports from India 's most populous Uttar Pradesh state say four people have died of heat strokes in the state .
The government there admits that it does not compile heat stroke figures , though many routinely die from heat every year .
On Wednesday , Indian officials said that monsoon are likely to be " below normal " triggering off fears about crop failure and high food prices .
Monsoon rains usually last from June to September .

Looks like one cool kitty , he 's traveled more than me .
My cat used to go on my shoulder for walks - but never this far or for that long , pretty cool adventure for him .
Over 15,000 km from Miami to the southern tip of south america .
While Xbox 360 systems may be known more for the dreaded " red ring of death " than any other hardware failure , one gaming blog has been tracking the rise of the " E74 " error , an issue that causes the console to crash and show a multi- language kill screen .
You 'll also get a single red section on your system 's power button .
Microsoft is aware of the problem , and has since amended it 's three - year warranty to cover the error .
The story began when Joystiq started to receive complaints concerning the error .
The site decided to gather some data , and found that complaints of the error increased after the release of the New Xbox Experience , or NXE .
" One oddity is that there is no correlation between the dates on which the systems in question were purchased and when they went belly up , " Joystiq writer Justin McElroy reported .
" The error usually occurred after anywhere from 12 to 36 months of use , with many of you claiming that trouble arose on consoles that have already been repaired for Red Ring of Death .
Whatever modifications Microsoft has made to the console to improve its reliability in the past years seems to have no bearing on the likelihood of E74 . "
The problem was that this issue was n't covered by Microsoft 's warranty ; the company simply called it a " general hardware failure " and that was that .
More sites jumped onto the issue , however , and found the same data : the E74 error was a widespread issue , and seemed connected to the NXE , although that might not be the direct cause of the issue .
" The time frame for the rise in issues makes NXE and its November debut a suspect , " Engadget wrote .
" But it 's worth noting that the uptick started just before that launch , so perhaps it has more to do with hiccups caused by spurred interest in turning on the console after a long period of dormancy . "
Tuesday , Microsoft announced that it would do the right thing and extend the red-ring warranty to include the E74 errors , detailing the inclusion on its Xbox support site .
" After investigating the issue , we have determined that the E74 error message can indicate the general hardware failure that is associated with three flashing red lights error on the console .
As a result , we have decided to cover repairs related to the E74 error message under our three - year warranty program for certain general hardware failures that was announced in July 2007 . "
Microsoft also claims it has made the necessary changes to decrease the likelihood of the error , and will refund the cost of E74 repairs to customers who may have already paid to have their console fixed or replaced .
It 's gratifying to see Microsoft do the right thing , but yet another known hardware issue with the 360 wo n't do much to help the system 's battered reputation ; the red ring fiasco ended up costing the company $ 1 billion plus to make right .
The " E74 " problem wo n't likely cost anything near that amount , but the damage to the 360's shoddy hardware reputation wo n't be easy to quantify .

Daphne's Story
Daphne 's story is one of a devoted athlete whose life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with lymphoma in June of 2018 .
Just five years prior , Daphne , the Race Director of the Asheville Marathon at Biltmore Estate , chose The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ( LLS ) as the charity partner for the marathon in 2013 .
She had no personal ties or connections with lymphoma or leukemia , saying " I just thought they were a solid organization to give back to and to help support through our event . "
After being diagnosed last year , Daphne turned to LLS for information , support and a community to help her through the trying battle ahead of her , saying " when I received the lymphoma diagnosis I knew that it would be very important for me to learn all that I can about my cancer and then support the organization that is dedicating its research dollars to finding a cure .

You see the same bullshit headlines churned out everywhere you turn .
Yes sir , we ’re supposed to believe the recession is over , recovery is underway and prosperity is just around the corner .
We need to go out and fulfill our patriotic duty , which means buying things , preferably houses .
That ’s what smart investors would do , we ’re told .
And judging by the polls , Americans are starting to believe it .
Contrary to just about every single economic metric — rising unemployment , rising credit card debt , falling production , spiraling real estate values — people are optimistic .
The recession is yesterday ’s news , everyone ’s moved on .
People are actually believing the hype and getting into real estate again .
And anyway , how the hell can we talk about real estate when America is torturing people and still not closing Guantanemo !
Well , the real estate industry is fine with us not paying attention .
Because it has a dirty little secret that shows just how fucked our economy really is , and how insolvent they really are .
In reality this McMansion is worth $ 30,000
If you , like me , live in a foreclosure - ridden area , it is n’t very hard to notice that the real estate optimism of you hear in the news just does not match reality .
Take Victorville , my new adopted home .
There are a total of about 30,000 single - family homes in Victorville .
As of today , 4,590 of them are for listed sale in the general area ( 3,500 of them are foreclosures ) .
The average listing price is $ 150,000 , but most of them sell for half that .
There ’s a 3 bedroom / 3 bathroom McMansion just around the corner from my own that sold for $ 75,000 a month ago .
The house cost $ 249,500 when it was built in 2004 and sold to some sucker for $ 338,500 at the peak of the boom in 2006 .
Three years later it was worth $ 125,000 — half of its original price — and now belonged to the bank , which was happy to cut the price by another 50 % just to get rid of it .
Houses sell so poorly , that real estate Web sites do n’t bother listing “ days the on market ” metric .
The Rise and Fall of Victorville ’s Real Estate
Pretty grim , right ?
Actually , it ’s much worse .
See , the weird thing about Victorville is that while 1 in 4 houses are vacant , and obviously have been for quite some time ( just judging by the dilapidated state of the empty houses ) , very few of these empty houses are on the market for sale .
Walking around my neighborhood , you rarely see a For Sale sign .
There ’s a foreclosure property up the street from me that has been prepped for long - term storage by its bank , with a notice posted on the living room window warning that the house ’s pipes are filled with antifreeze so that they wo n’t burst when the temperature starts plummeting to zero in the wintertime , as it does here in the high desert .
Fact is , banks all across the nation are keeping foreclosed properties off the market .
They ’re doing it on purpose , to fudge the statistics and make it seem like everything ’s alright .

Chris Anderson has been caught lifting huge chunks out of Wikipedia for his book Free .
The irony speaks for itself .
But it 's worth noting that the Wired editor 's excuses are disconcertingly clichéd .
Like so many plagiarists before him , Anderson claims his act was unintentional .
The Virginia Quarterly Review first reported his copying , and the explanation he gave us is that he and his editors decided to kill Free 's footnotes " at the 11th hour ; " though much attribution was restored within the body text , Wikipedia sources were not .
This was due , according to the statement he sent to VQR , to " my inability to find a good citation format for web sources ( I resisted the time stamp proposal ) . "
The upshot : Print authors like Mike Pollan were cited for " intellectual debts "
Anderson owed them , while many of the forward - thinking , freely - contributing writers Anderson champions in the book got no attribution .
As it happens , this is violates the copyright license governing Wikipedia .
Anderson told us , " this is my screwup ... I feel terrible about it . "
The lifted work was " mostly historical asides and nothing central to the book . "
But history is hardly simple to document , and it would seem a book on free products would be significantly diminished without its passages on the famous " free lunch " of the 19th - century saloon , or the origin of the phrase " there 's no such thing as a free lunch . "
Like Maureen
Dowd before him , Anderson promises to fix everything on the Web :
We 'll have the original notes that were supposed to accompany the book , which includes all these , online by publication date
Update : Hyperion , Anderson 's publisher , has gave a statement to VQR backing his mistake - not - plagiarism spin :

( CNN ) --
There is hardly anything in U.S. - Arab relations that screams scandal louder than the torture pictures of Abu Ghraib :
The abuse that went on behind these gates hardened Arab opinion against the United States .
more photos »
Naked hooded male bodies in the fetal position , piled up on top of each other in a pyramid shape , next to them U.S. soldiers in uniform smiling and giving two thumbs up .
Naked males made to touch their genitals on camera , others beaten so hard that paramedics are at hand to treat their wounds in preparation for the next round of torture .
For the Arab world , the human body is a taboo , a sacred temple that should be covered and respected .
For many , exposing the naked body is a sin .
So it is no surprise that taking pictures of the naked , hooded men was seen as a sick inexcusable act .
The United States was already unpopular in the Arab world , mainly because of its war in Iraq .
After Abu Ghraib in most quarters , it became despised with a vengeance .
Before the pictures and videos became public in 2004 , horror stories of what was going on inside the notorious Abu Ghraib prison were reported on Arab media in bits and pieces .
We 'd heard from people whose identity was hidden for their own protection .
They described despicable acts of sexual abuse and torture that sounded more from a made - up horror tale than from real - life experience .
For many Arab media observers , those claims were simply hard to believe .
That is , until hundreds of photos and some videos were made available to the public that showed exactly what former Abu Ghraib prisoners had described on Arab media , and even worse .
See the abuse photos »
Arab newspapers and TV networks seemed to run out of words in describing the shock at the images they were printing on their front pages and showing in their newscasts .
Anchors , reporters and guests felt uneasy about this bizarre story and all the twists and turns that followed .
Those included a guided media tour of Abu Ghraib , showing that the situation was under control and inmates were being treated with dignity and respect .
The shock quickly turned to anger against the United States and pity toward the victims .
Arab commentators described the photos as " shameful , " the act of U.S. soldiers " barbaric . "
The outrage at the acts carried out by U.S. soldiers was a common reaction in the West and among Muslims and Arabs around the world .
However , the way the reaction was translated on the ground was different .
Gen .
Mark Kimmitt first made his rounds on Arab networks arguing that these were isolated acts , made by a few low - ranking soldiers .
He said on the most - watched Arab network , Al - Jazeera , that he was " appalled " at the photos , but he stressed that the images were being " used as a tool " to impact the U.S. military negatively .
His boss , then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , broke his silence a few weeks later and reiterated that only a handful of low - level Army troops were involved in the abuse .
He also offered to resign twice but his resignation was never accepted .
Three months after the photo scandal , amid growing Arab and world outrage that showed no signs of calming , President Bush appeared on the U.S. government - run Arabic - language Al - Hurra TV .
Many Arab commentators and columnists were expecting an apology and some high level officials to be held accountable .
Neither happened .
Bush said , " I view those practices as abhorrent . "
But he added that Iraqis " must understand that what took place in that prison does not represent the America that I know . "
The president 's interview with his own station was seen in the Arab world as an attempt to pacify the situation instead of dealing appropriately with the problem .
When another wave of Abu Ghraib torture photos became public in 2006 , the reaction was n't as strong because it seemed by then that the Arab world had given up on America .
Sateh Noureddine of Lebanon 's independent newspaper Assafir wrote that the scandal confirms an image of America " already engraved in people 's minds in the Middle East . "
The image is that America is n't genuine about conducting " an experiment of democracy " in the region .
Newspaper headlines from that time captured the mood .
The London - based Al - Hayat newspaper said , " New Pictures of the Abu Ghraib Scandal : Torture , Killing and Body Mutilation . "
The Palestinian - owned Al - Quds Al - Arabi wrote " Despicable pictures of at Abu Ghraib abuse scandal , suppressing prisoners by using live ammunition .
Sexual abuse , barbaric beating and fallen bodies . "
The Saudi - owned Asharq Al - Aswat 's headline was critical of the U.S. administration 's position : " Washington :
The new pictures wo n't add anything other than stir up anger .
Those responsible were punished . "
As soon as the news broke that more torture pictures could be released this year , Arab media rolled the old photos of humiliated Iraqi prisoners .
The same pyramid of naked bodies showed up and that of a female soldier pulling a prisoner on a leash around his neck .
Anchors asked questions about what news the new pictures could bring .
Will they show that the Bush administration approved of those torture tactics and applied them in Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay and perhaps elsewhere ?
Was the torture a directive given to soldiers rather than low - level military personnel engaging in " abhorrent " practices as the president called them ?
There is nothing any new photos can prove that was n't already discussed and oftentimes believed on the Arab street already .
One political cartoon by Lebanese journalist Stavro Jabra from May 2004 describes the mood in the Arab region and its experience of the scandal .
It was inspired by one infamous Abu Ghraib photo , but , in the cartoon , the U.S. female soldier is replaced by Lady Liberty .
At the end of her leash , instead of the Iraqi prisoner , lies President Bush .
It was a clear reflection of an Arab view that the Abu Ghraib scandal will be a stamp of shame on the Bush administration .
History will judge if it is an accurate prediction .
CNN 's Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report .

US whistleblowing legislation gets little media attention
May 15 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Unlike American news outlets , the US intelligence community is paying a lot of attention right now to HR 1507 , known as the 2009 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act .
The act is currently making the rounds at two US House of Representatives committees , namely the Oversight and Government Reform and the Homeland Security committee .
There was an interesting debate yesterday morning at the Oversight and Government Reform committee hearing , where proponents and opponents of HR 1507 focused on the bill ’s provisions protecting the rights of whistleblowers in the intelligence and security services .
Under current legislation ( the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act , or ICWPA ) , there is a large gap separating the rights of intelligence and security whistleblowers from those of other government employees .
The former are actually required to seek and obtain formal authorization from their agency director prior to disclosing alleged fraud , abuse or waste to congressional oversight committees .
Moreover , there is currently no protection in place to help shield security and intelligence whistleblowers from retaliation .
Nearly everyone involved in the heated debate agrees that ICWPA is in urgent need of revamping .
But not everyone agrees on the precise direction of the required updates .
During yesterday ’s debate , witnesses from the Government Accountability Project and other lobby groups argued that the deficiencies in the ICWPA regime effectively force whistleblowers to secretly turn to the media when they want to expose illicit or abusive practices .
But representatives from the University of Virginia ’s Center for National Security Law called the proposed bill “ a truly horrible idea that will [ … ] probably get a lot of innocent Americans killed ” .
IntelNews hears that so far most committee members appear to favor HR 1507 .
The hearing continues .
In the Wall Street Journal today , an article is published that details how cities are disincorporating as a result of the declining economy .
Cities are dissolving themselves in order to escape city union contracts , among other things .
As the recession batters city budgets around the U.S. , some municipalities are considering the once - unthinkable option of dissolving themselves through “ disincorporation . ”
Benefits of this move vary from state to state .
In some cases , dissolution allows residents to escape local taxes .
In others , it saves the cost of local salaries and pensions .
And residents may get services more cheaply after consolidating with a county .
In Mesa , Wash . , a town of 500 residents about 250 miles east of Portland , Ore. , city leaders have initiated talks with county officials about the potential regional impact of disincorporating .
Mesa has been hit by a combination of the recession and lawsuits that threaten its depleted coffers , leaving few choices other than disincorporation , said Robert Koch , commissioner of Franklin County , where Mesa is located .
Two California towns , Rio Vista and Vallejo , have said they may need to disincorporate to address financial difficulties ; Vallejo filed for bankruptcy protection last year .
Civic leaders in Mountain View , Colo. , have alerted residents that they are left with few options but to disincorporate because the town can’t afford to pay salaries and services .
Incorporation brings residents a local government with the ability to raise money through taxes and bond issuances .
It also gives them more control of zoning decisions and development , and usually provides for local services such as trash pickup and police as well .
On the national level , the Federal government would simply cease to exist .
You ’re probably wondering that ’s not possible .
Well , given the extreme financial conditions of borrowing nearly 50 cents of every dollar spent , fighting two wars , having massive entitlements like Social Security and Medicaid that cannot be funded at current levels of taxation , having government expand at unparalleled levels , and the fact that Americans are already spending nearly half their income in taxes and other compliance costs as is ; perhaps the Federal government may have to disincorporate .
The problem is cultural , we Americans have never learned to live within our means .
That ’s why we have the credit crunch and that ’s why we have these outrageous government programs we can’t fund .
We need to have a serious discussion about the role of government and how we should pay for it .
As tragedies go , not getting what you want is the straightforward kind , and getting it can be the ironic variety .
But there is also the existential tragedy of not knowing what you want to begin with .
That ’s the species of catastrophe recounted in Walter Kirn ’s memoir , “ Lost in the Meritocracy : The Undereducation of an Overachiever , ” the witty , self - ­castigating story of the author ’s single - minded quest to succeed at a series of tests and competitions that took him from one of the lowest - ranked high schools in Minnesota to Princeton .
As Kirn , a noted critic and novelist , tells it , in childhood he leapt onto a hamster wheel baited with “ prizes , plaques , citations , stars , ” and kept rattling away at it until his junior year in the Ivy League , when he suffered a breakdown that left him nearly speechless .
Kirn cracked up as he began to suspect that he was approaching the end of the line .
He did n’t especially desire money or power , and even his appetite for renown was quixotic .
( He spent one summer bar - backing for a legendary mixologist in Munich , thinking : “ This was true fame I was witnessing , true mastery .
I should stay and learn from it . ” )
Up to that point , he ’d devoted his whole life to “ the great generational tournament of aptitude ” in which “ the ranking itself was the essential prize . ”
Somehow he ’d made it through three years of college without seriously considering what he intended to do once he got out .
Like many memoirs , “ Lost in the Meritocracy ” combines penetrating shrewdness with remarkable blind spots .
Take the book ’s central question :
How did anyone as smart as Kirn get into such a fix ?
The implication of the title is that “ meritocracy ” itself was to blame .
Kirn grew up in the 1960s and ’ 70s , when technocrats were thoroughly systematizing American public education .
In his suburban grammar school , subjects like art and music were formed into “ units ” and “ modules , ” implying that “ learning could be engineered , and that it had been , perhaps by government scientists — the same ones behind the Apollo program , maybe . ”
At the same time , the teachers were squishy , easily flattered and willing to coo over any creative daub that seemed to express “ feelings . ”
“ Art ” could be whatever he said it was , Kirn realized , and producing it was the equivalent of such apple - polishing activities as emptying the classroom pencil sharpener .
When he concocted bogus stories about the emotions that supposedly inspired his projects , he won “ praise , and sometimes hugs , eventually convincing me that art was about one feeling above all others : being loved . ”

Alexis Dahan
So there you have it : the young Walter Kirn quickly learned that achievement could be precisely quantified , but also that the system for arriving at that quantification could be gamed .
“ I was the system ’s pure product , ” he writes , “ sly and flexible , not so much educated as wised up . ”
He figured out how to turn a teacher ’s question inside out and parrot it back in a simulation of thoughtfulness .
If asked , “ How does racial prejudice contribute to inner-city hopelessness ? ” he ’d reply , “ Is our conception of ‘ inner - city hopelessness ’ perhaps in itself a form of prejudice ? ”
A maestro of multiple choice , he managed to ace his SATs despite having cracked only three “ serious novels ” by the age of 16 : “ Frankenstein , ” “ Moby - Dick ” and “ The Great Gatsby . ”

There was a mechanism for " the system " to work .
It called for the House of Representatives to refuse to accept the electors from the State of Florida when they reported .
It simply required for ONE member of the House and ONE Senator to stand up and raise an objection .
There were plenty of members of the House who rose to object , but no member of the Senate ( supposedly on orders from Al Gore ) would join the protest .
That was the last opportunity for justice in that election , and , as it turned out , one of the last chances to save our country from a electoral fraud coup that would use the 4 years after taking power to solidify their frauds so they could steal a second election in 2004 .
Trillions of dollars , millions of deaths , and a lost decade to address global climate change later ...
And , folks , just because they did n't seem to win in 2008 does n't mean any of their mechanisms of election theft are n't still in place and waiting for 2012 .
Seeds of Change Research Farm
Shapiro is global director of plant science and external research for Mars , the secretive food empire most famous for its eponymous chocolate bar .
He does n’t look a lot like Jesus but does have a mesmerising long white beard , which dates back beyond a decade of corporate life to when he founded a radical organic food company , Seeds of Change .
Twelve years after Seeds of Change was sold to Mars – amid cries of betrayal from some customers – Shapiro recently announced that the world ’s biggest chocolate company is committing itself to sustainable sourcing of the whole of its annual cocoa bean supply , worth more than $ 1 billion .
The policy starts with the Galaxy bar and by 2020 will encompass not just Gal­axy and Mars but also Snickers , Twix and M&Ms .
The new strategy also covers environmental issues and labour , dwarfing Cadbury ’s pledge that all Dairy Milk chocolate will be Fairtrade later this year …
Mars bought Seeds of Change because it saw a future in ethical production , says Shapiro .
Crucially , however , Mars had the might to put those principles into practice on a much bigger scale .
“ If you ’re interested in the future , scale is one of the things that ’s critical , ” says Shapiro .
“ I ’m interested in not having any hungry people in the world .
I ’m interested in changing the lives of as many people as possible … ”
About 18 months ago Ethical Consumer magazine gave “ before ” and “ after ” scores to brands that had been sold to corporations : like many of the acquisitions , Seeds of Change did badly , dropping from 15 to 3.5 out of 20 .
This Easter the UK - based magazine ranked chocolate eggs : again , two Mars brands – Mars and Galaxy – did badly , scoring a near - bottom three out of 20 .
The company was marked down for poor environmental reporting , testing on animals , operations in oppressive regimes and campaigning against EU obesity laws .
Ethical Consumer , of course , is n’t concerned with peoples ’ needs and wholesome food as much as it is at being a religion .
Satisfying requirements from the PETA - side of the spectrum and holier - than - thou ideologues might not work with the original company .
If you want to function in a market - driven world , you sometimes have to do business with people who do n’t belong to your church .
Last June Mars announced it would contribute $ 10 m to a project to map the cacao tree genome and publish it for free to speed up the development of quicker - growing and more resilient varieties .
In November the company sponsored a major conference of NGOs and governments to develop a 30 - year plan to encourage cocoa growers in Africa to plant different crops to restore nutrients to degraded soil and bring a year - round income .
This was background to the announcement in April that the Rainforest Alliance and at least five other global certification bodies will be asked to make sure all cocoa beans bought by Mars meet standards such as a minimum wages for farmers , conserving water and biodiversity - friendly pest management .
Unfortunately , the EC - crowd is as likely to whinge over mapping the cacao tree genome because it allows GM chocolate which they probably fear will turn their toenails curly .
And they ’d ignore the 3rd World farmers who might earn a safe , reliable living as a result .
SAN FRANCISCO 
These days , every skin lotion and dish detergent on store shelves gloats about how green it is .
How do shoppers know which are good for them and good for the earth ?
It was a similar question that hit Dara O’Rourke , a professor of environmental and labor policy at the University of California , Berkeley , one morning when he was applying sunscreen to his young daughter ’s face .
He realized he did not know what was in the lotion .
He went to his office and quickly discovered that it contained a carcinogen activated by sunlight .
It also contained an endocrine disruptor and two skin irritants .
He also discovered that her soap included a kind of dioxane , a carcinogen , and then found that one of her brand - name toys was made with lead .
And in looking for the answer , he hatched the idea for a company that used his esoteric research on supply chain management .
“ All I do is study this , and I know nothing about the products I ’m bringing into our house and putting in , on and around our family , ” Mr. O’Rourke said .
But when he wanted to find that information , he could .
Most consumers would struggle to do so .
One of the advantages of marine or nautical archeology is that , in many instances , catastrophic events send a ship or its cargo to the bottom , freezing a moment in time .
A catastrophe that has helped nautical archeologists was the earthquake that destroyed part of the city of Port Royal , Jamaica .
Once known as the " Wickedest City on Earth " for its sheer concentration of pirates , prostitutes and rum , Port Royal is now famous for another reason : " It is the only sunk city in the New World , " according to Donny L. Hamilton .
Port Royal began its watery journey to the Academy Awards of nautical archeology on the morning of June 7 , 1692 , when , in a matter of minutes , a massive earthquake sent nearly 33 acres of the city -- buildings , streets , houses , and their contents and occupants -- careening into Kingston Harbor .
Today , that underwater metropolis encompasses roughly 13 acres , at depths ranging from a few inches to 40 feet .
In 1981 , the Nautical Archaeology Program of Texas A&M University , in cooperation with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology ( INA ) and the Jamaica National Heritage Trust ( JNHT ) , began underwater archaeological investigations of the submerged portion of the 17th - century town of Port Royal , Jamaica .
Present evidence indicates that while the areas of Port Royal that lay along the edge of the harbor slid and jumbled as they sank , destroying most of the archaeological context , the area investigated by TAMU / INA , located some distance from the harbor , sank vertically , with minimal horizontal disturbance .
In contrast to many archaeological sites , the investigation of Port Royal yielded much more than simply trash and discarded items .
An unusually large amount of perishable , organic artifacts were recovered , preserved in the oxygen - depleted underwater environment .
Together with the vast treasury of complimentary historical documents , the underwater excavations of Port Royal have allowed for a detailed reconstruction of everyday life in an English colonial port city of the late 17th century .
The release of Windows 7 is finally in sight .
Microsoft said earlier this week that the new OS will be on store shelves on October 22 , and to expect an RTM date of sometime in the second half of July .
From beta to release candidate , Windows 7 moved from build 7000 series to 7100 series .
Now information from unofficial channels indicate that the software development team is now working on builds in the 7200 series , though it ’s unknown if there ’s any significance behind the number bump .
Build 7201 is now available through unofficial sources , such as BitTorrent networks , in both 32 - and 64 - bit flavors and carries a build tag of “ 6.1.7201.0.winmain win7ids.090601-1516 . ”
Microsoft has said that the build 7100 that is still publically distributed is feature complete , so do n’t expect significant changes in the 7201 release other than better driver support and slight tweaks .
Here are the key points of the project , distilled into a short video .
Seeing the thing in motion really is more exciting than screenshots .
I know in the video I claimed it was released as source and a screensaver , but that step has been delayed and I ’m to lazy to re-cut the video .
Soon .
Note that the stuttering apparent in the video is not from the program itself .
It was running at 200 - 300 fps with no slowdowns when I made this video .
The stuttering either happened during video capture or during the encoding process , which I was obliged to do twice .
( Cheapo Windows Movie Maker does n’t support multiple audio tracks , so to get the typing sound and the music in there together I had to encode the entire movie with just the typing , then re-import that movie and add the music .
There were probably better ways to have solved this , but all of them would have taken longer and I ’d already spent more time on this than I ’d intended .
The story of the cool cam is one many engineers ( and by extension , programmers ) need to take to heart , that marketing does not always deserve the scorn we give it , and that a little polish in presentation can go a long way to covering up the lack of polish in everything else .
I applied that lesson to great effect here .
The animated camera does a great job of showing off the cool stuff and hiding the rough edges .
The debate over economic policy has taken a predictable yet ominous turn : the crisis seems to be easing , and a chorus of critics is already demanding that the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration abandon their rescue efforts .
For those who know their history , it ’s déjà vu all over again  literally .
For this is the third time in history that a major economy has found itself in a liquidity trap , a situation in which interest - rate cuts , the conventional way to perk up the economy , have reached their limit .
When this happens , unconventional measures are the only way to fight recession .
Yet such unconventional measures make the conventionally minded uncomfortable , and they keep pushing for a return to normalcy .
In previous liquidity - trap episodes , policy makers gave in to these pressures far too soon , plunging the economy back into crisis .
And if the critics have their way , we ’ll do the same thing this time .
The first example of policy in a liquidity trap comes from the 1930s .
The U.S. economy grew rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , helped along by New Deal policies .
America , however , remained well short of full employment .

Last month , a French magazine called Amusement announced that it had become the “ first - ever magazine connected to the Internet ” — linking a page in its magazine to the Web using RFID ( “ radio - frequency identification ” ) technology .
The process , however , was something out of a James Bond film — readers were instructed to bring the page near a specially - designed “ RFID interrogator , ” which was plugged into their computer ’s USB port .
As we explained it : “ The RFID - tagged page has a unique ID number , which is then scanned by the device , unlocking exclusive online content — in this case , games , videos and assorted digital applications . ”
In other words , a pain in the ass for non-nerds .
Now comes the word that simpler print - to - Web technology — big in Japan — may be coming to U.S. magazines sooner than previously thought .
According to a post on PBS ’s Media Shift blog , QR codes — two - dimensional codes ( like the one used as a Pet Shop Boys album cover , above right ) embedded in print , scanned by Web - enabled camera phones — are starting to appear in European magazines .
Once scanned , the phone ’s Web browser is pointed to a site with , presumably , additional buying information , special offers or exclusive content .
This development would seem to have serious potential over the aforementioned French quarterly ’s complicated use of RFID .
But given my own Web - enabled phone ’s spotty coverage ( hi AT&T ! ) , the rise of URL shorteners and increasing ubiquity of texting — would n’t a dedicated ( and shortened ) URL printed in a magazine or ad do the trick ?
I accept that , during the early summer , the RPI may go negative for a month or two .
Oil prices were up above
$ 140 in May and June last year , and will this year be much lower – weighing heavily on the index .
But such " base effects " will be short - lived and very quickly reversed .
Fail and You " Listen up , friend .
We take care of the community .
We all protect each other .
You wanna set up shop in this neighborhood , you 're gonna need some protection , you know what I 'm sayin ' ?
I mean , you got a real nice business here , nice store , nice people .
It 'd be a shame if something were to happen to it .
Fire , robbery , these things happen all the time , but we can make sure they do n't - at least to you .
Let 's say 30 per cent of your daily take ?
It 's not in your best interest to say no to guys like us .
It 's bad for your health . "
Does this shakedown sound familiar ?
If you 're an iPhone developer , it should .
When a developer sells an application through the iPhone Application Store , they only see 70 per cent of the revenue .
The rest goes to Apple for “ system upkeep . ”
There 's no other way to sell iPhone apps .
Apple 's distribution channel is the only one .
Users can't buy your program from their computer then load it onto an iPhone without jailbreaking the device , which is a gamble .
If you do n't want to pay , well , let 's not go down that road .
After all , what good would a programmer be without his thumbs ?
Two Years Ago , I Thought RICO Was A Relative Of His
This 70/30 split is actually a pretty classic extortion scheme .
If you want to sell iPhone applications , you need to do it through Apple , and you need to accept these terms .
For gangsters , the first step in the racket is to make the “ clients ” fully dependent on the mob , so crossing the mob is completely out of the question .
At first , business is good .
You sell your wares , and cut 30 per cent to the bag man .
You feel only slightly uncomfortable with the whole situation , but you know that the mob has you by the balls .
You hope that they will leave you alone as long as you keep paying .
With such strong leverage , the mob can up your protection cost whenever they feel like it .
And sooner or later , they 'll feel like it .
What happens when Apple 's 30 per cent vig becomes 35 per cent ?
What about 50 per cent ?
With nothing to stop them , Apple is in a great position to bleed developers dry .
You can't take your business elsewhere , because there is no elsewhere .
Sure , there are good arguments for surrendering a big chunk of your revenue .
With the centralization of the Application Store , your program gets plenty of exposure .
You get a user - friendly distribution channel directly to the device .
You get a payment processing system .
I seem to remember another technology that solved these problems , though .
Oh , right .
It 's the internet , in like 1996 .
The internet is the ultimate distribution channel for software , but it 's unlikely that anyone will engineer the friction out of Apple 's setup , because there 's too much money to be made otherwise .
Plus , Apple has a habit for making such problems disappear , if you know what I mean .
Let Me Tell You Exactly Where To Shove Your Tricky Recursion Questions
Sticking with the tradition of being the savior that nobody asked for , Google is trying to make mobile distribution easier for developers .
If you develop an Android application , you can sell it through the Android Market under the same 70/30 split setup .
However , users can install applications on their Android phones without using the store .
Several developers have already taken advantage of this , considering that the Android Market is n't set up to take payments yet , as Google seems to have missed some of the finer points of free - market commerce .
Unfortunately , while Google asks a lot of hard programming questions to job candidates , they do n't ask how the candidate would launch a consumer electronic device .
It 's pretty obvious that they just winged it and expected a single link from the google .com homepage to generate the kind of buzz that the iPhone got .
With such a weak showing , it 's no surprise that there 's a general feeling of malaise among Android developers .
This does n't make a good case for potential iPhone refugees .
Sure , they operate in the neighborhood run by gangsters , but as a result , the neighborhood is clean , generally safe , and has a lot of customers .
Setting up shop in Google 's part of town means that you 're in the middle of a failed urban renewal .
The retail space is nice , but the storefronts are empty , and the only customers are tourists who have outdated travel guides .
So what 's a developer to do ?
Well , one option is suicide , but that may be a bit too extreme .
The real problem is the asymmetrical gravity that developers have .
More applications for Android does n't mean more customers for Android , unfortunately .
It 's the other way around :
The users hold all the cards .
As long as the customers are lining up in front of the Apple store instead of the T - Mobile store , you pretty much have to bend over and take it .
For the time being , there probably is n't too much of a business risk in agreeing to Apple 's terms .
Despite the global recession , Apple is still pulling in plenty of scratch , and the evidence that Steve Jobs is alive is the strongest since the false announcement of his heart attack by the citizen - journalism brigade .
Be that as it may , it 's still possible for them to put the screws to developers .
Earnings wo n't beat expectations forever .
A Bust - Out Is Like A License To Steal
The failing economy , however , may be the edge case that saves developers .
Organized crime is one business that 's recession - resistant .
When things start to tank , gangsters rely more on gambling and prostitution than protection rackets .
Shooting a broke guy in the knee is a net loss , because he's not going to come up with the money , and bullets are expensive nowadays .
Software shops are cutting costs left and right ( and by “ costs , ” I mean “ employees ” ) , so it 's not in Apple 's best interest to lean on them .
The next year is going to usher in the death of a lot of startups .
While Apple 's 30 per cent vig is n't likely to cause anyone to bite the dust directly , it 's not going to help any profit margins .
In the end , though , I suppose it 's better to be laid to rest in public than unceremoniously in a hole in the desert . ®

Court Rejects FBI Censorship on Terrorism Investigation
Vulgar Betrayal , touched upon both Hamas and Al Qaeda .
The Wright v. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( 02-915 ) ( D.D.C. ) ; Vincent v. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( 03 -226 ) ( D.D.C. ) ) .
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced a favorable decision by a federal court in a lawsuit against the FBI ’s efforts to censor the speech of agents seeking to expose the mishandling of a terrorism investigation in the days before 9/11 .
The investigation , known as , touched upon both Hamas and Al Qaeda .
The court ruling was handed down on May 8 , 2009 , by U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler in a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of FBI Special Agent Robert G. Wright , Jr. and retired FBI Special Agent John Vincent ( ( 02-915 ) ( D.D.C. ) ;(03 - 226 ) ( D.D.C. ) ) .
Special Agent Wright wanted to publish a book as well as complaints he made with the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General , and he wanted to respond to a media inquiry from Judith Miller , a then - reporter of The New York Times .
Wright had been censored in these efforts by the FBI .
Wright ’s former partner John Vincent , now retired from the FBI , had been similarly censored by the FBI and Department of Justice over his answers to the New York Times inquiry .
Judge Kessler excoriated the FBI ’s censorship and emphasized the public importance of the lawsuit :
“ This is a sad and discouraging tale about the determined efforts of the FBI to censor various portions of a 500 - page manuscript , written by a former long - time FBI agent , severely criticizing the FBI ’s conduct of the investigation of a money laundering scheme in which United States - based members of the Hamas terrorist organization were using non-profit organizations in this country to recruit and train terrorists and fund terrorist activities both here and abroad .
The FBI also sought to censor answers given by both Plaintiffs to a series of written questions presented to them by a New York Times reporter concerning Wright ’s allegations about the FBI ’s alleged mishandling of the investigation .
In its efforts to suppress this information , the FBI repeatedly changed its position , presented formalistic objections to release of various portions of the documents in question , admitted finally that much of the material it sought to suppress was in fact in the public domain and had been all along , and now concedes that several of the reasons it originally offered for censorship no longer have any validity .
Unfortunately , the issues of terrorism and of alleged FBI incompetence remain as timely as ever . ”
For over seven years , FBI Special Agent Wright and retired FBI Special Agent Vincent wished to exercise their First Amendment rights to expose FBI and Department of Justice bungling that shut down efforts to roll up terrorist financial networks in the United States prior to 9/11 .
Special Agent Wright is the only FBI agent prior 9/11 to have seized funds ( over $ 1.4 million ) from U.S. - based terrorists using federal civil forfeiture statutes .
“ Judicial Watch is pleased that a federal court beat back the FBI ’s illegal effort to censor criticism by its own agents .
Wright and Vincent sought to blow the whistle to help prevent other terrorist attacks like 9/11 .
We hope it is not too late for the FBI to listen to our clients , clean up its act , and better protect our nation from the Islamic terrorist threat , ” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .
SINGAPORE , June 25 ( Reuters ) - Investor Jim Rogers said on Thursday that he sees prolonged economic problems and while he did not see much worth buying , he is not shorting any assets either .
He repeated a previous comment that he is selling his U.S. dollars and that commodities were the best investment bet .
“ I have no shorts for one of the first times in my life , ” Rogers , a co-founder with George Soros of the Quantum Fund , told Reuters TV in Singapore .
“ On the other hand I do n’t see much to buy . ”
He said huge borrowing by governments , particularly in the United States and Britain , would hurt their currencies and lead to future problems , though he picked the Canadian dollar CAD= as one of the " soundest " currencies .
" I 've got out of my pounds .
I will be getting out of my ( U.S. ) dollars soon , " he said , repeating his view that commodities were the best place to be with metals having gained more than stocks this year and long - term potential for soft commodities .
“ I ’d rather be a farmer than a stockbroker for the next couple of years , ” he said .
“ No - one you went to school with became a farmer ... so we have a shortage of farmers . ”
Rogers , who lives in ethnically Chinese Singapore , co-founded the Quantum Fund in 1970 .
The fund , since closed , returned 4,200 percent in the next decade , compared with a 50 percent gain in the S&P 500 index .
“ If you ’re in London you ’re in the wrong place at the wrong time ...
You gotta move east . ” ( Writing by Neil Chatterjee ; Editing by Neil Fullick )
The case attracted national attention and gave rise to an intense debate over how much leeway school officials should have in enforcing zero - tolerance policies for drugs and violence .
Some parents were outraged by the intrusiveness of the search , while others worried about tying the hands of school officials charged with keeping their children safe .
The case also revealed a gender fault line at the court .
In an unusual interview about a pending case , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told USA Today in the spring that judging from their comments at the argument , her colleagues , all men , had failed to appreciate what Ms. Redding had endured .
“ They have never been a 13 - year - old girl , ” Justice Ginsburg said .
“ It ’s a very sensitive age for a girl .
I do n’t think that my colleagues , some of them , quite understood . ”
In the end , Justice Ginsburg ’s view of the constitutionality of the search prevailed .
But the decision did not offer particularly clear guidance to school personnel , who were told only to take account of the extent of danger of the contraband in question and whether there is good reason to think it is hidden in an intimate place .
So the upshot of the decision in a practical sense may well be to eliminate strip searches in schools .
“ A number of communities have decided that strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have banned them no matter what the facts may be , ” Justice Souter said , citing a regulation of the New York City Department of Education banning such searches in all circumstances .
von Franziska Reich
Sie leben hier seit Jahrzehnten , sie wohnen mitten unter uns .
Und irgendwie doch nicht .
Einwanderer haben es in Deutschland schwer .
Sie wohnen in eigenen Vierteln , sprechen oft die Sprache nicht und sie wissen nicht , was die Deutschen von ihnen erwarten .
Ihre Integration ist tragisch gescheitert .
Von Franziska Reich und Özlem Gezer
Es ist schwer , nicht wütend zu werden .
Man sitzt auf dem Sofa der Roma - Familie aus dem Kosovo , und der 24 - jährige Vater raucht und jammert : Kein Geld , kein Geld .
Gerade hat er die Reparatur seines riesigen Fernsehers angezahlt , der zweite läuft nebenan im Kinderzimmer , und die Tochter und die drei Söhne lächeln brav - nur der jüngste ohne verfaulte Zähne .
Man isst ein Stück Schokoladenkuchen bei der irakischen Großfamilie , und die Cousine schuftet in der Küche .
Vor wenigen
Wochen wurde sie frisch importiert als Braut für den ältesten Sohn .
Und im Wohnzimmer zeigt der Vater seine Schulhefte aus dem Integrationskurs vor , zu dem die Arbeitsagentur ihn verdonnert hat , und er kichert albern und sagt : " Nicht verstehen , was soll das " - und alle lachen .
Man trinkt einen
Tee bei der kurdischen Familie , acht Kinder , fast 30 Jahre in Deutschland .
Die Mutter sagt : " Meine Kinder gute Kinder , nicht mal rauchen " , und die zwei Söhne blicken hart gegen die Wand .
Man weiß , dass sie gestohlen haben und verletzt und geraubt .
Sie sind das , was die Polizei " Intensivtäter " nennt .
Und der eine sagt : " Ich hab hier eh keine Chance .
Ich war schon zweimal im Bau . "
Er ist 15 .
Was läuft falsch ?
Es ist schwer , nicht wütend zu werden bei dieser Suche nach Antworten auf die immer drängendere Frage : Woran scheitert die Integration in Deutschland ?
15,4 Millionen Menschen haben ihre Wurzeln in anderen Kulturen .
Und man fragt sich : Warum ist rund ein Drittel von ihnen erwerbslos ?
Was läuft so schief in diesem reichen Land , dass 44 Prozent der Migranten keinen Berufsabschluss haben ?
Dass 20 Prozent ihrer Söhne und Töchter die Schule nicht abschließen ?
Dass ein Drittel ihrer Kinder mit Sozialhilfe aufwächst ?
Warum haben fast 80 Prozent der Berliner Intensivtäter einen Migrationshintergrund ?
Was läuft hier verdammt noch mal so schief , dass eine große Gruppe an der Gesellschaft nicht teilhaben kann ?
Nicht teilhaben will ?
Nicht teilhaben darf ?
Es ist schwer , nicht wütend zu werden .
Unsinnig , darüber zu streiten , wer nun die meisten Probleme hat - die Türken oder die Russen , die Muslime oder die Religionslosen .
Unsinnig auch , immer nur auf die Metropolen zu starren - Berlin oder München oder Hamburg .
Menschen , die mit dem deutschen Alltag nicht zurechtkommen ; die verzweifeln und trotzdem so viele Kinder bekommen ; die in Ghettos leben - diese Menschen trifft man überall .
In Dortmund wie in Stuttgart wie in Villingen - Schwenningen .
Oder in Bremen , dieser linksliberalen , chronisch armen Stadt an der Weser .
Dort sehen die kaputten Viertel beschaulicher aus .
Kleiner .
Privater .
Doch die Härte hinter den Gardinen ist die gleiche .
Und Missverständnis und Wut. So viel Wut .
Eigentlich ist Sead Toska ein ruhiger Mann .
Schüchternes Lächeln . 24 Jahre alt .
Ein muslimischer Roma , der mit seinen vier Kindern , Mutter Sahira und Ehefrau Bana in der George - Albrecht - Straße im Bremer Norden wohnt .
Vor sechs Jahren sind sie aus dem Kosovo gekommen , 18 Familienmitglieder in einem abgedunkelten Kleinbus .
Seither wollen sie nichts als ein bisschen Leben .
Mit deutschen Papieren .
Mit Geld vom Sozialamt .
In aller Ruhe .
Doch immer wenn Sead Toska zum Sozialamt geht , verliert er sein schüchternes Lächeln .
Dann flippt er aus .
Streit im Amtszimmer
An diesem kalten Januarmorgen sitzt er also wieder einmal der deutschen Amtsfrau gegenüber , die für T wie Toska zuständig ist .
Er hat für den Monat nur den halben Sozialhilfesatz bekommen , weil seine Duldung verlängert werden musste .
Er sagt : " Du musst mir geben Geld .
War Silvester .
Teuer .
Nix mehr haben . "
Er streitet immer mit ihr .
Er hasst sie .
Sie sagt : " Ja , ja , Herr Toska , schon klar .
Sie wollen wieder Geld . "
Und er explodiert : " Du nicht reden so .
Du nicht behandeln mich wie Tier .
Du machen deine Arbeit ! "
Und sie sagt unendlich gedehnt : " Nicht in diesem Ton , Herr Toska " - und holt die Akte .
Diese Stimmung aus Herablassung , Ablehnung und Wut legt sich wie Blei aufs Gemüt .
So viel Streit in den Amtszimmern .
Die Schreibtische - meterhohe Festungsmauern zwischen den deutschen Beamten und den Massen an Bittstellern , von denen die meisten an diesem Morgen Ausländer sind .
Erschöpfte Sozialamtsmitarbeiter , resigniert oder genervt .
Müde Bedürftige , unverschämt oder verängstigt .
1640 Euro bekommt Sead Toska vom Amt für Soziale Dienste nach dem Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz .
Davon gehen 730 Euro an den Vermieter .
Sead Toska hat schon mal vier Monate lang gearbeitet - bei einer Leiharbeitsfirma für sechs Euro die Stunde .
" Das wenig Geld .
Und dann immer die schmeißen mich raus " , sagt er. Sead Toska wusste schon vor seiner Reise nach Deutschland , dass ihm Geld vom Sozialamt zusteht .
Er findet nur , dass es zu wenig ist .
" Über 100 Euro für Zigaretten .
Ich kann Kinder nichts kaufen .
Leben bisschen schwer " , sagt er .
Wieder ein Missverständnis
Und dann schaut er einen an mit diesem schüchternen Blick und sagt : " Mein Sohn Djekson nicht mehr Schule freitags , wegen Diebstahl oder Versicherung , ich verstehe nicht " - und man fragt nach bei der Schuldirektorin , warum der Achtjährige freitags keinen Unterricht mehr haben soll , und sie sagt : " Ach ja , wieder einmal so ein Missverständnis .
Djekson hatte ein einziges Mal am Freitag keinen Unterricht .
Da ist Elternsprechtag " - und man erklärt es dem Vater , und der lächelt und zuckt ratlos die Schultern .
Familie Toska lebt seit sechs Jahren in Deutschland - und so vieles scheint schon endgültig in die falsche Richtung gelaufen .
Wie Tausende andere Familien , die wegen eines Bürgerkriegs oder wirtschaftlicher Not ihre Heimat verließen , so sind auch sie verfangen im Dschungel von Wohlfahrtsstaat und Behörden .
Sind hier und doch nicht wirklich .
Lernen weder Sprache noch Kultur .
Lernen nur den harten Kampf um Papiere und Gelder .
Wenn man solche Familien nach ihrem Einwanderer - Schicksal befragt - so oft erlebt man ein erschreckendes Spektrum an Ahnungslosigkeit .
Keine Ahnung , warum ausgerechnet Bremen .
Keinen Schimmer , warum Duldung , Fiktionsbescheinigung oder wie auch immer die amtsdeutschen Bezeichnungen des Aufenthaltsrechts heißen .
Keinen Dunst , was Ermessen der Behörde ist - und was Gesetz .
So viele Menschen leben über Jahre hinweg in Deutschland und wissen nicht , was ihnen warum in diesem Land geschieht .
Zu fremd , zu einsam
Inzwischen stapeln sich zwar in den deutschen Behörden Faltblätter und Broschüren : erste Anlaufstellen für Flüchtlinge von Caritas oder Arbeiterwohlfahrt , Extra-Beratungsstellen beim Arbeitsamt , Informationen über Integrationskurse - so viele Telefonnummern und Adressen von Institutionen , die helfen könnten .
Doch die meisten Einwanderer , nach ihren ersten Schritten in der fremden
Welt befragt , erzählen endlose Geschichten über Schikanen der Behörden - und gnadenlose Einsamkeit .
Sie waren zu fremd , um nach dem Faltblatt zu greifen .
Zu hilflos , um eine Telefonnummer zu wählen .
Zu allein , um nach Hilfe zu fragen .
Wenn sie Glück hatten , halfen Verwandte .
Wenn sie Pech hatten , verfingen sie sich im Teufelskreis aus falschen Erwartungen und Unwissen .
Und zu viele hatten Pech .
Jahrzehntelang Pech .
So oft .
So tragisch .
Man lernt Familien kennen wie die Gencs , kurdische Libanesen , die seit 21 Jahren im Bremer Osten leben .
Nur der älteste
Sohn ist nicht hier geboren , die anderen sieben Kinder kennen kein anderes Land .
Doch über zwei Jahrzehnte hinweg hat sich ihr juristisches Schicksal nicht entschieden .
21 Jahre lang in Deutschland mit Kettenduldung - immer in Angst .
Die Kinder gehen zur Schule , die Mutter besucht einen Alphabetisierungskurs , nette Leute , die sich um ihr Leben in Deutschland bemühen .
Jetzt sollen sie abgeschoben werden .
Die Behörden glauben nicht , dass sie aus dem Libanon stammen .
Nun sollen sie in die Türkei , auch wenn keiner außer dem Vater Türkisch spricht .
Die Familie - verzweifelt .
Die Nachbarn - entsetzt .
Warum sie ?
Warum nach all den Jahren ?
Man lernt junge Männer kennen wie Ahmad Ammouri , 22 Jahre alt , in Deutschland geboren .
Für ihn hat das Unwissen Konsequenzen fürs Leben .
Die Grundschullehrer hatten den Sohn libanesischer Flüchtlinge fürs Gymnasium empfohlen .
Seine Eltern gingen zum Elternabend und bekamen ein Formular vorgelegt , auf dem sie ankreuzen sollten , welche Schule sie für Ahmad wünschten .
Sie kreuzten " Hauptschule " an .
Seine Mutter sagt heute : " Meine Kinder sagen mir , dass wir manches falsch gemacht .
Ich sage immer : Es tut mir leid .
Es tut mir schrecklich leid . "
An den Rand der Stadt verbannt
Wie viele andere deutsche Städte , so hat auch Bremen seine Ghettos säuberlich an den Rand der Stadt gedrückt .
Lüssum liegt 26 Kilometer von der schicken Fußgängerzone im Zentrum entfernt .
Viergeschossige Sozial - Wohnblöcke in vergrautem Gelb , die Balkone bepflanzt mit Wäscheleinen und Satellitenschüsseln im Dutzend .
Gleich dahinter alte Einfamilienhäuschen von deutschen Rentnern , die Vorgärten bepflanzt mit Thujen im Richteuch .
Und an den Kaffeetafeln : Feindseligkeit und Groll .
Im vergangenen Sommer wurde in viele der Häuser eingebrochen , in mancher Straße in jedes zweite .
Und so haben sich die erbosten Bürger zur Bürgerinitiative " Sicherheit in Lüssum " zusammengeschlossen - einer Bürgerwehr mit mehr als 20 Mann .
Wenn etwas passiert , startet eine Notrufwelle per SMS , und sie alle kommen zu Hilfe - ein deutsches Heer mit Knüppeln und Besen .
" Wir müssen uns selbst verteidigen .
Der Politik sind wir egal " , sagen sie .
Seit vergangenem Juli hat ein anderer Bürgerverein Vorschläge gesammelt , eine fünf Seiten lange Liste mit Wünschen von radikal bis radikal irre : " Die doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft darf es nicht geben und führt zur sofortigen Abschiebung . "
Und : " Ein Kopftuch sollte verboten werden .
Wir tragen auch kein Kreuz auf dem Kopf . "
Ein Viertel in Aufruhr .
Es hat noch nie zu den feinen Adressen Bremens gehört .
In den Mietskasernen der Lüssumer Heide , einer kleinen , schmutzigen Straße , wohnten früher Arbeiter der Bremer Werften .
Als die Werften in den 80er Jahren zu sterben begannen , zogen erst amerikanische Soldaten ein und dann wieder ab , und schließlich kamen mehr und mehr Migranten , Menschen aus mehr als 70 verschiedenen Ländern .
Sie wollten in der Nachbarschaft ihrer Verwandten leben .
Oder sie wurden von den Behörden geschickt , weil hier große und günstige Wohnungen zu vergeben waren .
Begehrte Spekulationsobjekte
Ende der Neunziger dann wurden viele der Wohnblöcke in Bremen - Nord wie auch anderswo in Deutschland an internationale Immobilien - und Hedgefonds verkauft .
Häuser mit Bewohnern , deren Miete verlässlich von Sozialamt oder Arbeitsagentur bezahlt wurde , galten als begehrte Spekulationsobjekte .
Hauptsache , irgendwie vermietet an pflegeleichte Menschen , die nicht wissen , wie man sich juristisch korrekt gegen eine kaputte Heizung oder Schimmel wehrt .
Stumme Mieter .
Die meisten : Migranten .
Heute läuft man durch die Lüssumer Heide und erlebt den tristen Alltag eines kurdischen Dorfes .
Frauen , die geblümte Stoffe für ihre Röcke und Kopftücher aus dem Kleinbus am Straßenrand kaufen .
Jungs , die ihre Nächte im Internetcafé verbringen und mittags um zwei aus ihren Zimmern muffeln .
Mädchen , die auf der Sonderschule gelandet sind , weil sie zu schlecht Deutsch sprechen .
Es ist nicht so , als würde sich die ordentliche Bürgerwelt nicht um diese Viertel kümmern .
Zwar zieht keiner , der den Anschluss an die Gesellschaft behalten will , in solche Gebiete .
Doch spätestens , wenn es beängstigend schiefläuft , wenn der warme , gemütliche , soziale Frieden in Gefahr scheint - spätestens dann stürzt sich die deutsche Sozial - Industrie auf diese Flecken .
Eine Studie der Bertelsmann - Stiftung hat ergeben : 16 Milliarden Euro jährlich gehen dem Staat schon heute durch mangelnde Integration verloren .
Welche Kosten auf Deutschland zukommen , wenn auch die nächste Generation nicht ankommt , vermag keiner vorauszusehen .
In mancher deutschen Großstadt stammen zwei Drittel der unter Fünfjährigen aus Migrantenfamilien , in einigen Vierteln mehr als 80 Prozent .
Was , wenn auch die Jüngsten im Nirgendwo der Gesellschaft landen ?
Ratlosigkeit im Helferlager
Und so stürzt sich also eine Armada an Familienhelfern , Streetworkern , Sozialpädagogen , Bewerbungshelfern , Bewährungshelfern , Sprachlehrern , Jobvermittlern , Psychologen , Konfliktschlichtern , Jugendgerichtshelfern und Kontaktpolizisten auf die Familien , die es über Jahre hinweg nicht schaffen , sich in Deutschland ein eigenständiges Leben aufzubauen .
Blauhelme im Brennpunkt .
Alireza Mohamadzadeh , ein ehemaliger freiwilliger Jugendhelfer in Bremen , sagt : " Manche Stadtteile sehen aus wie ein Krankenhaus .
Es gibt mehr Sozialarbeiter als Bewohner .
Man vermittelt den Leuten das Gefühl : Ihr seid krank .
Um euch muss man sich kümmern . "
Krisenintervention , Tag für Tag , um zumindest denen zu helfen , die vielleicht doch noch zu retten sind .
Eine Sozialpädagogin , seit vielen Jahren in einer Jugendeinrichtung in Bremen - Nord , sagt : " Manchmal werde ich zu einer Konferenz gerufen , um über einen einzigen schwierigen Jugendlichen zu sprechen .
Da sitzen dann 20 Personen im Konferenzraum , alles , was man sich an professionellem Hilfspersonal vorstellen kann , und alle sagen : Keine Ahnung .
Wir wissen auch nicht weiter . "
Heerschar der Ratlosigkeit .
Wie so viele , die man in Bremen - Nord trifft , möchte auch diese Sozialpädagogin ihren Namen nicht nennen .
Polizisten , Sozialarbeiter , Lehrer , Wohnungsbaugesellschaften - sie alle wollen nicht erkennbar sein , wenn Bremen in schlechtem Licht erscheint .
Außerdem wurde vergangenes Jahr der Leiter eines Jugendfreizeitheimes von einer Gang verprügelt , nachdem er öffentlich gesagt hatte , seine Jungs seien gar nicht so hart , die hätten manchmal sogar Angst vor Hunden .
Es braucht hier nicht viel , um das Maul gestopft zu bekommen .
" Die Gesellschaft scheitert "
" Immer wieder hofft man bei dem ein oder anderen , dass man ihn vielleicht doch ein bisschen in die deutsche Gesellschaft integriert .
Und dann kommt er aus den Sommerferien zurück und hat eine importierte Braut dabei .
Wir scheitern .
Die Gesellschaft scheitert " , sagt die Sozialpädagogin .
Und in welches Deutschland soll sie die Jugendlichen überhaupt integrieren ?
In das Deutschland des Ghettos ?
Ein Kulturverein am Freitagmittag , Fußgängerzone in Bremen - Nord , Blumenthal .
Die Fenster sind zugeklebt mit bunter Tapete .
Tag für Tag hängen hier die jungen Männer des Viertels in den Sesseln und Sofas , spielen Karten , trinken Tee - und machen auf coolen Gangster .
An diesem Freitagmittag ist es Cemil , der den Wortführer der 20 Jungs gibt .
Ein schmaler Mann Mitte 30 .
Streicht sich wieder und wieder über den rasierten Schädel und redet und flucht , und schließlich brüllt er : " Was wollen die von mir !
Ich spreche Deutsch , ich esse Deutsch , ich denke Deutsch , und trotzdem behandeln die mich wie Dreck ! "
Er hat gerade seine drei Kinder aus dem Kindergarten geholt - " für immer .
Die gehen da nie wieder hin " , wie er sagt .
Er ist ausgerastet , weil die Erzieherin seinen Sohn beschuldigt hat , das Klofenster kaputt gemacht zu haben .
Sie hat Cemil mit der Polizei gedroht , und er hat gebrüllt : " Die Bullen , bitte schön , machen Sie doch ! "
Sie hat ihm Hausverbot erteilt .
Wie auch das Sozialamt .
Wie auch die Ausländerbehörde .
" Die Deutschen müssen aufpassen .
Sonst ist Krieg ! " , brüllt Cemil .
Die anderen nicken , jemand ruft : " Der Aufstand in Frankreich war geil !
Auch wir werden uns wehren ! "
Dumpfe Gedanken
Man fühlt sich unwohl auf dem riesigen Sofa in dem riesigen Raum .
Jeder dieser wütenden jungen Männer erzählt Geschichten über die Scheiß - Behörden .
Die Scheiß - Deutschen .
Die Scheiß - Verarsche in diesem Scheiß - Land .
Einer sagt : " Wenn du Mohamed heißt , kriegst du nie einen Job . "
Ein anderer sagt : " Wenn die Deutschen sich nicht ändern , dann gehen wir .
Dann ist hier nichts mehr übrig . "
Und man denkt plötzlich : Dann geht doch !
Das wäre billiger !
- und erschrickt zugleich über diesen dumpfen Gedanken .
Viele dieser Teestuben - Jungs sind hier geboren .
Manche haben sogar Abitur .
Sie alle beherrschen die deutsche Sprache perfekt .
Diese Jungs sind die Söhne Deutschlands .
Mehr noch : Sie sind viele .
Sie sind die Zukunft - zumindest demografisch .
Doch nicht ein einziger unter ihnen , der sich hier zu Hause fühlte .
Nicht einer , der sich irgendwo zu Hause fühlte .
Diese Jungs sind wie Fische , die aus dem Aquarium gefallen sind .
" Es ist die Hölle , wenn so viele Ausländer auf einem Haufen leben " , sagt Ali* an diesem Freitagmittag im Kulturver - ein .
Er ist der sechste Sohn einer 14 - köpfigen Familie aus dem Libanon .
" Wir wollen ja selbst nicht , dass unsere Kinder in diesem Kanakenviertel aufwachsen .
Zu viel Müll .
Zu viel Kriminalität .
Die Deutschen müssen die Ausländer auf alle Stadtteile verteilen .
Sonst kannst du es vergessen . "
Harte Strafen oder Pädagogik ?
So viele seiner Freunde haben schon Dutzende Male mit der Polizei zu tun gehabt .
Auch er .
Sie waren noch Kinder , als der Ärger begann .
Als Kontaktpolizisten in ihre Familie kamen und " normenverdeutlichende Gespräche " führten - sie klauten weiter .
Als sich die Staatsanwaltschaft meldete , wieder und wieder , und Jugendgerichtshelfer und Richter ständig auf sie einredeten - sie überfielen und raubten weiter .
Manche von ihnen landeten irgendwann im Knast .
Egal .
Ali zuckt nur die Schultern und sagt : " Was sollen wir machen ?
Die Deutschen sehen uns im Supermarkt und schicken sechs Wachleute hinterher .
Ihr denkt sowieso , wir sind kriminell .
Also sind wir es auch . "
Immer wieder entflammt die Diskussion darüber :
Wie soll man umgehen mit Jungs wie Ali ?
Strengere Strafen , schnellere Urteile , Bootcamps oder Abschiebung - die Gesellschaft ist hilflos und schreit nach der Härte des Gesetzes .
In Bremen wurde jüngst Strafanzeige wegen Rechtsbeugung gegen den Jugendrichter Meinders erstattet .
Er hatte im " Römerstraßen - Prozess " drei Jugendliche aus Einwandererfamilien mit Freispruch und Bewährungsstrafe laufen lassen .
Sie hatten einen Studenten bis zur Schwerstbehinderung geprügelt .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft zürnte , Politiker tobten , Bürger schrien in Leserbriefen : Skandal !
Richter Meinders - der Schlappschwanz in Robe .
Doch wenn man ihm in seinem Amtszimmer in der Bremer Innenstadt gegenübersitzt und er von seinem Berufsalltag erzählt , so bröckelt die Empörung .
Richter Meinders ist ein nachdenklicher Mann , kein dummer .
Auch er hat erkannt , dass sich die Härte der Delikte in den vergangenen Jahren verändert hat - weniger Diebstahl , mehr Raubüberfall .
Und auch er gibt zu , dass sein Wirken an manchem Jugendlichen komplett vorbeigeht .
Doch was soll er machen ?
" Wir können doch nicht alle ins Gefängnis stecken .
Das deutsche Jugendstrafrecht hat eine starke pädagogische Ausrichtung .
Sollen wir die aufgeben ? " , fragt er . Und : " Was dann ? "
Ruf nach mehr Konsequenz
Es sind hehre Gedanken aus der humanistischen Welt der aufgeklärten Bürger , die Richter Meinders so wohlgesetzt formuliert .
Doch wohin führt es , wenn die Urteilsquote der Bremer Jugendgerichte bei 15 Prozent liegt , während im Bundesdurchschnitt immerhin 43,8 Prozent der Prozesse mit einem Urteil enden ?
Verstehen die Jugendlichen , dass auch die " Einstellung eines Verfahrens gegen Auflagen " ein Warnschuss für sie ist ?
Oder sehen sie darin einen Sieg ?
Inzwischen verlangen nicht nur die Stammtische , sondern auch unzählige bestens integrierte Migranten mehr Druck und Konsequenz .
Weniger Multikultikuscheln .
Härtere Ansagen .
Nicht nur von der Justiz , sondern von allen Institutionen der Gesellschaft .
Soziologen wie Ralph Ghadban , 1972 aus Beirut nach Deutschland gekommen .
Er sagt : " Entweder man lebt hier und hält sich an die Regeln .
Oder man geht wieder .
Man kann nicht nur das soziale Netz genießen , aber diese Gesellschaft ablehnen . "
Rechtsanwältinnen wie Gülsen Celebi , kurdische Wurzeln .
Sie sagt : " Die Deutschen haben eine Nazi - Macke .
Sie trauen sich nicht , gewalttätige Migranten zu kritisieren , weil sie Angst haben , als rechtsradikal bezeichnet zu werden . "
Frauenrechtlerinnen wie die Sozialwissenschaftlerin Necla Kelek .
Sie sagt : " Deutsche sind im Zweifelsfalle eher bereit , ihre Verfassung zu ignorieren , als sich Ausländerfeindlichkeit vorwerfen zu lassen .
Manche propagieren ein Toleranzverständnis , das einer Selbstaufgabe gleichkommt .
"
Es ist schwer , nicht wütend zu werden .
Man geht zum Arzt mit der Roma - Familie , und die Kinder laufen in die Apotheke und betteln um Bonbons .
Schließlich liegt der jüngste
Sohn nackt auf der Waage im Zimmer der Ärztin , und die Ärztin sagt : " Wir müssen das Gewicht noch mal kontrollieren .
Er ist leichter geworden " - und die Mutter sagt : " Nicht verstehen . "
Man feiert das Bayram - Fest mit der kurdischen Familie , und die Söhne starren feindselig geradeaus , allesamt berüchtigt als die härtesten Jungs vom Bremer Norden , und der Vater sagt : " Meine Frau bringt Kinder auf Welt .
Jetzt sie sind deutsche Staatsbürger , und deutsche Staat muss kümmern " - und lacht , als hätte er einen guten Witz gemacht .
Es ist schwer , nicht wütend zu werden .
Es ist unmöglich .
First , listen to the Equal Tempered tuning used to play a scale .
This is the scale you will hear on a properly tuned piano .
Now , listen to one of the many Chinese tunings used to play a similar scale .
Unless you have perfect pitch , you might not be able to tell the difference without a better musical context .
Later on in this discussion , you will be given an opportunity to hear identical melodies played in Equal Tempered and Chinese 12 Lyu tunings .
( By " tuning " I mean a rule that one uses to determine how to tune the strings of an instrument such as a harp so that it will play the frequencies that it is supposed to play . )
Because of the notes coming in a musical sequence , and because frequently several notes are played at the same time , you will be better able to hear the differences among the various tunings .
Before we can talk about the Chinese musical scales , it may be helpful to review some things about our own music and what we consider to be harmonious .
The original Chinese musical theory was probably developed by making rules for the lengths of a set of bamboo tubes that were made to be blown , perhaps in the way that people now blow over the ends of bottles to make a musical note .
It will be easier to explain things in terms of stringed instruments .
Let 's start with a long narrow piece of wood that is over a meter long .
At the left end ( unshown ) we will put tuning pegs , and at the right end we will put a resonating chamber .
But for right now we are just concerned with what will be analogous to the long neck of a guitar with its frets .
The vibrating part of our strings will be 100 cm. long .
( Click the above image to hear the open string play . )
Or click here .
The easiest way to get harmonious singing is for everyone to sing the same note .
But people sing in different registers , some high and some low .
We say that they are singing the same note , but actually the frequencies they sing are found by doubling some fundamental frequency , doubling it again , and so on .
We say that these people are singing an octave , or octaves , apart .
Let 's put a metal fret at the midpoint of the actively vibrating part of our string .
If you halve the length of a string ( and do n't change its tension ) , then you double its frequency .
( Click the fretboard image to hear the fundamental frequency and the frequency an octave higher . )
Or click here .
If we were actually to build this instrument , we could provide several strings .
We could set them all to A=440 , stop one string with our finger at the middle fret , and play that one and an unstopped string together .
We would hear frequencies of 440 hertz and 880 hertz together .
We could even add another fret a quarter of the way from the right end , giving us 1760 hertz .
( Click the keyboard image to hear the fundamental frequency , the frequency an octave higher , and the frequency two octaves higher . )
Or click here .
If we multiply the fundamental frequency ( in this case 440 hertz ) by an even number we will find that the high frequency waves fit exactly within the envelope created by the fundamental frequency .
To human being , and apparently to many of our animal friends , such sounds are more pleasant .
To experience a counter - example , try striking two adjacent keys on a piano , or playing two adjacent holes on a harmonica .
Or , try listening to this recording of two guitar strings tuned so as to produce an unpleasant interaction .
An unpleasant chord .
When two sound waves interfere , part of the time they augment each other , but part of the time one sound wave is trying to do the opposite of the other sound wave .
The result is that the sound you hear comes and goes very rapidly .
You will hear a kind of " wah , wah , wah , wah , wah " as a result .
If you have a piano available , you can try various combinations for yourself .
Playing four notes together , A , A an octave higher , F , and F an octave higher may produce some interesting results .
You can also listen to a " wav " file below .
This example gives the high F first , to demonstrate the highest note that is actually played in the second part .
When the second part comes on , you may be able to hear two interesting things .
There is a " wah - wah " fluctuation that occurs about every half second , and has a low , buzzy quality .
There is also a high frequency tone , an octave higher than the single reference tone at the beginning of the recording that has a pronounced warble .
Hear the high " ghost " instrument .
In the graph drawn below , the grayed - in areas are the parts where the two sound waves interfere .
You would hear the sound " drop out " at this point .
We found out by experiment that halving the length of a string doubles its frequency .
The general relationship is given by the equation :
L1/L2 = F2/F1 so F2= ( L1/L2 ) * F1 .
100/50 = F2/440 so F2=( 100/50 ) *440=2*440=880
We could divide the string into thirds , too :
100/66.66...6=F2/440 so F2=( 100/66.66...6 ) *440 =( ( 100*3 ) / ( 2*100 ) ) *440=3*220=660
In this scale , 660 hertz is E. ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
4/3 yields a D . The string length is about 75 cm. and the frequency is 586.6..6 hertz .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or clickHERE
6/5 produces a string length of 83 1/3 cm. and a frequency of 528 hertz .
That is a C .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
So let 's try 5 / 4 .
Following the mathematical steps shown above , that will give us a fret at the 80 cm. mark ( 20 cm. from the tuning pegs ) , and a frequency of 550 , which is C# .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
5/3 yields a string length of 60 cm. and a frequency of 733.3..3 hertz .
That 's an F# .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
The next multiple of the fundamental frequency we could try is 7 .
7/4 gives us a frequency of 770 hertz and tells us to set a fret so that we can use a string length of about 57.1 cm .
That will give us a G .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
7/5 yields about 71.43 cm and 616 hertz for an D# .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
8/5 yields yields 62.5 cm and 704 hertz .
That gives us an F .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
9 is the next multiplier , and it yields a frequency of 495 hertz and a string length of about 88.9 cm .
That 's a B .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
15 yields a string 53 1/3 cm. long and a frequency of 825 , a G# .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
16/15 yields a string 93.75 cm. long and a frequency of 469 1/3 hertz , an A# .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Now let 's hear the diatonic scale ( the one that goes " do , re , mi ... " ) in that tuning .
Click here .
If you have perfect pitch , or even just perfect relative pitch , you may have been troubled by the feeling that certain notes on various musical instruments sound out of tune .
And yet , all the musical instruments have the same frequencies .
It 's not the fault of your ears .
It 's because we play a tempered scale -- a scale that slightly detunes certain notes so that when a piece of music is transposed to another key it still sounds to us as though it is in key .
Tables at the end of this article will show differences that cause problems when transposing keys in untempered scales , and they will also show how the Chinese gamut of frequencies differs from an untempered Western scale and the tempered Western scale .
Now let 's put down frets according to the Chinese method .
This method has an ancient history , and was first written about in the Lyu Shi Chun - qiu , a text produced by the " think tank " of a late Zhou dynasty figure around 239 B.C. , and the Guan Zi , a syncretic text attributed to a very early figure , Guan Zhong , who died in 644 B.C.
The book may have been compiled in the late fourth century B.C. , but may also contain materials going back to the historical Guan Zhong 's time .
The Chinese rule is very simple : Take 2/3 of the length of the open string , and put down a fret there .
Then take 4/3 of that second length and put down a fret there .
The third step is to take 2/3 of the last length , then 4/3 , and so forth .
Let 's see how that works .
( Click the picture to hear this note play .
It is the open string , which will be set to 440 for ease of comparison , and called by the Chinese name , Huang Zhong . )
Or click here .
The first step is to put down a fret that will leave 2/3 of the whole string free to vibrate .
If the open string is tuned to 400 hertz , then stopping a fret at the 2/3 mark will provide 660 hertz .
This note is called Lin Zhong in Chinese .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
The second step is to put a fret at a point 4/3 of the stopped length of the string just determined .
That fret will provide 495 hertz .
It is called Da Cu .
The third step puts a fret at a point 2/3 of the stopped length we just created , and it provides 742.50 hertz .
( Nan Lyu )
Or click here .
Step five uses 2/3 and provides about 835.31 hertz .
( Ying Zhong ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step six uses 4/3 and provides about 626.48 hertz .
( Rui Bin ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step seven uses 4/3 and provides about 469.86 hertz .
( Da Lyu ) ( If we 'd used 2/3 , we 'd have gone an octave too high . )
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step eight uses 2/3 and provides about 704.79 hertz .
( Yi Ze ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step nine uses 4/3 and provides about 528.60 hertz .
( Jia Zhong ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step ten uses 2/3 and provides about 792.89 hertz .
( Wu Yi ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step eleven uses 4/3 and provides about 594.67 hertz .
( Zhong Lyu ) ( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
Or click here .
Step twelve uses 2/3 and provides about 892 hertz .
Note that the true octave is at 880 hertz .
Using this system would never permit derivation of the true octave .
But the method used here continually divides frequencies by two ( or multiplies string lengths by two ) to make a gamut all the notes of which fall within one octave , so it is clear that the early Chinese had a definite idea of how to define and use the octave .
The values derived in this twelfth step are not used in normal musical practice .
( Click the picture to hear this note play . )
The following is a comparison of the fret placement by the Chinese method ( the lower set of frets ) and by the Western method detailed above .
On the other hand , if a musician has an instrument like the bagpipe that is not very much like other instruments , then the only thing to do is to learn what can be done with that instrument that is musically interesting and pleasing .
And any gamut that can be produced will present a different set of possibilities and difficulties .
Traditional Chinese music uses a gamut of frequencies that are guaranteed to provide some level of discord in certain combinations that would sound more harmonious in the western musical tuning described above or even in the Equal Tempered tuning .
But sometimes people like a little discord for the sake of spice , and a piece of music that is composed with the Chinese system in mind can sound more brilliant and endearing than the same piece played in the Equal Tempered tuning -- because most notes in that system are deliberately flatted as a way to provide a compromise tuning that will tolerate transposition from one key to another .
Most of us grow up using the tempered scale which you can produce for yourself on any well - tuned piano .
But that scale is mathematically rather sophisticated .
( It involves complications involving the twelfth root of two . )
Before that scale was invented , some less sophisticated scales were produced .
Two of them are shown for comparison in the chart below .
One of the reasons for inventing mathematically defined scales was to facilitate the creation of musical instruments that permit transposing from key to key .
The advantage is that one can play in many keys without having many sets of musical instruments or constantly retuning one set of instruments .
The disadvantage is that they are all compromises .
They are all slightly out of tune and produce some degree of discord .
The Chinese system is based on the mathematical method of working back and forth by taking 3 / 2 of a base frequency , 3 / 4 of the frequency so produced , and so forth .
Once a series of 12 frequencies is produced , they use each of those 12 frequencies as the fundamental frequency for a new scale .
The result is 144 frequencies .
( It turns out that there are quite a few duplications . )
That gives the Chinese musician quite a large set of frequencies to play music with .
If the musical intervals between notes were exactly equal , then the numbers along any diagonal that rises from left to right should be the same .
But , in fact , the intervals are not equal , and the numbers along those diagonals are not always equal .
Note that the bottom line turns out not to be a true octave above the top line .
Each of the numbers calculated is somewhat higher than the octave .
A federal judge is awaiting an expert witness list from an Iraq War veteran , who filed a lawsuit against Mesa police alleging he was stabbed five times in the side by his arresting officer .
That list , which is due in U.S. District Court on Thursday , should contain a number of experts Keith LaVoie hopes will support his claims that on Jan. 25 , 2007 he was stabbed multiple times by Officer Russell Haynes .
The officer tackled LaVoie on the second floor outdoor walkway of a business complex at 1255 W. Baseline Road .
" Without cause or justification , ( LaVoie ) suffered five stab wounds resulting in a punctured lung when Defendant Haynes maliciously tackled and stabbed ( LaVoie ) , " LaVoie attorney Kelly Peralta states in court documents .
Mesa police spokesman Sgt. Ed Wessing said the department does not comment cases involving pending litigation .
However , the city officials denied the allegations in court documents .
In July 2007 , Peralta and LaVoie , who now lives in Illinois , told city officials they could settle the lawsuit for $ 225,000 .
In January 2008 they filed a federal lawsuit seeking an undisclosed amount of money to be presented at trial .
The incident began as a night of heavy drinking among LaVoie and friends that carried into the early morning .
LaVoie was later dropped off at his apartment complex .
" Keith admittedly consumed large quantities of alcohol while with his friends , " Peralta writes in court documents .
" His consumption made him somewhat disoriented and upon returning home , he unwittingly walked into the wrong apartment . "
Once inside , LaVoie called out for his roommate , but was greeted by the resident who told LaVoie he was in the wrong unit .
After spending 15 minutes to convince LaVoie he was in fact in the wrong place , LaVoie left .
While police were interviewing the resident , an officer noticed LaVoie duck down behind wall in a back yard in a neighborhood south of the apartment complex , a police report states .
When the officer asked LaVoie if he lived at the home , LaVoie ran .
In the lawsuit , LaVoie claims he was unaware who was chasing him and ran " to protect himself from what he believed to be a danger . "
After running through several back yards , LaVoie ran to the second floor balcony of a business complex , where he claims he stopped , lowered himself to one knee and showed his hands , the lawsuit states .
" Haynes unnecessarily knocked Keith to the ground , on his face , and proceeded to straddle his back , " the lawsuit states .
" At some point after detaining Keith , but before other officers arrived , Keith was stabbed by Haynes five times . "
Haynes told investigators LaVoie struggled with him and he was attempting to place him in custody when another officer arrived and saw the knife on the floor , according to police reports .
" Officer Haynes said he grabbed the knife . . . ( and ) held onto the knife while he continued to struggle with LaVoie , " according to police reports .
" It was not until he looked at it closely and then checked the sheath where he keeps his knife that he determined the knife was his . "
When other officers arrived , they found a pool of blood beneath LaVoie , who was bleeding from his right side .
Responding officers stated in their reports they saw blood and a knife on the ground near LaVoie .
No fingerprints were ever found on the knife , which Haynes admitted was his and was kept in a sheath on his boot .
When investigators examined LaVoie 's shirt they found four holes where he was injured .
Police reports note that the holes were no wider than an inch , which likely indicates he could n't have been stabbed by the widest part of the two - inch blade and therefore the knife could not have caused his injuries , police reports state .
Doctors who treated LaVoie told investigators his wounds were consistent with a puncture injury and likely not caused by a knife , according to police reports .
No internal affairs investigation was conducted following the incident , Wessing said .
Investigators found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and " exceptionally cleared " Haynes and the other officers on scene , according to police reports .
Sgt. Fabian Cota , president of the Mesa Police Association , said officers are allowed to carry personal weapons such as knives .
Such items are often used as utility - type tools , in instances such as vehicle crashes when an officer may need to cut a locked seatbelt .
Magazine advertising pages fell almost 26 percent in the first quarter , according to Publishers Information Bureau data released late Tuesday , signaling a difficult beginning to what is expected to be a dismal advertising year .
Only 15 magazines tracked by the bureau had more ad pages this quarter than they did in the period a year ago .
Those included the National Journal , up 42.1 percent to 185 pages , and Fitness , up 28 percent to 199 pages .
In a sign of just how difficult the magazine business is at the moment , the title that posted the second - biggest gain in the report was Hallmark Magazine , up 30.5 percent , to 54 pages .
It was shut down in February because of the economy .
The big publishers were hard to find among the advertising leaders .
No magazines at either Hachette Filipacchi Media or Hearst Magazines posted gains .
Time Inc. had only one , Sports Illustrated Kids , which rose about 30 percent to just under 29 pages .
Condé Nast ’s only improvement was Golf World , up 0.2 percent , to 283 pages .
In addition to Fitness , Meredith added ad pages at Family Circle , up 5.4 percent to 329 pages .
OTTAWA–Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's chief spokesman says Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. , is a " dysfunctional , " $ 30 - billion ``sinkhole " that will not get any more funding for a new research reactor .
The new , tough tone from the Conservatives comes as a respected nuclear physicist criticizes what he calls a " horribly short - sighted " government decision that effectively pulls the plug on a half - century of multi-faceted Canadian research at AECL's Chalk River laboratories .
Harper announced this week that Canada will get out of the medical isotope business when AECL 's 52 - year - old National Research Universal reactor finally gives up the ghost , likely by 2016 .
The decision has implications far beyond isotope production , physicist Dominic Ryan of McGill University 's Centre for the Physics of Materials told The Canadian Press in an interview .
Not only has the NRU provided the research base for Canada 's nuclear energy industry , it 's been a workhorse for neutron - beam research on such non-nuclear applications as analyzing booster rocket welds on the ill - fated Challenger space shuttle and certifying steel from Regina - based IPSCO Inc. , safe for bridge - building .
" Other nations are investing in research reactors , " Ryan , the president of Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering , said in an interview Thursday .
" And we 're just talking about closing the darn things down – the only one we 've got .
" And we had the first ! " Ryan added , his voice rising with incredulity .
" We were in this game ahead of everybody .
It really is annoying . "
The Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering , which represents more than 400 scientists who use neutron beam research , proposes replicating the NRU with an updated " super NRU " version of the same multi-purpose technology .
" We can .
It would be easy , " said Ryan , adding the project could take advantage of 50 years of technical upgrades and know - how .
" But basically that 's what we would like to see happen . "
Kory Teneycke , Harper 's communication director , made it emphatically clear the government has no interest in such a project .
" The government has put $ 30 billion into AECL over its history and it's been one of the largest sinkholes of government money probably in the history of the government of Canada , " Teneycke told The Canadian Press .
" So I do n't think describing it as an unmitigated success is accurate . "
Teneycke added there 's been " some pretty well - founded , sharp criticism of the history of AECL . . . .
I do n't think we 're going out on a limb to say it has been a fairly dysfunctional place . "
Last year , the Tories cancelled two ill - fated AECL medical isotope reactors at Chalk River , called MAPLES , after they went hundred of millions over budget and still failed to pass design inspections .
The MAPLES were focused on isotope production and were never designed as multi-purpose research replacements for the NRU .
" The fact is we are not going to make further investments into the MAPLE – which is the research reactor project at AECL , " said Teneycke .
As for another government - built research reactor , that too was shot down .
" I do n't think anyone is looking at giving a couple of billion dollars more to AECL at this point for a new project , " said Teneycke .
" What we 're focused on is trying to restructure AECL right now . "

Teneycke said the Chalk River decision wo n't end nuclear research in Canada , or government sponsorship of such research .
" I 'm sure there 's room for government involvement in many potential ways , but the government would have to look at that on a case - by - case basis . "
Ryan sees it differently , saying the renewed boom in nuclear research world - wide will quickly siphon off Canadian expertise .
" If we wait long enough , NRU will pop and have to be shut down and that will be the end of it .
Everyone just sort of closes the doors and walks away .
That will be a terrible thing to lose . "
Ryan is set to appear next Tuesday before the Commons natural resources committee , which is studying Chalk River and the isotope crisis .
On Thursday , the committee heard another expert echo much of Ryan 's argument about the long - term need for a research reactor at Chalk River .
John Waddington , a former director general of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission , said the new power generation reactor that AECL is currently trying to sell to Ontario , the ACR 1000 , " is also dependent on timely experimental work planned to be done in the NRU . "
Waddington said the safety of Canada 's existing reactor fleet and ``the continued development of the nuclear power business in Canada depend on having a research reactor available . . . .
" In the longterm , it means a replacement for the NRU will eventually be needed . "
Teneycke later backed away from his earlier comments , saying he ``spoke in haste and in error " and should have limited his remarks to the MAPLE reactors and not AECL as a whole .

Galileo Freitag : Was die Ackerbohne zum Klimahelden macht 43 min
By John Wilcockson
In order to challenge Denis Menchov and Danilo Di Luca for victory in this centennial Giro , Levi Leipheimer , Franco Pellizotti , Carlos Sastre , Ivan Basso and Michael Rogers have to go on the attack in the final week .
But where and when they attack is all important because in the first two weeks they have been unable to out - climb race leader Menchov or runner - up Di Luca .
So if the challengers can’t gain the time they need on this week ’s three summit finishes , at Monte Petrano on Monday , Blockhaus on Wednesday and Mount Vesuvius on Friday , what can they do ?
The short answer is : Tactics .
Basso and his Liquigas team did make a tactical move on Sunday in a bid to regain some of the three minutes by which he trails Menchov , but his opponents were too numerous and still relatively fresh when he attacked with Stefano Garzelli of Acqua & Sapone , and the chasers won the ensuing battle .
In today ’s racing world of faster speeds and radio - linked riders , it seems that traditional tactics — some may say old - fashioned tactics — have almost been forgotten .
But smart tactics can work as several winners of the Giro d’Italia can attest .
Bernard Hinault in 1980 , Stephen Roche in 1987 and Gilberto Simoni in 2003 all took the race leadership with well - thought - out attacks when their rivals were least expecting it .
History lessons
With two days to go in the 1980 Giro , Hinault was trailing Italian climber Wladimiro Panizza by a minute going into stage 20 , which went over the Stelvio , the highest mountain pass in Italy .
Up against a coalition of Italian teams , Hinault ’s chances of success seemed slim even if he managed to get clear of his rivals on the Stelvio because the climbs was followed by 85 km of downhill and flat roads before the finish in Sondrio .
Hinault ’s and his Renault team manager Cyrille Guimard ’s plan was to put their youngest rider , Jean - René Bernaudeau , into the day ’s early break and have Hinault make a solo effort on the Stelvio in an attempt to bridge to the break .
Hinault did just that and he and Bernaudeau joined forces over the summit and rode a two - man team time trial to reach the finish four minutes ahead of a six - man chase group led by Panizza .
In 1987 , the Irishman Roche went into stage 15 , a 224 km stage through the foothills of the Dolomites , with a 2:42 deficit on the race leader , his teammate and the defending champion , Roberto Visentini of Italy .
It looked like the Giro was virtually over , but two - thirds of the way through the stage , Roche made a surprise solo move on a flat road between two relatively minor climbs .
This was years before radio links , and by the time the his Carrera team boss managed to drive past the peloton and talk to his rider , Roche was halfway to bridging up to an earlier breakaway .
The Irishman refused to stop his effort and explained that he wanted to get to the break before s steep climb near the finish .
Roche made it to the front and then worked with riders shooting for the stage win and took over the pink jersey by a few seconds .
Roche ’s insubordination brought a storm of protest in the Italian press but he kept the maglia rosa to the end of the Giro after finding support from his team ’s one other non-Italian rider , Eddy Schepers of Belgium , along with the Scottish climber Robert Millar , who raced for the Panasonic team .
Visentini eventually pulled out of the race , while Millar moved up in the mountains to finish the race in second overall , 3:40 behind Roche .
A more recent example of smart tactics winning the race was Simoni ’s bold ( some said foolish ) solo move on a 2003 Giro stage similar to this Sunday ’s from Forli to Faenza .
Simoni began the 212 km stage 10 from Montecatini Terme to Faenza with a 31 - second deficit on race leader Stefano Garzelli .
There were four Cat , 2 climbs and half - a- dozen uncategorized hills on the stage , including two that the 2009 peloton faced this Sunday : the Colle Carnevale and Monte Trebbio .
Simoni broke away solo on a climb between those two peaks , and he was n’t given much hope of success because , the critics said , the climbs were too short and the distance to the finish was too far .
Well , Simoni bridged to the day ’s small breakaway group on the 6 km - long Monte Trebbio and finished the stage in third place behind Norway ’s Kurt - Asle Arvesen and Italy ’s Polo Tiralongo , 25 seconds ahead of the chase group .
That gap , plus time bonuses was enough to give Simoni the pink jersey by two seconds over Garzelli .
Simoni kept the jersey for the rest of the Giro , which he eventually won over runner - up Garzelli by seven minutes .
Monday is D - Day
It ’s said that today ’s racers are not capable of making surprise moves a success when every movement of every rider is monitored by live television and the ubiquitous team radios .
But in the third week of a grand tour when legs and minds are weary and the terrain is difficult , anything is still possible .
On Sunday ’s stage 15 , Basso did indeed try to elude the leaders like Simoni did six years ago on the same roads , but there were too many rivals willing to chase — including Di Luca ’s strongest LPR teammate Alessandro Spezialetti .
The LPR squad has been overworked for most of the Giro in defending Di Luca ’s lead for a week .
Besides Spezialetti , only his teammates Gabriele Bosisio and Jure Golcer have the legs to ride hard in the mountains , and when they have to pull the peloton — as they did for much of Saturday ’s stage — even these three folded and ended the day seven minutes back .
Menchov ’s Rabobank team appears to be even less capable of supporting their leader on major climbs .
None of them was able to help Menchov on Sunday during the Basso - Garzelli attack and only three of them have helped the Russian on the early parts of the mountain stages : the Colombian Mauricio Ardila , Dutchman Laurens Ten Dam and Russian Dmitry Kozontchuk .
So Menchov and Di Luca are likely to be left to their own devices on the latter part of this Monday ’s mountainous stage 16 , which will give their challengers a better opening — especially as the heat - wave conditions look likely to continue .
Basso and Liquigas teammate Pellizotti have a tactical advantage in that one of them can break away and the other can either bridge across or counterattack , depending on how Menchov and Di Luca reacts .
But Leipheimer , only nine seconds down on Di Luca and 43 seconds back of Menchov , is the best placed of the challengers , especially as he has at least four teammates capable of riding for him on the climbs : Lance Armstrong , Yaroslav Popovych , Jani Brajkovic and David Navarro .
Seven - hour stage ?
Monday ’s 237 km stage 16 from Pergola to Monte Petrano has four categorized climbs , including the finish up to Monte Petrano , as well as four uncategorized climbs , through the Apennines .
The highest point on the itinerary is only 4,649 feet ( 1417 meters ) , far lower than the mountain passes in the Alps or Dolomites , but the total amount of vertical climbing is a grueling 15.407 feet ( 4,696 meters ) .
The marathon length , the huge amount of climbing and the mountaintop finish potentially make this the toughest and most spectacular stage of the 2009 Giro .
In French , this is called the étape - reine ( an expression that has been mis-translated into English as the queen stage ; it simply means the dominant stage ) , and it ’s one that has all the ingredients to make it a great one .
There ’s barely a stretch of flat or straight road on the intricate , twisting course that loops around the peaks of the Apennines , in similar country to where this year ’s Tirreno - Adriatico had its toughest day of climbing .
There will be no place to hide as the stage climbs 950 feet right from the start to the Colle della Serra that peaks after just 6 km .
The subsequent undulating road has two other significant uphills at 30 km and 60 km before the first categorized one : the Cat. 2 Monte delle Cesane , which opens with 2 km of 11.4 - percent grade including an 18 - percent pitch , the steepest of the day .
The remaining 5.75 km of the Cesane has three false flats between steeper pitches of 10.4 , 8.8 and 8 percent .
The Cesane , which tops out at 81 km , has a fast descent before 30 km of flatter roads until the climbing recommences 123 km into the stage , There are five climbs in the final 114 km : the 2.3 km Rocca Leonella ( with 117 km to go ) , the 13.3 km Cat. 1 Monte Nerone ( with 70.2 km left ) , the 3.7 km Moria ( 58.5 km to go ) , the 11 km Cat. 1 Monte Catria ( 34.6 km to go ) and the 10.4 km finishing climb to Monte Petrano .
Monte Nerone has two dozen switchbacks and has a fairly even grade of 8 percent , with a steepest pitch of 12 percent near the start .
Monte Catria has a dozen switchbacks and is consistently steep , with a 10 - percent section 2 km into the climb , and a 13 - percent maximum 2 km from the summit .
As for the finish to Monte Petrano , its steepest stretch is straight out of the town of Cagli at 13 percent and has log stretches at 8 percent except for short false flats in the middle and over the final kilometer .
Should this stage be ridden in the modern way , with a process of attrition prior to a race up the climb to the finish , then Menchov and Di Luca will hold strong .
But if their challengers learn anything from history they know they will have to improvise , putting teammates in early breaks to help them later , or isolating their opponents with strong team efforts on the Nerone , Moria and Catria climbs until their leader emerges in the final hour or what could be a seven - hour stage .
Leipheimer , Sastre and Basso have all won or finished on the podium of grand tours , so they know they can expend a major effort in a long stage like this — especially as it precedes a rest day on Tuesday .
As for Pellizotti and Rogers , this is a big test of their endurance and ambition .
Should Monte Petrano simply eliminate two or three of the leaders , those left in contention have the summit finishes Wednesday and Friday , and the closing time trial next Sunday , to pull something out of the hat .
It promises to be a scintillating Monday stage and a fascinating week of racing .
And maybe smart tactics will win the race .

George Bush seems less likely to be remembered as a disastrous American president than as an ultimately insignificant one .
Despite his ambition to reshape American politics and society in the order of a Reagan or a Thatcher , Bush has presided over a period of national and economic drift that more closely resembles the forgettable reign of his father .
The main goal of the Bush presidency was to transform the American electorate by creating a durable Republican majority .
Karl Rove , the architect of Bush 's political career in Texas and Washington , has drawn an implicit analogy between his own role and that of the legendary fin- de - siècle political boss Mark Hanna , who served President William McKinley in the 1890s .
Hanna was McKinley 's political brain in the way Rove is Bush's .
McKinley was an affable , not - too - bright former congressman when Hanna helped to elect him governor of Ohio .
In 1896 , Hanna raised an unprecedented amount of money , and ran a ruthless and sophisticated campaign that got McKinley to the White House .
One could go on with this analogy .
McKinley governed negligently in the interests of big business and went to war on flimsy evidence that Spain had blown up the USS Maine .
The key to McKinley 's success was the alliance Hanna forged between wealthy industrialists like himself , who provided cash , and workers , who provided votes .
In the Bush version , the rich again provide the cash and religious conservatives provide the votes .
The wealthy have been rewarded with tax cuts , the evangelicals with hard - line conservative policies on abortion , gay rights and a school prayer .
Bush 's re-election victory last year seemed to vindicate his and Rove 's strategy of attempting to turn the country to the right .
Though it was hardly a landslide , Bush did , unlike in 2000 , win a genuine , popular endorsement of his policies .
But a year later , that re-election victory looks like an aberration , explained more by factors such as a weak Democratic opponent rather than any sea-change in American politics .
Less than a year into Bush 's second term , his approval rating has fallen to less than 40 % , which approaches the nadir for any modern president at any moment in his tenure .
This has happened at a time when the US economy , usually a reliable predicter of presidential popularity , has continued to grow robustly , oblivious to Bush 's irresponsible fiscal policies and neglect of global competitiveness issues surrounding America 's education and health care systems .
Many things have gone wrong for Bush , most notably everything that has happened in Iraq since he declared " Mission Accomplished " in the spring of 2003 , but the underlying problem is his relationship to the rightwing constituency that elected him .
Bush 's debt to his big donors and to religious conservatives has boxed him in and pitted him against the national consensus on a range of issues .
It has proven impossible for Bush to satisfy both the militant conservative base and the eternally moderate US electorate .
The president has never understood the brilliance of Ronald Reagan 's way of dealing with this conflict .
Reagan managed to appease the religious right with rhetoric , without actually forcing retrograde changes on divisive social issues .
Reagan also placated conservatives by challenging the growth of the public sector .
This is a theme Bush has soft - pedalled , preferring to allow federal spending and deficits to rise .
Whether because he is less adroit or because he truly believes what he says , Bush seems able to appease his conservative evangelical base only by surrendering to its wish - list .
He has caved in to conservatives on issues including stem - cell research , pension privatisation and the teaching of " intelligent design " in schools .
With his most recent Supreme Court nomination , Bush has given in further , creating at least the appearance that he is trying to get enough votes to remove the constitutional protection for abortion rights .
Through such choices , Bush propels his increasingly beleaguered administration further towards the right - hand margin - a place where his party cannot win future national elections .
Possessed of the notion that he had won a mandate for radical change and enshrined a new governing majority , Bush lost sight of the eternal moderation of the American electorate .
Now even rock - ribbed conservatives who face re-election next year are running away from any association with Bush because of his unpopularity .
When it comes to America 's relations with the rest of the world , the damage Bush caused may take longer to repair , but his historic influence is unlikely to be any more durable .
He will bequeath to our next president the remnants of a negligently planned entanglement in Iraq , but not any coherent American approach to foreign policy or international economics .

The marriage between President George Bush and his base is like any other - fraught with tensions and imperfections .
So much so that , to appraise his popularity with those who brung 'em to the party , one might need to think in terms of the Ford Theatre 's most infamous drama : " Other than that , Mrs Lincoln , how did you like the play ? "
Other than Bush 's " fiddle - de- dee " Scarlett O'Hara approach to deficit spending ( " I 'll think about that tomorrow " ) , an immigration policy that threatens to turn the US into a private piñata for Mexico 's president , Vicente Fox , and a fuzzy relationship with the religious right that has even Catholics lurching for the balcony ... he 's still got a full orchestra pit .
Those most willing to give him a pass on domestic issues tend to be those who think it is critical that a Republican president restore conservatives to the federal courts , or who believe that the war in Iraq is of paramount importance , or who think both .
And there still are plenty who do .
These are the folks who , though they may share everyone 's dismay that the war has dragged on at greater cost in blood and money than many expected , tend to see the war in Iraq as part of the second world war : not just a skirmish over oil or an exercise in daddy - revenge , but as a systemic approach to an enduring problem , a theatre in a wider war against a new and virulent fascism .
But his domestic policies have been a mixed bag - so that the conservative party has become divided over the central question of what it means to be a " conservative " .
Is it about protecting unborn life or keeping government out of personal decisions ?
Is it about preserving " God " in the Pledge of Allegiance or about freedom from all belief ?
Is conservatism about controlling government 's appetites or about feeding the beast in the name of national security , even at the expense of civil liberties ?
Thus , contradiction and paradox have become bedfellows in the Republican party 's sleepover for the past five years .
And much of the confusion stems from Bush 's seminal decision - with the approval of the Congress , we feel compelled to note - to invade Iraq .
It is hard to make a case for fiscal conservatism when you are underwriting a war .
It is hard to keep government small when the mandate to prevent another 9/11 results in the creation of a mammoth new bureaucracy such as the Department of Homeland Security .
Bush 's spending habits cannot be blamed entirely on the war .
To true conservatives who vote Republican because they prefer limited government and low taxes , the president spends like a day - wager on a three - day drunk .
His is the visionary perspective of a man for whom perfectionism is neither flaw nor pathology , but an achievable goal .
Combine that philosophical perspective with the money - is - no - obstacle legacy of a born - rich kid , and you see Bush in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina , no longer a mere compassionate conservative but His Majesty Comus astride his Mardi Gras float , tossing gold coins to the homeless and hungry .
Bush enjoys the further distinction of increasing spending more than his Democratic predecessor via passage of the pharmaceutical drug bill in 2003 - the largest entitlement since Medicare in 1965 .
And then there is his " No Child Left Behind " package that enhanced the federal government 's role in education more than any measure since the 1960s .
Which is to say , a large portion of Bush 's Republican base feels betrayed - even if some of their pain has been eased by recent reports of a healthy economy , new jobs , and a 20 - year low in unemployment ( 5 % as of this week ) .
The tax cuts did n't hurt , either .
Bush 's greatest failing may be his continued wooing of illegal immigrants at a time when his biggest supporters want secure borders and for whom Bush 's proposed guest - worker programme is a euphemism for amnesty .
His argument that " guests " will do the work that Americans are unwilling to do is viewed as an insult to the many citizens already waiting tables and cleaning hotel rooms , and suggests the same disconnect with working folk that plagued his father , who failed to recognise the scanner in a grocery store .
Not surprisingly , the most steadfast of his supporters are social conservatives who applaud Bush 's court appointments - surely his most lasting legacy .
By the end of his second term , Bush will have appointed more than half of the Appellate and US district judges .
He is also more than likely to fill three seats on the US Supreme Court , including Chief Justice John Roberts , Judge Samuel A Alito Jr and at least one more , possibly the multiple - niche - filling Viet Dinh , a Harvard - educated Vietnamese - American law professor and former assistant attorney general .
Only Baghdad Bob would insist that Bush is doing swimmingly at his five - year marker , but only a pessimist would deny that the night is still young .
The next three years may be enough time for Bush to reach an acceptable level of success in Iraq , which has to do more with leaving Iraqis in charge than in defeating every last insurgent / terrorist .
In the meantime , the president has accomplished much of what he promised , from arranging conservative courts to imposing trickle - down economic policies .
Those distressed by his performance must have been dozing when the curtain rose on The Bush Show , Part II .

At this point , the policy legacy of George Bush seems defined by three disparate disasters : Iraq in foreign affairs , Katrina in social welfare , and corporate influence over tax , budget and regulatory decisions .
As a short - term political consequence , we may avoid another dim- witted Bush in the White House .
But what the Bush dynasty has done to presidential campaign science - the protocols by which Americans elect presidents in the modern era - amounts to a political legacy that could haunt the republic for years to come .
We are now enduring the third generation of Bushes who have taken the playbook of the " ruthless " Kennedys and amplified it into a consistent code of amorality .
In their campaigns , the Kennedys used money , image - manipulation , old - boy networks and , when necessary , personal attacks on worthy adversaries such as Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey .
But there was also a solid foundation of knowledge and purpose undergirding John Kennedy 's sophisticated internationalism , his Medicare initiative , his late - blooming devotion to racial justice , and Robert Kennedy 's opposition to corporate and union gangsterism .
Like Truman , Roosevelt and even Lincoln , two generations of Kennedys believed that a certain amount of political chicanery was tolerable in the service of altruism .
Behind George W , there are four generations of Bushes and Walkers devoted first to using political networks to pile up and protect personal fortunes and , latterly , to using absolutely any means to gain office , not because they want to do good , but because they are what passes in America for hereditary aristocrats .
In sum , Bush stands at the apex of a pyramid of privilege whose history and social significance , given his animosity towards scholarly thought , he almost certainly does not understand .
Here is the big picture , as drawn by the Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips in American Dynasty .
Starting in 1850 , the Bushes , through alliance with the smarter Walker clan , built up a fortune based on classic robber - baron foundations : railroads , steel , oil , investment banking , armaments and materiel in the world wars .
They had ties to the richest families of the industrial age - Rockefeller , Harriman , Brookings .
Yet they never adopted the charitable , public - service ethic that developed in those families .
Starting with Senator Prescott Bush 's alliance with Eisenhower and continuing through the dogged loyalty of his son , George HW Bush , to two more gifted politicians , Presidents Nixon and Reagan , the family has developed a prime rule of advancement .
In a campaign , any accommodation , no matter how unprincipled , any attack on an opponent , no matter how false , was to be embraced if it worked .
The paradigm in its purest form was seen when the first President Bush , in 1980 , renounced a lifelong belief in abortion rights to run as Reagan 's vice - president .
His son surpassed the father 's dabbling with pork rinds and country music .
He adopted the full agenda of redneck America - on abortion , gun control , Jesus - as a matter of convenience and , most frighteningly , as a matter of belief .
Before the Bushes , American political slogans of the left and right embodied at least a grain of truth about how a presidential candidate would govern .
The elder Bush 's promise of a " kinder , gentler " America and the younger 's " compassionate conservatism " brought us the political slogan as pure disinformation .
They were asserting a claim of noblesse oblige totally foreign to their family history .
But whether Bush the father was pandering or Bush the son was praying , the underlying political trade - off was the same .
The Bushes believe in letting the hoi polloi control the social and religious restrictions flowing from Washington , so long as Wall Street gets to say what happens to the nation 's money .
The Republican party as a national institution has endorsed this trade - off .
What we do not know yet is whether a Republican party without a Bush at the top is seedy enough to keep it going .
Americans have had an ambivalent attitude toward their aristocrats .
They have also believed that dirty politics originated with populist machiavells such as Louisiana governor Huey Long and Chicago mayor Richard Daley .
The Bushes , with such minders as Rove , Cheney and Delay , have turned that historic expectation upside down .
Now our political deviance trickles down relentlessly from the top .
The next presidential election will be a national test of whether the taint of Bushian tactics outlasts what is probably the last Bush to occupy the Executive Mansion .
In 1988 , the first President Bush secured office by falsely depicting his opponent as a coddler of rapists and murderers .
In 2000 , the current President Bush nailed down the nomination by accusing John McCain of opposing breast - cancer research .
He won in 2004 with a barrage of lies about John Kerry 's war record .
With the right leadership , the US can stop the blood - letting in Iraq , regain its world standing , avert the crises in health care and social security , and even bring disaster relief to the Gulf Coast .
But that 's not simply a matter of keeping Bushes and Bushites , with their impaired civic consciences , out of the White House .
The next presidential campaign will show us whether these miscreant patricians have poisoned the well of the presidential campaign system .
If so , there is no telling what we kind of president we might get .

George Bush became " born again " when the bottom dropped out of the oil boom in Midland , Texas .
In the spring of 1984 , the town 's bank failed , fortunes crashed and overnight millionaires tumbled into life - wrecking debt .
In a desperate effort to rescue lives and restore morale , the church elders invited the evangelist Arthur Blessitt to stage a revival .
Blessitt was known as the man who had wheeled a 96lb cross of Jesus into 60 countries on six continents .
Midland residents lined the streets during the day and watched Blessitt roll his 12 ft - high cross through the boomtown gone bust .
Bush felt uncomfortable about attending the revival , but he listened to the broadcast .
On the second day , he asked a friend to arrange a meeting with the evangelist at a coffee shop .
Bush told Blessitt : " I want to talk to you about how to know Jesus Christ and how to follow him . "
The evangelist quoted Mark and John and Luke to George , who held hands with the two men , repented his sins , and proclaimed Jesus Christ as his saviour .
" It was an awesome and glorious moment , " said Blessitt .
He later wrote in his diary on April 3 1984 : " A good and powerful day - Led Vice - President Bush 's son to Jesus - George Bush Jr .!!
This is great .
Glory to God ... "
That conversion eventually led Bush to give up tobacco , alcohol and drugs at the age of 40 , illustrating the wisdom of philosopher and psychologist William James ( elder brother of the writer Henry ) , who said " the only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania " .
Ever since Bush came to Jesus , his religion has ruled his life and , as president , his policies reflect his fierce religiosity .
Within 48 hours of his first inaugural , he issued an executive order banning US government aid to international family planning groups that perform abortions or provide abortion counselling .
He also signed a bill that required that a foetus that showed signs of life following an abortion procedure be considered a person under federal law .
He later signed a law prohibiting partial - birth abortion .
The measure , which had been vetoed twice by President Clinton , was the most significant restriction on abortion rights in years .
Federal judges in Nebraska , San Francisco and New York ruled that the law was unconstitutional , but Bush did not care .
He had placated his evangelical base for his re-election .
By defining a foetus as a person , Bush had forced himself into taking a hard line against providing federal funds for embryonic stem - cell research - a decision that will hamper scientific research for decades .
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan , whose husband was dying of Alzheimer 's , urged Bush to back stem - cell studies .
Instead , he restricted federal funding to only 60 stem - cell lines , already in existence .
He felt his compromise was the perfect political , if not moral , solution .
He satisfied the religious right while giving something to moderates in his party who wanted the federal government to advance rather than hinder research into debilitating diseases .
Bush proposed several constitutional amendments to appeal to the 30 million evangelicals in the US , including a ban on same - sex marriage .
By executive fiat he allowed contractors to use religious favouritism in their hiring practices .
He also asked Congress to make it easier for federally funded groups to base their hiring decisions on a job candidate 's religion and sexual orientation .
The Rev Barry W Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , said the president had instituted " taxpayer - subsidised job discrimination " by allowing tax - payer - funded groups to hire and fire based on religious belief .
As president , Bush had crossed the constitutional line separating church and state .
Within days of taking office , he made federal funds available to faith - based groups that provided social services .
More than $ 1.1 bn was disbursed by his administration to Christian groups .
No Jews or Muslims received funds .
Over time , W's " faith - based initiative " came to look like a political pay - off to church groups to keep them voting Republican .
And it worked .
In 2004 , Bush was re-elected by 3.4 million religious conservatives , who , like him , oppose teaching evolution in schools , and insist on substituting a God - based version of " intelligent design " .
From Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt , all presidents have invoked providence and appealed to a higher power , but Bush actually sees himself as a divine messenger .
" I trust God speaks through me , " he told an Amish community in Pennsylvania .
" Without that I could not do my job . "
After 9/11 , he told Richard Land , president of the Southern Baptist Convention , " I believe God wants me to be president . "
After the World Trade Centre attacks ,
Time magazine reported that the president spoke of " being chosen by the grace of God to lead at that moment " .
With messianic zeal , Bush took the country to war in Iraq against " evil doers " and , despite the lives lost and maimed , he , unlike a growing majority of Americans , has never questioned his policy .
" Absolutely not , " he said during the presidential debates .
" It was the right decision . "

With his detumescent polls , his unpopular war and his faltering domestic policy , George Bush is very much in the sorry state that an earlier president , Harry S Truman , found himself when he left office in 1953 .
Truman 's approval rating then was 23 % , worse than Bush 's present 38 % .
Truman was in a war he saw as an extension of the war against tyranny that his predecessor , Franklin Roosevelt , had fought and that Truman had successfully concluded .
Then , too , he was engaged in consolidating FDR's New Deal , a consolidation that earned him the profound resentment of the Old Order that he and FDR had replaced , the Republicans .
Alhough Truman was viewed a failure , he is now esteemed as one of the " near - great " presidents .
He was inspired in the 1940s by high - minded ideals , as was FDR , who perceived Hitler 's threat to our civilisation perhaps even before Winston Churchill .
Truman , too , was an enemy of tyranny ; in March 1947 , he told a joint session of Congress : " I believe that it must be the policy of the US to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . "
This was called the Truman Doctrine .
Today , with minor emendations , it might be called the Bush Doctrine .
Like Truman , Bush will be adjudged a failure or a success on the outcome of his " support of free peoples " .
His foreign policy is his greatest gambit .
It is not his foreign policy , however , that explains his weakness in the polls .
At roughly 38 % , it is down from his natural approval rating of 45 - 48 % .
The erosion has been from his conservative base .
He was elected by the growing conservative disposition within America to consolidate the policies of the first epochal president since FDR - namely , Ronald Reagan .
As FDR in 1933 began the age of big government in America , Reagan in 1981 began the era of alternatives to government .
Bush came to the White House believing he would continue the Reagan regime .
He has won significant victories - for instance , tax cuts that have led to 10 straight quarters of near 4 % growth in GDP , with low unemployment and usually low inflation .
He continued the Reagan policy of free trade with his Central American Free Trade Agreement , though he has occasionally parted with free trade for political expedience .
With the successful nomination of John Roberts as chief justice of the Supreme Court , and with at least one conservative justice on the way , he has continued the conservative drift in the judiciary .
Yet his conservative base feels he has failed to keep down spending .
He has failed to champion various hot - button matters that ephemerally inflame each constituent group in the conservative amalgam : piety for the people of faith , deregulation for the economic conservatives , attention to immigration for the national security - conscious .
But these are distractions .
The main point is that Bush has to leave the presidency with a healthy economy , which he probably will , and stability and something like democratic government in Iraq , which I believe he is closer to achieving than his critics contend .
One thing is certain .
He will leave the White House with many Americans furious with him , much as Truman did .
Most of those who seethed at Truman were Republicans from the Old Order , with a few conservative Democrats along for the wrathful ride .
Those who seethe at Bush are from America 's present Old Order - to wit , Democrats , who have been steadily losing power nationwide and who now hold power mainly in the media and the universities .
They loathe this president .
They are proud of their anger .
The intensity of this anger is peculiar .
After all , Bush 's domestic policy is not that much different from Reagan 's and his foreign policy is pretty much in line with the doctrine that Truman lent his name to and which FDR would indubitably have approved .
How does one account for this dispendious wrath ?
More than principle or personal interest , politics is the domain of psychological need .
In the case of Bush , the need of a passing Old Order to have enemies .

George Bush is talking again , and I do n't have a clue what he 's saying .
It 's not that he 's mangling his syntax .
That 's par for the course .
And while it's as amusing as it is disconcerting , I usually think I know what he 's trying to say ( though I do confess to being stumped by " more and more of our imports are coming from overseas " ) .
Bush is talking about Iraq , which is always confusing for those of us who like our words and facts to match .
He 's saying he 'll " settle for nothing less than total victory " .
And I 'm wondering : what in the world is total victory ?
Does it mean large numbers of American troops will stay until Iraq is a fully functioning democracy with a vibrant economy and the political will to help spread freedom across the Middle East ?
That could take , like , 100 years .
Or does it mean that we 'll stay until we stand up enough Iraqi police officers and soldiers to claim with a straight face that they can handle their own security ?
That could mean substantial troop reductions in time to prevent total defeat in next year 's mid-term elections .
I just do n't know .
But this is a familiar feeling for me .
I think I know what something means - until I hear George Bush say it .
My trouble with Bush 's words started early .
When he was running for president in 2000 , Bush said he was a " compassionate conservative " .
I thought I understood compassion and conservatism separately , but put them together and it might as well be cold fusion , a concept that , I confess , totally eludes me .
Five years later , I 'm still trying to get my head around it .
I guess cutting income , estate and capital gains taxes is the compassionate part , since the cuts really help the rich , who did have it awfully tough during the Clinton years .
Or perhaps that 's the conservative part , because I 'm pretty sure that adding $ 2.4trn to the national debt is n't .
Neither is vastly expanding the size of government .
Bush says he 's for " fiscal restraint " .
But during his first term , federal spending increased by $ 616.4bn - not that anyone 's counting , in the wake of 9/11 .
Obviously , I 'm not looking at this right .
But even when I do n't count the vast sums spent on defence and homeland security , Bush is still the most profligate president in 30 years ; domestic spending alone is up 36 % .
OK , so maybe the Congress is to blame .
Even though Republicans control the place , they do n't seem to have got the message about " fiscal restraint " ; they passed $ 91bn more in programmes than Bush requested during his first term .
Surely Bush fought hard to slow them down , refusing to go along with their mountain of cockamamie spending measures ?
Or not , since he 's the first president since John Quincy Adams ( 1825 - 29 ) to serve an entire term without vetoing a bill .
" Uniter " is another word that gives me trouble .
Bush says he is one .
Granted , he ran a campaign aimed at dividing the country , but who can blame a guy for wanting to win ?
He decided early on that he would forget about building a broad consensus for his second term .
That kind of talk is for sissies , like John Kerry .
Bush wanted a narrow victory , 50 % plus one - and that 's what he got .
But after the election , he said he wanted to be president of all the people , even the dummies who did n't vote for him .
And he welcomed us to just change our views so we could all agree together .
That was pretty big of him .
My list of confusing words and concepts gets longer all the time .
" Competence " is on the list .
George Bush promised us he was the first MBA president and would run the White House with cold - eyed efficiency .
And it 's very reassuring to hear him say that from Iraq to New Orleans , the government is doing a " heck of a job " .
Ditto torture .
The president says the United States does n't torture .
Boy , is that a relief .
Now if only I had a new word for what I saw at Abu Ghraib .
Let 's not forget " energy policy " .
I 'm sure there 's a good reason why Bush 's friends in the oil business ran up record profits while American consumers were choking on record prices .
I wish I had Bush 's ability to tell all those voices in my head to shut up .
Maybe I need to learn his squinty - eyed stare ; it certainly seems to have had the desired effect on the press corps .
I , too , want to believe that the world is black and white , that all problems have simple solutions , and that doubts are for the weak and faint - hearted .
I , too , want to ignore complexity and laugh in the face of contradictory facts .
I , too , want to be 14 again
