Three economists decided to investigate whether using a for sale by owner ( FSBO ) web site could actually make homeowners more money compared to selling a house with a traditional real estate agent .
The answer , at least in Madison , Wisconsin , is yes .
In the Dark Ages before the light of the Internet beamed across the land , Realtors ( the term is trademarked ) were the ones who had access to the lists of properties for sale in a given location .
This information could be very difficult to collect on one 's own without flying to the desired city and driving the side streets , jotting down addresses .
But with the growth of the Internet , it 's easy to list and share information , and even Realtors are opening up their listings to public access .
In such a situation , does it still make sense to pay a six percent commission ?
If a low - stress selling experience is what you want , a Realtor is probably the way to go .
But if it 's all about the bottom line , Igal Hendel , Aviv Nevo , and Francois Ortalo - Magné argue that selling a place yourself can be more lucrative in a city with a well - used FSBO web site .
Madison , WI has such a site ( FSBOMadison.com ) and provided an excellent test case for the authors to compare FSBO results to Realtor results between 1998 and 2004 .
The study was made available yesterday ( PDF ) by the authors .
In a nutshell , the paper shows that the FSBO homes sold for an average price of $ 175,068 in Madison , while Realtor homes sold for $ 173,205 in the same period .
After commissions are removed from that figure , the FSBO folks came out a good deal ahead .
Using a Realtor 's multiple listing service ( MLS ) does shorten the time a house is on the market , though , and prevents you from having to watch strangers tramp through your home , pointing out the water stains on your woodwork .
The New York Times had a writeup on the report today , and they note that the National Association of Realtors , one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country , takes issue with these findings .
In an earlier study touted by the group , they claim that selling with a Realtor leads to a 16 percent increase in a home 's sales price .
That 's great news if you 're a seller , but not so positive if you 're a buyer — and Realtors represent both .
Combine the power of FSBO web sites with pricing information provided by sites like Zillow , and it 's getting increasingly easy for homeowners to be savvy salesmen of their own property .
The web has already put the hurt on services like travel agencies ; will the far more lucrative real estate market feel the pinch next ?
This is the Google side of your brain By Elizabeth Weise , USA TODAY
As more people find themselves spending much of the day within arm 's reach — or even pocket 's reach — of something that can tap into the Internet , search engine Google quickly is taking the place of not only a trip to the library , but also a call home to Mom , a recipe box , the phone book and neighborly advice .
Why remember ?
Google can do the brain work for you .
By Mary Altaffer , AP
In fact , it has become the key to a huge repository of trivia , the kind that once rattled around in the back of our minds .
Call it our auxiliary brain .
Kristin Beltramini , a recent college graduate , can't imagine keeping things like the capital of Turkey or how to get red wine out of the carpet in her long - term memory .
" It is amazing how often I use the search engine when I can't think of something , " says the public - relations associate at PAN Communications in Andover , Mass .
" My roommate and I do n't have arguments about trivia anymore — they usually last about as long as it takes our DSL to open up the search page . "
If we are the sum total of our knowledge and experiences , then the Internet is a collection of other people 's knowledge and experiences .
And Google — so ubiquitous that it has become its own verb — allows us to tap into that collection .
As recently as five years ago , " googol " was just a funny word that meant a really big number ( 1 followed by 100 zeroes ) .
The news in search engines was mostly about Alta Vista and Yahoo .
But it started shifting around 2002 , says Danny Sullivan , editor of SearchEngineWatch.com .
Just as a new generation of users was flooding online , Google revolutionized search with its canny ability to quickly zero in on exactly the fact we were looking for , without sorting through dozens of off - topic references .
" Google was the Marcia Brady of search , " he says .
" It was suddenly ' Google , Google , Google . '
You could almost hear Jan saying , ' What about me ? ' "
And with the growth in always - on fast broadband connections and wireless devices , Mrs. Brady herself would probably be Googling today .
Jen Singer of MommaSaid , a website for stay - at - home moms , says if it were n't for Google , her son might not think she is the world 's most intelligent person .
But by Googling answers to questions like " How do birds breathe inside eggs ? " and " Why are tires black ? " she can keep up with his questions .
Even though it has existed for nearly as long as the Web , search is one of the fastest - growing services .
Google 's searches grew 21 % in just four months this year .
In October , Google logged 2.4 billion requests , nearly half of all searches .
Googling by the numbers Total number of Internet search queries in October : 5.1 billion Percentage increase since June : 15 % Number of Google searches in October : 2.4 billion Percentage increase since June : 21 % Google share of Web searches : 47.7 % People who search on Google per month : 91 million Google 's rank among websites : No. 3
Last week 's top search term : Richard Pryor Sources : Nielsen // NetRatings ; ComScore Media Metrix ; Google Some of that represents the outsourcing of our personal fact - collecting functions .
In the midst of packing for her family 's move from New Jersey to Las Vegas , marketer Cynthia Mun had a revelation : " I was going through my files and I thought , ' Why do I need this stuff anymore ?
If I need something , I 'll just Google it . ' "
She and her husband were in the process of turning a decade or so's worth of clippings , files and reports into packing material when their overheated shredder gave up the ghost .
Shredders are n't the only things that overheat .
James
Olds , a professor of computational neuroscience at George Mason University in Virginia , says he often feels his " brain would fry " if he had to keep one more fact in it .
To him , Google is a way to " off- load " everything he does n't have to keep front and center in his brain for work .
The process of memory
Do these experiences mean that Google is fundamentally changing our notion of memory ?
Plato wrote : " For this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it ; they will not exercise their memories . "
He was n't talking about Google ; he was talking about writing .
Not bothering to commit trivia to memory is n't a character flaw ; it 's part of a long - ongoing process , academics say .
" Memorizing is not something that people typically have done since the invention of writing , " says Fernando Pereira , chairman of the computer and information science department at the University of Pennsylvania .
And despite Plato 's complaints , even writing did n't change the process of memory , just what we chose to remember , says Pam Frese , a professor of anthropology at The College of Wooster in Ohio .
In pre-literate societies , what was worth remembering might be complex information about who can marry whom , or the history of long - term trading relationships , she says .
Today , " the emphasis on what kinds of knowledge need to be remembered has shifted . "
Even such veteran memorizers as physicians use Google .
" It 's a little embarrassing , coming from a really rigorous academic program , " says Eric Swagel , assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of California - San Francisco .
But often , he says , a Google search is far faster than plowing through PubMed , the authoritative medical literature database .
Recently , a colleague told Swagel the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend that adults get the whooping cough vaccine because the immunity from childhood vaccinations wanes .
But the thought of going on PubMed was daunting .
" If you plugged in ' pertussis booster in adults , ' you 'd get a hellacious collection of articles " — none of which would have told them the news .
Instead the doctors typed the same phrase into Google and got the CDC 's press release and a news article with a quick overview — maybe not at profound depth , but enough that they understood current medical thinking .
Being able to Google down any fact is a point of pride to many .
David Becker , president of Philippe Becker Design in San Francisco , says sleuthing out a prospective client 's e-mail address or a hidden fact about a company is " almost like a game .
It 's a haystack and there 's a needle out there . "
In fact , he has always thought there should be a kind of Google Olympics to see who can find a craftily hidden piece of information the fastest .
Giving up on memorizing state capitals is one thing .
But Google has definitely had an effect on students , says Jeffrey Schwartz , a professor of the history of science at the University of Pittsburgh .
" They 're worse at spelling , " he says , because Google is life 's spell checker .
Type in consious and Google pops back with " Did you mean : conscious . "
While the lack of a question mark might drive grammarians crazy , the ability to blindly misspell and get back a correct answer is a boon to the alphabet - impaired .
Truth and consequences
But as in all things , beware gifts from strangers .
Google 's spell check is based on occurrences of all the words it finds on the Internet .
And Noah Webster is n't the one writing them .
As JJ Jacobson , a research librarian at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , notes , " The problem is that other people can't spell , either . "
So if enough people think equipment is spelled " equiptment " ( more than 1,110,000 sites , according to Google ) , the unwary could be lulled into a false sense of security .
Then there 's Wikipedia .
The online free encyclopedia is written collectively by Internet users and can be modified by those who feel they have better information .
It 's so frequently used that Wikipedia articles tend to show up at the top of many Google searches .
But , as recently became obvious , the veracity of the information depends on who has done the posting .
In a widely publicized case , false and malicious information found its way into the online biography of former USA TODAY editorial page editor John Seigenthaler .
( Related item : Author apologizes for fake Wikipedia biography )
And even when malicious intent is n't the problem , mastery of a subject can be , says Jacobson .
" The opinions that get heard are from people who have a lot of time to create websites , not necessarily the people with the best information . "
Search - engine ' optimization '
Does our increasing dependence on Google pose a danger ?
John Rooney , professor of psychology at La Salle University in Philadelphia , worries .
" The knowledge that we have ' in our heads ' is much more than factual information .
It provides us with perspective on ourselves and our relationship to our physical and social environment . "
Up until now , " society 's intelligentsia has been the most intellectual .
In the next generation , it will be those best at search - engine optimization , " says Fern Reiss , the chief executive of a Newton , Mass . - based media company .
But even the most inveterate Googler realizes that it's not appropriate for every question , as physician Jennifer Lee found out in the happiest of all possible ways .
One evening this fall her courtship with Jan Liphardt , a physics professor at Berkeley , took a turn for the permanent when he popped the question .
When the reality began to sink in , she wondered aloud , " So I guess we 're engaged .
What are we supposed to do ? "
Liphardt , who has been known to look up geological terms on his cellphone from mountain peaks , did what any red - blooded man who just got the woman he loves to agree to marry him would do .
He said , " Let 's Google it ! " and started for his Treo to search for " engagement rituals . "
Fortunately , he reconsidered in time and returned to the side of his new fiancée without touching an electronic device .
The wedding is set for June 3 .

During the years my wife and I were living in apartments — in San Francisco , Vancouver , and Paris — we always looked for units that had their own washer and dryer .
We had both spent enough time using laundromats and shared communal laundry rooms to recognize that there is a positive correlation between convenience of laundry facilities and marital bliss .
Even though such apartments were often harder to find and more expensive , we knew the extra effort was worth it .
Once when we were looking for a place , we came across an otherwise suitable apartment that included a small extra room with hookups for a washing machine , but no space for a dryer — nor any way to vent one .
That sounded to me like a problem that ought to have a technological solution , so I began searching the web .
Sure enough , I found a class of machines that used a single chamber for both washing and drying — put clothes in dirty , push a button , wait an hour or two , and take them out clean and dry .
That by itself was interesting , but what really got my attention was the fact that these devices could dry clothes without any sort of vent .
I had always assumed that hot , moist , linty air has to come out of a clothes dryer one way or another — it seemed like one of those cosmic truths you just could n’t get around .
But you can get around it , and surprisingly enough , one way to do so is to use water to dry your clothes .
Small Change
I first saw one of these machines when I went over to a friend ’s apartment in San Francisco and saw one of the combo washer / dryer machines in the corner humming merrily along .
After it washed his clothes , a different light came on and it started drying them .
It did n’t give off any heat , which was actually slightly disappointing because that room was a bit chilly .
He said it worked extremely well , the only minor drawback being that it had a relatively small capacity .
According to the sticker on top of the machine , it was expected to consume about US $ 12 worth of electricity in a year — or about as much as a typical San Franciscan spends on coin-operated washers and dryers in a month .
But it was n’t the compactness or energy efficiency of this machine that intrigued me , it was the way it got the clothes dry .
Ordinary dryers suck in cool , dry air from the room , heat it , blow it through the clothes , and then discharge the damp , hot air outside through a vent .
This dryer , on the other hand , runs the exhaust through a heat - exchange system to cool it .
Cold water flows through the heat exchanger , absorbing heat from the air .
As the air cools , the moisture in it condenses and runs down the drain ( along with the used cooling water ) ; the dry air is then heated again , sent back through the clothes , and the cycle continues .
The upshot of this is that drying your clothes with a ventless dryer requires a few extra gallons of water , but eliminates the need for a vent and keeps your laundry room from overheating .
Years later , we moved into an apartment in Paris that had space in the kitchen for a washer , but nowhere to put a dryer .
No problem — combination washers and ventless dryers were commonplace there , so we bought one and installed it in all of two minutes — we pretty much just plugged it in , attached the input and output hoses , and slid it into place .
It served us well until we moved again , and we really dug the convenience of washing and drying all at once .
Air Apparent
Not all ventless dryers ( or condenser dryers , as they are often called ) have built - in washing machines , and not all of them use water to condense the moisture from the air .
Another design — frequently seen in Europe but hard to find in North America — has heat exchangers that use cool air from the room to absorb the heat .
This means that hot ( but dry ) air is discharged into the room ; the condensed water drains away just as it does in the combination units .
It ’s easy to find ventless dryers , washer / dryer combos , and even units that can switch between vented and ventless modes .
Major brands available in North America include Equator , Haier , LG , and even Whirlpool .
And yet , although these devices do solve a problem for those in places with limited space or venting options , they have n’t achieved widespread popularity , for a combination of three reasons : higher price , lower capacity , and longer drying time compared to conventional dryers .
I hope that changes some day because — and I speak from experience — the whole notion that you can wash and dry your clothes with the push of a single button while keeping your apartment cool and dry fills me with geeky delight .
But there ’s one final frontier of laundry automation , and it ’s already on its way to a solution : folding .
A machine called FoldiMate , projected to ship in late 2019 for about US $ 1,000 , can fold shirts , blouses , pants , towels , and pillowcases as fast as you can feed them in .
That ’s extremely cool ( if pricey for what it does ) , and the manufacturer hints that in the future they may incorporate wrinkle removal and other laundry care features .
( It ca n’t fold underwear or pair socks , but I expect such capabilities are n’t too many years in the future . )
If the FoldiMate or something like it could be integrated with a washer / dryer , though , that would be just about perfect .
I remember an old Lost in Space episode in which Mrs. Robinson put the family ’s dirty clothes into a tabletop box , pressed a button , and then pulled out clean , dry , folded , and plastic - wrapped garments a few seconds later .
That ’s ultimately what I want .
Then my wife will be happy to do the laundry while I replicate dinner .

このサイトのppBlog's webRingのリストは 、BlogPeople からdocument.writeで書き出しています。というかBlogPeopleのスクリプトがそうなっているのですが。で、document.writeが、HTMLソースの最初の方にあると、document.writeによる書き出しが終わるまで、それ以降のページのレンダリング( HTMLの書き出し)はストップした状態となります。document.writeによって呼び出している外部サーバー(ここではBlogPeople)のレスポンスが速ければ、ページ描画で待たされることはありませんが、たまにはレスポンスが遅くて、ページの残りがなかなか表示されないという事態は起こりえます。このdocument.writeは、広告バナーなどでも当たり前のように使われていて、メインコンテンツの内容が知りたいのに、バナー広告がなかなか表示されず、イライラしたという経験もあるかと思います。確か、GoogleのADWordsなどでも使われているのではないでしょうか。
こういう事態を避けるには、HTMLソースの最後の方で document.write を呼び出すというのがあり、これはこれで有効ですが、そう汎用性のあるやり方ではなく、また、スクリプト( JavaScript)
がHTMLの中で、あちこちに散らばるのは美しくないです。
ここでは、document.writeの内容をとりあえず配列などに一時的に退避させといて(この間にHTMLソースの描画は進んでいきます)、ページ読み込み完了と同時に、そのストックしておいたdocument.write内容を吐き出すという方法について書いておきます。
まず、普通にdocument.writeを含んだ外部スクリプトを呼び出すやり方。これは、BlogPeopleがこうしましょう、と述べているものです。
< script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://www.blogpeople.net/display/usr/0f0d40535b5b4103.js " charset = " euc - jp " ></ script >
これの実際の中身は、次のようになっています。
document.write ( '< div class=¥'blogpeople -main¥'>' ) ; document . write ( '登録されたサイト ' ) ： ： document .write ('</div >' ) ; document.write ( '< div class=¥'blogpeople-powered - by¥' >' ) ; document . write ( '< br />< a href= ¥' ･･･¥ ' target= ¥' _blank¥ '>< img src= ¥ ' ･･･¥ ' border= ¥ ' 0¥ ' alt=¥' Powered By BlogPeople ¥ ' /></a>' ) ; document.write ( '< /div >' ) ;
ここに使われているdocument.write内容をとりあえず配列に入れておけば良いのですが、それには次のようにします。
( function ( ) { var alts = [ ] ; // document.writeの内容を入れておく配列を準備 d._write = d.write ; // オリジナルはコピーしておく d.write = function (s ) { alts.push(s ) ; } // d.writeを新たに定義 var src = " http://www.blogpeople.net/display/usr/0f0d40535b5b4103.js " ; var script = d.createElement ( ' script ' ) ; script.setAttribute(' type ' , ' text / javascript ' ) ; script.setAttribute(' charset ' , ' euc- jp ' ) ; script.setAttribute('src' , src ) ; d.getElementsByTagName( ' head ' ) [ 0].appendChild( script ) ; addEvent ( window , " load " , function ( ) { o( " _webRing " ).innerHTML = alts.join ( " " ) ; // 指定した場所に流し込む d.write = d._write ; // d.writeを元の定義に戻しておく } ) ; } ( ) ) ;
ポイントは、既存のdocument.writeを新たに、
document.write = function (s ) { alts.push(s ) ; }
と再定義している点です。ここではaltsという配列に退避させています。こうすることで、document.writeによる書き出しを待つことなく、残りのページレンダリングを進めていくことが出来ます。このスクリプトで、SafariでもIE6でもFirefoxでもきちんと動くことを確認しています。
小生のブログであるmartin.p2b.jpのwebRing と、このサイトにあるwebRing とは同じ外部スクリプトを呼び出しているのですが、比較のために、このサイトのwebRingは上記の手法で、martin'sの方は従来の方法で呼び出しています。BlogPeopleのサーバーレスポンスは素早いので、なかなか差が実感できにくいかと思いますが、このサイトのやつは、(サイドバーのHTMLソースはdocument.writeよりも後にもかかわらず)サイドバーが先に表示されて、最後にwebRingのリストが表示されるのに対して、martin'sの方は、HTMLソースの順序通り、webRingリスト→サイドバーという順序で表示されています。
ちなみに、このサイトのwebRingは、ppBlogの「ページ作成機能」を使って作成しているのですが、具体的に、どのような内容になっているのか、理解の一助のために添付しておきますね。
まぁ、こんなアプローチもありますよということで
Linux developer Hans Reiser is scheduled to start trial Monday for the alleged murder of his estranged wife , Nina Reiser , who 's been missing since September .
Now reporter Joshua Davis has the unexpected news that a witness in the case , described in past testimony as a former boyfriend of Nina , confessed to prosecutors that he murdered eight people unrelated to the case , and left a ninth for dead .
Sean Sturgeon , a one - time friend of Reiser 's , had already been a focus of the defense team 's efforts to shift suspicion off Reiser in the disappearance of his estranged wife , Nina Reiser .
Sturgeon 's alleged confession to a series of unrelated murders will likely complicate the trial , which is set to begin Monday .
" ( Deputy District Attorney ) Paul Hora indicated that the court was ordering him to divulge this information , " defense attorney Richard Tamor said last Friday .
" He also said that Sturgeon had confessed to a potential ninth murder , but that Sturgeon was n't sure if the victim was fully dead when he left him . "
" Sturgeon claims that the murders were in retaliation for his abuse as a child , " said Ramon Reiser , Hans Reiser 's father , who was briefed by the defense team over the weekend and spoke to Wired News on Sunday .
The full story is here .
Sturgeon , in an interview with Josh , adamantly denied any role in Nina Reiser 's disappearance , and his confession has n't resulted in his arrest .
So it 's not completely clear what 's going on .
But this is certainly going to throw the prosecution 's case into chaos .
Imagine if , in the middle of the O.J. trial , Kato Kaelin had suddenly announced he was a serial killer .

Micro-optimizing Python code for 3D
I enjoy optimizing code .
These days I do n't get the opportunity to do it very often , since I prefer working in high level languages now .
Which is why I have been particularly enthusiastic in optimizing the 3D math classes in Game Objects .
Whenever the subject of optimization comes up , someone inevitably regurgitates the quote " premature optimization is the root of all evil " , which they take to mean that you should not do any optimization until you have a working application and are able to profile it .
In general this is good advice - but if you know about the domain you are working in , occasionally early optimization is a good thing .
3D math for games is one of these situations .
The code is a black box which does n't need to be built upon .
Speeding it up tends to have a direct impact on the user experience ( i.e. a better frame - rate ) .
There is also limited scope for algorithmic improvements ( which should be considered first ) , so micro-optimization is justifiable in this case ( IMHO ) .
When I started looking in to optimizing my Matrix class , I compared it against another matrix class in PyEuclid , which is a quite comprehensive set of classes for 2D and 3D euclidean geometry .
When I looked at the Matrix3 implementation , I was surprised that it stored the values of the matrix as 16 attributes ( self. a , self .b etc. ) , because attribute access can be a bottle - neck for serious number crunching code .
So I suspected that the matrix multiplication in PyEuclid would be slower than the equivalent function in Game Objects , as I used a single list of 16 values , which should be faster .
But when I timed it , I found that PyEuclid was fractionally faster .
Naturally I had a look at the Matrix3. __imul__ method in PyEuclid , I noticed that It copied one of the matrices in to 16 local references , and that made it a little faster because the attribute access was done only once .
So I tried doing the same thing for the self matrix , which turned out to speed it up my almost 20 % , which made it faster than my version .
I was happy to submit the optimization back to Alex Halkner , the author of PyEuclid , but naturally I was determined to speed up my version by at least the same amount !
I used the updated Matrix__imul__ from PyEuclid ( below ) as my benchmark .
def __imul__ ( self , other ) : #assert isinstance ( other , Matrix4 ) a = self .
a b = self .
b c = self .
c d = self .
d e = self .
e f = self .
f g = self .
g h = self .
h i = self .
i j = self .
j k = self .
k l = self .
l m = self .
m n = self .
n o = self .
o p = self .
p oa = other .
a ob = other .
b oc = other .
c od = other .
d oe = other .
e of = other .
f og = other .
g oh = other .
h oi = other .
i oj = other .
j ok = other .
k ol = other .
l om = other .
m on = other .
n oo = other .
o op = other .
p self .
a = a * oa + b * oe + c * oi + d * om self .
b = a * ob + b * of + c * oj + d * on self .
c = a * oc + b * og + c * ok + d * oo self .
d = a * od + b * oh + c * ol + d * op self .
e = e * oa + f * oe + g * oi + h * om self .
f = e * ob + f * of + g * oj + h * on self .
g = e * oc + f * og + g * ok + h * oo self .
h = e * od + f * oh + g * ol + h * op self .
i = i * oa + j * oe + k * oi + l * om self .
j = i * ob + j * of + k * oj + l * on self .
k = i * oc + j * og + k * ok + l * oo self .
l = i * od + j * oh + k * ol + l * op self .
m = m * oa + n * oe + o * oi + p * om self .
n = m * ob + n * of + o * oj + p * on self .
o = m * oc + n * og + o * ok + p * oo self .
p = m * od + n * oh + o * ol + p * op return self
It may appear that the 32 assignments would slow it down , but it was faster over all because they reduce the amount of attribute access in the function .
Knowing that attribute access was the enemy , I tried the same trick with Matrix44.__imul__ in Game Objects .
My 16 values of the matrix were stored in a list called self._m , and the individual values were accessed as self ._m [ 0 ] thru self self . m[ 15 ] .
Copying these in to local references turned out to be very easy , because I could use Python 's list unpacking .
Doing this for both matrices yielded the following code .
def __imul__ ( self , rhs ) : " " " Multiplies this Matrix44 by another , called by the *= operator . " " "
m1_0 , m1_1 , m1_2 , m1_3 , m1_4 , m1_5 , m1_6 , m1_7 , m1_8 , m1_9 , m1_10 , m1_11 , m1_12 , m1_13 , m1_14 , m1_15 = self .
_m m2_0 , m2_1 , m2_2 , m2_3 , m2_4 , m2_5 , m2_6 , m2_7 , m2_8 , m2_9 , m2_10 , m2_11 , m2_12 , m2_13 , m2_14 , m2_15 = rhs .
_m self .
_m = [ m2_0 * m1_0 + m2_1 * m1_4 + m2 _2 * m1_8 + m2_3 * m1_12 , m2_0 * m1_1 + m2_1 * m1_5 + m2 _2 * m1_9 + m2_3 * m1_13 , m2_0 * m1 _2 + m2_1 * m1_6 + m2 _2 * m1_10 + m 2_3 * m1_14 , m2_0 * m1_3 + m2_1 * m1_7 + m 2 _2 * m1_11 + m2_3 * m1_15 , m2_4 * m1_0 + m2_5 * m1_4 + m2_6 * m1_8 + m2_7 * m1_12 , m2_4 * m1_1 + m2_5 * m1_5 + m2_6 * m1_9 + m2_7 * m1_13 , m2_4 * m1 _2 + m2_5 * m1_6 + m2_6 * m1_10 + m 2_7 * m1_14 , m2_4 * m1_3 + m2_5 * m1_7 + m 2_6 * m1_11 + m2_7 * m1_15 , m2_8 * m1_0 + m2_9 * m1_4 + m2_10 * m1_8 + m2_11 * m1_12 , m2_8 * m1_1 + m2_9 * m1_5 + m2_10 * m1_9 + m2_11 * m1_13 , m2_8 * m1 _2 + m2_9 * m1_6 + m2_10 * m1_10 + m2_11 * m1_14 , m2_8 * m1_3 + m2_9 * m1_7 + m2_10 * m1_11 + m2_11 * m1_15 , m2_12 * m1_0 + m2_13 * m1_4 + m2_14 * m1_8 + m2_15 * m1_12 , m2_12 * m1_1 + m2_13 * m1_5 + m2_14 * m1_9 + m2_15 * m1_13 , m2_12 * m1 _2 + m2_13 * m1_6 + m2_14 * m1_10 + m2_15 * m1_14 , m2_12 * m1_3 + m2_13 * m1_7 + m2_14 * m1_11 + m 2_15 * m1_15 ] return self
This optimized version removed all the list index operations from the function and reduced attribute access dramatically , making it considerably quicker ; it could do 60,502 matrix multiplies per second , compared to PyEuclid 's 47,594 per second .
I think this must be the quickest way to do a full matrix multiply in straight Python .
Other functions benefited from this to , transforming a Vector3 improved by about 20 % , as did other operations .
I also applied the same technique to the Vector3 class , which was worthwhile , but not quite as good an improvement as the matrix code .
These experiments have lead me to the following rules of thumb for micro-optimizing Python code , with the disclaimer that you should only micro-optimize if you know it will produce tangible benefits in the user experience !

What better time to update our list of the 25 best Batman comics and graphic novels ever published ?
The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels of All Time 26 IMAGES
A few criteria before we get started .
This list of essentials is meant to focus on Batman comics that provide a compete , standalone reading experience rather than spotlighting individual issues or long comic runs .
They do n’t have to have originally been published in graphic novel form , but they do need to be available to read in a single collected edition now .
We ’re also limiting our focus to stories where Batman himself is the star of the show .
Classics like Mad Love and Batgirl : Year
One are must - read stories set in the world of Batman , but you wo n't find them on this list .
With that out of the way , here are the 25 best and most influential Batman graphic novels of all time .
These are the comics that belong on any Bat - fan ’s shelf .
25 . Batman : Earth One
24 . Flashpoint : Batman - Knight of Vengeance
23 . Batman : The Man Who Laughs
22 . Batman : Venom
21 . Batman : A Lonely Place of Dying
19 . Batman : The Cult
18 . Batman : The Court of Owls
17 . Batman : Strange Apparitions
16 . Batman : Gothic

14 . Batman : The War of Jokes and Riddles
Geoff Johns & Gary FrankIf Batman : Year
One were written today , it would be Batman : Earth One .
It ’s a modern retelling of Batman ’s early years where he ’s not an infallible master detective who moves like a shadow -- a point driven home when , while chasing a crook over the city rooftops , his grappling gun malfunctions and he lands in a pile of trash below .
Also , instead of being best buds with Jim Gordon , he winds up socking him in the face .
The crucial element that makes this story work is the overhaul of Alfred Pennyworth ’s character .
No longer a kindly butler , Alfred is an ex-MI - 6 agent who , instead of serving him tea and tending to his wounds , beats the crap out of Bruce to teach him a lesson .
It ’s a refreshing spin on the classic dynamic that lets us appreciate how Batman would adapt to a world with more realistic limitations .
To date , Earth One has spawned one sequel , and we ’re looking forward to release of Book 3 once Geoff Johns and Gary Frank wrap up their work on Doomsday Clock .
Brian Azzarello & Eduardo RissoFlashpoint marked a critical chapter in DC ’s history , paving the way for the rebooted New 52 universe and everything else that followed .
But as it turns out , the best part of this massive crossover did n’t involve The Flash himself , but rather Batman .
In this alternate timeline , Thomas Wayne became Batman after his son was murdered in front of him .
The result is a vigilante who manages to top even Bruce Wayne in the brooding and scowling department .
Knight of Vengeance showcases a darker , meaner Gotham City that plays perfectly to Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso ’s storytelling strengths .
Though this book technically serves as a piece of a much larger crossover , it also reads perfectly well on its own .
It also features one of the most haunting endings you ’ll find in any Batman comic .
Ed Brubaker & Doug MahnkeA mad man is targeting Gotham 's elite and next on his hit list is millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne .
This is Batman 's introduction to his most nefarious villain , the Joker .
Where Alan Moore 's The Killing Joke tells the origin of the Clown Prince of Crime , The Man Who Laughs details the first tussle between Joker and Batman .
Brubaker is one of the best crime writers in comics .
He manages to bring some of that noir flair to The Man Who Laughs while maintaining the proper tone and pace for a good Batman yarn .
To my knowledge this is the only story to ever suggest that , like Bruce Wayne , the Joker had to practice to perfect his art .
And that 's ultimately what makes the Joker so frightening .
His psychosis is not chaotic , not as random as you might think .
There 's a methodology and a purposefulness to many of his actions .
Denny O’Neil & Trevor Von EdenVenom opens with one of the biggest failures in Batman 's career .
A little girl is trapped .
Drowning .
And Batman is n't strong enough to save her .
Distraught , the Dark Knight finds a new alternative to strength training -- a little pill that triples his strength .
Of course , it 's highly addictive and the always - in - control hero loses his grip , nearly assassinating Jim Gordon just to get his fix .
It 's a look at a side of Batman we rarely see .
Venom is one of those stories that is a struggle to rank .
The premise is stronger than the actual writing .
Batman fights a shark .
So , there 's that .
But there are moments , strong moments , where O'Neil tests the limits of Batman 's commitment to his crusade .
And it 's enough to make Venom one of the more memorable Batman stories ever told .
Marv Wolfman , George Perez , Jim Aparo & Tom GrummettDick Grayson and Jason Todd became Robin out of circumstance .
They did n't really choose the role , it was chosen for them .
Tim Drake is different .
He takes an active role in becoming the third Robin .
A Lonely Place of Dying is n't just an origin tale of Robin # 3 , it 's the best response to the question : " Why does Batman need Robin ?
" The answer , it turns out , is n't to keep Batman from the dark side or as some subconscious way of restoring Bruce Wayne 's lost youth .
When Batman has to consider the safety of a young sidekick , he 's more likely to think things through .
He 'll take more precautions .
He 'll be safer .
Robin , just by virtue of being at his side , keeps Batman alive a little longer .
Now , if that does n't make you want to read the only worthwhile Robin origin , you just do n't like Batman stories .
Matt WagnerA year into his crime - fighting career , Batman has only faced mobsters , thugs , and a few crazies .
Monster Men is Batman 's first encounter with anything super - human .
Hugo Strange is creating monstrous creatures , stronger than the Dark Knight and with a mindless thirst for blood .
Now , Batman must adapt to a new kind of villain .
This is the moment where Batman goes from street legend onto the path of superhero .
The best Batman books push the Caped Crusader to his limits .
This story is about Bruce Wayne learning he has limits .
Jim Starlin & Bernie WrightsonWhile it does n’t feature Bane as the villain , Batman : The Cult is easily one of the heaviest influences on The Dark Knight Rises .
Let ’s just say that the Nolan brothers know a good Batman comic when they see one .
The Cult showcases Batman at his most psychologically vulnerable .
In this story he ’s captured by Deacon Blackfire and his cultists and subjected to torture and brainwashing .
The result is an unnerving and even psychedelic Batman tale that uses Bernie Wrightson ’s gorgeous art to convey the instability of Batman ’s unraveling mind .
The Cult has proven to be a divisive story , in large part because it does n’t portray Batman as the tough , capable hero he normally is .
But his failures in The Cult only make his eventual victory that much more satisfying .
Scott Snyder & Greg CapulloScott Snyder and Greg Capullo had a tall order to fill when they took the reins of DC ’s relaunched Batman comic in 2011 .
They had to assuage the fears of those fans nervous about DC ’s New 52 reboot and somehow follow the impossible act that is writer Grant Morrison .
And somehow they succeeded in both goals .
Snyder and Capullo kicked off their run by introducing a brand new group of villains to Gotham City - the Court of Owls .
This centuries - old , shadowy organization forced Batman to confront the fact that he does n’t know his own city nearly as well as he thought .
That fueled a personal odyssey that dragged Batman through the depths of Gotham and pitted him against a new archrival from a very unexpected source .
“ The Court of Owls ” immediately established Batman as one of the best comics of the New 52 era and Snyder and Capullo as one of the most effective teams working in comics .
Steve Englehart , Len Wein , Marshall Rogers & Walt Simonson
If you have n't read Strange Apparitions , chances are you 've never heard of Bruce Wayne 's best love interest , Silver St. Cloud .
She 's smart enough to deduce Batman 's true identity and strong enough to break the Batman 's heart .
And that 's just part of the mix in this great tale from the late ' 70s featuring underappreciated lunatic Hugo Strange ( back from the dead ) and the Joker ( creating more dead ) .
Plus , as a bonus , you get to see Hugo Strange dressed as Batman .
Batman : Year
One gets a little too much credit for " reinventing Batman . "
The truth is that there were great Batman stories before Year One .
This is the best you 'll find from the pre-Year
One era that 's been collected in a TPB .
And it serves as a worthwhile introduction to Hugo Strange .
Grant Morrison & Klaus Janson
Where did Bruce Wayne go to school ?
We know about Wayne 's training to become the Batman , but in Gothic , we get a glimpse into Bruce Wayne 's life before his parents were murdered .
This ties into a series of grisly murders in Batman 's early days in the cape and cowl .
Gothic is a detective story , a horror story , and a thriller that teams Morrison with the great Klaus Janson .
Religion and Batman are n't married in comics as often as they should be .
Morrison plays it perfectly .
For those a little worried about a " Morrison head - trip , " relax .
Nothing in these pages will damage your brain … too much .
Various Knightfall is an example of a story that overcomes the shortcomings of its art and writing , which were flawed if only because of several change - ups over its publication .
The story is so essential to Batman ’s character that it was the main inspiration for The Dark Knight Rises movie , further expanding its popularity and cementing it as a classic .
In Knightfall , Bane breaks out all of Arkham Asylum ’s criminals to exhaust Batman .
Once the Caped Crusader is exhausted physically and mentally , Bane breaks his back over his knee .
Ouch .
What follows next is why the story made this list .
Batman hands over the mantle to Jean - Paul Valley , aka Azreal , who soon loses his mind and starts killing criminals .
Batman must train and rebuild himself from the ground up with help from Lady Shiva , and then he returns to Gotham to reclaim his mantle from Azreal .
The story shows why Bruce Wayne ’s morality makes him the ideal Batman .
He is uniquely suited to be the kind of hero that Gotham needs , which is made plain by juxtaposing him with the murderous Azreal .
Tom King , Mikel Janin & Clay MannPlenty of Batman comics have flashed back to the early days of Bruce Wayne ’s costumed career , but few have done it as successfully as “ The War of Jokes and Riddles .
” In this extended flashback saga , writer Tom King and artists Mikel Janin and Clay Mann explore a Batman just young and naive enough to think he’s on the verge of cleaning up Gotham City for good .
A devastating gang war between Joker and Riddler shows him just how wrong he is .
This story stands out both because it pushes Batman to the psychological brink and because it showcases so many iconic villains .
And somehow , D - List baddie Kite - Man outshines them all .
While “ The War of Jokes and Riddles ” has its place as part of King ’s larger , 100 - issue Batman run , it also stands alone as a compelling glimpse into one of the most formative periods in Batman ’s war on crime .
Sanjay Parekh and Rob Friedman storyBelieve it or not , IP intelligence technology provider Digital Envoy Inc. was spawned from two serious sweet - tooths .
Sanjay Parekh , 31 , started buying candy from Costco and reselling it to his telecom co-workers when he struck up a friendship with Rob Friedman , 38 , general counsel at the company and an Atomic Fireball enthusiast .
Soon , their friendship moved beyond candy cravings , and they were bouncing around business ideas .
Parekh made an interesting discovery when visiting the FedEx and Ikea websites in 1999 : both prompted him to enter what country he was in .
" I thought that was kind of stupid , " he recalls , and the extra step slowed down his home dial - up session .
" So I architected a solution to that problem using IP addresses . "
Friedman agreed that the technology -- which provides general information about an online user , such as the city , local demographics and type of internet connection being used , based only on the IP address -- would help businesses .
They launched Digital Envoy Inc. in 1999 , bringing along senior finance manager and co-worker Dennis Maicon , 40 .
Filing fees for corporate documents cost $ 100 , and Friedman drew up all the legal drafts .
An article on the Red Herring website about their business led to their very first client , Advertising.com ( now owned by AOL ) .
Since they worked from their homes , Friedman quips , " I negotiated that deal in my bedroom . "
They also hired an intern and Friedman 's cousin to do programming work in the beginning .
After moving into an office in 2000 , they hired three more employees .
Friedman found $ 10 chairs , and opted for modular desk setups rather than expensive cubicles .
In their newest office , they have cubicles , bought inexpensively from the office 's previous tenant .
When it comes to traveling to trade shows and to see customers , they 've also found ways to save their Norcross , Georgia , company money , using slightly out - of - the - way but much cheaper flight options .
Digital Envoy now works with many major ad networks and sites , and estimates last year sales at less than $ 10 million .
The company 's latest product , IP Inspector Fraud Analyst , allows companies to fight identity fraud by verifying user identity in real time .
They are also combating fraud with a product that analyzes whether an e-mail is really a phishing attack .
Digital Envoy continues to grow , but in many ways remains the same .
Says Parekh , " One of the philosophies we 've always had is to do more with less people . "
IT USED to be so straightforward .
A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal .
A journal editor would then remove the authors ' names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review .
Depending on the comments received , the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it .
Copyright rested with the journal publisher , and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal .
No longer .
The internet — and pressure from funding agencies , who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government - funded research by restricting access to it — is making free access to scientific results a reality .
This week , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) issued a report describing the far - reaching consequences of this .
The report , by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD , makes heavy reading for publishers who have , so far , made handsome profits .
But it goes further than that .
It signals a change in what has , until now , been a key element of scientific endeavour .
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends , in part , upon wide distribution and ready access .
It is big business .
In America , the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $ 7 billion and $ 11 billion .
The International Association of Scientific , Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specialising in these subjects .
They publish more than 1.2 m articles each year in some 16,000 journals .
This is now changing .
According to the OECD report , some 75 % of scholarly journals are now online .
Entirely new business models are emerging ; three main ones were identified by the report 's authors .
There is the so - called big deal , where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site - licensing agreements .
There is open - access publishing , typically supported by asking the author ( or his employer ) to pay for the paper to be published .
Finally , there are open - access archives , where organisations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories .
Other models exist that are hybrids of these three , such as delayed open - access , where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months , before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it .
All this could change the traditional form of the peer - review process , at least for the publication of papers .
The process is organised by the publisher but conducted , for free , by scholars .
The advantages afforded by the internet mean that primary data is becoming available freely online .
Indeed , quite often the online paper has a direct link to it .
This means that reported findings are more readily replicable and checkable by other teams of researchers .
Moreover , online publication offers the opportunity for others to comment on the research .
Research is also becoming more collaborative so that , before they have been finalised , papers have been reviewed by several authors .
This central tenet of scholarly publishing is changing , too .
Nicholas Carr has an odd piece up , reacting to the ongoing question of Wikipedia governance as if it is the death of Wikipedia .
In Carr ’s view
Where once we had a commitment to open democracy , we now have a commitment to “ making sure things are not excessively semi-protected . ”
Where once we had a commune , we now have a gated community , “ policed ” by “ good editors . ”
So let ’s pause and shed a tear for the old Wikipedia , the true Wikipedia .
Rest in peace , dear child .
You are now beyond the reach of vandals .
Now this is odd because Carr has in the past cast entirely appropriate aspersions on pure openess as a goal , noting , among other things , that “ The open source model is not a democratic model .
It is the combination of community and hierarchy that makes it work .
Community without hierarchy means mediocrity . ”
Carr was right earlier , and he is wrong now .
Carr would like Wikipedia to have committed itself to openess at all costs , so that changes in the model are failure conditions .
That is n’t the case however ; Wikipedia is committed to effectiveness , and one of the things it has found to be effective is openess , but where openess fails to provide the necessary defenses on it ’s own , they ’ll make changes to remain effective .
The changes in Wikipedia do not represent the death of Wikipedia but adaptation , and more importantly , adaptation in exactly the direction Carr suggests will work .
We ’ve said it here before : Openness allows for innovation .
Innovation creates value .
Value creates incentive .
If that were all there was , it would be a virtuous circle , because the incentive would be to create more value .
But incentive is value - neutral , so it also creates distortions — free riders , attempts to protect value by stifling competition , and so on .
And distortions threaten openess .
As a result , successful open systems create the very conditions that require a threaten openess .
Systems that handle this pressure effectively continue ( Slashdot comments . )
Systems that ca n’t or do n’t find ways to balance openess and closedness — to become semi-protected — fail ( Usenet . )
A huge number of our current systems are hanging in the balance , because the more valuable a system , the greater the incentive for free - riding .
Our largest and most spontaneous sources of conversation and collaboration are busily being retrofit with filters and logins and distributed ID systems , in an attempt to save some of what is good about openess while defending against Wiki spam , email spam , comment spam , splogs , and other attempts at free - riding .
Wikipedia falls into that category .
And this is the possibility that Carr does n’t entertain , but is implicit in his earlier work — this is n’t happening because the Wikipedia model is a failure , it is happening because it is a success .
Carr attempts to deflect this line of thought by using a lot of scare quotes around words like vandal , as if there were no distinction between contribution and vandalism , but this line of reasoning runs aground on the evidence of Wikipedia ’s increasing utility .
If no one cared about Wikipedia , semi-protection would be pointless , but with Wikipedia being used as reference material in the Economist and the NY Times , the incentive for distortion is huge , and behavior that can be sensibly described as vandalism , outside scare quotes , is obvious to anyone watching Wikipedia .
The rise of governance models is a reaction to the success that creates incentives to vandalism and other forms of attack or distortion .
We ’ve also noted before that governance is a certified Hard Problem .
At the extremes , co-creation , openess , and scale are incompatible .
Wikipedia ’s principle advantage over other methods of putting together a body of knowledge is openess , and from the outside , it looks like Wikipedia ’s guiding principle is “ Be as open as you can be ; close down only where there is evidence that openess causes more harm than good ; when this happens , reduce openess in the smallest increment possible , and see if that fixes the problem . ”
People who build or manage large - scale social software form the experimental wing of political philosophy — in the same way that the US Constitution is harder to change than local parking regulations , Wikipedia is moving towards a system where evidence of abuse generates anti-bodies , and those anti-bodies vary in form and rigidity depending on the nature and site of the threat .
By responding to the threats caused by its growth , Wikipedia is moving the hierachy + community model that Carr favored earlier .
His current stance — that this change is killing the model of pure openess he loved — is simply crocodile tears .
December 2006
From the newsgroup :
Q. I do n’t understand why while a nested function perfectly matches the definition of closure , it is not closure simply because it is not used by external world .
Like so many other computing terms , the word “ closure ” is used in different ways by different people .
Strictly speaking , a closure is simply a function with free variables , where the bindings for all such variables are known in advance .
Some early languages did n’t have “ closed ” functions ; the bindings for free variables were left open , and was determined at runtime .
And languages that had both “ open ” and “ closed ” functions needed some way to distinguish between the two , so people started referring to the latter as “ closures ” .
But in Python , as well as in most other modern languages , all functions are “ closed ” — i.e. there are no “ open ” free variables — so the use of the term has morphed from “ a function for which all free variables have a known binding ” to “ a function that can refer to environments that are no longer active ” ( such as the local namespace of an outer function , even after that function has returned ) .
And since that is somewhat difficult to implement , and programmers do n’t like to hide things that are hard to implement , people still like to use the term to distinguish between closed functions of kind 1 and closed functions of kind 2 .
As in this [ newsgroup ] thread , they sometimes argue that when you ’re using a closed function of kind 2 in a specific way , it ’s not quite as much of a closure as when you use it in another way .
Heck , some people even argue that languages that do n’t support closed functions of kind 3 ( a kind that Python currently does n’t support ) do n’t really have closures at all .
But as a language user , you can actually forget about all this — all you need to know is that in Python , all functions are closed , and free variables bind to variable names in lexically nested outer scopes .
Dear Cecil :
My husband swears that when he took anthropology they talked about a race of blue people .
How did I miss this ?
Do n't you dare say it was the Smurfs .
Lonijo , via AOL
Cecil replies :
OK , it was n’t the Smurfs .
I was thinking maybe I could work up something involving the chronically depressed , fans of B.B. King , or Minnesotans in January , but those all pretty much suck too .
So I may as well tell you the truth , namely that your husband is probably talking about the blue Fugates of Kentucky , the best warning against the dangers of inbreeding till the arrival of Prince Charles .
The blue Fugates were n’t a race but rather an excessively tight - knit family living in the Appalachian Mountains .
The patriarch of the clan was Martin Fugate , who settled along the banks of Troublesome Creek near Hazard , Kentucky , sometime after 1800 .
His wife , Mary , is thought to have been a carrier for a rare disease known as hereditary methemoglobinemia , which we ’ll call met-H .
Due to an enzyme deficiency , the blood of met - H victims has reduced oxygen - carrying capacity .
Instead of being the usual bright red , arterial blood is chocolate brown and gives the skin of Caucasians a bluish cast .
Hereditary met- H is caused by a recessive gene .
If only one of your parents has this gene , you ’ll be normal , but if they both have it , there ’s a good chance you ’ll be blue .
None of Martin and Mary Fugate ’s descendants would have been blue had they not intermarried with a nearby clan , the Smiths .
The Smiths were descendants of Richard Smith and Alicia Combs , one of whom apparently was also a met - H carrier .
According to family historian Mary Fugate , the first known blue Fugate was born in 1832 .
Because of inbreeding among the isolated hill folk — the Fugate family tree is a tangled mess of cousins marrying cousins — blue people started popping up frequently thereafter .
A half dozen or so were on the scene by the 1890s , and one case was reported as recently as 1975 .
They were quite a sight .
One woman is said to have had lips the color of a bruise .
In 1960 a doctor named Madison Cawein heard about the blue Fugates and succeeded in tracking down several of them .
Luckily some cases of hereditary met- H among native Alaskans had been written up in the medical literature not long before , so he was able to diagnose the problem fairly quickly .
He also prescribed a simple , if temporary , cure — the chemical methylene blue , which replaced the missing enzyme in the blood .
The results were dramatic .
Within minutes after getting a dose , the blue Fugates became a normal pink for the first time in their lives .
Today , what with increased prosperity and mobility , the Fugates get around a lot more and the likelihood of further instances of blueness is thought to be low .
Still , if you ’re in the neighborhood of Troublesome Creek and someone tells you he ’s feeling blue , try to get a look at him in a good light .
Mo’ Bettah Blues
Dear Cecil :
Your piece about the blue Fugates was fascinating , but I do n’t think Lonijo ’s husband was talking about them when he referred to the “ blue people ” he studied in anthropology .
The blue men are the Tuareg , a nomadic group of people in the Sahara whose traditional territories included Mali and parts of Niger , Morocco , Algeria , etc .
They get their nickname from the blue robes they wear .
Originally their clothing was deeply dyed with natural indigo .
This was absorbed by the skin , which also took on a blue tinge .
I have read that even babies were born with blue skin because of the indigo in their mothers ’ blood .

Dear Cecil :
I wanted to mention another blue population to you .
It was a very ancient race of which Krishna was a member .
Check out pictures of Krishna and his cohorts from one of the books the Hare Krishna members sell .
You will see depictions of members of the blue race .
It was long , long ago , and I guess that ’s why most people are unaware of them .
— Beth Cummings
Dear Cecil :
Please dig deeper in response to the line of inquiry initiated by Lonijo via AOL .
I too was a student of anthropology some 30 years ago and also stumbled across reference to a former race of humanoids who were blue .
Once , in addition to the four known races of mankind , there was a fifth race that dwelled on an unknown continent in the middle of the ocean between Asia and Europe ( i.e. , North America ) .
This race , the most ancient of all , was called the Blue Moovians .
They were very tall , about seven feet , and very thin , and had extremely large heads .
They possessed all manners of powers of the mind : teleportation , telekinesis , ESP .
One day , in response to a stimulus known only to them , they conveyed to regular humans that they had , through their powers of astral projection , located a planet more suitable to their needs in a far distant solar system or galaxy , and all at once they each and every one disappeared from the face of the earth and teleported themselves there , never to be seen or heard from again .
This supposedly occurred about 60,000 BC .
— Mark S. Miller
Dear Cecil :
Cecil , gimme a break .
Really , an anthro course covering blue people in Kentucky and leaving out the Picts of Scotland ?
The Picts were an early race of Scotsmen who fought naked and painted themselves blue with woad .
They were known as the blue people .
— Tom Riemers , via the Internet
Dear Cecil :
You completely missed the Ainu , an indigenous people living in Japan whose skin hue is often described as blue .
— David de Graaf
Dear Cecil :
In Irish - Scottish Gaeilge ( or Gaelic ) , people of African descent were historically referred to as the fir gorum , or blue men .
People of this race were described as “ blue ” rather than as “ black . ”
This may explain why a particular musical style often associated with an African - American influence is called “ the blues . ”
Then again , I may be wrong .
— Ed O’Neill
Cecil replies :
More than that , chum .
I ’d say you blue it .
George Carlin may wonder why there ’s no blue food , but there ’s apparently no lack of blue people .
A rundown on the suggestions above :
Tuareg .
The skin of these desert herders does turn blue from the dye they use in their clothing .
Indeed , they consider a blue tinge healthful and attractive .
However , at the risk of showing insufficient appreciation for cultural diversity , what it really means is they ’re overdue for a bath .
Krishna ’s race .
Most likely this is what comes of cheesy color reproduction in those airport handouts .
Blue Moovians .
Too many B moovies , bub .
Picts of Scotland .
They ’re thought to have tattooed themselves .
The name Pict derives from the Latin pictor , painter .
Tattoos today often have a bluish cast ; still , there ’s no definite evidence the Picts were blue .
The Ainu .
In the anthropological literature their skin is described as brown .
However , an 1891 Smithsonian report comments , “ It is difficult to speak with confidence , for they do not bathe or wash , and the natural color of the skin is not often seen . ”
So who knows ?
Maybe it ’s blue .
Africans as seen by the Scots and the Irish .
Unable to confirm use of this term .
However , “ the blues ” ?
I ’m not buying it .
Not even if you hold your breath till you turn blue .
Blue cheese
Dear Cecil :
You published several possibilities about the supposed race of blue people .
One such possibility was that of the Indic god Krishna , who is usually depicted as having blue skin .
You dismissed this as being the product of “ cheesy color reproduction in those airport handouts . ”
While I will not defend the quality of the handouts made by the Hare Krishnas , I point out that Krishna is traditionally shown with blue skin in almost all the art of India .
This is part of the mythology of Krishna .
See , some demons wanted to kill every living being on the earth , so they dumped poison in the rivers .
Krishna prevented mass mortality by drinking up all the poison .
Being a god , naturally Krishna did n’t die from the poison , but it did turn his skin blue for the rest of time .
Why poison = blue ?
I suspect the poison in question was cyanide , which you mention as being colored blue .
— Paul
Cecil replies :
Another take on this I ’ve heard is that blue is the standard depiction of all Hindu gods .
Be that as it may , it ’s not blue gods we ’re interested in , it ’s blue people .

Zen and the Art of Good Cooking - from The Vegetarian April 1992
A good meal should do more than fill an empty stomach ; it should also feed your soul .
David Scott discovered the spiritual aspects of Zen food from an inspiring Buddhist source in Japan .
Inside the temple gates of Sanko - in , a Zen Buddhist monastery for women , the earth under the pruned trees and shrubs of the front gardens had been carefully brushed clean .
Neat piles of fallen leaves , twigs and tiny ripe persimmons were collected along the pathway I took to the main monastery building .
I left my shoes at the sliding , wooden double door entrance , changed into the thonged slippers provided , and was led along a narrow corridor with a polished oak board floor to an almost bare ten tatami ( woven straw ) mat room .
There were shoji ( paper ) screens on three sides and a wall with a tokonama ( scroll ) hanging alcove on the other .
I left my slippers in the corridor and sat on a cushion at a small red lacquered table in the rather cold and very silent room .
I was told I would dine first and then meet the Abbess .
On an unusually warm and sunny day for a Japanese autumn I had travelled by bus , subway and finally taxi to Sanko - in which is tucked away in the outer suburbs of Tokyo .
Here they have a reputation for serving the very best shojin - ryori food and the small number of public dining rooms are booked up months in advance .
Shojin - ryori may be simply translated as ' vegetable cooking ' but it also carries with it the idea of cooking for spiritual growth since correct food preparation and good dietary practice form an integral part of traditional Japanese Zen training .
Koei Hoshino , the Abbess of the temple and a famous shojin cook , had kindly agreed to meet me to talk about herself , Zen food and the spiritual life .
The meal , which contained no meat , fish or dairy products , was served to me with a quiet reverence .
It was exquisite .
Green gunpowder whisked tea from Matsume in the Shimane Prefecture , the best in Japan , was served first accompanied by a round wafer biscuit filled with bean jam .
In the centre was half a salted bean .
Following this , served together on a single black lacquered tray , were a selection of dishes .
Sesame flavoured tofu ( beancurd ) ; soft creamy chawan mushi ( a savoury custard filled with carefully patterned carrot slices ) and shiitake ( wood mushrooms ) : spinach , lightly parboiled , pressed and wrapped in nori seaweed ; a plate of ginko nuts , fresh chestnut halves , slivers of gobo ( vegetable ) root , greenbeans and a wheel of okura ( beancurd product ) wrapped in seaweed .
Rice , pickles and miso soup followed .
The Abbess came to join me , and a small pot of tea and tiny violet coloured sweets with the temple motif pressed into the top were served .
She is 57 years old , stout but not fat .
Her head was shaved and she wore a black heavy cotton habit .
She sat on the floor on her heels with her hands lightly folded in her lap , back straight but not stiff .
Her eyes sparkled with humour and energy , she was composed , friendly and feminine .
I asked the Abbess what shojin - ryori meant to her .
She thought carefully and replied , " Shojin is my way of staying alive - that is all .
There is nothing harmful in it , which is important .
I eat the food to sustain me .
" Mind you , the food we eat ourselves on a daily basis is simpler than that served to our customers .
After a hard day 's work one does not long for delicacies .
The simple yet delicious tastes of a bowl of rice gruel with pickled plums or of rice just off the stove accompanied by miso soup are unforgettable . "
I asked her what basic advice she gave to the lay cooks who came to her for training .
" Firstly and most importantly I tell them to concentrate fully on what they are doing " , she told me , then smiled and said , " Secondly they must not make a mess ! " and then , " Finally nothing should be wasted .
For instance , here we use the peelings from carrots and other vegetables to make pickles for the next day's meal . "
Koei Hoshino 's teacher and the previous Abbess was Soei Yoneda who towards the end of her life wrote ' Food From a Zen Temple ' ( Kodensha International ) .
Soei took tonsure and began a life of monastic discipline at the age of seven in the Bamboo Palace nunnery in Kyoto .
At the age of 28 she took over Sanko -in .
Many years later , still naive in the ways of the world , she discovered that the temple land had been sold without her knowledge and that their financial reserves had also been drained .
It seemed that Sanko - in would have to close .
It was then that Koei Hoshino , assistant Abbess at the time , suggested the idea of offering their shojin dishes to the public .
In this way they would be able to survive and to propagate the teachings of the Buddha through their cooking .
I asked Koei why , in retrospect , she thought the scheme had been such a success .
She told me after a long pause , " Since the beginning we have served our dishes with an eye to the colours of the seasons .
We also prepare our ingredients with great care and love and the food is then presented on charming tableware which itself relates to the season at hand .
For instance , the bowls may have a motif of chrysanthemums or peonies or maple leaves .
Our patrons seem to enjoy these feminine touches .
As well , they appreciate our emphasis on tradition .
" My old boss 's view was that though our modern lives are full of comfort , we have gradually become distant from our natural environment .
Living in homes with heaters and air conditioners has isolated us from the changes in the four seasons .
We tend to forget the gentle breeze in the tree tops and the warm rays of the sun .
Shojin cooking emphasises rather than hides these delights .
On a cold and snowy day in winter , one sits hunched over warming the tips of one 's fingers on a warming bowl of soup .
And in the summer 's heat there are cold noodles on a bed of ice and deep green leaves .
Or one can enjoy cold , white tofu as it floats in clear water " .
The motto of the temple , " chori ni kometa aijo " , means cooking with love .
I asked the Abbess who this love was for .
She replied with a warm smile , " This love is for Buddha nature , for the people who eat our food , for the ingredients and for the pots and pans .
In fact the essential flavour of the food comes from one 's heart , from cooking with one 's whole soul and from respecting the spirit of the kitchen .
" Also we love the crockery we use and try not to make a noise with it when we eat .
It takes about three years of study to learn how to handle her eating bowls correctly .
Only then will she be ready to start for a novice to learn shojin ryori " .
What simple advice , I asked her , would the Abbess give to an ordinary person who wishes to lead a life of spiritual endeavours .
She sat very still for a few moments and then said , " Whatever you do you must put your whole heart into it .
Practise this day after day .
That is enough .
Here for instance we believe that if we put all our energies into making the best possible food we can with the best possible taste , then we are pleasing Buddha .
A meal reflects the gentle nature and warm heart of the cook .
Of course some of us are more clever with our hands than others but if one does the best one can , a fine meal results almost as if by divine grace . "
Finally I asked the Abbess for a Zen cook 's tips .
She told me , " In shojin cuisine we try to harmonise the five tastes ; sweet , salty , vinegary , bitter and hot plus one more which is also very important .
That is a soh taste , as of tofu for instance .
" Once finished eating , one should be left with this perfect soh aftertaste .
Remember if the first sip of a meal is perfect the aftertaste will not be , so one must strive for subtle , developing flavours rather than for those with a strong , immediate impact on the taste buds " .
The solar roof at the Floriade Exhibition Hall in the Netherlands still holds the record as the largest of its kind in the world .
The roof is comprised of 20,000 semi- transparent solar modules , and it has a surface area of 28,000 square meters ( almost 7 acres ) .
It acts as one gigantic solar panel , and generating 2.3 megawatts of power .
The solar cells also provide a dappled shade beneath the canopy , which housed a huge exhibit of flowers , plants and trees .
The hall was was built by Nuon for the 2002 Floriade flower exhibition in Haarlemmermeer , just west of Amsterdam .
Siemens Netherlands was responsible for the actually installation of the panels .
The Floriade exhibit is held only once every ten years , so the electricity is currently being sold to the grid .
The yield of the solar roof is enough to supply 450 households with clean electricity ( about 1.23 GWh per year ) .
The solar roof is expected to have a 20 - year lifespan , before it needs to be replaced .

An introduction to bash completion : part 2
Posted by Steve on Sat 24 Dec 2005 at 03:00
Previously we showed how to add basic completion to commands , using facilities which were already provided by the bash completion routines .
In this second part we 'll demonstrate how to add completely new custom completion to commands .
In part one we looked at adding hostname completion to arbitrary commands by executing :
complete -F _known_hosts xvncviewer
This uses the complete command to tell bash that the function _known_hosts should be used to handle the completion of arguments to the xvncviewer .
If we wish to add custom completion to a command we will instead write our own function , and bind that to the command .
As a basic example we 'll first look at adding some simple completions to the binary foo .
This hypothetical command takes three arguments : -- help
Shows the help options for foo , and exits .
-- version
Shows the version of the foo command , and exits .
-- verbose Runs foo with extra verbosity
To handle these arguments we 'll create a new file /etc/ bash_completion.d/ foo .
This file will be automatically sourced ( or loaded ) when the bash completion code is loaded .
Inside that file save the following text : _foo( ) { local cur prev opts COMPREPLY = ( ) cur= " $ { COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} " prev= " $ { COMP_WORDS [COMP_CWORD -1]} " opts= " -- help -- verbose -- version " if [ [ $ {cur} == -* ] ] ; then COMPREPLY =( $ ( compgen - W " $ {opts} " -- $ {cur} ) ) return 0 fi } complete - F _foo foo
To test it you can now source the file : skx@lappy : ~$ .
/etc/bash_completion.d/foo skx@lappy :~$ foo --[ TAB ] -- help -- verbose --version
If you experiment you 'll see that it successfully completes the arguments as expected .
Type " foo -- h[ TAB ] " and the -- help argument is completed .
Press [ TAB ] a few times and you 'll see all the options .
( In this case it does n't actually matter if you do n't have a binary called foo installed upon your system . )
So now that we have something working we should look at how it actually works !
The previous example showed a simple bash function which was invoked to handle completion for a command .
This function starts out by defining some variables cur being the current word being typed , prev being the previous word typed , and opts which is our list of options to complete .
The option completing is then handled by use of the compgen command via this line : COMPREPLY= ( $ ( compgen - W " $ {opts} " -- $ {cur} ) )
What this does is set the value of $ COMPREPLY to the output of running the command : compgen - W " $ {opts} " -- $ {cur}
If you replace these variables with their contents you 'll see how that works : compgen - W " -- help -- verbose -- version " -- " userinput "
This command attempts to return the match of the current word " $ {cur} " against the list " -- help -- verbose -- version " .
If you run this command in a shell you 'll be able to experiment with it and see how it works : skx@lappy : ~$ compgen - W " -- help -- verbose -- version " -- -- -- help -- verbose -- version skx@lappy : ~$ compgen - W " -- help -- verbose -- version " -- --h -- help
Here you first see what happens if the user enters just " -- " - all three options match so they are returned .
In the second attempt the user enters --h and this is enough to specify -- help unambiguously , so that is returned .
In our function we simply set " COMPREPLY " to this result , and return .
This allows bash to replace our current word with the output .
COMPREPLY is a special variable which has a particular meaning within bash .
Inside completion routines it is used to denote the output of the completion attempt .
From the bash reference manual we can read the description of COMPREPLY : COMPREPLY
An array variable from which Bash reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility
We can also see how we found the current word using the array COMP_WORDS to find both the current and the previous word by looking them up : COMP_WORDS
An array variable consisting of the individual words in the current command line .
This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities .
COMP_CWORD
An index into $ {COMP_WORDS} of the word containing the current cursor position .
This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities
Many commands are more complicated to fill out , and have numerous options which depend upon their previous ones .
As a relevant example Xen ships with a command called xm this has some basic options : xm list List all running Xen instances
xm create ConfigName Create a new Xen instances using the configuration file in /etc / xen called ConfigName .
xm console Name Connect to the console of the running machine named " Name " .
In general the command is " xm operation args " where " args " varies depending upon the initial operation selected .
Setting up basic completion of inital operation can be handled in much the same way as our previous example the only difference is that the operations do n't start with a " -- " prefix .
However completing the arguments requires special handling .
If you recall we have access to the previous token upon the command line , and using that we can take different actions for each operation .
The sample code looks like this : _xm ( ) { local cur prev opts base COMPREPLY = ( ) cur= " $ { COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} " prev= " $ {COMP_WORDS [COMP_CWORD -1 ]} " # #
The basic options we 'll complete .
# opts =" console create list " # # Complete the arguments to some of the basic commands .
# case " ${prev} " in console ) local running =$ ( for x in `xm list -- long | grep \( name | grep -v Domain - 0 | awk '{ print $ 2 } ' | tr -d \ ) ` ; do echo $ {x} ; done ) COMPREPLY = ( $ ( compgen - W " ${running} " -- $ {cur} ) ) return 0 ; ; create ) local names =$ ( for x in `ls - 1 /etc/xen/*.cfg` ; do echo $ {x/\/etc\/xen\//} ; done ) COMPREPLY=( $ ( compgen - W " ${names} " -- $ {cur} ) ) return 0 ;; *) ;; esac COMPREPLY =( $( compgen - W " $ {opts} " -- $ {cur} ) ) return 0 } complete - F _xm xm
Here we 've setup the initial completion of the operations and then added special handling for the two operations " create " and " console " .
In both cases we use compgen to complete the input based upon the text that is supplied by the user , compared against a dynamically created list .
For the " console " operation we complete based upon the output of this command : xm list -- long | grep \( name | grep -v Domain - 0 | awk '{ print $ 2 } ' | tr -d \)
This gives us a list of the running Xen systems .
For the creation operation we complete based upon the output of this command : for x in `ls - 1 /etc/xen/*.cfg` ; do echo $ {x/\/etc\/xen\//} ; done
This takes a directory listing of the /etc / xen directory and outputs the names of any files ending in .cfg .
For example : skx@lappy : ~$ for x in `ls - 1 /etc/xen/*.cfg` ; do echo $ {x/\/etc\/xen\//} ; done etch.cfg root.cfg sarge.cfg steve.cfg x.cfg skx@lappy : ~$
Using the compgen command we 've shown how to match user input against particular strings , both by using a fixed set of choices and by using the output of commands .
It is also possible to match directory names , process names , and other things .
See the bash manual for a full description by running " man bash " .
The final example demonstrates how to complete files and hostnames in response to two initial options : # # Completion for foo : # # foo file [ filename ] # foo hostname [ hostname ] # _foo( ) { local cur prev opts COMPREPLY = ( ) cur= " $ { COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} " prev= " $ { COMP_WORDS [ COMP_CWORD -1]} " opts = " file hostname " case " ${prev} " in file ) COMPREPLY = ( $ ( compgen -f $ {cur} ) ) return 0 ; ; hostname ) COMPREPLY = ( $ ( compgen - A hostname $ {cur} ) ) return 0 ;; *) ;; esac COMPREPLY=( $ ( compgen - W " $ {opts} " -- $ {cur} ) ) } complete -F _foo foo
Using these examples you should now be able to create your own custom completion functions .
95 % of the time you only need to complete from a set of available options , the other times you 'll need to deal with dynamic argument generation much like we did for the xm command .
Breaking the options down into a small collection of pipes and testing them outside the completion environment ( just in the shell ) is probably the best approach , then once you 've got a working command line just paste it into your function .
A new patient comes into a doctor ’s office weighing 204 pounds .
He ’s six feet tall .
The following conversation ensues :
Doctor :
Is that up a little bit for you , weightwise ?
Patient :
It might be up a few pounds .
I used to jog and I just have n’t ...
Doctor : See , ’cause I ’m weighing more like 172 , 173 and I ’m six foot .
And I ’m still running .
I ’m doing the 5 and 10 and 15 K’s .
The half marathons and ...
Patient : So , I ’m 30 pounds heavier than you ?
Doctor : Right now , yeah .
That , a group of researchers say , is part of an actual conversation they recorded in the course of a study that showed that many doctors waste patients ’ time and lose their focus in office visits by interjecting irrelevant information about themselves .
Their paper , published yesterday in The Archives of Internal Medicine , involved 100 primary - care doctors in the Rochester area .
As part of a study on patient care and outcomes , the doctors agreed to allow two people trained to act as patients come to their offices sometime over the course of a year .
The test patients would surreptitiously make an audio recording of the encounter .
The investigators analyzed recordings of 113 of those office visits , excluding situations when the doctors figured out that the patient was fake .
My firm represents whistleblowers in numerous cases involving fraud by government contractors in Iraq .
These cases are often brought under the Civil False Claims Act , a law that was enacted in 1863 to combat war profiteering during the Civil War .
In 1986 , when Congress amended the Act , it lauded it as the " Government 's primary litigative tool for combating fraud . "
Nevertheless , at present there are only four such cases in litigation that have been unsealed , and Alan Grayson of my firm , Grayson & Kubli , P.C. , is the attorney of record in all four of them .
Of course , there have been far more than four instances of war profiteering in Iraq .
The False Claims
Act yielded total recoveries of over $ 3 billion last year alone , but in Iraq , where there has been war and war profiteering for over four years , the total recovery to date has been less than $ 6 million .
Senator Dorgan has rightly referred to it as " an orgy of greed " by military contractors .
Billions of dollars are missing -- at least $ 9 billion to be more precise -- and many more billions are being wasted .
It is a travesty that only four such cases are unsealed and in litigation , and even in those four cases , the Bush Administration is not participating .
Moreover , it has swept such cases under the rug by obtaining and extending court orders sealing the cases when , by law , they are supposed to be sealed ( secret ) for only 60 days .
Then after the cases are unsealed , the courts create and apply strict rules that have no basis in the statute .
As Lincoln said 144 years ago ,
worse than traitors in arms are the men who pretend loyalty to the flag , feast and fatten on the misfortunes of the Nation , while patriotic blood is crimsoning the plains .
. . and their countrymen moldering the dust .

Let 's focus on the real issues :
What threat are we trying to protect ourselves from ?
How serious is that threat ?
How would a city protect itself from it ?
What are the effects of the process we currently have in place ?
Is it effective ?
What are its drawbacks ?
Something clearly went wrong - what should we change ?
Protecting Us From Nothing
The threat this activity aims to protect us from , they say , is this : A terrorist , fanatic , or violent person of some sort wants to set off a bomb or bombs in Boston , to kill people or disrupt the city or both , and cause fear .
Well , the fear 's already here and probably does n't need help , but leaving that aside , let 's think about what such a person could do .
If you want to cause death and destruction and terror with a bomb , you could put it in a backpack stuffed with papers and clothes .
Dress up like a student , and go sit down in Harvard Square eating a sandwich .
Get up , " forgetting " your backpack ( you could receive a cell phone call at an appropriate moment if you want to dress up the acting ) , and walk away into the crowd .
Nobody would notice anything suspicious , nobody would call the police .
A few minutes later , when you 're safely through to the other side of Harvard Yard or on a bus , the bomb could go off , killing people , blasting shops , and closing down part of the red line .
Or , you could take the express bus from Waltham , and get off in Newton , before the bus gets on the pike .
Leave your bomb under the seat ( again , in a backpack stuffed with papers & clothes ) .
Time it to go off about when the bus is in the I - 90 tunnel near Copley - or have an accomplice watch near the entrance to the tunnel and use a remote trigger , so you do n't have to worry about traffic delays .
Or , do what the 1993 World Trade Center bombers did : rent ( or steal ) a van , and pack it with explosives .
Drive it up to a big building and leave it to explode there .
Boston has no shortage of buildings vulnerable to that attack .
You could close down some major roads that way , too .
None of what Boston did last week shows that they can protect us from this threat , for the simple reason that none of what Boston did bears much relation to what needs to be done to protect us from it .
Boston 's freak out started in response to a call about a strange object , and it 's highly unlikely that such a call would come in the case of a real terrorist bomb .
Protecting us from terrorist bombs requires that we develop a process for spotting them , not that we react in the extreme to the occasional phone call .
Does this make you feel safe ?
It makes me feel safe .
Really , I mean that .
I 'm not going to say it 's " easy " for a terrorist to plant a bomb , but it 's certainly doable and not particularly complex .
And if someone does plant a bomb , chances that anyone will stop it are tiny .
Given that , and the fact that years have passed since 9/11 with no bombs going off , the lesson is clear : Nobody 's trying !.
... and that 's the best protection there is .
How to Protect Against Bombs
In Israel , the threat of terrorist bombs is real and prevalent .
Israeli authorities and processes are extremely effective at countering it : they catch and prevent real bomb plot and attempts every month - in times of higher tension , multiple times a week .
I 'm from Israel , and though I 've lived most of my life in Boston , I did spend several summers there in the 80s and 90s , enough to be familiar with some of what they do .
In Israel , any unattended portable object is a " suspicious object " , including the equivalent of a backpack left in Harvard Square or on the 553 bus .
Most everyone , except some tourists , knows how to respond .
Someone calls " khefetz khashud " ( suspicious object ) ; people clear the vicinity of the object ; an announcement is made if it 's somewhere with a PA system ; the bomb squad arrives and destroys the object ; they make sure there 's nothing dangerous around , and call the all clear .
The whole process usually takes about 15 - 30 minutes , and affects a single restaurant , bus stop , building , or intersection , while the rest of the city keeps going .
Most bombs and bomb plots get stopped well before they reach the stage where that process is necessary - it's in place as a safety net for when intelligence fails .
There are other processes to handle suicide bombers , again as a safety net to catch the ones intelligence fails to stop .
The Israeli process of protection against terrorist bombs has a lot of pieces .
Intelligence networks , investigators , rapid response , an informed population , well known procedures , and lots of practice .
It requires the participation of a majority of people , on a daily basis .
It 's a lot of hassle , and a big expense .
People do it because they know the threat is real and prevalent , and because they know it works .
People do it because the cost of not doing it would be bombs blowing up every week .
What 's the Risk ?
If we wanted to really protect Boston from terrorist bombs , we'd have to do something like what Israel does .
And yet ...
Sometimes , bombs do blow up in Israel cities .
Every single year , some plots slip through all the safety nets and succeed , while every single year , zero terrorist bombs blow up in Boston .
Why ?
Because in Israel , somebody 's trying .
Israel 's process , as effective and robust as it is , is missing the most important piece : the political & social .
The only true way to protect your city from terrorist bombs is to have a political & social situation in which terrorists are n't trying to plant bombs .
That 's what we have here in Boston .
We 're safer in Boston .
But it 's not because we do n't face a terrorist bomb threat .
Actually , the thing most likely to cause sudden death or injury to a typical Bostonian , and to a typical Israeli , is the same : a traffic accident .
Even in Israel , cars kill more people than terrorists , by a long shot .
We 're safer in Boston because Israeli drivers are crazier , and their accident rates are higher .
Israelis are safer than Italians , who , in turn , are safer than residents of Nairobi , Kenya ( which has one of the highest car accident death rates in the world ) .
On the scale of risk we face , terrorist bombs do n't come close to competing with many people 's daily commute to and from work .
Incidentally , bumper to bumper traffic on a highway increases accident rates .
Accidents in a bumper to bumper portion of a highway tend to be low speed and do n't cause injury , but if portions of a road are clear and portions are clogged , accidents at the transition points can be serious .
When you close or divert major roads during high traffic times , you increase the risk of injury to a lot of people .
What are we protecting ourselves from , again ?
Random Panic
But let 's get back to those hypothetical bombs in Boston , the ones that do n't exist but that our city claims to be protecting us from .
Why , exactly , did they decide to kick in maximum " protection " when they found that first Mooninite ?
It 's not because the Mooninite sign was more likely to be a bomb than countless other objects in the city .
Sure , the Mooninite could have been a bomb , but so could just about anything else that 's lying around .
If anything , these cartoons were much less likely to be bombs than millions of other things we see lying around .
Making something with lights and a pattern to draw attention , and hanging it somewhere visible , are n't exactly on a would - be terrorist bomber 's priority list .
So why was n't Chinatown closed down last weekend because of the crate of vegetables some delivery truck left on the sidewalk , that I walked by .
Do n't tell me a crate of vegetables can't be hiding a bomb .
Why did the cartoons lead to a panic when many other things much more likely to be bombs did not ?
Because they were weird .
And because they were weird , someone called to report them as being weird .
As Boston officials have said , and commenters on this blog have echoed , " what if we had n't responded to the call , and then something happened ? "
Nobody says , " what if we had n't called the alarm over that crate of vegetables in Chinatown , and then it turned out to be a bomb ? "
Nobody says , " what if we had n't shut down Harvard Square because of that stray backpack , and then it turned out to be a bomb ? "
Why ?
Because those things are n't weird , and therefore nobody called about them .
The process we have is n't about protecting us from terrorists , it 's about covering the city 's ass .
How likely is there to be a correlation between actual bombs , and calls reporting weird objects ?
First , real bombs are highly unlikely - we have n't had even one yet .
Second , if there were a real bomb , there 's little chance of it being weird and prompting a call .
Third , there are a lot of weird objects around that are n't bombs but could prompt calls .
Therefore , the correlation is probably negative .
In today 's Boston , given what we know and how we act and think , if someone calls about an unusual object , it 's almost certainly not a bomb , and is in fact less likely to be a bomb than some other object that nobody called about .
The Aqua Teen Hunger Force attack is an illustrative example of this .
We have in place a process that responds to such calls with hysteria , spectacle , and a major disruption of the city .
It 's a response that , as we 've seen , has major costs - not just the $ 1 million the city says it cost them , but the disruptions and delays for millions of other people .
And yet , despite all this cost , it 's a response that is triggered essentially at random , with no positive correlation to the ( almost nonexistent ) threat it 's supposed to be a response to .
That 's why I call it " Random Panic " .
What Should We Do ?
First , we need to understand the situation :
We 're not under a serious threat of terrorist bombs .
If we were , the process we have now would not protect us from it at all .
We 're basically safe , but we suffer from the process that 's supposed to keep us safe .
Once we understand the situation , we can stop looking for outside scapegoats .
Turner is not to blame .
The ad agency is not to blame .
Sean and Peter are not to blame .
The vegetable truck delivery people are not to blame .
The student who forgot her backpack is not to blame .
that does us no good , and that is where we need to shine the light .
Step back a bit , and tune our " response " to better suit the value it provides ( which is , very little ) .
Then , we can weigh the tradeoffs involved in putting in place something that actual would protect us from bombs .
It should be obvious to us that in our current situation , it 's not worth it .
We ca n't go the Israeli way without a major investment , not just on the part of the city & state , but on the part of most residents - and residents simply are n't going to stick to such a program unless they see the threat .
Not just abstractly , but for real .
Since it 's not real , it can't work .
If someone calls about a suspicious object , investigate .
But do n't assume it 's a bomb without evidence - and understand that the fact that someone called about it does not constitute evidence .
If someone calls in a specific bomb threat , that is evidence : respond accordingly .
But even in that case , do n't overreact .
If and when we turn out to have an active , ongoing threat of terrorist bombings , then and only then , start learning how to counter it from places like Britain and Israel .
In the meantime :
Admit that the city screwed up in a big way .
Apologize to the people .
Apologize to the artists .
Investigate and fix the broken process .
Investigate the implementation of that process in this particular case : how those in charge acted .
Apply some accountability to city authorities if appropriate .
Drop all threats & court cases against the scapegoats .
Stop digging the hole we got ourselves in , deeper .
Most of the Universe is a complete and total mystery .
And one of these mysteries is dark matter .
It ’s out there , and astronomers are slowly teasing out its characteristics , but it ’s not giving up its secrets easily .
The problem is , dark matter only interacts with regular matter through gravity ( and maybe through the weak nuclear force ) .
It does n’t shine , it does n’t give off heat or radio waves , and it passes through regular matter like it is n’t there .
But when dark matter is destroyed , it might give astronomers the clues they ’re looking for .
Researchers have theorized that one productive way to search for dark matter might not be to search for it directly , but to look for the resulting particles and energy which are emitted when it ’s destroyed .
In the environment around the centre of our galaxy , dark matter might be dense enough that particles regularly collide , releasing a cascade of energy and additional particles ; which could be detected .
And this theory could help account for a strange result gathered by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) , a NASA spacecraft which is mapping the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ( CMBR ) .
This background radiation was supposed to be roughly even across the entire sky .
But for some reason , the satellite turned up an excess of microwave emission around the centre of our galaxy .
Perhaps this microwave radiation is the glow of all that dark matter getting annihilated .
This conclusion was reached by a team of US astronomers : Dan Hooper , Douglas P. Finkbeiner and Gregory Dobler .
Their work is published in a new research paper called Evidence Of Dark Matter Annihilations In The WMAP Haze .
The excess microwave radiation around our galactic centre is known as the WMAP Haze , and was originally thought to be the emissions from hot gas .
Astronomers set about trying to confirm this theory , but observations in other wavelengths failed to turn up any evidence .
According to the researchers , the microwave haze could be explained by annihilating particles of dark matter , like the interaction between matter and antimatter .
As dark matter particles collide they could give off any number of detectable particles and radiation , including gamma-rays , electrons , positrons , protons , antiprotons and neutrinos .
The size , shape and distribution of the haze matches the central region of our galaxy which should also have a high concentration of dark matter .
And if the dark matter particles are within a certain range of mass – 100 to 1000s of times the mass of a proton – they could release a torrent of electrons and positrons that nicely match the microwave haze .
In fact , their calculations precisely match one of the most attractive dark matter particle candidates : the hypothetical neutralino which is predicted in supersymmetry models .
When annihilated , these would produce heavy quarks , gauge bosons or the Higgs boson , and would have the right mass and particle size to produce the microwave haze observed by WMAP .
One of the predictions made in this paper is for the upcoming Gamma Ray large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) , due to launch in December , 2007 .
If they ’re correct , GLAST will be able to detect a glow of gamma rays coming from the Galactic Centre , matching the microwave haze , and even put an upper limit of the mass of dark matter particles .
The upcoming ESA Planck mission will give an even more precise look at the microwave haze , providing better data .
It might still be mysterious , but dark matter is revealing its secrets slowly but surely .

Ah , satire .
If you ever wonder whether you company is getting a reputation , just wait for the blogosphere to make fun of you .
Case in point : Yahoo !
Announces Acquisition of Company Before Its Foundation :
SUNNYVALE , CA , Jan 11 , 2006 ( YARDLEYPRESS ) � Yahoo! Inc. ( Nasdaq : YAHOO ) , a leading global Internet company , today announced the acquisition of an unnamed Web 2.0 company three days before it was to be founded .
� Yahoo !

I assume you have heard of reddit and digg , but let me describe them to you anyways , in case you have been living in a cave .
( How are you reading this in your cave ?
Does someone print it out and bring it to you ? )
Reddit , digg , and their imitators are sites where readers submit links , which are then voted upon by other readers .
Links that receive the most votes appear on the front page , while those that receive less remain out of sight .
Through this mechanism these sites promised to bring to their readers the best content on the web , leaving what constituted the “ best ” content to the readers .
Initially it seemed to work well , the early adopters found that nearly everything on the front page was to their liking .
But as they have become more popular the content seems to have gone downhill , with perhaps only a handful of the links on the front page worth looking at on average .
How can we explain this , given that more readers should have meant that the democratic setup would be more effective ?
Well the problem lies in the nature of democracy itself .
Consider the small group of early adopters .
They were much alike in their interests and thus tended to vote similarly to each other .
And this meant that when any one user went to the front page they found the links that people much like themselves had voted up , and so there was a good change that they would like them as well .
But as you add more people the group of voters becomes less homogenous .
Because of the nature of voting this means that only links with broad appeal will rise to the top .
Which is n’t always a bad thing , but it means that the links that appeal strongly to only a smaller group of the readers will never make it to the front page , and this is bad .
And this means that the average reader will find many links that are mildly appealing , but nothing that is really interesting to them .
( Assuming that for a given person the most interesting topics for them are of a specialized nature .
This is probably true of most people , because in general what people feel passionate about is some specific topic or activity , and anything that would engage them in this area will be too “ technical ” for those who are n’t already interested in it .
For example , I have never seen anything philosophically interesting make it to the front page of reddit , although there is plenty of philosophically interesting content on the web . )
Of course the reddit and digg audiences have n’t grown large enough to encompass all kinds of people equally , for example reddit has a liberal / libertarian and atheist bias , and digg has a preference for gadgets , but they are getting there .
So what is the solution ?
Well , ideally , you want to segregate the readers by their interests to get back to a situation more like when the site first started .
One way to do this is to provide different sections for different topics , such as politics , physics , and so on .
Instead of submitting links to the site as a whole to be voted on by everyone readers with narrower interests could submit links to the relevant topic section and have them voted on by readers of that topic sections alone .
Both reddit and digg have done this to some extent , but on both sites there are only a few topic sections , and which topic sections exist is dictated by what the site owners feel is important , and not by what the people want ( ideally the users should create topic sections , just like they submit links ) .
And on top of that people should be able to “ subscribe ” to one or more topic sections , so that when they visit the site they are presented only with the links from the topic sections they are subscribed to .
Of course this is all somewhat tangential to the philosophical ramifications of these issues .
The first thing that the evolution of these sites demonstrate is that democracy is not a universal solution that you can simply throw at a problem .
Democracy works when you are trying to find things that are compromises , that are acceptable to most people .
It does n’t work when you are trying to find something outstanding , something that the majority of people may not appreciate .
For example , you would n’t want to decide what was great art by democracy ( because many people do n’t like cubism , but that does n’t make it bad art ) , nor would you want to decide what was true by democracy .
Of course if you are working with democracy in such a situation you can improve your position by restricting your pool of voters , for example when deciding what was great art you could try to restrict your pool of voters to people who are known to have good taste , and when deciding what is true you can restrict your pool to people who are impartial and knowledgeable in the field .
Of course it is even better to do away with democracy altogether in these situations and devise a method for deciding that is independent of what people think ( for example , in the case of truth you can test your claims ) .
I guess the real question then is : are laws , foreign policy , ect the kind of things that a compromise solution is right for , or should we trying to find a way to make them objectively the best ?

The 101 - storey Taipei 101 was built to the highest safety standards
Lin Cheng - horng suggests ground stress from the 508m - tall building may have reopened an ancient earthquake fault .
This could be the reason for what he says is a recent sharp increase in seismic activity in the Taipei basin .
Writing in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters , he urges further investigation and monitoring .
Mr Lin says the 101 - storey skyscraper , which was completed a year ago and is anchored by enormous concrete and steel columns , may have reactivated a fault line .
According to Mr Lin , it weighs 700,000 metric tons and exerts a stress on the ground below of 4.7 bars - some of which would be transferred to the earth 's upper crust due to extremely soft sedimentary rocks beneath the Taipei basin .
' Not to blame '
Taiwan is one of the most earthquake - prone places in the world , which is why , when the idea of building the huge structure was first raised , rigorous safety and geological surveys were carried out .
The concrete steel and glass building in the country 's capital was then designed to the most exacting safety standards .
A spokesman for the Taipei Financial Centre Corporation , which owns the building , said he was confident that Taipei 101 was not to blame for an increase in earthquakes .
Recent tremors were caused by seismic activity in other parts of the island or offshore , he said .
He called the report interesting , but pointed out that Taipei 101 was at least 200 m away from the Taipei fault , which has not been active for more than 45,000 years .
I was listening to Bubba The Love Sponge on Sirius Satellite Radio today and to prep up for their Friday morning show all the guys in the studio were hitting cans of Big Ox .
I do n’t think that the guys over at The Big Ox intended on radio personalities using their product to wake up in the morning but it did seem to do the trick .
For all intents and proposes The Big Ox is oxygen in a can .
Each can contains 95 % pure oxygen as apposed to the wimpy 21 % we normally breathe from day to day and comes in four tasty flavors Tropical Breeze , Mountain Mint , Polar Rush and Citrus Blast .
If you are exercising , training , or just need a pick me up during your high paced day you can grab yourself a 2 pack of cans for just over 20 bucks .
Last night , after working diligently all day , I took a break and settled into the couch with my honey ( and my dogs ) to watch a pay - per - view movie .
You know — kick back and dumb down .
One of modern life ’s little pleasures .
But no… the cable TV service did a “ HAL ” on me , and refused to cooperate .
I got an indecipherable error message when I tried to give them money for a movie .
So , I called the only number listed for the cable company .
I ’ll spare you most of the details , because I ’m sure you ’ve experienced similar intellectual insults … but I was put through twenty minutes of automated Hell , forced to jump through hoops and recite information and answer truly stupid questions … by a sweet - voiced ROBOT .
“ I ’m sorry .
I did n’t hear your selection .
Could you please repeat your answer ?
Here are your choices again … ”
Now , I ’m a level - headed guy , most of the time .
All I wanted was my friggin’ movie .
The popcorn was getting cold , the dogs had wandered off , and I quickly began to resent this …
ROBOT … that assumed I was one of the stupidest humans on the planet .
She ( it was woman ’s voice ) very politely informed me that , in “ her ” experience , the solution was one of the following twelve choices … and she , in her wisdom and patience , was going to stay with me while we worked together to solve this pecadillo .
First choice : “ Is your television set turned on ?
Say yes … or no , please . ”
You know , companies that use robot answering systems experimented with software a few years ago that recognized when people started using “ bad ” words … and you would get a dial tone the instant you swore , kicked off for having a potty mouth .
The cable company must not have implemented that software , however , cuz by the third choice in the robot menu , I was calling her every evil name I could think of .
( I even used the dreaded “ C ” word .
Shame on me .
It was anthropomorphism gone ape - shit . )
A half hour later , I ’d rebooted the entire system twice , recited every piece of privileged info I have four times , and performed technological stunts that defied logic .
And STILL got the damn error code .
Next step :
The robot connected me with “ Steve ” … in Bombay .
“ Steve ” , who had clearly never set foot on American soil , apologized profusely for everything , and asked me for ALL the info I ’d given the robot multiple times just minutes before .
Then… he asked me if the TV was on .
So we could reboot the system .
At that point , my mind cleared a bit .
I had the sense to ask what the friggin ’ error code meant … and “ Steve ” seemed reluctant to tell me .
Weak signal , he finally mumbled .
So … rebooting was essentially useless , was n’t it ?
Well … yes .
Then why had I been subjected to all this futile rigamarole ?
Oh , very sorry about everything , sir .
You ’ll probably have to ask to have a technician come over to look at your system .
And no , I ca n’t arrange that for you .
I did NOT call “ Steve ” any names .
He ’s just doing his job , right ?
Before hanging up , in fact , he asked me if I wanted to review my account … because there were exciting NEW options available from my wonderful cable company to make me happy , happy , happy .
Stunned at the stupidity of asking me for more money while clearly not delivering on what I ’d already paid for , I hung up on “ Steve ” .
Let him suck some dial tone .
No movie , no appointment set up to fix things , and a ruined evening ( which could have been salvaged had the robot told me that the error code meant no solution would be forthcoming … in the time I spent on the phone jumping through her hoops , I could have drove over to Blockbuster and rented the flick , come back and enjoyed my popcorn ) .
And the entire nasty experience was topped with a chirpy request for more money , please , thank you very much .
This is what happens when the friggin ’ government confuses the free market with monopolies .
There ’s only one cable company in town .
I ’ll have to get a dish if I want the service I ’ve paid for .
Mind you , the fiber - optic cable laid in the street was financed with my tax money .
Paid for by me , but owned by the cable monster .
It ’s enough to turn a guy into a frothing socialist .
Okay , I ’m done complaining .
Here ’s the marketing lesson : I ’ve run my biz as a two - person shop for years .
This means that , occasionally , things slipped through cracks , and customers rightly got frustrated and angry .
But here ’s the kicker :
Whenever that happened , we promptly took CARE of the problem as soon as it came to our attention .
We never outsourced customer management … because the first rule of Operation MoneySuck is to pay attention to where the money ’s coming from .
Duh .
The cable companies — and every other monopoly joint in the culture — TALK a good game of customer relations … but it ’s ALL talk .
I can easily imagine the meeting where they planned out the flowchart their robot would use with complaining customers .
They must have been laughing their asses off , coming up with new tortures to inflict ( like asking if your TV was “ on ” ) .
It ’s plausible , and you know I ’m right .
That meeting really could have been a laugh - parade of evil - minded employees … because none of them CARED about the customer .
They would collect their paycheck regardless .
They were , in fact , as removed from Operation MoneySuck as a person could be .
As an entrepreneur or small business owner , you cannot allow this mindset of “ screw ‘em , we already got their money ” to infect your operations .
I ’ve consulted with small biz who wanted to buy an automated answering system … and the reason was always the same :
It was a HASSLE dealing with unhappy customers personally .
Well , too bad , I told them .
I do n’t believe the customer is “ always right ” , because there ARE plenty of insane assholes out there .
But until you can VERIFY that any complainer IS insane or an asshole … you must assume he ’s a good guy who got screwed in your system .
And what he wants is nothing elaborate .
I have been close to every customer we ’ve had for five years now , and I hear Diane dealing with them in the next office every day .
No matter how mad they are to start with … it ’s EASY to end their frustration , which is usually the source of the anger .
We ’ll either fix the problem asap , or refund them , or do whatever else is required to be fair .
It ’s not brain surgery .
The LAST thing you want to do with an angry customer … is to pitch them for more money .
That ’s just stupid … and makes me think your entire organization is stupid .
For me , that means going to a dish .
The cable company will care not a whit that I ’ve left , because they believe their monopoly is solid .
But multiply me by a thousand , or ten thousand , and you ’ve got a problem .
Even worse , how could the cable company know that I ’m not wired into the city council … where their tidy little monopoly is vulnerable ?
Treating customers well is the first casualty of growing too big , and getting to comfy .
( For a more grisly example , check out the way the Walter Reed Hospital story played out — thinking they were immune , the idiots running the joint refused to fix problems when it would have been easy … and one day they woke up being the face of a national scandal . )
Human problems require human solutions .
The company that realizes this will thrive , with or without a monopoly .
Slogans and robots do not replace human connections .
HAL — the misunderstood computer in the movie “ 2001 ″ — eventually got his ass handed to him , and audiences cheered .
Because it ’s no fun swearing at a robot that can not be insulted .
Stay frosty .

Introducing the Gutsy Gibbon
Folks , allow me to introduce the Gutsy Gibbon , who will be succeeding the Feisty Fawn as the focus of our development love in a few short weeks , for release in October 2007 .
The Gibbon won the G - race to be our engineering mascot for this next release , but it was a close run .
We very much wanted to honour the tremendous contributions of the GNU project to Free Software by awarding the role to the Glossy Gnu .
This prompted an intense internal debate about trademarks , at which both the Fiery Fox and the Icy Weasel were heard .
In the end , however , the judge , jury and elocutionary ( that would be me ) took a liking to the Gibbon 's extraordinary reach , and the Gibbon won outright .
The Glossy Gnu will nonetheless play a role in this next release , because Ubuntu 7.10 will feature a new flavour - as yet unnamed - which takes an ultra - orthodox view of licensing : no firmware , drivers , imagery , sounds , applications , or other content which do not include full source materials and come with full rights of modification , remixing and redistribution .
There should be no more conservative home , for those who demand a super - strict interpretation of the " free " in free software .
This work will be done in collaboration with the folks behind Gnewsense .
Our Gutsy is an expert in brachiation , which is apt for a project that needs to navigate a complicated forest of branches very quickly .
Some folks would say that any monkey can install Ubuntu ( and sadly , other folks would say that many have ) , but the Gibbon will take easy installation to a whole new level , with work on an unattended - installation infrastructure in Ubiquity that makes it trivial to roll out Ubuntu desktops across an organization while getting on with other , more complicated stuff such as Windows service pack installations on legacy desktops .
While Ubuntu is by no means the 800 - pound gorilla in the server game , the Gibbon will show that lean and mean count for something !
Agility of deployment , together with integrated management will be a focus for the Ubuntu server team .
Gutsy will not be an LTS ( Long Term Support ) release , but it will nonetheless see a lot of server work and be useful for fast - moving server deployments .
On a personal note , the monkey on my back has been composite - by - default , which I had hoped would happen in Edgy , then Feisty .
I 'm nervous to predict it now for Gutsy , for fear of a third strike , but I 'm told that great work is being done in the Compiz / Beryl community and upstream in X .
There 's a reasonable chance that Gutsy will deliver where those others have not .
I remain convinced that malleable , transparent and extra-dimensional GUI 's are a real opportunity for the free software community to take a lead in the field of desktop innovation , and am keen to see the underlying technologies land in Ubuntu , but we have to balance that enthusiasm with the Technical Board 's judgement of the stability and maturity of those fundamental layers .
Of course , the real work of deciding Gutsy 's goals will happen at UDS - Sevilla , May 5 - 11 in the wonderful Andalucia , Spain .
I hope many of you will be joining us for some hard work and also , no doubt , a fair bit of monkey business !
As usual we will be running a semi-virtual summit , open for participation by VoIP and real - time online editing of the blueprints for Gutsy Gibbon .
If you have items you want on the agenda , please make sure they are in the Ubuntu blueprints list : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu ... and then also nominate them for discussion at UDS - Sevilla !
Please only do this if you intend to participate in the developer summit - either in person or virtually - so that you can present your ideas and collaborate with the other developers .
The summit should be a great combination of hard work planning Gutsy , presentations from cutting edge upstreams on their own plans for this next six months , and some time in the sun for R&R in the best tradition of the region .
For those of you who can't make it across the Atlantic , we hope to see you for Gutsy + 1 at UDS - Boston in the first week of November .
Now that the Fawn has found her legs , and is ready for her debut on April 19th , we need to lay some foundations for Gutsy .
In the next few days we will open up a limited - upload target for Gutsy and start uploading toolchain packages there .
Our aim is to open Gutsy for general upload on the same day that Feisty is released .
Wherever you are , that will be a day for celebration .
Go ape !

Woke Up This Mornin’ Posted on January 7th , 2015 by superadmin
CapnPseudo says , “ I learned this from my father when I was a kid , and apparently it was something kids sang in his elementary sometime in the early 70’s . ”
When I woke up this mornin’ ,
I looked upon the wall ,
the boogies and the bedbugs
were playing a game of ball .
The score was 6 to nothing ,
The boogies were ahead ,
The bedbugs knocked a homer
and knocked me out of bed
When I woke up this mornin’ ,
the coffe was so stale ,
It tasted like tobac-y juice
‘ right outta the garbage pale .
The Indian rubber beefsteak ,
The insulated cheese ,
the weenies took a flip - flop
and landed in the peas .

Former US attorney : Charges may be filed in US attorney firings scandal RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print This Email
This
Two of the former US attorneys at the center of the attorney firings scandal believe that criminal charges could be brought against high level Justice Department employees , reports the Seattle Times .
John McKay , who was a US attorney for Washington state , and David Iglesias , who was the attorney for New Mexico , told the Seattle Times that they think White House adviser Karl Rove and his aides were behind the firings of selected US attorneys last December .
" I think there will be a criminal case that will come out of this , " McKay said .
" This is going to get worse , not better . "
McKay said he believes that there is a possibility of obstruction - of - justice charges being filed .
" McKay cited ongoing investigations into the dismissals by the Senate and House Judiciary committees , and inquiries now under way by the Justice Department 's inspector general and its Office of Professional Responsibility , " writes David Bowermaster .
The firings of Iglesias and Carol Lam , the former San Diego US attorney , provide the most solid evidence for obstruction - of - justice charges , according to McKay .
" There was an attempt to inject the virus of partisan politics into the prosecutorial process , " Iglesias said .
" That 's been stopped because of Congressional oversight and because of media scrutiny . "
Excerpts follow : # McKay and Iglesias also have both concluded that the White House was behind the firings .
They based their conclusions on thousands of pages of documents released by the Justice Department in recent weeks , as well as hours of public testimony by senior Justice Department officials and press reports of private depositions those officials gave to congressional investigators .
" It seems that given that no one takes credit at the Justice Department , that it can only be coming from one place , and that very strongly means the White House , " McKay said .

The Top 10 Arguments Against DRM
One question we get a lot here at LearnOutLoud is why we 've chosen to go DRM - free with our digital downloads .
I 've explained it to a number of people and written a number of posts about it but I 've never summarized our reasons for going the DRM - free route in one post before .
So here goes ...
( And if you have no idea what I 'm talking about or what DRM is please click here . )
1. DRM does n't prevent illegal use of files , it just makes it a bit more difficult to access them .
A lot of publishers are under the impression that once you put DRM on a file nothing bad will happen to that file ever .
It just ai n't so .
There are a multitude of tools out there that allow you to strip DRM off of files relatively easily .
So while DRM might make illegal sharing a bit more difficult if someone really wants an unprotected / unencrypted version of the file it 's not very hard to do this .
This is an important point because ...
2 . All it takes is one person to crack the file and it can be made available to everyone .
Most illegal trading of files happens over P2P networks .
The thing with P2P networks is that it only takes one copy of a file to be unencrypted / unprotected to have that file be available to all .
Check any P2P search engine and you 'll find a multitude of titles that are supposed to only be available for sale online as protected files .
Of course , there is one other possibility ...
3 . Anyone selling content on CD is already selling unprotected files anyway .
With the exception of debacles like the Sony rootkit , 99 + % of all CDs sold contain unencrypted files .
This means that anyone who sells content on CDs is making unprotected content available and that putting those files online is as easy as ripping them to MP3 files , a pretty simple task these days .
What boggles my mind is record companies and publishers who are willing to make content available unprotected on CD but for some reason insist on copy protection for digitally downloaded files .
Especially considering that ...
4. DRM adds a lot of costs for content producers - Implementing DRM is n't free of course .
The costs to develop and / or license DRM technology , encode media files and deal with a multitude of DRM - related customer service complaints are usually passed on from the retailers to the content producers .
What this means is that content producers make significantly less money selling DRM " protected " content than they do selling DRM - free content .
Royalty rates offered to many content producers from online retailers are often pitifully low and DRM is typically used as a main reason why this is so .
That 's a shame .
Of course that 's not the only cost ...
5 . There 's a huge hidden cost in trying to sell DRM 'ed content -
In addition to the many costs of implementing DRM for content there 's a cost that is often overlooked :
The sales you lose because people do n't want to buy DRM 'ed content or have incompatible players .
This is huge .
There is a growing number of people who wo n't buy any content that has DRM .
In addition , because there is no universally compatible DRM standard , many people can't buy your content if they do n't have a compatible player .
For instance , if you only sell your content with Apple 's Fairplay DRM all of the people getting Zunes during the holidays wo n't buy you content because it wo n't play on your player ( and vice versa of course ) .
So by implementing DRM you are losing out on a significant ( and unknown ) amount of revenue .
So those are five good reasons why content producers should n't implement DRM .
Let 's take a look at five good reasons why DRM hurts consumers ...
6 . Often the costs of the DRM are passed along to the consumer as well .
Since DRM is n't free someone has to pay for it .
Sometimes it's the content producer in the form of reduced royalties .
Other times it 's the consumer .
Take the example of eMusic and Apple iTunes .
iTunes tracks sell for 99 cents while eMusic tracks sell for 25 cents .
One of the reasons why eMusic can sell its music for so much cheaper is that it is n't spending tons of money implementing a DRM system and dealing with customers who are having DRM issues .
So it is able to offer a technically superior product for a significantly lower price .
Which is good and even better when you consider that ...
7. DRM - free content will play on your device of today and your device of tomorrow - It 'll be a little shocker for some people in a few weeks when they get the new Zune device from Microsoft and try to load all of their Rhapsody or MSN Music tunes on it only to find that they wo n't work .
Why ?
Because Microsoft 's previous DRM ( PlaysForSure ) is n't compatible with the new Zune DRM .
And that 's an example of one of the biggest problems with DRM .
It locks you into a specific player from a specific company .
While that might be good for a hardware manufacturer like Microsoft or Apple it 's not good for you the consumer .
Want another reason ?
Consider that ...
8 . Your media devices of the future will be significantly different than your media devices of the present .
I discussed this point at length in my post The 5 Dangers of Buying DRM'ed Media .
There 's a really good chance that your next media player wo n't be an iPod and that in the not - too - distant future it'll probably be your cellphone .
If that 's the case then you need to be aware that any DRM - encoded content that you buy probably wo n't work for you anymore .
While millions of cellphones are currently shipping that play MP3 files , very few of them will play songs from iTunes or audiobooks from Audible.com .
So if you 're at all interested in being able to play your content ( the stuff you paid hard - earned money for ) in the future you should think twice before buying anything infected with DRM .
Furthermore ...
9. DRM fundamentally changes who is control of your media .
This might be the most esoteric of the arguments and is a bit difficult to explain but in a nutshell , when you buy DRM content for the first time in history , someone else is dictating to you what you can do with something that you 've legally purchased .
Watch this short video from the great folks over at DefectiveByDesign which illustrates this point nicely :
Finally , it 's really important to understand that ...
10 .
Whenever you buy DRM 'ed content you support the system of DRM - I buy DRM 'ed content from time to time like most of you .
However , I have realized that with each purchase of DRM 'ed content I help to perpetuate a system in which DRM is acceptable .
And at the same time , whenever I frequent a site that offers DRM - free content I 'm helping to support a system in which DRM is viewed as unacceptable and a bad business practice .
There are a ton of good sites out that offer DRM - free content ( here 's another great list ) and they could use your support .

May 7 , 2007  --
" Proving the existence of God is actually a lot easier than you think , " said former child star Kirk Cameron , minutes before taking the stage for the " Nightline Face - Off . "
It was a warm Saturday night in New York City as a mixed crowd of atheists and Christians converged on Calvary Baptist Church in midtown Manhattan for the first " Nightline Face - Off . "
And it was n't long before temperatures began to rise inside the auditorium .
The question for our debate was " Does God Exist ? " and both sides went at the issue with a series of passionate declarations and critical attacks on the arguments of their opponents .
It was a clean but unflinching contest .
Former child star Kirk Cameron and his evangelist colleague Ray Comfort had pledged to prove the existence of God , scientifically .
Cameron and Comfort run an organization called the Way of the Master , which comprises a Web site and cable television show , all focused on preaching what they say is the truth of Christianity .
Cameron opened the debate by addressing the crowd :
Hi , I'm Kirk Cameron and my partner and I Ray Comfort come to you tonight not as molecular biologists or rocket scientists , but simply as an author and an actor , and we want to do two things that fly in the face of convention .
One , we 'd like to show you that the existence of God can be proven , 100 percent , absolutely , without the use of faith .
And secondly , as a former atheist myself -- an evolutionist -- I want to pull back the curtain and show that the number one reason that people do n't believe in God is not a lack in evidence , but because of a theory that many scientists today believe to be a fairytale for grownups .
They were confronted by the might of the " rational response squad " — in the form of unabashed atheists Brian Sapient and his comrade , a woman who goes by the name of Kelly .
They had been included in a previous " Nightline " report , telling the story of the Blasphemy Challenge in which they invited atheists to deny the existence of the Holy Spirit by posting videotaped denunciations on their Web site .
Comfort saw the piece on the Blasphemy Challenge , and he immediately e-mailed " Nightline , " saying , " We would like to challenge them to a public debate . …
Let 's hear their best evidence as to why God does n't exist , and let the audience decide whose evidence is based on faith and whose is based on fact .
We cannot only prove that God exists , but we can prove that the atheist does n't . "
Sapient had this to say when he addressed the crowd at the debate :
" I want to start off by thanking ABC , Kirk and Ray and the audience for their ears and their participation of the discussion of this magnitude .
The Rational Response Squad was formed to respond to irrational claims , and the most wildly held irrational claim are the ones offered by religion .
Ray and Kirk have agreed to offer scientific proof that god exists without invoking faith of the Bible , and we are here to respond to those claims .
For more than 90 minutes , they battled over the main arguments of evolution , historical evidence and the existence of God .
The audience , which was divided between Christians and atheists , asked penetrating questions , and there were also a number of contributions submitted by viewers at ABCNEWS.com .
It was a no -holds - barred debate that was well worth watching .
My Foolish Money Mistakes : Moves That Cost Me More Than $ 1,000 Each
Let me share with you some of my money confessions .
Everyone ’s had their share of silly money mistakes in their lives .
The web is full of such confessions , so I thought it ’s about time I owned up to my own list .
There were some moves I made that may only look bad in hindsight , of course — such as stock market based decisions and calculated investment maneuvers that have gone south .
If these had turned out well for me , then I would n’t be thinking of them necessarily as mistakes , but rather as lucky or even smartly ( ! ) performed strategies .
So who knows how many successful investments I ’ve made that could ’ve turned sour instead and thus could ’ve made it into this list ?
How many of these lucky moves have we crowed about and claimed to be the consequence of a skillful hand or a sharp mind ?
What I ’m really trying to say is that a “ mistake ” is an action that goes against proper reasoning at a given point in time , and is not necessarily defined by its consequences or repercussions .
Many times , I ’ve done stupid and foolish things that have resulted in monetary gains , due to good fortune .
And many other times , I ’ve made what I believed were solid , well thought out decisions that have ended up in financial loss .
With these technical clarifications , I now present a few screw ups that have defined a few lives … mine and some of those close to me .
What follows are some lessons that have come out of our lives … real stories of MY screw ups !
Financial Mistakes That Have Cost Me ( Or Someone I Know ) Over $ 1,000 Each
Investing Errors
Not diversifying a high valued portfolio
This is our biggest mistake to date .
It ’s very easy for greed to rise proportionately to confidence begotten from a rapidly rising highly concentrated stock portfolio .
Once upon a time , we held onto a single stock that did incredibly well , and once upon a time , it was valued at levels I have n’t seen since .
We had earmarked this position for our retirement needs .
Unfortunately , for various reasons , we sold our position right when the stock dropped , and there went our glorious retirement .
We ’re now in a new chapter in our lives — no , still pre-retirement but trying out entrepreneurship — but with hopefully a better ending .

Shorting on the way down
I was young , naive and emotional , and what a combustible combination that was !
There I was trying to time the market during Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait in September of 1990 .
Earlier on , I had invested my entire savings of $ 10,000 on July 1990 into a single stock riding on the back and erstwhile popularity of its # 1 celebrity endorser , Michael Jackson .
How could I have known that a war was just around the corner ?
I sold the stock when the market tanked in the fall of 1990 for a 50 % loss .
With my net worth on the line , I reacted by promptly trying to salvage something by shorting the market .
I lost more during the serious market swings that followed .
Thank you L.A. Gear for teaching me a lesson and the value of risk management .

Joining network marketing efforts
Heard of Amway ?
I heard of it everywhere .
Everyone was in one MLM scheme or other .
I did n’t want to be the odd person out so I joined Sprint ’s direct marketing gang .
I learned then that I was a lousy salesperson — that lesson set me back $ 300.00 .
At least , I got off easy compared to peers who hoarded Amway products to resell , who attended seminars and training sessions in far flung places and who purchased Amway motivational tapes to keep them going .
Instead , they lost bucks in the thousands .

Committing to huge expenses while our portfolio was rising
There was a time not too long ago that we were sitting pretty on a pile of dough when our highly concentrated stock position was peaking .
That time , we did not necessarily feel it was peaking as it was simply rising in a straight up trajectory with no end in sight .
While this was happening , we felt confident enough to embark on a house project which involved a room remodel .
Though the price quote was steep ( it was for this type of work ) , we signed the builder ’s contract without hesitation knowing that we were flush .
Our mistake was to psychologically consider our paper wealth as real .
We did not redeem our position and instead rode the stock down , subsequently making us feel pretty pinched .
Moral of the story : do not use imaginary wealth to fund your big purchases !
Real Estate Errors
Not properly maintaining a house
Do n’t let your house fall into too much disrepair before you start fixing things .
When it comes to home maintenance , small problems grow larger quite easily when things are unattended .
I had owned an old house in the past whose needs I had ignored indefinitely .
I was a negligent homeowner .
When I sold that thing , I had to spend around $ 10,000 just to get it into the shape required for buyers to become interested .
My real estate agent told me that if I had properly cared for it throughout the years , I would n’t have had to fork out as much money on repairs when it came time to unload .

Prepaying for house maintenance
After I learned my lesson about avoiding delayed home maintenance , I overcompensated .
I was then convinced that the idea of hiring an outfit that does preventive and routine maintenance on houses was a good idea since it was meant to stave off bigger problems later .
Also , some outfits do exist that claim that altogether , their one stop shop provides cheaper service than if you hired different service providers that are more specialized : such as a chimney sweep , a contractor , an inspector , etc .
If you are n’t handy ( and we definitely are n’t ! ) , then this may sound attractive to you .
By being overly conscientious , I went for the service and ended up being overcharged for the jobs that were performed .
I guess there is such a thing as overkill .
The key to maintaining a house is to do so in moderation — do n’t wait too long for something to completely fall apart , but do n’t anticipate too early that something will .

Acting as my own general contractor
If you ’re skilled in the home building arena , then by all means , be your own general contractor .
There was one time when I tried to serve as the liaison between a designer and a builder while we were in the midst of a home project .
I ended up in a dispute with the architect / designer because I had failed to communicate his important figures to the builder .
This cost us $ 1,500 .
Now if instead I had made sure to hire someone who was both willing to stand as both a designer and contractor for the given project , then if communication problems arise , they would have accountability , while I would have a leg to stand on in small claims court .
Even better , they would have known what they were doing .

Landlording at a distance without a property management company to help
Goodness knows how many people are able to manage something like this .
We ’re just not able to .
We lost money because we tried to be landlords for far flung properties without hiring a property management company to represent us locally .
In the end , we were defrauded by some tenants who refused to pay the rent for a few months and who decided to trash our property before vanishing .
Money and Life Management Errors
Lending money and expecting it to be returned
I have known for a long time that when I “ lend ” money to a friend or family member without virtue of a contract of any sort , I should just basically write it off and treat it as a gift .
But silly me , still holding out on the hope that someone will pay me back the hundreds of dollars that I ’ve spent on them .
I ’m talking about several hundred PER “ borrower ” here , so I ’m out a good amount .

I ’m talking about several hundred PER “ borrower ” here , so I ’m out a good amount .
Buying expensive items nobody uses
Whenever we buy something , it ’s always under the guise of good intentions .
For example , we bought a mountain bike so that the digerati spouse could use it for exercise .
You can count in one hand the number of times that bike was used this winter .
Or what about the wardrobe upgrade I underwent right before I got pregnant .
Now since I have not gone back to my pre-pregnancy size , those lovely coats , shoes and suits have been abandoned , and given away .
I was also dumb enough to buy a whole outfit for a sporting competition that I never joined .
It cost me $ 750.00 .
What about those occasional fancy food ingredients you never get to use , but which you discover at the back of your fridge 6 months later ?

Disorganization with financial material
I have been quite disappointed in my recent efforts to be organized .
I could definitely improve on this front .
In the past , I have kicked myself in the behind for ridiculous memory lapses that have led to lost money : Forgetting or losing checks that are received Not tracking financial transactions properly
Not paying bills on time
I have been quite disappointed in my recent efforts to be organized .
I could definitely improve on this front .
In the past , I have kicked myself in the behind for ridiculous memory lapses that have led to lost money : Falling for scams
For this one , do n’t look at me .
I ’m hard to scam .
Or so I thought until I wrote up this list , and some memories came flooding back to me .
But the sad thing is that my extended family has indeed suffered large financial losses through fraud perpetrated by individuals they ’ve trusted .
The losses were large , but not serious enough to affect their economic status .
Because of such episodes , I ’m learning to watch my transactions much more carefully and now I ’m what you may call a queen of financial paranoia .

Because of such episodes , I ’m learning to watch my transactions much more carefully and Not backing up my computer
Again , inertia will come to claim your computer data if you ’re not careful .
Set up a backup and recovery service for your computer as insurance against data loss or you ’ll be out something like the thousand plus dollars ( $ 1,000 + ) I paid for restoring my disk drive .
All in all , I must have lost in the zillions of dollars due to these boo - boos that have happened throughout my life .
Now take into consideration the opportunity cost and power of compounding that these dollars would have made me if properly invested and my losses would be in the gazillions .
Gah !
Unfortunately , it ’s not easy to learn from some of these mistakes .
We end up committing the same errors over and over , just in a different form .
At least I have — and yes , even at this age .
Human nature and its imperfections , greed and fear , can have such a resounding grip on us that we do n’t very easily break out of behavioral patterns that have caused us grief in the past .
But being aware of our follies should help us manage ourselves and financial situations better .
At least it ’s a good step in the right direction .

in response to Jens Eckels ( Microsoft , IntelliJ and Sun 's NetBeans remain the only significant bastions ) .
Enterprise adoption of Eclipse grows rapidly as Eclipse - based tooling becomes a standard , not an exception .
There is a broad range between ' exception ' and ' standard ' , and to claim that Microsoft , IntelliJ and NetBeans remain ' the only significant bastions ' is a rather skewed view of things .
For example , NetBeans shows no sign of decline , indeed it is gathering more support .
I see a real problem with one IDE becoming truly dominant ( a status Eclipse has not yet reached ) , in that it gives too much control over how Java is used to the IDE .
I have seen this happen in a group that used Eclipse - they held back on adoption of Java 5 because Eclipse did not support it .
( Fortunately , I had the choice of using NetBeans , which had supported Java 5 for some time at that point ) .
Imagine that kind of decision - making industry - wide .
Eclipse has led the way in terms of some IDE features ( refactoring , for example ) , but in other ways it has been far behind , relying on plugins for what many of us think should be core features ( JEE support , GUI design ) .
What we need is choice .
To get that choice we want more than one IDE ; instead , there should be better mechanisms for transferring projects and plug-ins between IDEs - we really need JSR 198 .
My wish for the 10th birthday of Eclipse is that it remains a widepread and highly popular IDE , but others remain to give developers choice , and moving between IDEs and is far easier than now , with an increasing number of portable plug-ins .
On a side issue , I will make another prediction about Eclipse on that birthday , just to add a bit more controversy :
It will use Swing .
Good luck to Eclipse , but this article seems to me to present a rather arrogant attitude ( of course , that does not mean it is wrong ! )

Well , that 's only to be expected as the author represents a vendor ( MyEclipse ) that has a vested interest in seeing Eclipse completely dominate the market .
NetBeans looks exciting but I suspect large scale adoption of NetBeans will depend to a certain extent on how quickly major app server vendors release JEE compliant versions and how receptive customers will be in embracing JEE .
Not sure how users will warm up to the so - called SOA development features in NB ( BPEL , JBI , OpenESB etc. ) as the major SOA infrastructure vendors will most likely base their tooling around Eclipse plug-ins and for their customers there wo n't be much of a choice .

IntelliJ has always been the leader in this space .
If the future world of java is one where one MUST use an IDE to do the job AND one MUST use one and only one IDE then it's way past time to move on to Ruby ...
A real value would be if people writing plugins could target a generic API so that we could all experience the great refactoring abilities of IntelliJ along side the great maven integration of NetBeans and great modelling and DB tools from Eclipse .
I hate to fan the flames , but the original article is a troll anyway .

However , it will be interesting to see how IntelliJ fares in an increasingly FOSS Java world .</blockquote >
Considering that a $ 500 / license tool has been able to stand up against a number of free tools for at least 5 years , I 'd say it 's faring quite well :)

Agreed .
As of right now , I see Jetbrains lack of support for maven ( it had been slated for version 6 , but the dropped it when they decided to build their own build environment ) as a sign that they are losing their way a bit in this regard .
Hands down they have the best core IDE .
However , if they fight open source rather than embrace it , they will become more and more of a niche product .
Albeit , a very nice one at the core .

in response to Steve Zara
No need to be afraid , Eclipse is not going to ... eclipse all the other players , at least as long as NetBeans is out there .
Open source communities do n't vanish , although some companies might want that to happen ;)
Btw , I was playing with NetBeans during weekend and created this little flash demo ... can you show me how to create such an application in few minutes with Eclipse ( and only with free tools ) ?
At the Tech days in Prague my keynote demo was about databinding support for Matisse ... yes we have a solution today ( it just needs to be QA'ed and finished , but it works ) .
Time to ask Eclipse - where is the release - quality support for Java EE 5 ? ( is it 7 months to go to the Europa release ? ) .
Where is the ease of use in Visual Editor ?
Where do I get good Mobility tools on the Eclipse platform ?
What is Eclipse 's / SWT 's answer to the improvements in Swing ( which btw influences the platform competition ) ?
And so on ...
We 've learned our lessons and worked hard to add features our community was asking for ( yes better editor is the last large missing piece , check out latest daily builds , better editor is on the way ) ... now it 's time for Eclipse to get some important work done .

in response to Roman Strobl I really want to switch to Netbeans , but I can't , because Netbeans is not doing things well and right !
Seems to me , they just want to add more and more features .
Matisse is a dictator GUI designer !
For any kind of modifications , you have to use the GUI builder , it does n't allow you to modify the generated code the way you want !
To me this means putting limitations on developer 's creativity .
Based on my experience , to get a job 100 % done , always you have to do some manual modifications to the generated code !
From code completion and code suggestion perspective , Netbeans is really lags behind Eclipse .
The good news is that , according to Roman , they are working on this ( is n't it too late ? ) .
To create an Enterprise Application in Netbeans , you have to have the application server setup first , whereas in Eclipse ( WTP ) , this is not a must , you can start and continue coding using " J2EE Runtime Library " .
Also , Eclipse does support more application servers by default .
As a java developer , I really do n't care so much about visual web design !
What I 'm looking for is a strong integration and good support for all major application servers .
Below is a list of application servers supported by WTP vs NetBeans : WTP ===============================
Apache Tomcat v3.2 Apache Tomcat v4.0 Apache Tomcat v4.1 Apache Tomcat v4.0 Apache Tomcat v5.5 Generic BEA WebLogic Server v8.1 Generic BEA WebLogic Server v9.0 Generic BEA WebLogic Server v9.2 IBM WebSphere v6.0 J2 EE Runtime Library JBoss v3.2.3 JBoss v4.0 JOnAS v4 Oracle OC4J Standalone 10.1.3 Geronimo v1.0 Geronimo v1.1 WebSphere Application server Community Edition v1.0 Pramati 4.1.x NetBeans =================================
BEA Weblogic Server 9 JBoss Application server 4 Sun java system Application Server Tomcat 5.0 Tomcat 5.5 Reply to this Reply to original

in response to Mohammad wrk Hi Mohammed , As for Matisse you can modify the generated code .
Choose a component , go to the properties window and choose the Code tab .
Now you can override code Matisse generates and replace the code by your own .
Two - way editing is really hard to be done correctly , so this is how we solve the problem .
Yes Eclipse is indeed superior in coding and this will be fixed in NetBeans 6.0 .
It 's never too late to add features people ask for :)
As for integration with application servers , the old versions of Tomcat are in my opinion obsolete .
NetBeans also supports WebSphere and JOnAS using plug-ins you can download separately .
I also do n't think the versions are strict - e.g. Weblogic plug - in supports both 9.0 and 9.2 .
So the lists are not that much different , if you include plug - ins you can get from the web .
You are right though , that there are more plug-ins for Eclipse than for NetBeans and we are working on supporting the community to write additional plug-ins .
We have launched a new partner program which will improve it and we 're hiring a community manager to work with the community in this regard .
And as our community grows , more and more plug-ins appear these days ( unlike 2 years ago when not many people cared about NetBeans ) .

in response to Roman Strobl Eclipse has always been intended for more than just Java development .
From the beginning , the entire point of Eclipse projects has been to create frameworks and platforms along with exemplary products .
These frameworks and platforms have been leveraged by many companies to make some great products .
This focus has evolved of late and projects are starting to put more work into polish .
A great example of this is BIRT .
In fact , there 's a demo on the BIRT site that shows off some pretty cool report generation : http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/examples/misc/BIRT2.1Demo/EclipseDemo.html
It 's a little on the long side ( 11 minutes ) , but it does have a lot of material to cover .
The point is that Eclipse is being used for Java development to be sure .
It is also a great platform for building rich client applications .
But there is so much more that you can do with Eclipse .

in response to Roman Strobl At the Tech days in Prague my keynote demo was about databinding support for Matisse ... yes we have a solution today ( it just needs to be QA'ed and finished , but it works ) .
Golly .
Eclipse has this also .
It was part of Eclipse 3.2 .
At the time , it was marked as provisional since the designers were n't totally happy with it .
It 's becoming official API with Eclipse 3.3 .
You can use it today ( many people already are ) .
I guess that you could say that it's in the later stages of QA , is basically finished and works pretty darned well .
Where is the release - quality support for Java EE 5 ? ( is it 7 months to go to the Europa release ? )
We can play the you - do n't - have - this - feature game all week .
However , it is unproductive .
The Eclipse Web Tools team is working hard to provide Java EE 5 support as part of the Europa simultaneous release ( http://www.eclipse.org/projects/europa.php).
Their project plan is posted so you can keep up with the functionality they 're working on and even get involved with the development by testing the various milestones that will be released leading up to the big event .
In the meantime , the Eclipse eco-system provides ( http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-req-viewcatlink-cid-9.html).
Where is the ease of use in Visual Editor ?
It 's coming .
The Visual Editor continues to evolve .
Personally , I like VE and do use it often .
It does n't support the GroupLayout yet : they decided to actually support existing layout managers and the whole round - trip engineering thing .
If VE is n't quite your cup of tea , the eco-system provides ( http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-req-viewcatlink-cid-18.html).
If you want to see a really good GUI builder , check out WindowBuilder ( which does support GroupLayout and round - tripping ) .
There are others , like Jigloo .
And then there are a bunch of specialty GUI builders .
There 's a tonne of options on EPIC .
Where do I get good Mobility tools on the Eclipse platform ?
http://www.eclipse.org/home/categories/embedded_device.php
What is Eclipse's / SWT 's answer to the improvements in Swing ( which btw influences the platform competition ) ?
This is just FUD .
What improvements ?
Be specific .
Where -- in your opinion -- is SWT not rising to the challenge ?
SWT continues to evolve to meet the needs of Eclipse developers .
There 's a lot of development teams out there pushing the limits of what can be done with SWT ; the SWT team has been responding .
Golly .

Yes , but what I heard from developers is that Matisse is easier to use and more powerful than any of these GUI builders ( which is the reason why MyEclipse includes it ) .
So I think the VE guys should realize that - but in the interview with them I heard that VE as a platform is more important than good usability of VE .
I do n't think that 's what the users are asking for but I might be wrong .

FYI - in recent version of NetBeans Mobility Pack we support SVG on mobile phones , Swing on CDC mobile phones , there 's complete support for CLDC , tools for device fragmentation , end - to - end solutions to access Java EE 5 backends from mobile devices , etc .
So I would like to see similar tools on the Eclipse platform , to compare .

in response to Roman Strobl Roman ; Since MyEclipse has become part of the conversation , I 'd like to point out that yes , we incorporated Matisse .
We did so for many reasons , most of which can be found here in Wayne Parrott 's blog .
But truly , I think that the fact that we were able to incorporate Matisse into Eclipse illustrates what my original post proposed .
Eclipse has approaching 150 member companies , and hundreds if not thousands of contributing developers .
If they collectively wanted to get together and focus on creating one killer feature , it would be a matter of time .
Instead , they choose to leave the platform concept intact and allow the various member companies ( like us ) to innovate and create .
The very ability to port NetBeans features into Eclipse , as we have shown , proves that the technology behind Eclipse is what makes it successful .
By incorporating Matisse , Genuitec showed that external technology ( yes , even Swing - based technology ) can be brought into the Eclipse ecosystem and innovated from the inside - out .
This is a strength of the Eclipse ecosystem .
Not a weakness .

in response to Roman Strobl Hi Beaton , good to see a reply from you :)
Actually , most people call me Wayne .
Though , I have been Beaton all my life ...
Good !
Which visual designers support it ?
That 's next .
VE is working on support .
I 'm not sure what the commercial folks are planning , but I 'd bet good money that Instantiations is going to support it .
I know it 's coming , I am just saying that if developers want to use opensource final - release quality tools for Java EE 5 today , they can use NetBeans .
Europa is 7 months away , right ? :)
Very deft use of the word " final " .
You 're right , Eclipse is n't fully there yet with a " final " release .
However , we have software .
The Dali project ( Yes , but what I heard from developers is that Matisse is easier to use and more powerful than any of these GUI builders ( which is the reason why MyEclipse includes it ) .
So I think the VE guys should realize that - but in the interview with them I heard that VE as a platform is more important than good usability of VE .
I do n't think that 's what the users are asking for but I might be wrong .
You 're probably wrong .
Be honest : you spend about as much time as I do talking with the converted .
So , of course the developers you talk to think that Matisse is easier .
Most of the folks that I talk to have heard about or have looked at Matisse and think it looks pretty neat but still do n't use it .
I played with it for a while and ( a ) managed to break it in about 10 minutes ; ( b ) got pissed off that I could n't edit existing windows ; and ( c ) got worried that I would n't be able to recover my work if I lost that silly " forms " file .
Before you answer " we 're working on it " , remember your response to my answer to the Java EE 5 question .
At the end of the day , I personally think that Matisse looks pretty cool , but frankly I do n't care ( and nor do most the developers I talk to ) .
When you 're building Eclipse RCP applications , you tend to build views that are individually relatively simple .
VE does a fine job on these .
And again , those developers who have more sophisticated GUI building requirements can turn to the eco-system can get mind - bendingly great tools ( that the developers I talk to say blow the doors off Matisse ) GUI building tools from companies like Instantiations ( who , incidently , have a great RCP builder application now ) .
FYI - in recent version of NetBeans Mobility Pack we support SVG on mobile phones , Swing on CDC mobile phones , there 's complete support for CLDC , tools for device fragmentation , end - to - end solutions to access Java EE 5 backends from mobile devices , etc .
So I would like to see similar tools on the Eclipse platform , to compare .
I guess that you did n't follow the link I gave .
Eclipse has a tonne of stuff in the mobile area , from eRCP and eSWT , through to device debugging and target management .
Sure , it does n't have the polish and shine that NetBeans does , but our eco-system is running with this stuff and is putting together some pretty slick products based on Eclipse technology .
At Eclipse , we do n't just hire a bunch of developers and set them off , great companies like Nokia , WindRiver , IBM , QNX , Freescale , TI , PalmSource , MentorGraphics / ATI , and more come to us and through us collaborate on projects that deliver the frameworks , platforms , and infrastructure they need to then go and build superior products .
In the process , they build exemplary tools .
These people all know quite a bit about building software for the various devices and know what they need to get the job done .
There 's already a lot of great stuff there .
Do we have a " Mobility Pack " today ?
no .
But real people are getting real work done and that 's what really counts , right ?
I 'll give an example , show me an application similar to Aerith , written in SWT .
Ah , you 've changed the focus ( more FUD Roman , shame on you ) .
But I can play this game to .
Show me a great GIS platform built using the NetBeans Rich Client Platform ( Actually , most people call me Wayne .

Very deft use of the word " final " .
You 're right , Eclipse is n't fully there yet with a " final " release .
However , we have software .
The Dali project ( http://www.eclipse.org/dali ) provides support for EJB 3.0 today .
And while it is not a " final release " , Eclipse projects do have a long history of high - quality milestone releases .
And still , there is the eco-system .
As Jens points out , Eclipse has traditionally been focused on providing frameworks and platforms that others can use to provide great functionality .
EPIC is packed with plug-ins for Eclipse that provide Jave EE 5 Functionality .
If you do n't want to hunt for plug-ins , there are more refined offerings available from folks like Genuitect , BEA , and IBM .
You can find these on eclipseplugincentral .
com

I guess that since nobody has built a reporting tool for NetBeans , that NetBeans can't do reporting , right ?

Well , to me sounds like this is a cheating answer - or in other words , _you_ are changing the focus . :-)
The question about Aerith is not concerning what kind of functionality Aerith is about ( it manages photos , but for the sake of this discussion it could be whatever else , an iTunes clone etc ... ) .
The point about Aerith is that it looks cool and is very rich of visual effects .
Now , let me restate the original question : does exist some SWT application which is so cool in visual effects as Aerith ?
From your answer pointing at GIS and whatever , I 'd say it does n't exist . :-)
But of course I can be wrong .

in response to Frank Bank Swing is the toolkit that needs to show the answers for the disaster it 's been over the years .
You can talk in 5 years or so when Java 6 has some decent penetration numbers .
Old debate , Frank .
Been through all this before , including showing you how Swing has been used even with current versions of Java for high - rated applications - even shrink - wrapped ones .
Last year a very widely used application - Maple - switched their interface to Swing .
Reviews included phrases like " spiffy new interface " and " Still , even such power users will find the new interface a pleasure to use " .
Swing certainly was something of a disaster , but that was a long time ago .
Time to put this old argument in the trash .

No dice Steve .
Java 6 is n't out yet , and most of have good vision .
The Swing disaster will be with for a long time to come .
OK then - here is a challenge - find me a review of the new Maple Swing interface that in any way backs up your view .
The fact is , that Swing can , and has , been used to develop first - class user interfaces .
If it was a disaster , then there would have been no commercial advantage in MyEclipse incorporating Mattise .

Once again Steve , your solipsism is predictable , but boring .

Hell , even the open source desktop guys do n't touch that Swing crap with a 10 - foot pole .
It looks like crap on every desktop .
If only Sun had n't gone the emulation route .

Sure , Swing has had a long history of sucking .

Some of us have moved on .
I do n't consider following what MyEclipse are doing to be grasping at straws ...

There are plenty of open source Swing projects , and open source JRE developers have been working to get Swing support going in their runtimes .
The Kaffe guys have been doing it , and so have GNU classpath .
I find this exciting , not boring .
They seem to have abandoned the 10 - foot pole .
Not only that , this year the Harmony managed to run JEdit , and they were " proud " to demonstrate it .

You may say Swing looks like crap , but surely what matters is the users .
More reviews of Maple : " Many things can be done faster , more intuitively , more productively and more enjoyably … " ( Scientific Computing World ) " Maple 10's most obvious strengths are in the friendly developments to its general interface ... " ( also Scientific Computing World )
" The new Maple interface is the most exciting development I ’ve seen in highend mathematics packages in several years . "
( Desktop Engineering ) Emulation is a great way to do things .
Even SWT does it , by emulating components that are n't present on some systems .

I do n't know what * you * have move on to , but Swing 's problems have n't really " moved on " until Java 6 - and even then , there is always going to be problems with emulation .

Of course Kaffe and Classpath are doing Swing .
They 're recreating Java SE for Christ 's sake !
But if you 're going to bring up that irrelevance , you should also note that Classpath is using native peers , like OSX .

I never said that NOBODY had ever used Swing .

Sorry , but you can't have it both ways ; first say that the open source guys are n't touching Swing with a 10 - foot pole , but then explain how they are implementing it .
Maple is completely irrelevant .

No , what you said was that " It looks like crap on every desktop . "
Maple is highly relevant , as it is a very widely used and popular application present on a range of platforms , and praised for the high standard of its Swing interface .
It shows that your generalisation is wrong .

Sure .
It means Swing is improving even more , and will have more fidelity with ' native systems ' .
I never said Swing could not improve ...
The point I have demonstrated beyond doubt is that developers have already been using Swing to produce high - quality and well - reviewed user interfaces for years .
One of the reasons I picked Maple ( apart from the fact it so widely used ) is that the developers achieved this with some time ago , with Java 1.4 , so any idea that you will have to wait for Java 6 is plainly wrong .
Why am I arguing here ?
Because I am curious as to why Java is still being judged by the way it was 5 or more years ago .
I find it strange that in an industry where there is so much change , that ideas in some areas are so fixed .

Steve I thought this was such a simple concept , that it would n't have to be explained to you .
I 'm not talking about people that are implementing Java SE .
Obviously they would be implementing Swing , with native peers ( like it should have been done by Sun ) .
It 's about application developers whose applications get put in a repository in the open source desktop world .
o , what you said was that " It looks like crap on every desktop . "
Maple is highly relevant , as it is a very widely used and popular application present on a range of platforms , and praised for the high standard of its Swing interface .

No , Swing does look like crap on every desktop .
The people who made Maple decided that Swing looking like crap was outweighed by whatever perceived benefits they came up with for programming with the Swing API .
Sure .
It means Swing is improving even more , and will have more fidelity with ' native systems ' .
I never said Swing could not improve ...
Except Sun blundered by starting from the wrong end .
They should have been emulating what needed to be emulated and using native peers for what they can .

Steve , I could produce a usable interface using Ncurses .

in response to Frank Bank Sorry , but you can't have it both ways ; first say that the open source guys are n't touching Swing with a 10 - foot pole , but then explain how they are implementing it .
Steve I thought this was such a simple concept , that it would n't have to be explained to you .
I 'm not talking about people that are implementing Java SE .
Obviously they would be implementing Swing , with native peers ( like it should have been done by Sun ) .
It 's about application developers whose applications get put in a repository in the open source desktop world .
You mean like Sourceforce ?
Searching for Java Swing gives 13,284 results .
Try it for yourself , and see the results .
Your statement that open source developers are n't willing to touch Swing could not be more clearly shown to be wrong .
No , what you said was that " It looks like crap on every desktop . "
Maple is highly relevant , as it is a very widely used and popular application present on a range of platforms , and praised for the high standard of its Swing interface .
It shows that your generalisation is wrong .
No , Swing does look like crap on every desktop .
The people who made Maple decided that Swing looking like crap was outweighed by whatever perceived benefits they came up with for programming with the Swing API .
No , sorry , you can't get away with this .
Maple has been specifically praised for the look and quality of its interface .
You can't twist this into some kind of ease of development motivation for developers .
Maple is a product that works graphically - the quality of the interface is important .
Except Sun blundered by starting from the wrong end .
They should have been emulating what needed to be emulated and using native peers for what they can .
Which is irrelevant .
Yes , I agree that they blundered with Swing at the start .
Not because of using native peers ( anyway that term is meaningless on many platforms ) , but because they lifted the design wholesale from a Smalltalk system , which was far more highly tuned to the Swing approach .
It has taken years to overcome the performance issues that resulted from that .
But we are n't talking about then .
We are talking about the past few years .
The point I have demonstrated beyond doubt is that developers have already been using Swing to produce high - quality and well - reviewed user interfaces for years .
One of the reasons I picked Maple ( apart from the fact it so widely used ) is that the developers achieved this with some time ago , with Java 1.4 , so any idea that you will have to wait for Java 6 is plainly wrong .
Steve , I could produce a usable interface using Ncurses .
That does n't change the fact that it 's going to be quite unappealing on a modern desktop .
Yeah , I can produce a usable interface using Swing .
That does n't change the fact that pre-Java 6 Swing looks like crap .
Again , it is not about a usable interface , in Swing or ncurses .
It is about an interface that has been specifically reviewed and praised as being attractive and appealing .
Here is another review : " The most obvious addition is a sparkling new graphical user interface .... "

Thousands of them .
Come on ...
First you say that " even the open source desktop guys do n't touch that Swing crap with a 10 - foot pole . "
Apart , of course , from the open source Java implementors .
Then you say that those do n't count , so I show you over 13,000 projects on Sourceforce in Swing .
Then you say that those do n't count , because you are labelling 13,000 projects " random crap that nobody cares about " and you need to see real applications that people use and are in distro repositories .
Well , that is going to be hard to find , is n't it ?
Because almost all distro repositories contain pure FOSS , and Swing support on FOSS Java implementations is still being worked on !
Well done : you have kept moving the goalposts until they are just close enough together to exclude Swing apps .
There are , of course , plenty of Swing apps that run on Linux .
At least 13,000 of them !
( And , of course , Maple ) .

And , of course , any reviewer or user who disagrees with you must be blind .

You are out of date here as well .
Swing is showing more market penetration than even GUI systems designed specifically for Windows : from indeed.com today : WinForms jobs 1,300 .
Java Swing jobs : 3,000 .

in response to Karsten Silz
There are two things missing in Swing in JDK 1.5 that are very important to me : font anti-aliasing ( which I 've had in Eclipse since day one ) and native dialogues ( I have a lot of software installed that connects to the context - menu , e.g. , in " File Open " dialogue ) .
From what I hear , font anti-aliasing will be in JDK 1.6 - but not the native dialogues .
Steve , is that correct ?
If so , that still puts Swing at a disadvantage in my book .
Anti-aliasing is there .
I am not sure what you mean regarding the dialogues - not something I have worked with .
The functionality you require may well be there in the Java Desktop Integration Components .

We 've learned our lessons and worked hard to add features our community was asking for ( yes better editor is the last large missing piece , check out latest daily builds , better editor is on the way ) ... now it 's time for Eclipse to get some important work done .
Roman ,
As a long time NetBeans user , I have to ask you how you define " large " here :
If you consider " refactor " as a large piece , then Editor is definitely NOT the " last " one missing .
We need NetBeans refactor to catch up with Eclipse / IntelliJ .
And we need it NOW !
I understand it takes time to play catch - up game , but how long has it been since the Refactor project started with NB , two years ?
And just as it caught up about half of the features that are already there with Eclipse / IntelliJ , it stalled at 5.0 - no new refactor features added in 5.5 at all !
Ok , 5.5 's focus is Java EE , but what about 6.0 ?
No new feature , either !
Why , " becasue we are switching the underlying refactor engine to Jackpot " .
I do n't care what potentials a new technology ( Jackpot or anything else ) brings , if it does n't bring values to the end users fast and solid , it does NOT matter !!!
So please , catch up on Refactor already !

in response to Jens Eckels Current trends does not support the claim Eclipse will " become a household name by year 10 " .
I have used eclipse for three years and found good for standard java development .
But when it comes to new technologies JSF , EJB3 , Web Service NetBeans is way better .
Today Netbeans provides integrated IDE for JSF , AJAX , EJB , WebServices , BPEL .
What else I could ask for for free !!
Eclipse is too much of a pain downloading all plug-ins and then troubleshooting when they dont work as expected .
Netbeans also has improved a lot in recent past and has integrated view for Runtime environment !
I can understand why Java developers are moving towards Netbeans .

These days I moved back to NetBeans for Swing , Web and Java EE5 development and am much happier .
Eclipse does not have as much competitive advantage over NB as it had , although it still gets a lot more press and industry support .
But , for me , I like the integrated " everything works out of the box " Netbeans experience much more .
Eclipse could learn from it , Callisto did n't nearly achieve that .

If eclipse did n't appear , would Net Beans have gotten to where it is today ?
I think the competition has helped accelerate and improve free IDE's .
Peter ; I think this definitely works both ways .
Just like history has shown , nothing advances technology quite like a " war " economy .
The pushing back and forth has made both camps work harder , and I credit both with innovation as a result .

We are going to be exploring this issue in early ' 07 .
But , as with every feature , we want to be sure to include the most effective solutions , which requires a bit of critical analysis .
We should have a more concrete position in the coming months .

I also make sure to keep up to date on it .
Personally I use Netbeans for my Java development , other then my corporate job which requires JDeveloper ( BTW I like JDeveloper and have no beef using it ) .
At this point I 'm only using Eclipse for ROR development using the RDT and WTP toolkits .

In five years from now , we might have 1,2 or 3 new players that are not even started up yet .
All the commercial IDE might have gone open - sources or the other way around .
And genetic science might have come up with a chicken with shark theeth .
Hammers are very simple tools that have a little more than 5 years of existence if my informations are accurate .
If we apply the same simplistic logic of the author , there should only be one universal hammer available today .
Everybody would happily have flatted thumbs and index fingers using that same hammer on 5 inches and half inch framing nails ( ouch ! !! ) , sheet metal shaping , etc , and , of course , nobody would ask themselves if there could be a better hammer for the job .
The reality is that IDE's are nothing but sophisticated hammers and each of them have their strenghs and weaknesses .
Eclipse was for a time the only serious open - source player .
With NetBeans 5.0+ , this situation is turning around very fast .
I even came accross a Java book where all examples and howtoos were written for Netbeans ( at a Press I think ) .
This would have been unthinkable one year ago .
I think Eclipse has some great features but I simply do n't buy the plug-ins approach .
I largely prefer the Netbeans approach where the main functionnalities are core features yet , specialties can be implemented as modules .
And this approach seems to gain momentum every day .
My whish is that all players in the IDE field provide interoperability so the choice of the IDE would be a personnal preference within a multi-developpers project .
It is somewhat possible today but improvements are still needed .
I hope that Eclipse people react intelligently to this shift and spend their time in improving their product to face this new challenge .
That way , in five years from now , there will still be more than one hammer available ...

Your post and others seem to make the assumption that we are simply comparing IDEs .
That is n't really what the opinion of the article is about at all .
Rather , it has more to do with vendor adoption of Eclipse as a platform / framework .
The fact is that the plug - in approach will come to dominate as the right approach for building highly modular software .
Eclipse 's plug - in approach has transformed into an OSGi services approach , and before you knock these as plug-ins , go do a bit of research on how OSGi handles classloading and deployment .
NetBeans may be nice to use from the perspective of a business application developer building Java apps .
Eclipse , as a platform for vendor integration , however , is superior .
Eclipse , as a community for vendor cooperation , however , beats NetBeans .
The ubiquity Eclipse will enjoy will be ubiquity among tool vendors as a marketplace to play in .
I 'm sure you 'll even be able to use NetBeans to code up that OSGi service for your next - gen Spring + Equinox server stack .
But then , this is just opinion , also .

in response to Frank Bank Hi , Before a year or two , if the same topic was posted , i doubt anyone would have mentioned about NetBeans in an Eclipse thread .
Yes , Eclipse was the IDE of choice at that point of time .
But things are changing very fast .
Almost everyone who replied in this thread mentioned about NetBeans .
That itself is a victory for NetBeans .
We were very reluctant initially to switch to NB .
But dude , we just could n't resist the offerings like Matisse , Java EE 5 support , Profiler etc .
Looks like NB has learnt the lessons .
Looks like NB is doing well indeed .
May be in few years from now , i foresee NetBeans replacing Eclipse as the major Java IDE .

in response to Frank Bank ... is the huge number of plugins that are n't Java related .
Eclipse has pretty much become the standard alternative to Emacs for creating development environments .
The other thing , to a lesser extent , is Eclipse as a RCP .
Netbeans is starting to focus on this , but is playing catchup , and has in the past been hindered by Swing .
Frank ;
You 've hit on a big issue .
Eclipse is successful not only because of its core Java components , but also because it truly is a platform for all sorts of applications .
IDE flamewars are all fine and good , but when you envision the success of the Eclipse platform , not of Eclipse exclusively as a Java IDE ( though this is how many folks see Eclipse ) , the picture gets bigger .
Tools - only vendors will find difficult to compete with Eclipse in the many infiltrated verticals as a result of RCP and non-Java areas as you mentioned .

This is why JSR198 , or some similar mechanism , could be important .
Why should n't tools be portable between IDEs ?
Hopefully use of NetBeans ( and other IDEs ) will continue to grow their share of the market , then at a certain point tool and plug - in vendors will put the pressure IDE developers for this kind of portability .
I suspect I am being far too optimistic .

in response to Jens Eckels Just check out where netbeans was 2 years ago and where it is now .
And also check out netbean 's mave n2 support through Mevenide .
The only true advantage of eclipse is the " compile on save " and error reporting .
I just dont see eclipse evolve as much as netbeans and i believe that the main factor for this is eclipse 's arrogance .
Anyway a developer just chooses the IDE that fits his personal development way .
And if you combine the features of the current players in the market you have the ultimate IDE : Eclipse does some things , Netbeans some others , IDEA some others .
Competition is essential to further improvement of any IDE and this is the best for the developers ( just to have choices ) .
if eclipse continue to hide behind its finger i think that it will just lose the game .
and just because i dont want to start a flame war i use both netbeans and eclipse and yes eclipse rcp is better than netbeans but until when ?

in response to Jens Eckels Pre-Java 6 fonts look horrible on an LCD .
For instance , I do n't understand the recurring point about anti-aliasing .

I 've run NetBeans 5.5 ( but it was the same with 5.0 ) .
All the three with Java 5 , not Java 6 .

Yes , there 's that blind - made Maple .
But there are a lot of others .
Some are so - so , others appear very good to me ( maybe it 's also a matter of programmers ' skills ? ) .
Can you elaborate on the " crap " concept ?
Maybe it 's too subjective :-)

I found JXMapViewer from SwingLabs ( that delivers a lot of other advanced components , such as date pickers and so on ) .
Integrating it in my application was a breeze .
Perhaps it 's just because I 'm definitely on the Swing side , and I do n't know about SWT : does exist such a component for SWT ?
I could perfectly be wrong ( please contradict me ) , but I do n't see the same amount of extra UI components in the SWT world .
On java .

And now to the Eclipse vs NetBeans .
Talking about the IDE .
I 've been using for years , at least since 2003 but probably even earlier , and I 'm really grateful to the Eclipse people for having delivered such a beautiful IDE for all this time - in the free world there were really no good alternatives .
I had evaluated NetBeans in 2002 , and soon get rid of it .
When 5.0 came out , I was pretty skeptical about it .
I had to change my mind , even though there were still many points behind Eclipse .
With NetBeans 5.5 . most of them are on par .
If the trend goes on , I suspect that with 6.0 the gap could be completely filled .
In the meantime , I think that NetBeans 5.5 is much superior for the J2EE stuff .
Also some customers of mine for which I did some comparative evaluation think the same .
Is it NB still buggy ?
Probably there 's still some annoying bug , but they 're catching up , and Eclipse is n't immune too .
For instance , some weeks ago I was driven mad by trying to set up the JBoss Plug - In - there were some blocking bugs that I 've learnt to patch manually from JBoss maling lists .
Is this an Eclipse blame ?
Probably not , but the out - of - the - box experience for J2EE in the end is absolutely superior for NetBeans .
NetBeans vs Eclipse RCP ?
Until this year I was n't really much involved in RCP stuff .
I had evaluated Eclipse in mid 2005 , but I really did n't like at all to learn a new API since I already knew Swing .
As I did n't have any professional need , I just gave up .
This year my needs changed and I started using NetBeans RCP .
I like it very much , I appreciate the point that I 'm just using enhanced Swing and that I find a lot of extra components that can be easily integrated ( see above ) .
I 'm aware that Eclipse is superior for some aspects ( e.g. OSGi ) but they are not relevant for me today , and in perspective I think NetBeans will be able to catch up .
PS I should also mention that when I switched from my G4 Mac to the Intel Mac , NetBeans and all my GUI stuff just worked .
For Eclipse I had to wait until 3.2 .
Ok , a microprocessor switch is n't something that happens every year , nevertheless ...

in response to Fabrizio Giudici Maybe I 'm still on another planet , but I 'm looking at the Swing Sightings page and I 'm seeing a lot of Swing applications .
Yes , there 's that blind - made Maple .
But there are a lot of others .
Some are so - so , others appear very good to me ( maybe it 's also a matter of programmers ' skills ? ) .
Can you elaborate on the " crap " concept ?
Maybe it 's too subjective :-)
All opinions here are subjective .
I took a look at the Swing Sightings , and I 've got to agree with Frank - they look crap to me too :^ ) .
Superior features could induce me to use a swing app though , despite the looks .
For example IntelliJ IDEA is Swing , looks crap , but is still a very good app .
BTW as for SWT , well I tried to use it once , and found it limiting .
It looks great on Eclipse , but not that good for your own bespoke stuff I find .
There you go a couple more opinions :^ ) .

Hi Steve , I 'm not trying to be controversal , but all Swing apps to me me look poor .
They just have this dull finish to them .
Not bright and dazzling like native apps .
I 've noticed that on the Mac Swing apps look better then they do on Windows , but you can still tell the difference straight away .
I was following the debate as an impartial observer ( like I 've said I 've got my issues with SWT too , unless it 's improved significantly recently ) .
And from what has been said I was curious to see if Swing had somehow got better .
From the screen shots IMO no .
So I do n't know if Franks preferred adjective of crap is the best word to use , but I know what he means .
Paul .

Perhaps you are right .
In spite of all the hundreds of different looks and feels produced for Swing , some hacked by amateurs , some by skilled professionals , and in spite of the best efforts of GUI designers from some of the most successful software houses , all Swing apps have a ' dull finish ' .
All of them .
Perhaps a bug report should be submitted for Java 7 ( probably too late for Java 6 ) ... next time you work on Swing ... do n't forget to bring the shiny .

George Bush has a land mine planted in the supplemental appropriation legislation working its way through Congress .
The Iraq Accountability
Act passed by the House and the companion bill passed in the Senate contain deadlines for withdrawing our troops from Iraq , in open defiance of the President 's repeated objections .
He threatens a veto , but he might well be bluffing .
Buried deep in the legislation and intentionally obscured is a near - guarantee of success for the Bush Administration 's true objective of the war - capturing Iraq 's oil - and George Bush will not casually forego that .
This bizarre circumstance is the end - game of the brilliant , ever - deceitful maneuvering by the Bush Administration in conducting the entire scenario of the " global war on terror . "
The supplemental appropriation package requires the Iraqi government to meet a series of " benchmarks " President Bush established in his speech to the nation on January 10 ( in which he made his case for the " surge " ) .
Most of Mr. Bush 's benchmarks are designed to blame the victim , forcing the Iraqis to solve the problems George Bush himself created .
One of the President 's benchmarks , however , stands apart .
This is how the President described it : " To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country 's economy , Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis . "
A seemingly decent , even noble concession .
That 's all Mr. Bush said about that benchmark , but his brevity was gravely misleading , and it had to be intentional .
The Iraqi Parliament has before it today , in fact , a bill called the hydrocarbon law , and it does call for revenue sharing among Sunnis , Shiites , and Kurds .
For President Bush , this is a must - have law , and it is the only " benchmark " that truly matters to his Administration .
Yes , revenue sharing is there - essentially in fine print , essentially trivial .
The bill is long and complex , it has been years in the making , and its primary purpose is transformational in scope : a radical and wholesale reconstruction - virtual privatization - of the currently nationalized Iraqi oil industry .
If passed , the law will make available to Exxon / Mobil , Chevron / Texaco , BP / Amoco , and Royal Dutch / Shell about 4/5's of the stupendous petroleum reserves in Iraq .
That is the wretched goal of the Bush Administration , and in his speech setting the revenue - sharing " benchmark " Mr. Bush consciously avoided any hint of it .
The legislation pending now in Washington requires the President to certify to Congress by next October that the benchmarks have been met- specifically that the Iraqi hydrocarbon law has been passed .
That 's the land mine : he will certify the American and British oil companies have access to Iraqi oil .
This is not likely what Congress intended , but it is precisely what Mr. Bush has sought for the better part of six years .
It is why we went to war .
For years President Bush has cloaked his intentions behind the fabricated " Global War on Terrorism . "
It has long been suspected that oil drove the wars , but dozens of skilled and determined writers have documented it .
It is no longer a matter of suspicion , nor is it speculation now : it is sordid fact .
( See a brief summary of the story at http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/47489/ . )
Planning for the two wars was underway almost immediately upon the Bush Administration taking office -- at least six months before September 11 , 2001 .
The wars had nothing to do with terrorism .
Terrorism was initially rejected by the new Administration as unworthy of national concern and public policy , but 9/11 gave them a conveniently timed and spectacular alibi to undertake the wars .
Quickly inventing a catchy " global war on terror " theme , the Administration disguised the true nature of the wars very cleverly , and with enduring success .
The " global war on terror " is bogus .
The prime terrorist in Afghanistan and the architect of 9/11 , Osama bin Laden , was never apprehended , and the President 's subsequent indifference is a matter of record .
And Iraq harbored no terrorists at all .
But both countries were invaded , both countries suffer military occupation today , both are dotted with permanent U.S. military bases protecting the hydrocarbon assets , and both have been provided with puppet governments .
And a billion dollar embassy in Baghdad is under construction now .
It will be the largest U.S. embassy in the world by a factor of ten .
( To see it , go to http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=20070124&articleId=4579 .)
It consists of 21 buildings on 104 acres , six times larger than the United Nations compound in New York city , larger than Vatican City .
It will house a delegation of more than five thousand people .
It will have its own water , electric , and sewage systems , and it is surrounded by a fortress wall of concrete fifteen feet thick .
For an Administration committed to fighting terrorism with armies and bombs , that 's far more anti-terror diplomacy than a tiny country needs .
There must be another purpose for it .
In the first two months of the Bush Administration two significant events took place that preordained the Iraqi war .
Vice President Cheney 's Energy Task Force was created , composed of federal officials and oil industry people .
By March of 2001 , half a year before 9/11 , the Task Force was poring secretly over maps of the Iraqi oil fields , pipe lines , and tanker terminals .
It studied a listing of foreign oil company " suitors " for exploration and development contracts , to be executed with Saddam Hussein 's oil ministry .
There was not a single American or British oil company included , and to Mr. Cheney and his cohorts that was intolerable .
The final report of the Task Force was candid : " ... Middle East oil producers will remain central to world security .
The Gulf will be a primary focus of U.S. international energy policy . "
The detailed meaning of " focus " was left blank .
The other event was the first meeting of President Bush 's National Security Council , and it filled in the blank .
The Council abandoned abruptly the decades - long attempt to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , and set a new priority for Middle East foreign policy instead : the invasion of Iraq .
This , too , was six months before 9/11 .
" Focus " would mean war .
By the fall of 2002 , the White House Iraq Group - a collection not of foreign policy experts but of media and public relations people - was cranking up the marketing campaign for the war .
A contract was signed with the Halliburton Corporation - even before military force in Iraq had been authorized by Congress - to organize the suppression of oil well fires , should Saddam torch the fields as he had done in the first Gulf War .
Little was left to chance .
The oil industry is the primary client and top - ranked beneficiary of the Bush Administration .
There can be no question the Administration intended to secure for American oil corporations the rich petroleum resources of Iraq : 115 billion barrels of proven reserves , twice that in probable and possible resources , potentially far more than Saudi Arabia .
The Energy Task Force spoke to this and the National Security Council answered .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
A secret NSC memorandum in 2001 spoke candidly of " actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields " in Iraq .
In 2002 Paul Wolfowitz suggested simply seizing the oil fields .
These words and suggestions were draconian , overt , and reprehensible - morally , historically , politically and diplomatically .
The seizure of the oil would have to be oblique and far more sophisticated .
A year before the war the State Department undertook the " Future of Iraq " project , expressly to design the institutional contours of the postwar country .
The ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ " Oil and Energy Working Group " looked with dismay at the National Iraqi Oil Company , the government agency that owned and operated the Iraqi oil fields and marketed the products .
100 % of the revenues went directly to the central government , and constituted about 90 % of its income .
Saddam Hussein benefited , certainly - his lavish palaces - but the Iraqi people did so to a far greater extent , in terms of the nation 's public services and physical infrastructure .
For this reason nationalized oil industries are the norm throughout the world .
The Oil and Energy Working Group designed a scheme that was oblique and sophisticated , indeed .
The oil seizure would be less than total .
It would be obscured in complexity .
The apparent responsibility for it would be shifted , and it would be disguised as benefiting , even necessary to Iraq 's well being .
Their work was supremely ingenious , undeniably brilliant .
The plan would keep the National Iraqi Oil Company in place , to continue overseeing the currently producing fields .
But those fields represent only 19 % of Iraq 's petroleum reserves .
The other 81 % would be flung open to " investment " by foreign oil interests , and the companies in favored positions today - because of the war and their political connections - are Exxon / Mobil , Chevron / Texaco , BP / Amoco , and Royal Dutch / Shell .
The nationalized industry would be 80 % privatized .
The investment vehicle would be the " production sharing agreement , " a long - term contract - up to 40 years - that grants to the company a share of the oil produced ; in exchange , the company underwrites the development costs and oilfield infrastructure .
Such " investment " is touted by the Bush Administration and its puppets in Iraq as necessary to the country 's recovery , and a huge benefit , accordingly .
But it is not unusual for these contracts to grant the companies more than half the profits for the first 15 - 30 years , and to deny the host country any revenue at all until the investment costs have been recovered .
The Iraqi oil industry does very much need a great deal of investment capital , to repair , replace , and upgrade its infrastructure .
But it does not need Exxon / Mobil or any other foreign company to provide it .
At a reduced level , Iraq is still producing oil and hence revenue , and no country in the world , perhaps , has better collateral against which to float bond issues for public investment .
Privatization of any sort and in any degree is utterly unnecessary in Iraq today .
The features of the State Department plan were inserted by Paul Bremer 's Provisional Coalition Authority into the developing structures of Iraqi governance .
American oil companies were omnipresent in Baghdad then and have been since , shaping and shepherding the plan through the several iterations of puppet governments - the " democracy " said to be taking hold in Iraq .
The package today is in the form of draft legislation , the hydrocarbon law .
Only a handful of Iraqi officials know its details .
Virtually none of them had a hand in its construction .
( It was first written in English . )
And its exclusive beneficiaries are the American and British oil companies , whose profits will come directly from the pockets of the Iraqi people .
The Iraqi people do , however , benefit to some degree .
The seizure is not total .
The hydrocarbon law specifies the oil revenues - the residue accruing to Iraq - will be shared equally among the Sunni , Shiite , and Kurdish regions , on a basis of population .
This is the feature President Bush relies upon exclusively to justify , to insist on the passage of the hydrocarbon law .
His real reasons are Exxon / Mobil , Chevron / Texaco , BP / Amoco , and Royal Dutch / Shell .
No one can say at the moment how much the hydrocarbon law will cost the Iraqi people , but it will be in the hundreds of billions .
The circumstances of its passage are mired in the country 's chaos , and its final details are not yet settled .
If and when it passes , however , Iraq will orchestrate the foreign capture of its own oil .
The ingenious , brilliant seizure of Iraqi oil will be assured .
That outcome has been on the Bush Administration 's agenda since early in 2001 , long before terrorism struck in New York and Washington .
The Iraqi war has never been about terrorism .
It is blood for oil .
The blood has been spilled already , hugely , criminally .
More than 3,200 American military men and women have died in Iraq .
26,500 more have been wounded .
But the oil remains in play .
The game will end if the revenue - sharing " benchmark " is fully enforced .
The land mine will detonate .
Mission almost accomplished , Mr. President .
Author 's endnote :
This article was written assuming the members of Congress were ignorant , when they passed the supplemental appropriation bills , of the clever origin , the details , and the true beneficiaries of the Iraqi hydrocarbon law .
It was written assuming they did not know President Bush 's stated " benchmark " of revenue - sharing was fraudulently incomplete , intentionally obscuring the fully intended seizure , by military force , of Iraqi oil assets .
The Bush Administration made every effort to mislead deliberately both the Congress and the American people .
Ignorance of the circumstances was imposed .
If any members of Congress acted with full and complete knowledge , however , then they have become complicit in a criminal war .
Vultures are native to much of the US , especially in open areas
A nearby airport said the scavenging birds could endanger low - flying aircraft as they circled the body farm .
Residents were also said to be unhappy with plans to keep up to nine cadavers at the facility at any one time .
Texas State University had wanted to use the site to study how humans decompose under a range of conditions .
Forensic scientists use data from body farms to learn about how the human body decomposes in a range of controlled situations , to aid criminal investigations .
Two other body farms are already operational in the US , one established at the University of Tennessee in 1971 , and the other in 2006 in North Carolina .
Shallow grave
Texas State researchers had planned to begin using a site near Texas ' San Marcos Municipal Airport later this year .
There 's a lot of people who do n't want it their backyard
Mark Hendricks
Texas State University
Most bodies used by the scientists are made available for medical research by prior consent .
But the plans fell foul of the vultures - known locally as buzzards - which frequent the skies and feed on dead animals and other carrion on the ground .
Plans for the site included a razor - wire fence around the property , vulture - proof cages to protect exposed bodies and a 70ft ( 21.3 m ) grass buffer around the site to absorb rainwater as it runs away .
However , airport officials and local residents felt the risks - both to pilots and to public health - remained too high , forcing officials to bury their plans .
" There 's a lot of people who do n't want it their backyard , and that 's certainly understandable , " said Mark Hendricks , a university spokesman .
" It 's a controversial project , there 's no doubt about it . "
enhanced in 2019 Types of red wines
Syrah , cabernet , zinfandel are different red grape varieties .
For each major variety , please find herebelow : names , pronunciation , food pairings , production area , description , differences .
Syrah ( or Shiraz )
( Sah -ra or Shi-raz ) Syrah and shiraz are two names for the same variety .
Europe vintners only use the name syrah .
Food pairings : meat ( steak , beef , wild game , stews , etc . )
Districts : syrah excels in California , in Australia , and in France ’s Rhone Valley .
Typical taste in varietal wine : aromas and flavors of wild black fruit ( such as blackcurrant ) , with overtones of black pepper spice and roasting meat .
The abundance of fruit sensations is often complemented by warm alcohol and gripping tannins .
Toffee notes if present come not from the fruit but from the wine having rested in oak barrels .
The shiraz variety gives hearty , spicy reds .
While shiraz is used to produce many average wines it can produce some of the world ’s finest , deepest , and darkest reds with intense flavors and excellent longevity .
You ’ll discover Syrah wines of value and elegance by reading my reviews of French wines .
Merlot
( Mare - lo ) Easy to drink .
The softness of Merlot has made it an " introducing " wine for new red - wine drinkers .
Food pairings : any will do .
Districts : a key player in the Bordeaux blend , merlot is now also grown in Italy , Romania , California , Washington State , Chile , Australia , etc .
It is the fourth wine grape variety in terms of coverage worldwide ( after sultanine blanche , airen blanc , and grenache noir ) .
Typical taste in varietal wine : typical scents include blackcherry , plums and herbal flavors .
The texture is round but a middle palate gap is common .
The Merlot type of wine is less tannic ( rough ) than Cabernet Sauvignon .
Cabernet sauvignon
( Ca -burr - nay so - veen - yaw ) Widely accepted as one of the world ’s best varieties .
Cabernet sauvignon is often blended with cabernet franc and merlot .
It usually undergoes oak treatment .
Food pairings : best with simply prepared red meat .
Districts : cabernet sauvignon is planted wherever red wine grapes grow except in the Northern fringes such as Germany .
It is part of the great red Médoc wines of France , and among the finest reds in Australia , California and Chile .
Typical taste in varietal wine : full - bodied , but firm and gripping when young .
With age , polyphenols polymerize : the grip fades away .
The rich currant qualities of the Cabernet Sauvignon wine change to that of pencil box .
Bell pepper notes remain .
Vanilla notes if present come not from the fruit but from the oak treatment .
They increase review ratings but may overwhelm the varietal taste .
Malbec
( Mal - bek )
Food pairings : all types of meat - based meals , foie gras .
Argentine Malbec suits Mexican , Cajun , and Indian dishes , if you insist on having wine with such meals .
Districts : malbec has its origins in the French Bordeaux region .
It is grown as côt in the Loire Valley and auxerrois in Cahors .
Malbec has also been recognized as médoc noir or pressac again in France .
Malbec is widely grown in Argentina , where it is the most popular red grape variety .
It is also available in Chile , in Australia , and in the cooler regions of California .
Typical taste in varietal wine : malbec ’s characteristics vary greatly depending on where the grape is grown and how it is transformed .
Often it produces an easy - drinking style , well colored wine that tastes of plums , berries , and spice .
Malbec is often blended with other varieties such as cabernet franc , cabernet sauvignon , merlot , and petit verdot to make Bordeaux style wines .
Malbec and some such blends may present some health benefits .
Pinot noir
( Pee - know na-wahr ) One of the noblest red wine grapes .
Pinot noir is difficult to grow , rarely blended , without roughness .
Food pairings : excellent with grilled salmon , chicken , lamb and Japanese dishes ( notably sushi rolls ) .
Districts : makes extraodinary reds in Burgundy ( Bourgogne , France ) , and great wines from Austria , Oregon , and New Zealand .
Typical taste in varietal wine : very unlike Cabernet Sauvignon .
The structure is delicate and fresh .
The tannins are very soft ; this is related to the low level of polyphenols .
The aromatics are very fruity ( cherry , strawberry , plum ) , often with notes of tea - leaf , damp earth , or worn leather .
Yet pinot noir is very transparent to the place where it is grown .
The staggering range of Pinot Noir wines produced makes it pointless to define which personality is the best expression of the variety .
Zinfandel
Food pairings : very much depends on the freshness / heaviness of the wine ; tomato - sauce pasta , pizza , and grilled and barbecued meats .
Districts : mainly found in California , zinfandel was introduced in the 18th century to Italy ( where it is called primitivo ) .
It originates in Croatia .
Typical taste in varietal wine : often a zesty flavor with berry and pepper .
Sangiovese
( San - gee - oh - ve- zee )
Food pairings : a good choice for Italian and other Mediterranean - style cuisines .
Districts : sangiovese produces the Chiantis of Italy ’s Tuscany region and , of late , good wines from California .
Typical taste in varietal wine : the primary style is medium - bodied with fresh berry and plum flavors .
Barbera
( Bar - bear - a ) Not as popular as Merlot but with similar use or pairing .
Food pairings : barbera wines are versatile : they match many dishes , including tomato sauces .
Districts : another classic red of Italian origin .
Widespread in California .
Typical taste in varietal wine : juicy black cherry and plum fruit , a silky texture and excellent acidity .

With a red woollen cap soaking up the baking midday sun and his blue coat covered in dust and drying cement , the wiry , reclusive 81 - year - old was in the middle of a self - imposed working day that started at 6 am .
" I can't say when it will be finished , " he said , surveying the columns , walls , towers , arches and cloisters he has raised above the arid ground of Mejorada del Campo , a small country town near Madrid .
Justo's do - it - yourself cathedral was yesterday a focus of media attention in Spain as news spread that a Spanish ironmonger had donated and delivered the buildings ' doors while a French artist was offering to decorate the interior .
It now seems possible that what Justo's own neighbours have often regarded as a useless folly worthy of the legendary Don Quixote may , actually , one day , become the cathedral he pledged to build with his own hands half a century ago .
Visitors wandered in and out of his red - brick and concrete cathedral yesterday , weaving their way past heaps of recycled building materials and mounds of cement bags .
Obsession
Justo ignored them as he pursued the obsession that has kept him busy through searing heat and freezing cold , six days a week , since he was 36 .
Journalists were invited to read a written version of why he embarked on his single - minded pursuit .
" Apart from occasional help from others , I have built it all myself , " he explains .
" I 've got up at 3.30 some mornings in order to start work . "
The scale of Justo's ambition can be seen in the size of a building whose main temple occupies 1,000 sq metres ( 10,700 sq ft ) .
The heavy metal frame of a huge cupola is already in place , 35 metres ( 115 ft ) up .
A dozen 40 - metre ( 130 ft ) towers are almost complete .
A subterranean crypt , an open - air baptistry , two cloisters , four priests ' homes and a sweeping flight of steps up to the soon - to - be - installed front doors are at varying states of completion .
" I am not an architect or a bricklayer , nor do I have any training in building , " Justo admits .
The concrete on the larger curved arches was moulded with old tyres .
Smaller arches were shaped around car wheels .
Abandoned tin cans and plastic tubes have also been pressed into service .
" There are no plans and no approved , official project , " he says .
" Everything is in my head . "
Materials are recycled , donated , begged off building sites or provided by local brick or tile factories that send him their rejects .
The land itself is a former olive grove that belongs to Justo 's family .
The cathedral currently resembles a chaotic cross between a dilapidated medieval monastery and a modern scrap - yard .
Bits of metal poke out here and there from uneven patches of concrete rendering .
The deformed bricks on one soaring tower look as though they have been squashed by the weight of what sits on top of them .
Rotting electric cables , rusting scaffolding and bits of old carpet form part of an array of home - made building equipment , along with winches made from rope and old bicycle wheels .
Local sceptics have spent four decades claiming the building is bound to fall in on itself .
" If you do n't think it is safe then do n't come in , " is the reply given by Gregorio Martín , a former missionary who acts as Justo 's doorman , to sceptics .
Plenty of visitors do enter , however , attracted by the blossoming popularity not just of the building but of the builder .
A large trestle table with a simple portrait of Pope John Paul II was being used yesterday as a depository for picture cards of saints and virgins , for medallions and for notes of support left by those who already begin to see the stuff of sainthood in Justo .
A group of 20 German priests travel south every July to work alongside him for a few days .
Justo's eccentric dream was born after he was sent home with tuberculosis from a Cistercian monastery almost half a century ago , frustrating his plans for a life of religious contemplation .
" I was inspired by books on cathedrals , castles and other great buildings , " he explains .
" But my greatest inspiration is Christ . "
Ridicule
He has suffered ridicule and the disdain of both the local town hall and Roman Catholic authorities over the decades .
" Now it seems they both want to get involved , " mutters Gregorio .
Justo , who lives at his sister 's home , has always known people were laughing at him .
" As they have seen the cathedral grow , however , they have realised that I am not mad , " he told a Spanish newspaper yesterday .
" I am not harming anyone . "
The German priests say their own prayers here , but the question of whether the cathedral will ever be used for normal worship remains open .
Justo has no building permits .
The local bishopric at Alcala de Henares , which will receive the building when he dies , is not sure what to do with it .
In his old age , meanwhile , Justo is becoming a celebrity .
He has even starred in a television advertisement for a popular soft drink .
Some see him as an obstinate fool , given over to a pointless , if honourable , endeavour .
Even his friends admit that his obsession is out of the ordinary .
" You have to be a bit odd to do this , " agrees Gregorio .
" People laugh at him , " says Ramón Flores , who sells vegetables from a stall across the road .
" But he lives off a piece of bread and a tomato a day .
I would say he is closer to a saint . "
Justo is not bothered by what people think .
" I just keep working every day , " he says .
" I try to be content with what I have done so far . "

Analysis
Two weeks ago , Intel looked poised to mount a serious challenge to AMD 's server processor performance lead .
Then the shockers arrived .
Dual - core Itanium chip production slowed because of quality concerns .
A sophisticated future Xeon processor was cancelled .
Plans to unite the Itanium and Xeon lines around a common architecture to make servers more affordable and faster have been pushed out likely until 2009 .
In short , bad news for Intel customers .
Underneath all of these roadmap adjustments lurk some painful technology slips that must have customers concerned .
In particular , it now appears that Intel will stay married to its front side bus dependency for much longer than previously expected and will fail to deliver integrated memory controllers on time .
Where Intel had a very real shot at closing the gap with AMD in just 18 months on previous roadmaps , it now looks more likely to trail for close to four years .
This should worry folks at Dell , HP and SGI , as they 're most vulnerable to Intel 's shortcomings .
We covered all of Intel 's roadmap changes here , but will zero in on the " Tukwila " Itanium processor delay and " Whitefield " Xeon cancellation in this story .
Tukwila and Whitefield were both meant to arrive in 2007 and not only have integrated memory controllers but also share a high - speed serial interconnect called CSI .
Both pieces would help Intel compete against AMD 's direct connect and hypertransport technologies .
Intel , however , struggled to insert these goodies into Whitefield and will be forced to push out a replacement processor called Tigerton without the technology in 2007 .
Tukwila will have the goodies but will ship in 2008 instead of 2007 as hoped .
And the common technology wo n't help Tukwila too much since Intel does n't have a Xeon chip ready to share it .
Such a Xeon is n't supposed to arrive until 2009 , according to industry chatter .
So , Intel has two problems .
On one hand , its chips will continue to suffer from performance issues as a result of the front side bus dependency and lack of integrated memory controllers .
( Intel has some kind of workaround for this in Tigerton , but not a real competitor to AMD . )
In addition , Itanium customers - the chosen few - wo n't benefit from the cost savings that a shared Itanic / Xeon server infrastructure promised to deliver .
Nathan Brookwood , an analyst at InSight 64 , summed up the issues well in a research note issued this week .
" If Intel is ever to reclaim the performance lead from AMD , it must make the transition to an on - chip memory controller , " he wrote .
" Intel slated Whitefield ( a Xeon ) and Tukwila ( an Itanium ) as its first processors to incorporate on - chip memory controllers .
Tukwila will still use this approach , but Tigerton , Whitefield 's replacement , will rely on a memory controller built into the chipset that supports the CPU , Intel 's traditional approach , rather than a controller built into the CPU itself .
Given the two year cycles that drive Intel 's server roadmaps , this means that Intel will not be able to field a server processor with an on - board memory controller until 2009 at the earliest .
Between now and then , we see little likelihood that Intel will be able to claim performance leadership . "

If they change their minds one more time I ’m building both an igloo , a small ark and a tepee in my front yard just to cover my bases .
Well as it turns out maybe they were right the first time , scientists are now predicting the sun may cause global cooling soon …

And the far - right got upset that we criticized Jerry Falwell after his death .
That does n’t even come close to dissing a newborn baby .
But there you have it , Stephen Bennett , a spokesman for the Concerned Women for America , one of the largest religious right groups , today blasted Vice President Dick Cheney ’s lesbian daughter , Mary , and her partner Heather Poe for having a baby out of wedlock .
As we reported yesterday , the White House published a baby announcement on the Vice President ’s portion of the White House Web site , noting that the Mary and Heather were both “ parents ” of the newborn child .
( Bennett is the same guy who , only four months ago , was angling for a meeting with President Bush .
Funny , I ’m guessing that is n’t going to be happening now . )
Well , that set the religious right off , big time .
Here is what Bennett had to say about Mary and Heather having a baby , then I ’ve posted his press release in its entirety – it ’s a must - read of venom .
SBM PRAISES parents and individuals – mothers and fathers – who have taken on the noble task of adopting children and giving them a chance at life in the God ordained family unit including a Daddy and Mommy .
Every child deserves a Daddy and Mommy .
We understand , sometimes through death or divorce , that unit is broken – and parents do the best they could to raise and nurture their child or children .
That ’s where we as the Body of Christ step in to help and be there for the family and child .
We celebrate these individuals and families .
Sometimes in a second heterosexual marriage , children are adopted .
We praise these men and women who do all they could to raise these children .
THESE ARE REAL PARENTS .
This is NOT playing “ house . ”
Homosexual parenting though is something TOTALLY different .
It “ mimicks ” the real and the natural … .
And here is Bennett ’s press release .
I ca n’t even begin to excerpt it or bold it , it ’s that bad .

Just got an email reminder from the ICPSR data archive yesterday that the 2006 GSS data are out and ready to play with .
Always curious to know what ’s happening with my favorite survey of the attitudes and behaviors of the American population I looked around the codebook to see what was new for 2006 .
Among the highlights , there is ( 1 ) a module designed to estimate global characteristics of the social networks of the American population using a cutting edge method based on asking people questions of the type : “ How many people do you know …( named Jeff , in Prison , who can do a somersault , who eat hamburgers , etc. [ see Zheng et al 2006 ] and see also a copy of the proposal of the GSS module designed to measure “ network polarization ” in the American population in order to see if it is related to “ cultural polarization ” ) and ( 2 ) a “ science ” module designed to measure the scientific knowledge of the American population .
My guess is that ( 1 ) will produce the most fascinating and scientifically interesting results , and ( 2 ) will of course provide fodder for the constant complaints ( and jokes ) about the utter mental dullness of the population .
A case in point is the following .
The GSS folk actually made the mistake of asking the following question as part of their science module :
Now , does the Earth go around the Sun , or does the Sun go around the Earth ?
Here we go .
Now what follows is real social science data folks .
No joking around :
Earth around sun 73.6 %
Sun around earth 18.3 %
Do n’t Know 8.0 %
Refused 0.1 %
Yes .
More than a fifth of the American population does not think ( or are not quite sure ) that they live in Copernicus ’ heliocentric solar system .
Is this a glass half - full or glass half empty thing ?
Well , those glass half - full people might say , almost three - quarters of the population got the right answer .
But the GSS questionnaire designers conspire against your carefree optimism half - glass full guy or gal .
Among those who were up to date with seventeenth - century Galilean basic science , they actually dared to ask the follow - up question :
How long does it take for the Earth to go around the Sun : one day , one month , or one year ?
One day 19.0 %
One month 1.1 %
One year 71.2 %
Other time period 0.1 %
Do n’t Know 8.5 %
Refused 0.1 %
Barring that guy who categorically refused to answer the question , we are again faced with the result that a full one - fifth of those in the American population who are aware that the earth revolves around the sun are in their turn unable to distinguish the earth ’s rotation around its axis from a full revolution around the sun .
Poor Galileo ; talk about reason to turn in your grave .
The United States has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the industrialized world , with sub-Saharan African countries among the worst overall .
The report issued Tuesday by the Save the Children organization said U.S. newborn death rates are highest among minorities , even when mothers have early and equal access to prenatal care .
The odds of newborn infants dying , after all other risk factors were taken into account , were 3.4 times higher in blacks , 1.5 times higher in Hispanics and 1.9 times higher for races other than whites .
In the developing world , about half of newborn deaths are due to infection , tetanus and diarrhea , the report said .
In the industrialized world , these problems are almost non-existent and newborn deaths are most likely to result from babies being born too small or too early .
Of the 125 countries listed , Sweden ranked first , or safest , followed by Denmark , Finland , Austria , Germany , Norway , Australia , Netherlands , Canada , United States and Britain .
The west African state of Niger is at the bottom , with nine other African countries filling the 10 last positions .

Bootes Field :
New Panorama Reveals More Than a Thousand Black Holes
A new wide - field panorama reveals more than a thousand supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies , some up to several billion times more massive than the sun .
This survey , taken in a region of the Bootes constellation , involved 126 separate Chandra exposures of 5,000 - seconds each , making it the largest contiguous field ever obtained by the observatory .
At 9.3 square degrees , it is over 40 times larger than the full moon seen on the night sky , which is also shown in this graphic for scale .
In this image , the red represents low - energy X - rays , green shows the medium range , and blue the higher energy X - rays .
Material falling into these black holes at high rates generates huge amounts of light that can be detected in different wavelengths .
These systems are known as active galactic nuclei , or AGN .
When combined with data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and Kitt Peak's 4 - meter Mayall and the MMT 6.5 - meter optical telescopes , these results give astronomers a snapshot of a crucial period when these monster black holes are growing , and provide insight into the environments in which they occur .
Instead of staring at one relatively small part of the sky for a long time , as with the Chandra Deep Fields -- two of the longest exposures obtained with the observatory -- and other concentrated surveys , this strategy employed a technique that scanned a much bigger portion with shorter exposures .
Since the biggest black holes power the brightest AGN , they can be spotted at vast distances , even with short exposures .
The survey gives a new test of a popular model for AGN in which a supermassive black hole is surrounded by a doughnut - shaped region , or torus , of gas .
An observer from Earth would have their view blocked by this torus by different amounts , depending on the orientation of the torus , so some of the nuclei will be obscured and some wo n't .
This study identified more than 600 obscured and 700 unobscured AGN , located between about six to 11 billion light years from Earth .
The red sources are mostly unobscured AGN and the green and blue sources are dominated by obscured AGN .

Middle Eastern .
Pot Belly .
We catch each others eye every now and then and give each other a slight nod .
I know you , I know what you do and I am on to your games .
I saw you this morning , we made eye contact .
You nodded and took another bite of whatever Death - Ass producing garbage you fuel up on that makes the bathroom , smell like the inside of a dead monkey 's colon , and nodded at me .
I got you this time , fucker .
I give you my icey grin and nod back , then hurry back to my office .
It 's almost noon , and that 's the time you like to run to the toilet and preform your daily ASS JIHAD on all the people just trying to wash their hands .
Maybe in your country there is no commen sense that would tell you that lunch time = hand wash time .
People want to get clean and eat , not be fumigated with the high octane liquid shit attack you subjigate them too .
But I got you this time .
Yeah fucker I GOT SOMETHING COOKING UP FOR YOU !
Two egg sandwiches with cheese .
Greasy sausage patties .
A couple glasses of Tang .

Root Beer Soda .
Some steamed brocoli I had in the fridge .
A Hot Pocket with peperonni and cheese .
A Chocolate Poptart .
And like a cherry on top ... a McDonald 's Quaterpounder with cheese .
I never eat this shit , it 's all greasy and fucking nasty , but today is the day I fight back .
I go out for a quick mile jog and almsot die .
My stomach feels like there are two midgets fighting to the death inside there .
I walk back to work , ass clenched tighter than a virgin's thighs at Church .
Great .
The hot chick from next door wants to chat .
She assumes the sweat on my face and arms is from running .
She does n't realize that it's a cold sweat induced by my severe sphicter trauma .
She finally shuts up and I stagger to the Death Ass Arena .
You are there already in your favorite stall :
The one right next to the fucking sinks .
You stupid , socially retarded fuck .
Fine .
You have yet to begin your daily purge of Middle Eastern Ass Stew .
I enter the stall next to you and drop my pants in preperation of the upcomming battle .

I know you are summoning your intestinal fortitude for full out war .
You do not dissapoint me .
With a hissing " SSSShhhhhzzzzzzzzz ! " you squirt out a deadly spray of ass juice that pollutes the air and makes my head swim .
The pisser at the urinal is no longer laughing , he quickly zips up and runs for the door .

I should have known the battle was not over .
The only thing I can think of is that you must has completly unzipped your ass to your elbow .
That 's the only way I could begin to explain the lumpy , creamy splashs falling out of your ass into the toilet .
It sounds like you are pouring a gallon of strawberry shake with whole strawberries in it into the shitter .
I see the hairs on my arms start to curl from the horrid stench wafting up from under your stall .
I shudder and sway on my throne , unsure if I will survive .
I have no choice .
I must employ the Deal Breaker .
I hunker down and clench my hands together .
My fingers twitch and entwine like a nest of snakes , almost like I am running through a series of ancient Ninja Hand Symbols .
My feet lift up onto the toes and my legs start to shake .
" You want to play ? ? " I growls .
A low moaning comes from my stomach , like a dinosaur calling into a swampy , foggy night .

Me and my ass will be waiting .
What Red Shoes Has To Do With It My experiences over the past ten years have inspired and prepared me to run for Lieutenant Governor .
While the Libertarian Party would do well to run a " name " candidate , or someone with wide voter - appeal for Governor , as someone who has gained a degree of notoriety working for ferret legalization , I can show voters and non-voters a real example why they should support the Libertarian Party for their own self - interest .
At the risk of appearing to be a one - issue candidate , I intend to show California voters what many would consider a small infringement of freedom is actually another instance of disappearing liberty and the great threat we face if we let this go unchallenged .
After 2 terms as chairman of the Libertarian Party of California ( where we doubled membership ) ended in 1993 , I thought it was time to get serious over the ferret issue .
Ferret owners previously relied on their solid documentation that ferrets were safe pets , but the state of California continued to make up outlandish stories about domestic ferrets .
I formed Ferrets Anonymous that year , and when my chairmanship of that organization ended in 1998 it had a mailing list of 6,000 names .
During my chairmanship I was on CBS This Morning , had a full page article in People Magazine numerous articles in newspapers , television and radio ..
Back then , because of the absolute absurdity of what our opponents in the state government were saying , it was fun to debunk them and the media enjoyed covering ferrets .
The fun ended in 1998 when my ferret was removed from his vet and euthanized while he was in quarantine for biting a cameraman .
I had helped many people get their ferrets through quarantine , but when the state of California learned that my ferret was in quarantine , the Department of Health Services ordered him picked up and destroyed immediately .
To lose a ferret , a cherished family member , because I made fun of our opponents almost ruined me .
I have also faced many criminal complaints over ferrets , and I have seen how justice system works ( more accurately , does n't work ) in this country .
For instance I have had charges added the day before my trial was to start , I have been secretly tape - recorded , I have been charged with possessing wild animals and not allowed to present evidence that domestic ferrets are not wild .
I could go on at great length about my legal battles .
But I wo n't let the emotional and financial drain from those battles stop me .
I 'm not going to surrender .
I 'm going to fight back the best way I can , by running for Lieutenant Governor .
In July 1999 agents from the Department of Fish and Game , the San Diego Police Department and Animal Control broke down my door .
They did have a search warrant , but I did n't know it .
I did n't think any judge would issue a search warrant for ferrets .
In a still traumatized state of mind from my ferret 's confiscation and murder , I had a knife in my hand as the door was kicked open .
At that trial I was found guilty of brandishing a knife at a police officer and possession of wild animals without a permit .
I was sentenced to 45 days in jail for refusing to give up my fourth amendment rights against search and seizure .
The real reason I am running for Lt. Governor is to fight the , all to pervasive , sentiment expressed by the judge in my case .
It is a attitude that has lead to many horrific tragedies throughout history .
It says " do n't question authority " .
It says " just follow your orders " .
It 's an attitude that 's the antithesis to freedom and responsibility .
Here 's what he said that provoked me to run :
" If the law requires us to wear red shoes , we should wear red shoes .
We have the right to try to change the law , but until then we should wear red shoes .
And people who want to change the law should be prepared to go to jail . "
So off I went , to maximum security .
And I really saw another part of life that made me a stronger person and a greater advocate of personal freedom and responsibility .
This campaign is because of ferrets , but it is not about ferrets .
It is an effort to show people that they need to join a political party firmly based in the philosophy of letting people live their own life without fear , unless they transgress on others .
The 250,000 to 1,000,000 ferret owners in California provide me with a solid base of voters and supporters .
They know the fear of having their homes violated and their pets confiscated and destroyed .
They know that prominent Republicans like Pete Wilson and Dan Lungren , and prominent Democrats like Diane Feinstein and Gray Davis worked very hard to keep ferrets illegal ( we just do n't know why ) .
They know that I am genuine champion of their cause , and that I 've paid my dues .
I do n't know how my candidacy will be received .
But I do believe it is an opportunity to both show people who do n't consider themselves libertarian to give us the consideration and to get more ferret owners to protect their rights and open their eyes to all of the other rights that are threatened with each passing year .
I do want more members in Ferrets Anonymous when I finish this campaign !..
I look forward to using my publicity skills to advance libertarian ideas and serving the membership of the Libertarian Party .

Mark Fairhurst , 35 , of Wigan , Greater Manchester , was found by customer Elizabeth Bebe in June 2006 with his head submerged in water .
Bolton Coroner 's Court heard that a heart condition caused the collapse but the cause of death was drowning because he had been unable to save himself .
The jury returned a unanimous verdict of accidental death .
It looked like he had been in that position for some time
Elizabeth Bebe
The father - of - one , of Fowler Close , Scholes , was working at the home of Miss Bebe in Whelley , near Wigan .
She told the inquest : " I went outside to hang some washing at the back when I saw a ladder propped up against the wall .
" I then saw Mark lying on the ground motionless , with his arms tucked in and his head tilted to the right inside the bucket .
" It looked like he had been in that position for some time .
I went to call a neighbour who then called the ambulance and the police . "
No foul play
Miss Bebe told the jury she thought Mr Fairhurst may have fallen while on the ground , rather than from his ladder .
The hearing also heard that the window cleaner had complained about heart palpitations earlier in the year but had not told his doctor .
Pathologist Dr Charles Wilson told the jury he had been informed that Mr Fairhurst had been assaulted in August 2005 which had led to memory problems .
He said he could not rule out the incident being linked to his blackout - but was satisfied there was no foul play .
Coroner Jennifer Leeming expressed her condolences to the family of Mr Fairhurst at the hearing on Thursday .
The pioneering research overcomes one of the most pressing ethical issues faced by stem cell scientists today - that the most promising variety of stem cells known can be obtained only from embryos , which are cannibalised when the cells are collected .
Researchers claim the new technique can produce stem cells without harming embryos .
In a series of papers published today , they describe experiments in which skin cells were plucked from adult mice and " reprogrammed " , turning them into cells that are indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells , the only kind thought to be able to grow into all of the body 's tissue types .
The breakthrough is expected to overcome a major hurdle that has severely hampered progress in stem cell research .
For any stem cell treatment to be useful , it has to work without causing an immune reaction in patients .
This means scientists must either create enormous stockpiles of different stem cells , which can then be matched to patients , much as organs are before transplant operations .
Or , scientists have to perfect a technique called therapeutic cloning , in which a cell taken from a patient is cloned to produce stem cells that are an exact genetic match .
Neither is simple .
The research points to a new way around the problem , suggesting it may be possible to take any cell from a patient and convert into an embryonic stem cell .
This could then be used to grow batches of other tissues for future operations , such as neurons and heart cells .
Two teams , one lead by Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University and the other by Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , announced details of their research in the journal Nature today .
Both groups took skin cells from adult mice and injected them with a harmless virus that was genetically modified to carry four carefully selected genes , known as Oct4 , Sox2 , c - Myc and Klf4 .
Together the genes rewound the clock on the adult cells , returning them to a youthful state in which they could then grow into any other cell type .
" These reprogrammed cells , by all criteria that we can apply , are indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells , " said Professor Jaenisch .
To prove the new cells could form any tissue type in the body , they tagged some and injected them into early - stage mouse embryos .
When the mice were born , the cells were spotted throughout and were even passed on through sperm and eggs to the next generation .
The technique is not yet safe enough to use in humans , not least because two of the genes injected into the cells increase the risk of cancer .
Researchers at other laboratories aim to get around this problem by reprogramming cells with substances that mimic the genes for only as long as they are needed .
" Reprogramming cells in this way is one of the biggest breakthroughs we 've seen in the field , " said Steven Pollard , a stem cell scientist at the Wellcome Trust centre for stem cell research in Cambridge .
Lyle Armstrong , whose team at Newcastle University is awaiting permission to create stem cells from embryos made by fusing animal and human cells , said the research would give scientists a chance to understand how the biological clocks of cells can be reset .
But Paul de Sousa , a stem cell expert at Edinburgh University 's Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine , said the cells might still be able to treat patients with terminal diseases even if they do contain cancer - causing genes .
" When people are suffering from a degenerative disease , injecting them with cells is already a last option to save their life or improve their quality of life .
It 's all about control , knowing that a cell is going to do what you want it to do and not something else . "
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia — King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia told Arab leaders on Wednesday that the American occupation of Iraq is “ illegal , ” and he warned that unless Arab governments settle their differences , foreign powers like the United States would continue to dictate the region ’s politics .
The king ’s speech , at the opening of the Arab League summit meeting here , underscored growing differences between Saudi Arabia and the Bush administration as the Saudis take on a greater regional leadership role , partly at American urging .
The Saudis seem to be emphasizing that they will not be beholden to the policies of their longtime ally .
The Saudis brokered a deal between the two main Palestinian factions last month but one that both Israel and the United States found deeply problematic because it added to the power of the radical group Hamas rather than to the more moderate Fatah .
On Wednesday , the king called for an end to the international boycott of the new Palestinian government .
The United States and Israel want the boycott continued .
In addition , King Abdullah invited President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to Riyadh earlier this month while the Americans want him shunned .

Grahamの ANSI Common Lisp では嫌われていて碌に説明のないloopマクロ。一方、 Practical Common Lisp では対照的に好んで用いられていて、全編に渡って頻繁に使われている。しかしloopマクロは難しいという意識があるのかその説明は第22章とかなり後回しにされており、ちぐはぐな感を受ける。ここでは、LOOP
for Black - Belts という題のつけられたその章で解説されているloopマクロの用法を整理してみた。
ANSI Common Lisp での黒魔術扱いに敬遠していたloopマクロだったが、こうして整理してみるとそれほど難しく考えずとも便利に使うことができそうだ。

概要
一つ以上の繰り返し ( for 節)の後に、ループの中身であるアクションを一つ以上書く。アクションの主たるものは値の集約だが、任意の式の実行も可能。
繰り返しは複数個指定でき、その場合は入れ子ではなく同じループの中で並行して扱われる。
繰り返しの終了条件のどれかが満たされるとループは終了する。
アクションも複数指定でき、それらは毎回順番に実行される。
例 : この繰り返しではxとy がそれぞれ並行して進む。先にxのリストが尽きるため、yはまだ残りがあるがループは3回で終了する。
( loop for x in ( 1 3 5 ) for y in ( 2 4 6 8 10 ) collect ( cons x y ) ) == > ( ( 1 . 2 ) ( 3 .
4 ) ( 5 . 6 ) )
例 : 一つのループで複数のアクション。一つめでy を更新し、二つめでloopの戻り値となる値に集約。
( loop for x in ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) sum x into y collect y ) ==> ( 1 3 6 10 15 )
計数繰り返 し
for 変数 [ from N upfrom N downfrom N ] [ to N upto N downto N below N above N ] [ by N ] 〜
次 の3要素の1つ以上が必要 :
from 数値 ( 始値の指定 ) from N / upfrom N / downfrom N ( デフォルトは0 ) to 数値 ( 上限または下限の指定 ) to N / upto N / downto N / below N / above N by 数値 ( 増分の指定 ) by N ( デフォル ト は 1 ま た は - 1 )
デクリメント時の注意点 :
始値のデフォルトは存在しないため省略不可。
downfrom か downto / below によって増分の方向が負であることを明示する必要あり。( 例えば、 from 20 to 10 等は不可。 downfrom 20 to 10 や from 20 downto 10 等とする )
例 :
( loop for i from 10 to 50 by 5 collect i ) == > ( 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 )
repeat N 〜
N 回繰り返し。カウンタ変数の値そのものは不要な時に。
コレクション内繰り返し
for 変数 in リスト on リスト across ベクタ [ by ステップ関数 ] 〜
ステップ関数は次の要素を保持する位置を得る関数で、
デフォルトは当然 #'cdr 。この関数次第でリストに限らず広く応用もできそうだ。
「 on リスト 」の場合、変数には要素ではな くconsセルが代入される 。
( loop for x in ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) collect x ) ==> ( 1 2 3 4 ) ( loop for x in ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) by #'cddr collect x ) == > ( 1 3 ) ; 一つ飛ばし ( loop for x on ' ( 1 2 3 ) collect x ) == > ( ( 1 2 3 ) ( 2 3 ) ( 3 ) ) ( loop for x on ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) by #'cddr collect x ) == > ( ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ( 3 4 5 ) ( 5 ) )
for 変数 being the hash - keys hash - values in ハッシュ表 [ using ( hash - value hash - key 変数 ) ] 〜
for 変数 being the symbols present - symbols external - symbols in パッケージ 〜
ハッシュ表やパッケージの要素についての繰り返し。ハッシュ表ではループ変数はキーか値の一方について繰り返すが using を使うことで他方も参照可能。
( defvar ht ( make - hash - table ) ) ( setf ( gethash ' foo ht ) 1 ) ( setf ( gethash ' bar ht ) 2 ) ( loop for x being the hash - keys in ht collect x ) ==> ( BAR FOO ) ( loop for x being the hash - keys in ht using ( hash - value y ) collect ( cons x y ) ) == > ( ( BAR .
2 ) ( FOO . 1 ) )
変数更新しながら繰り返し
for 変数 = 式 1 [ then 式 2 ] 〜
最初のループでは式1を評価した結果を変数の値とし、以降のループでは式2(省略された場合は式1)を評価した値で更新する。 do マクロとは異なり、式2が省略された場合も式1を毎回評価して変数を更新する。
複数の変数を更新する場合、 for を複数並べるか、 and を使う 。
( loop repeat 5 for x = 0 then y ← 前回のy が使われる for y = 1 then (+ x y ) ← 新しいxが使われる 〜) ( loop repeat 5 for x = 0 then y ← 前回のy が使われ る and y = 1 then (+ x y ) ← 前回のxが使われる 〜)
ループ終了条件の追 加
while until 式 〜
式 が偽になったら( until の場合は真になったら ) ループは終了 。
( loop for y = nil then ( cons 'x y ) while (< ( length y ) 3 ) collect y ) ==> ( NIL ( X ) ( X X ) )
集約
collect append nconc count sum maximize minimize 式 [ into 変数 ]
式を評価しその結果をそれぞれの方法で集約する。
into 句があると、集約の結果はループ内ローカルな変数に代入される。ない場合は集約の結果は loop のデフォルトの戻り値となる 。
動詞はそれぞれ〜ingという動名詞形でもよい。
collect : 式を並べたリストを作る
: 式を並べたリストを作る append : 式をリストとみて、それらを結合したリストを作る
: 式をリストとみて、それらを結合したリストを作る nconc : 〃
: 〃 count : 式が真となる場合の回数を数える
: 式が真となる場合の回数を数える sum : 式を足し合わせる
: 式を足し合わせる maximize : 最大値を選ぶ
: 最大値を選ぶ minimize : 最小値を選ぶ
ループ内ローカル変 数
with 変数 [ = 式 ]
任意の式の実 行
do 式 [ 式 ... ]
任意 のLisp式を毎回実行。別のloopマクロ内キーワードが出現するかloopマクロの終わりまで任意個のLisp式を続けられる。
条件分岐
if when unless 条件 〜 [ else … ] [ end ]
条件は任意 のLisp式。 if と when は同義 。
〜や…の部分はloopマクロの節。複数の節を入れたい場合はそれらを and で繋ぐ。
end は省略可 。
( loop for x from 1 to 5 if ( evenp x ) collect x ) == > ( 2 4 )
ループ中 断
return 式
named ラベル for ...
return はループを中断する。 finally 節は実行されない。ループから脱出したいが正常終了と同様に finally 節を実行したり値を返したい場合、 do 節の中で LOOP - FINISH マクロを用いる 。
named はループが作るブロックに名前をつける。その名前を使って
RETURN -FROM してもループを抜けられる。
( loop named outer for xs in lists do ( loop for x in xs do ( if ( foop x ) ( return - from outer x ) ... ) ) )
繰り返しの初期化・後始末
initially finally 式 [ 式 ... ]
どちらもdo同様に次のloopキーワードまで任意個の式が書ける。
finally 節が実行されない3条件 :
return 節で脱出した場 合
節で脱出した場合 RETURN , RETURN -FROM
で脱出した場合 ( つまり、 finally は unwind - protect で実現されるわけではない )
, で脱出した場合 ( つまり、 は で実現されるわけではない ) ループが always , never , thereis 条件で終了した場 合
不変条件
always never thereis 式 〜
ループの全繰り返しに渡って不変条件が守られたかをloopの戻り値とする。条件が破られるとループを中断、 finally によるエピローグもスキップする。
中断する条件 中断時の戻り値 完了時の戻り値 always 式が偽になったら中断 nil t never 式が真になったら中断 nil t thereis 式がnil以外になったら中断 式の値 nil
分割代入
記述力は destructuring - bind に劣るものの、 for や with による変数への代入は、リスト やconsの分割代入が可能 。
値を無視したい部分にはnilを使う。
for ( a b ) in ' ( ( 1 2 ) ( 3 4 ) ( 5 6 ) ) 〜 for ( kar . kdr ) on ' ( ( 1 .
2 ) ( 3 .
4 ) ( 5 . 6 ) ) 〜

World of Ends What the Internet Is and
How to Stop Mistaking It
for Something Else . by
Doc Searls and
David Weinberger Last update : 3.10.03 ( More typos fixed 1.29.08 )
There are mistakes and there are mistakes .
Some mistakes we learn from .
For example :
Thinking that selling toys for pets on the Web is a great way to get rich .
We 're not going to do that again .
Other mistakes we insist on making over and over .
For example , thinking that : ... the Web , like television , is a way to hold eyeballs still while advertisers spray them with messages .
... the Net is something that telcos and cable companies should filter , control and otherwise " improve . "
... it 's a bad thing for users to communicate between different kinds of instant messaging systems on the Net .
... the Net suffers from a lack of regulation to protect industries that feel threatened by it .
When it comes to the Net , a lot of us suffer from Repetitive Mistake Syndrome .
This is especially true for magazine and newspaper publishing , broadcasting , cable television , the record industry , the movie industry , and the telephone industry , to name just six .
Thanks to the enormous influence of those industries in Washington , Repetitive Mistake Syndrome also afflicts lawmakers , regulators and even the courts .
Last year Internet radio , a promising new industry that threatened to give listeners choices far exceeding anything on the increasingly variety - less ( and technologically stone - age ) AM and FM bands , was shot in its cradle .
Guns , ammo and the occasional " Yee - Haw ! " were provided by the recording industry and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which embodies all the fears felt by Hollywood 's alpha dinosaurs when they lobbied the Act through Congress in 1998 .
" The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it , " John Gilmore famously said .
And it 's true .
In the long run , Internet radio will succeed .
Instant messaging systems will interoperate .
Dumb companies will get smart or die .
Stupid laws will be killed or replaced .
But then , as John Maynard Keynes also famously said , " In the long run , we 're all dead . "
All we need to do is pay attention to what the Internet really is .
It 's not hard .
The Net is n't rocket science .
It is n't even 6th grade science fair , when you get right down to it .
We can end the tragedy of Repetitive Mistake Syndrome in our lifetimes — and save a few trillion dollars ' worth of dumb decisions — if we can just remember one simple fact : the Net is a world of ends .
You 're at one end , and everybody and everything else are at the other ends .
Sure , that 's a feel - good statement about everyone having value on the Net , etc .
But it 's also the basic rock - solid fact about the Net 's technical architecture .
And the Internet 's value is founded in its technical architecture .
Fortunately , the true nature of the Internet is n't hard to understand .
In fact , just a fistful of statements stands between Repetitive Mistake Syndrome and Enlightenment ...

A payday loan helps you to deal with something urgent without dipping into money earmarked for other bills .
Applying for a payday loan with Payday UK is carried out online .
It ’s fast and straightforward , and you ’ll usually have the money in your bank account within 10 minutes * .
We have tried to keep all our processes as straightforward as possible and back them up with a knowledgeable and efficient customer service team .
Although the reasons for applying for a payday loan are wide and varied , they are nearly always time - sensitive .
Direct lenders understand this .
They have made the process from acceptance to receiving your money as streamlined as they can .
Loans for Life ’s Emergencies
A payday loan or short term loan can be particularly useful when faced with an unexpected expense that ca n’t wait .
Some people can be put off using payday loans because of the high APR rates quoted .
However , this is because the loans are generally over a short period , providing a direct lender with a narrow window for interest to be accumulated .
Since the FCA introduced a cap on interest rates and the number of times a loan can be rolled over , all lenders now adhere to these fair lending rules .
If you ’re unsure of any aspect of your loan , please read the relevant information in your agreement , as lenders are required to be transparent about any interest or charges they are going to apply .
Remember , you are under no obligation to accept any offer that a lender makes to you and you should never pay any fees for a loan .
Splogging
18 septembra , 2006 at 12:39 popoldan
Zadnje dni sem , priznam – bolj kot pisala svojega , brala druge bloge .
Tako tuje kot domače .
Pri tem sem naletela na pojem splogging .
Razmišljam še , kako bi ga lahko poimenovali po slovensko ( * splog* mi ni preveč všeč ) .
No , saj morda ga pa kdo že je .
Na 24 ur pravijo TAKOLE .
Zanimivo je razmišljanje tudi na na Lugosu , tukaj .
Na RIS lahko preberemo naslednje :
Med blogi vedno več spama
Umbria je naredila raziskavo med spletnimi dnevniki ( blog ) in prišla do presenetljivih ugotovitev .
V povprečju se na spletu pojavi vsako sekundo en nov spletni dnevnik .
Število dnevnikov se podvoji vsakih 5 in pol mesecev .
Močno pa se med denvniki širi tudi e-slama ( spam ) .
Zelo hitro se povečuje število spam blogov , katerih glavni namen je , da zavajajo iskalnike in speljujejo promet na strani , ki prodajajo različne izdelke in storitve .
Zadnje ocene kažejo , da je 10 do 20 % vseh blogov spam blogov ( splog ) .
Spam blogi so tudi usmerjeni v iskalnike blogov .
Ti med rezultati pokažejo v povprečju 44 % spam blogov ( splogov ) .
Vir : Umbria , 28.12.2005 , Celotna raziskava >> ( pdf , 4,46 MB , en )
Kaj je torej splog ?
Splog pa ni samo spam plus blog .
Splog je tudi blog , na katerem lastnik ne dela objavlja vsebin , ki bi imele neko za / pisno vrednost .
Veliko je tudi blogov z ukradeno vsebino in / ali so namenjeni le / posrednemu / oglaševanju .
Toda , vsebina v blogu je zelo pomembna .
Če blogaš , blogaš zato , ker želiš nekaj povedati .
Vsebina je tista , ki daje blogu vrednost .
Pri tem sem prišla do nekaj ugotovitev .
Ja , že spet , kar naprej kaj ugotavljam , kar že obstaja .
Splogov ne maram , ker kradejo moj čas .
Kategorija : kr neki .
Pika !
Potem sem šla malce vase in kritično preučila vsebino svojega bloga .
Sem in tja tudi sama pripnem kak šno povezavo ali štos , ki mi je všeč in ga želim deliti z drugimi .
Ampak vsaj enkrat do dvakrat tedensko pa se res ornk potrudim za bogatejšo vsebino .
Z različnih področij , pač tisto , kar me trenutno zanima .
Obilica Splogov se valja po spletu .
In ne maram zgubljat časa s selekcioniranjem le teh .
Katere bloge , take – Z VSEBINO , pa vi radi berete ?

It 's one thing to type code that produces a " Hello World " message on your display , but quite another to make the gesture as grandly as one German programmer , who cut a wheat field in Semacode to display the classic message .
I remember my first C++ programming class during my budding years as a computer nerd .
The first in - class project was to write code that included iostream.h and output " Hello , World ! " to our monitors ; it 's a common project for beginner programmers as they start to learn a new language , but I 've never seen it done quite like this .
I 'll stop complaining about mowing my yard now .
The German programmer , Ben Hopfeng - Aertner , wrote in Semacode , a type of visual code that contains " machine readable information " that can be used to graphically encode web - links .
Since the code is visual , Ben was able to take a picture of his 160 square meter programming artwork from an airplane and have a machine read the code to output the words " Hello , World ! "
Ben also created a Google Earth file so that anyone can download his project and see his work in its native landscape .
He does n't mention how long it took him but , judging by pictures that include Winter and Spring shots , it looks like the project took at least a few months to complete .
No word on whether he 's opening up his own landscape / coding business .
For more information on this project , check out Ben 's web site or Flickr page .
From US News and World Report , authorities made two extraordinary seizures not long ago : the largest drug cash seizure and the largest maritime drug seizure in history .
On March 15 , Mexican authorities raided a villa in one of Mexico City 's poshest neighborhoods and found what they say is the largest drug cash seizure on record– anywhere – $ 205 million in cash , most of it in $ 100 bills .
Total weight of all that cash : at least 4,500 pounds .
" This is like law enforcement hitting the ultimate jackpot , " said DEA top cop Karen Tandy .
Also seized were 200,000 euros , 158,000 pesos , eight luxury vehicles , and a small arsenal .
Officials say the money is tied to Chinese and Indian suppliers of raw materials for methamphetamine , which is brewed in Mexican superlabs and then exported to the United States .
Google is improving its green credentials by offering all of its employees a free bike to ride to work .
The bikes , manufactured by Raleigh Europe , will be offered to around 2,000 permanent employees of the search engine giant in Europe , the Middle East and Africa .
All of the bikes - plus free helmets - will be branded with the Google name .
Holger Meyer , Germany 's first Google employee , came up with the idea and staff will be able to choose from a range of models including a " cool cruiser " - a folding bike for those that only make part of their trip to work under pedal power - and men's and women 's hybrids .
" We try to innovate not just in technology for users but in the benefits we give our employees , " Liane Hornsey , director of human resources and staffing for Google Europe , Middle East and Africa , told MediaGuardian.co.uk .
" We think that these amazing bikes will help Googlers keep fit and healthy , get to know their city better and reduce the environmental impact of their journey to work . "
When Google is not fighting $ 1bn lawsuits on behalf of video sharing subsidiary YouTube over copyright issues , or defending products such as Google News from irate publishers , it puts some effort into developing an ethical operation .
Google recently announced plans to begin installing solar panels on the roof of its Mountain View HQ campus .
The project , which will provide the " Googleplex " HQ with green energy , will be the largest solar installation on any corporate campus in the US - and possibly one of the largest on any corporate site in the world , according to the company .
Google Europe has also this week been given an award for using free - range eggs by the Compassion in World Farming organisation .

Alan Turing is considered to be one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the last century .
He helped crack the German Enigma code during the Second World War and laid the foundations for the digital computer .
His only foray into mathematical biology produced a paper so insightful that it is still regularly cited today , over 50 years since it was published .
Reticulated giraffe Rothschild 's giraffe
Modelling an embryo
Turing 's paper described how " reaction - diffusion equations " might be used by animals to generate patterned structure during their development as an embryo .
Animals start as a single cell that divides many times to create a full - size individual .
During the early stages , the small ball of cells is completely uniform , or homogeneous , but out of this develop the dramatic patterns of a zebra , leopard , giraffe , butterfly or angelfish .
Turing was interested in how a spatially homogeneous system , such as a uniform ball of cells , can generate a spatially inhomogeneous but static pattern , such as the stripes of a zebra .
He managed to formulate a series of differential equations that , when solved , show very elegantly how the diversity of wonderful patterns on animals might be created .
Imagine an embryo with two types of chemical inside it .
The two chemicals , as we will see , interact to generate patterns , and so are called morphogens ( morpho from the Greek for " form " , and gen from the Greek for " to beget " ) .
For the sake of this discussion , we can imagine the embryo as a one - dimensional line and look at the concentration of each of the two morphogens at each point along the line .
The chemicals can diffuse left and right along the line from a point of high concentration to lower concentration , and can also be produced afresh by cells along the embryo .
One morphogen is an " Inhibitor " and suppresses the production of both itself and the other chemical .
The other , an " Activator " , promotes the production of both morphogens .
At any time ( t ) and any point along the embryo ( x ) , the concentrations of the Activator and Inhibitor are given by A ( x , t ) and I ( x , t ) respectively .
But these concentrations change over time due to new production ( a reaction ) and diffusion .
The system is therefore known as a reaction - diffusion equation .
As we saw in Making the grade in Issue 27 of Plus , differentiation is a method of working out the gradient of a curve - how quickly one variable changes with respect to another .
If , as in this case , the function is of two variables ( x and t ) then calculating the gradient with respect to just one of them is known as partial differentiation .
So the change of concentration of Activator over time can be written as the partial differential equation
The first term on the right - hand side describes how much Activator is being produced .
It is a function of Activator and Inhibitor concentrations because they both affect the reaction rate .
The second term is a second derivative describing how quickly the gradient of Activator is changing .
It gives the rate of diffusion .
The change of Inhibitor with respect to time is given by
The extra term , d , on the right - hand side is the diffusion coefficient - how much quicker Inhibitor diffuses than Activator .
The Inhibitor being a faster diffuser was shown by Turing to be pivotal in driving the process of pattern generation .
Very perturbing
Initially ( i.e. when t=0 ) , the two chemicals are in equilibrium - their concentrations do not change over time .
The amount of Activator and Inhibitor is just right so that the reaction and diffusion rates exactly balance .
The situation is an " unstable equilibrium " , however , and the first nudge , or perturbation in maths speak , knocks the system away from this equilibrium .
It is like a pencil poised on its tip - it might be perfectly balanced but the slightest nudge pushes the pencil over and it never recovers this equilibrium point .
Say that , for whatever reason , the concentration of Activator increases slightly at one point .
Now the local concentration of Activator is greater than Inhibitor , so more Activator is produced , and so on in a snowball effect .
But Inhibitor is also being produced , and because it diffuses faster it quickly spreads to either side of the perturbation and decreases the concentration of Activator there .
So you end up with a region of high Activator concentration bordered on both sides by high Inhibitor .
This process can be seen in the video to the right .
As the animation steps through time the concentration of Activator along the embryo organises into a series of peaks .
The reaction - diffusion equations can also be formulated for two dimensions .
In this case an island of high Activator becomes surrounded by a moat of Inhibitor .
Beyond this inhibitory halo , however , the levels of Inhibitor drop again and so other seeds can produce an area of high activator concentration .
In this way the symmetry of the uniform concentration is broken into roughly evenly spaced regions of high Activator .
Revealing the pattern
An activator landscape
The Activator and Inhibitor are not colour pigments themselves , just the morphogens that interact to create an underlying pattern .
If the Activator also promotes the generation of a pigment in the skin of the animal then this pattern can be made visible .
Skin cells could produce yellow pigment unless they detect high levels of Activator instructing them to produce black .
This would yield a visible pattern similar to that of a cheetah .
The size of these spots will depend on what are known as thresholds .
The concentration of Activator can be thought of as a landscape of hills , with a certain concentration of Activator ( i.e. altitude ) required to turn ON the pigment .
If this threshold is high , then only tiny spots at the very summit of the hills are seen , but if the threshold is lowered , then more of each hill is coloured and the spots are larger with less space between them .
Such a mechanism may explain the difference in markings between two subspecies of giraffe : the Rothschild 's giraffe and the reticulated giraffe ( shown at the top of this page ) , the first of which has smaller , more widely - spaced spots than the other .
A low threshold for turning pigment ON A high threshold for turning pigment ON
Saturation can also be an important factor .
If the concentration of Activator can reach a maximum value ( ie. it is produced as fast as it breaks down or diffuses away ) then the spots may join up into stripes .
This is believed to be what happens in the zebra .
Size matters
The size of the embryo at the time of pattern generation is also very important .
If the Inhibitor diffuses quickly relative to the size of the domain then few spots will be able to form .
In fact , the stationary wave of Activator concentration is very similar to modes of vibration on a guitar string : only certain wavelengths can fit .
The diagram below shows the reaction - diffusion simulation run on " embryos " of different sizes : 5 , 30 , 150 and 1000 units long .
No pattern at all can form on small animals , and on very large animals the spots are too small - scale and seem to blend together .
The cheetah has spots on its body and a stripy tail - but it's not possible for a stripy animal to have a spotted tail
Some developmental biologists have argued that this explains why neither small mice nor large elephants have any patterning .
In between , however , more and more spots fit along the embryo .
If d ( the diffusion constant ) is assumed to be the same for all mammals , then this would explain why hamsters have only a few patches of colour whilst leopards have hundreds of small spots .
The size of the domain also affects the type of patterns that can form .
An animal 's tail can be thought of as a cylinder with a steadily decreasing radius .
The top is large enough to support two - dimensional patterns like spots , but down at the bottom the domain becomes too small .
The region of high Activator spreads all the way around the tail and joins up with itself , so that a spot becomes a stripe .
The transition between spots and stripes is shown very well by a cheetah 's tail .
This aspect of the maths also explains why a spotted animal can have a striped tail , but a striped animal can never have a spotted tail .
The process of pattern generation is completed in mammals during the embryonic stage .
But some animals need to keep their markings up to date as they grow to full size .
The stripes along the Marine angelfish move very slowly over time as the domain size increases .
The basic bands on a young fish move apart as the fish grows , with new stripes appearing or dividing off existing ones to fill in any gaps .
Nature as Art ?
The perturbations that trigger spots and stripes are usually statistical variations in the rate of morphogen production or diffusion .
But physical disturbances from outside the embryo can have the same effect .
The beautiful eyespots on butterfly wings are thought to rely on the principles described above , although involving more morphogens .
Marta de Menezes produces art with living objects by pricking a butterfly wing with a pin while it is still developing in the chrysalis .
This disrupts the concentration gradients and so alters the natural design .

Australian artist Justine Cooper created the marketing campaign for a non-existent drug called Havidol for Dysphoric Social Attention Consumption Deficit Anxiety Disorder ( DSACDAD ) , which she also invented .
But the multi-media exhibit at the Daneyal Mahmood Gallery in New York , which includes a Web site , mock television and print advertisements and billboards is so convincing people think it is authentic .
“ People have walked into the gallery and thought it was real , ” Mahmood said in an interview .
“ They did n’t get the fact that this was a parody or satire . ”
But Mahmood said it really took off over the Internet .
In the first few days after the Web site ( www.havidol.com) went up , it had 5,000 hits .
The last time he checked it had reached a quarter of a million .
“ The thing that amazes me is that it has been folded into real Web sites for panic and anxiety disorder .
It ’s been folded into a Web site for depression .
It ’s been folded into hundreds of art blogs , ” he added .
The parody is in response to the tactics used by the drug industry to sell their wares to the public .
Consumer advertising for prescription medications , which are a staple of television advertising in the United States , was legalized in the country in 1997 .
Cooper said she intended the exhibit to be subtle .
“ The drug ads themselves are sometimes so comedic .
I could n’t be outrageously spoofy so I really wanted it to be a more subtle kind of parody that draws you in , makes you want this thing and then makes you wonder why you want it and maybe where you can get it , ” she added .
Mahmood said that in addition to generating interest among the artsy crowd , doctors and medical students have been asking about the exhibit .
“ I think people identify with the condition , ” he said .
Reporter arrested after Republican debate

A reporter advancing 9/11 conspiracy theories in a heated exchange with advisers to Rudy Giuliani was arrested following Tuesday night 's Republican debate .
Police in Goffstown , N.H. , confirmed to RAW STORY that freelance reporter Matt Lepacek was arrested for trespassing following the debate at St. Anselm College in Goffstown .
Lepacek was asking a Giuliani adviser about comments the former mayor made on ABC News on Sept. 11 that some say show he had foreknowledge that the World Trade Center would collapse .
Police refused to release more information about Lepacek 's case prior to his first scheduled court appearance July 3 .
Lepacek was reporting for Infowars.com , which advances theories about the government knowing in advance about the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 .
Lepacek claimed to have press credentials issued by CNN , which sponsored Tuesday 's debate .
A CNN representative in charge of issuing credentials did not immediately return a phone call or e-mail from RAW STORY seeking comment .
Reports on Lepacek 's arrest first appeared on Infowars.com and the Jones Report .
Witnesses said Lepacek and another reporter were physically assaulted by police and their camera equipment was damaged , according to those reports , which also included video of Lepacek 's confrontation with Giuliani staffers .
" If this were 10 years ago , they'd be throwing pies in our face , " the Giuliani staffer says to other assembled reporters after Lepacek is dragged away .

Landis produces a tremendous fightback on Thursday
After losing more than 10 minutes on Wednesday , Landis bounced back to move within 30 seconds of leader Oscar Pereiro and rival Carlos Sastre .
Sastre came home second to close the gap on Pereiro to 12 seconds , with Landis now well placed in third .
The American could still win the Tour with Saturday 's time - trial to come .
Landis had looked dead and buried at the start of the stage , which he started more than eight minutes adrift of his rivals after his final climb collapse on Wednesday .
I have come here to win the Tour and I am not done fighting yet
Floyd Landis
His solo raid allowed him to climb the fifth of the day 's climbs , the unclassified Col de la Joux Plane , on his own and he came over the summit with a five - minute lead on Spaniard Sastre .
Landis finished the race seven minutes and eight seconds ahead of Pereiro , who retained the jersey by the narrowest of margins .
" I have come here to win the Tour and I am not done fighting yet , " said Landis , who lost the leader 's yellow jersey on Wednesday .

96 members of Congress paying family members Nick Juliano
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This
More than one in four members of Congress who hold top positions on committees and subcommittees or are in the House Leadership have used their position to enrich family members , according to a watchdog 's investigation .
Lawmakers employed family members on campaign committees and used campaign funds to pay family businesses or contribute to relatives among other methods that Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says warrants an investigation .
In its report , CREW identified 96 members of Congress * -- 41 Democrats and 55 Republicans -- who used their positions to financially benefit family members .
CREW , a Washington - based watchdog group that promotes openness in government , focused on the 337 House committee or subcommittee chairs and ranking members , along with the five leadership positions .
It examined campaign finance records from the 2002 , 2004 and 2006 election cycles .
CREW notes much of the financial arrangements it uncovers are legal .
A candidate can employ his wife or brother as a campaign aide as long as the relative is paid fair market value for the real work they contribute to the campaign .
The investigation was unable to determine a relatives ' qualifications in the 64 cases of lawmakers paying family members through their campaign committees or PACs , CREW said .
Members of Congress contributed to family members ' financial interest in amounts ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars , according to the investigation .
Among the top spending lawmakers , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , used more than $ 350,000 of campaign funds for accounting and fundraising services from firms controlled by her husband .
Lofgren told USA
Today that her husband 's firm did superior work , but he has since dissolved the firm .
" People did n't feel comfortable with it ... if you have to use more than two sentences to explain it , that does n't work , " Lofgren told the newspaper .
She said she supports a bill introduced this month that would prohibit candidates from using campaign accounts to pay spouses and would heighten disclosure of other family relationships with campaign staff .
CREW 's report notes that members of Congress can't hire spouses or other family members to work in their congressional offices .
The group says the logic should be the same for campaign committees , which can rake in huge sums of money from an array of individual donors and political action committees .
The group 's executive director , Melanie Sloan , said the report " shines a spotlight on the troubling practice of lawmakers using their congressional positions as profit centers for family members . "
Several presidential candidates made it to CREW 's list , including Reps. Duncan Hunter , R - Calif. ; Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio ; and Ron Paul , R - Texas .
Hunter and Paul each spent more than $ 100,000 in salaries and reimbursements to family members , while Kucinich paid his cousin more than $ 35,000 for campaign consulting and fundraising between 2002 and 2004 .
Editor 's Note :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly listed the party affiliations of the members of Congress identified in CREW 's report .

A two - year study of the World Trade Center Towers ’ collapse by Purdue University has reaffirmed the findings of the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which suggested that the buildings crashed under their own weight after crucial support columns and fireproofing were damaged or destroyed .
The research team released an animation of the first plane ’s collision to show how heat and flame eventually brought the towers down .
AP via Yahoo :
The two - year Purdue University study , funded in part by the National Science Foundation , was the first to use 3 - D animation to provide visual context to the attacks , said Christoph Hoffmann , a professor of computer science and one of the lead researchers on the project .
“ One thing it does point out … is the absolute essential nature of fireproofing steel structures , ” Hoffmann told the Associated Press .
“ This is something that was n’t done originally in the World Trade Center when it was built .
It was n’t code at that time . ”
Mete Sozen , a professor of structural engineering and a lead investigator on the simulation , said Purdue researchers hope their work leads to better structural design and building codes to prevent similar collapses .

I guess I need to start slicking my hair back with spit , like that suave man of the world , Paul Wolfowitz .
Or maybe it was n't the spit that got Wolfowitz a new girlfriend .
Maybe it was the way he gave her two large salary increases even though she was no longer with the World Bank .
Wolfowitz , President Bush 's choice to head the World Bank , took over in 2005 .
Riza [ with whom he was romantically involved ] was transferred to the State Department shortly afterward , in accordance with conflict - of - interest rules .
She is still paid by the bank and she has received raises that increased her pay to $ 193,590 from $ 132,660 , according to the bank 's employee association , which has said the raises violated bank rules that limit the size of pay increases .
One thing that makes this story especially eye - rolling , NPR has is in the midst of a two part story on Wolfowitz 's pet project at the World Bank , stamping out corruption .
" Corruption is often at the very root of why governments do not work , " Wolfowitz argued in a speech in Indonesia in April 2006 .
On that point , Paul and I are in full agreement .
However , it does n't look as if Wolfowitz will have to go far in locating his next corruption problem .
Update [ 2007-4-12 17:50:17 by Devilstower ] : Judicial Watch has this covered .
Danny Ocean & Co. are back at it , this time taking Las Vegas by storm once again .
In 2001 ’s Ocean ’s 11 , we saw the crew take out not one but three Las Vegas casinos at one time — the MGM , the Bellagio , and the Mirage .
In Ocean ’s 12 , the team heads across the pond to pull off another heist .
This time , to dismal reviews , they were after the world ’s oldest stock certificate , issued by Dutch East India Company in 1602 .
This Friday , June 8th , they ’re back in Vegas .
To celebrate the release of Ocean ’s 13 , we decided to cast the special effects and clever screenwriting aside to find the less - than - glamorous inspiration for Hollywood heists .
From actual casino jobs in Vegas to East Coast bull semen robberies , here are 13 heists that really happened — one for each of Ocean ’s crew .
In September of 1992 , Bill Brennan , a cashier at the Stardust ’s ( which has since been demolished ) sports book , casually left for lunch after a shift with over $ 500,000 in cash and chips inside of a bag draped over his shoulder — the biggest theft from a Las Vegas casino in history .
Even after being on the the FBI ’s most wanted list , and appearing on America ’s Most Wanted , there have been no signs of Brennan .
Some believe he worked with an accomplice who later killed him for his half of the money , though others — such as the police — are convinced he worked alone and fled the country .
Fifteen years later and still no sign of Bill Brennan .
Meet Heather Tallchief .
In October of 1993 , Tallchief , 21 , and accomplice Roberto Solis , 48 , made off with a Loomis Armored truck filled with $ 2.5 million USD outside of Circus Circus .
The two escaped the United States via the Cayman Islands and St. Martin , though Solis — a man who Tallchief thought was in love with her — later left , leaving her with only $ 1,000 to her name and a kid to raise alone .
After running from the law for over 12 years , Heather Tallchief finally surrendered in September of 2005 .
“ There ’s no running away anymore , ” she told MSNBC .
“ I ’ve done enough of that . ”
Her sentence : 63 months in prison .
In August of 2005 , Brazil saw its largest bank robbery to date , a heist that netted its masterminds $ 65 million USD .
Police estimate that at least 20 members spent three months tunneling 80 meters underground from a nearby house ( just like Short Circuit 2 ) and carted out over 20,000 pounds of money without as much as an alarm going off .
Two suspects have since been caught , though only $ 500,000 has been found , which is a shame for the bank .
It turns out their insurance only covered theft during transportation , not while it sat in the vault .
Oops .
February , 1994 .
Across the pond , in Oslo , Norway , Edvard Munch ’s famous painting , The Scream , was stolen from a lower level gallery in the National Gallery of Norway .
Two men , a ladder , some wire cutters , and 50 seconds is all it took to wander off with Norway ’s most famous and valuable painting .
A few months later the thieves offered the painting back in exchange for a $ 1 million USD ransom , but the offer was refused .
Good thing , too , as a sting operation held in May of 1994 successfully recovered the unharmed painting and returned it to its owners .
Four men were convicted and sentenced for the theft in 1996 .
However , the drama for The Scream was n’t over yet .
In August of 2004 , nearly 10 years after the first theft , The Scream , along with Munch ’s Madonna , was stolen once again — this time at gun point at the Munch Museum .
“ The paintings were simply attached by wire to the walls , ” a French radio producer and witness to the theft told the BBC .
“ All you had to do is pull on the painting hard for the cord to break loose – which is what I saw one of the thieves doing . ”
Have no fear — the paintings were once again recovered , and in much better condition than expected .
But come on , Norway , twice ?
You ’ve seen the movie Goodfellas , right ?
The character , Henry Hill , played by Ray Liotta , is responsible for the Air France Robbery of 1967 in which Hill and crew simply walked into the Air France cargo terminal at JFK and left with USD $ 420,000 .
It really happened .
Working on a tip from cargo supervisor Robert McMahon , the team used a woman to seduce a security guard into getting a copy of a key that locked the main security door separating the criminals from the money .
Keys replaced unnoticed , Hill and Tommy DeSimone ( portrayed by Joe Pesci in Goodfellas ) walked in , unlocked the door , and walked out with the bags without as much as a peep from an alarm or question from a guard .
This robbery later led up to the famous Lufthansa Heist , ” the largest cash robbery ever committed on American soil at the time . ”
In December of 2006 , a delivery man in Santa Clara , California had just loaded up his Mazda MPV with nearly $ 200,000 worth of microchips from his employers warehouse when an unmarked white van lightly rear - ended him in traffic .
Both parties got out to investigate the damage , while a second man jumped into the Mazda and drove off , stealing the car and the pricey microchips inside .
Peanuts compared to a well - orchestrated November 2006 heist on the Island of Penang , in the pirate - infested waters of the Strait of Malacca .
Two box trailers entered the MASKargo Complex under the charade that they were there to sniff out illegal workers .
The customs officials believed them , of course , and let them into the facil
ity without as much as a search of the trailer .
Once inside , 20 men armed with parangs ( a machete - like knife , not a style of Caribbean folk music ) jumped out and rounded up the complex workers in the area .
“ To neutralise the threat of a fight - back , the robbers plied their captives with chloroform .
Some were forced to drink a white solution which caused them to vomit .
Anyone still standing was beaten with sticks , ” according to The Star Online .
They made off with 585 cartons and 18 pallets of microchips and motherboards , a heist worth roughly $ 12 million USD .
Not too shabby for an hours worth of work .
Not everyone steals famous paintings , cash , or microchips .
In fact , some people go to great lengths to get their hands on some very unsavory — yet quite expensive — items .
In November of 2005 , a farmer at Smithburg , Maryland ’s Stonewood Acres had ventured to Pennsylvania to visit relatives .
When he returned to the farm , he noticed a 70 - pound tank filled with $ 75,000 worth of bull semen had been opened up , with sixty - five “ straws ” containing the sperm of nearly 50 bulls missing .
“ Frozen bull semen is big business because it saves on the transportation cost of putting a bull and a cow into the same pen to breed , ” explains the Washington Post .
“ Frozen semen can also last for many years , outliving the bull who produced it . ”
Moo ?
The Securitas depot robbery of 2006 is the single most profitable ( for the criminals , that is ) crime in Britain ’s history , just barely beating out the 2004 Northern Bank robbery of Belfast , Ireland .
The Securitas heist began on the evening of February 21st , when the depot manager , Colin Dixon , was heading home .
Posed as a policeman , one of the robbers pulled Dixon over and forced him into their car , where he was handcuffed and driven to a nearby farm .
Meanwhile , Dixon ’s wife and kid were also abducted and driven to the same farm , where the family were bounded together and driven to the Securitas depot .
Fourteen depot employees were also restrained while £ 53 million in used bills ( $ 92.5 million USD ) was loaded into a truck .
Here ’s one you ’ve probably never heard of : The Robert Zemelsky Musky Heist , or the Day That Everything Changed .
In 1963 , Robert Zemelsky , a Spooner , Wisconsin area fisherman , reeled in a world record 70 - pound muskellunge and hauled it into the Hayward , Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to have it weighed and measured .
Unfortunately for him , he failed to take any pictures of the gigantic fish , and the employees at the department immediately seized the fish and kicked him out .
You see , Hayward prides itself on having the largest “ musky ” on record , and the Department of Natural Resources could n’t bare seeing someone from a rival town capturing anything larger than their hometown pride .
So they stole it .
These days , Hayward folks do n’t have to worry about any larger fish popping up — they ’ve built not only the world ’s largest fiberglass structure , but the world ’s largest fish ( above ) .
The 4.5 - story - tall , 143 - foot - long musky replica is the centerpiece of Hayward ’s National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame , built in 1960 .
Oddly enough , the Robert Zemelsky Heist is n’t the only musky - related controversy in Wisconsin .
It happens quite often .
D.B. Cooper is one of America ’s most notorious hijackers , one that is still at large after 35 years of being on the run .
On November 24 , 1971 — the day before Thanksgiving — “ Dan Cooper ” hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines flight 305 with a briefcase “ bomb . ”
He handed a flight attendant a note saying “ I have a bomb in my briefcase .
I will use it if necessary .
I want you to sit next to me .
You are being hijacked . ”
With that , the flight attendant alerted the pilot who then relayed details of the situation to Seattle - Tacoma International Airport .
The pilot was instructed by radio control to comply with Cooper ’s requests : four parachutes and USD $ 200,000 .
Why four parachutes ?
Allegedly he requested the extra three for the pilot , co-pilot , and flight attendant as a way to insure they were not fake .
Passengers were dropped off at the Seattle - Tacoma airport , in exchange for the parachutes and cash .
Loot in hand , Cooper instructed the pilot to take to the skies again , this time headed for Mexico .
Not even the trailing F - 106 fighter jet saw D.B. Cooper as he jumped out of the slow - moving plane ; it ’s believed that he landed safely somewhere near Ariel , Washington .
The Wikipedia entry on D.B. Cooper has a massive amount of information — everything from possible suspects to pop cultural reference .
Most definitely worth a read .
The Isabella Gardner Museum heist of 1990 is called “ the biggest art heist in history , ” and the culprits , after 17 years , are still unknown .
Just a few hours after Boston ’s St. Patrick ’s Day festivities ended , two men dressed as policemen knocked on the side security door at the Isabella Gardner Museum , where they were greeted by two museum guards .
It only took a few minutes for the guards to realize they had made a mistake — these were n’t Boston ’s finest , they were art theives .
Before they knew it , they were handcuffed , duct taped and dragged into the basement .
The con men cut three Rembrandt ’s from their frames ( which still hang empty today ) as well as “ The Concert ” by Johannes Vermeer , “ Landscape with an Obelisk ” by Govert Flinck , and other various sketches .
The paintings have never been found , and the museum never reimbursed .
Moral of the story : make sure your valuable art is insured !
What ’s the biggest bank robbery in history ?
On the eve of the first round of Baghdad bombings in March of 2003 , a gang broke into the Central Bank of Iraq and filled up three tractor trailers with cash totaling approximately USD $ 1 - billion .
Over half of that billion was later found hidden in the walls of Saddam Hussein ’s palace by US troops , yet the rest still remains
unaccounted for .
Just down the road in Basra , Iraq , UK troops foiled yet another high - dollar bank heist .
Roughly 60 men blasted their way into the national bank in broad daylight , using another round of explosives to penetrate the vault .
The loud explosions alerted nearby UK troops , who broke up the party .
In August of 1963 , fifteen gun-less men wearing ski masks and helmets jumped on a stopped Royal Mail traveling post office train running from Glasgow to London , stealing £ 2.3 million in used bank notes .
Today that amount would be worth nearly £ 40 million .
Bruce Reynolds ( left ) was the mastermind behind the heist , and after his capture and subsequent prison time , he was treated as a celebrity .
There are numerous books , films , and musical tributes devoted to telling the story of the Great Train Robbery .
Among them is a film called Buster starring Phil Collins , who plays the lead role of Buster Edwards , one of them men involved in the robbery .
After his release from prison in 1980 , he ran a flower stall outside of London ’s Waterloo station .
ATI Catalyst Is No Longer A Killer
After our traumatic experience with ATI 's beta Catalyst driver for Windows Vista , we swore we would never touch another ATI graphics card , at least not with Windows Vista for the next few months or so .
Even when ATI released the Catalyst 7.4 driver on April 18 , 2007 , we refused to give it a try .
We were just too traumatised by our experience with Catalyst 7.3 .
After all , Catalyst 7.4 seemed like it was only a minor update of Catalyst 7.3 .
We would be nuts to give it a try .
However , after waiting over two weeks for a new update , we got tired and decided ... what the hell , let 's give this version a try and reformat the testbed if it kills Windows Vista again .
So , with some trepidation in our hearts , we downloaded the Catalyst 7.4 driver .
After crossing our fingers and drawing ancient protection runes around the system , we loaded up the Radeon X1950 GT and installed the driver .
One reboot , no BSOD ( Blue Screen Of Death ) .
Adjusted the resolution and another reboot .
Still no BSOD !
Finally !
We are very happy to announce that ATI 's driver team has finally done something right with their Windows Vista driver .
The new ATI Catalyst 7.4 driver will NOT kill Windows Vista .
It Is Much Faster ...
The ATI Radeon X1950 GT chugged happily through Doom 3 and Company Of Heroes .
According to ATI , " typical Improvements of 15 % or more can be seen in games such as Doom 3 , Quake 4 and Prey , with enthusiast class of products seeing improvements of 30 % or more . "
Doom 3 Catalyst 7.3 Catalyst 7.4 Difference 1920 x 1200 Not Tested 52.6 fps - 1600 x 1200 55.3 fps 61.8 fps + 11.8 % 1280 x 1024 65.7 fps 78.0 fps + 18.7 %
The X1950 GT can be considered an enthusiast - level card , so we put it to the test in Windows Vista with anisotropic filtering set to 16 x and anti-aliasing disabled .
True enough , this driver was much faster than Catalyst 7.3 .
We saw a 11.8 % increase in frame rate at 1600x1200 and a 18.7 % faster frame rate at 1280x1024 .
Nice !
But It Only Works Sometimes
Unfortunately , Far Cry still did n't work with this driver .
When we tried to load Far Cry 1.4 , it just hung .
Argghhh ... ATI still has a lot of work to do on the driver .
Far Cry 's OpenGL renderer worked but it was still slow and rendered poorly with lots of missing textures .
In other words , it was unplayable .
Like what we saw earlier with the Catalyst 7.3 driver , Far Cry 's Direct3D renderer just would n't work with the new ATI Catalyst 7.4 Vista driver , at least not with the Radeon X1950 GT .
If you successfully run Far Cry in Direct3D mode with another ATI card using the same driver , do let us know .
At least we will know it 's not a Radeon X1950 GT - specific issue .
Conclusion
We are much relieved that ATI has finally made their Catalyst driver load in Windows Vista without crashing or killing it .
You cannot believe how loud our sighs of relief were when Vista loaded up without crashing after we installed the driver .
It was like the Second Coming !
Although we are very happy that the Catalyst 7.4 driver was relatively stable in Windows Vista , that is really the absolute minimum we should expect from any driver , period .
No company should ever release a product without a working driver .
It 's not only bad work ethics , it 's bad business .
A driver that does not work with games is also bad for business .
Far Cry , for example , refused to load with this new driver .
It just hung .
Gamers do not like it when their games do n't load .
So , if ATI wants gamers to buy their cards , they will have to work hard on getting games to work right with their drivers .
With all that said , it 's great to see ATI finally getting on the right path to Windows Vista , especially so close to the launch of the Radeon HD 2000 series of graphics cards .
If ATI can get their Vista drivers in working condition for the current X1950 cards , it 's likely they will have working drivers for the Radeon HD 2000 cards .

Porn Demon
It ’s a Thursday night and I ’m having a martini at Cafe American .
On my way over I walked past The Bistro .
It was the first time I ’d seen the place since I left .
As I peeked though the restaurant ’s front window a weird sensation churned in my gut .
It was the same feeling I had driving past my boyhood home after my parents sold it and the new owners moved in .
I could see the usual wait staff running food and chatting with customers .
If anyone saw me they did n’t let on .
The Bistro looked busy .
It also looked like the dark side of the moon .
“ So , ” Arthur , the cafe ’s bartender says , “ You ’re not working at the Bistro anymore . ”
“ How long did it take for that news to travel the waiter grapevine ? ” I ask .
“ About thirty minutes . ”
“ That fast ? ”
“ No one ’s surprised you left , ” Arthur says .
“ They ’re just surprised it took so long . ”
“ No one ’s more surprised than me , ” I reply , looking into my drink .
“ You gotta admit , ” Arthur says , “ That place has blown through a lot of staff . ”
“ That ’s true about a lot of places , ” I reply .
A customer walks up to the bar and asks for a Manhattan .
Arthur and I let our conversation hang in the air while he makes the drink .
Its a pleasure to watch Arthur work .
All his movements are precise and economical .
Not a movement or drop is wasted .
Arthur passes the cocktail across the bar , rings it up , and hands back the change .
A few seconds later he palms his tip off the wooden countertop , grabs a towel , and walks back towards me .
“ So whatcha doing now ? ” Arthur asks , toweling his hands dry .
“ Oh , ” I reply , “ A little bit of this and that . ”
“ Working in a restaurant ? ”
“ Not yet , ” I reply .
“ But soon . ”
“ Want to work here ? ”
“ Thanks , but no thanks , ” I reply .
“ I want some of my watering holes to remain sacrosanct . ”
“ I hear that brother . ”
“ How ’s things with you ? ” I ask .
“ Auditions , auditions , auditions , ” Arthur replies , half smiling .
“ Any luck ? ”
“ Same old , ” Arthur says .
“ How ’s the writing thing going ? ”
“ Harder than I expected , ” I say .
“ But thank God for computers .
I ca n’t imagine typing this all out on a typewriter . ”
“ Computers are great , ” Arthur says .
“ Until they go wrong . ”
“ Ai n’t that the truth . ”
“ My old computer was so infested with porn I had to throw it out , ” Arthur says .
“ No way , ” I reply , taking a sip from my martini .
“ I ’m not kidding . ”
“ Could n’t you reformat the hard drive ? ”
“ My ex brother - in - law tried to fix it , ” Arthur says , wiping down the bar with his towel .
“ He ’s a computer geek and even he could n’t do it . ”
“ What the hell were you looking at ? ” I ask .
“ Nothing illegal , ” the bartender says , suddenly defensive .
“ Sure . ”
“ I swear , ” Arthur says .
“ I ’m surfing the net , minding my own business … ”
“ Looking at naked women . ”
“ Perusing all the wonderful smut the internet has to offer , ” Arthur continues , “ When a porn demon possesses my laptop . ”
“ Porn demon ? ”
“ Yeah , ” Arthur says , throwing up his hands .
“ A million pop-ups start exploding on the screen . ”
“ Oh no , ” I mutter .
“ And it was n’t just meat and potatoes sex stuff , ” Arthur says .
“ Not naked girls and big boobies . ”
“ Of course not . ”
“ It was the filthy degenerate monkey house porn , ” Arthur says .
“ Sick stuff . ”
I start cracking up .
“ Monkey house porn ? ”
“ Do you need me to draw you a picture ? ” Arthur asks .
“ Thats OK , ” I say quickly .
“ I know the internet can be a sick place . ”
“ The internet ’s only a window into the wackiness , ” Arthur says .
“ It was always there , just hidden . ”
“ I do n’t know about that , ” I reply .
“ Maybe on some level the craziness was always there .
But the internet ’s exacerbated the situation . ”
“ Masturbated the situation ? ” Arthur says out of the side of his mouth .
“ That was a mortal sin in my house . ”
“ Exacerbated the situation , ” I say , laughing .
“ You grow up Catholic ? ”
“ Not just Catholic , ” Arthur replies .
“ Catholic in Oklahoma . ”
“ Wow . Hardcore . ”
“ And how . ”
I drain the last of my martini .
Arthur points to the empty glass .
I nod .
“ So , ” Arthur says , pulling a frosted glass out of the freezer , “ I had a millions pop ups .
It took me forever to close them .
My ex-wife saw them . ”
“ I ’m not gonna even ask what she was doing there . ”
Arthur just smiles .
“ So the computers completely fucked , ” he says .
“ Ran slow , acted weird – the works . ”
“ Did n’t you run a virus scan ? ”
“ This is n’t a virus , ” Arthur cautions .
“ It ’s a porn demon .
Virus scans are powerless against it . ”
“ I do n’t think the church exorcises computers , ” I say .
“ You sure ? ”
I chuckle to myself .
Every Catholic diocese has an official exorcist .
I used to know the one from mine .
Its a secret , mostly ceremonial post .
Despite what you see in the movies , Linda Blair scenes are few and far between .
Something tells me the Church is n’t gonna whip out the bell , book , and candle to save a Duo-Core processor .
“ I ’m sure , ” I say .
“ That ’s too bad , ” Arthur says .
“ My brother - in - law gave up .
I had to throw the damn thing in the trash . ”
“ I do n’t know whats worse , ” I say .
“ You buying a new computer or your ex brother - in- law trying to fix it . ”
“ I learned my lesson , ” Arthur says , pouring my drink into the frosted glass .
“ I had to spend a grand on a new computer .
No more internet porn for me . ”
“ Good . ”
“ Why should I go online when theres a perfectly good video store down the street ? ”
“ You ’re incorrigible Arthur . ”
“ That I am , ” Arthur says .
“ Probably explains why Ive been divorced twice . ”
“ Maybe . ”
Arthur slides two olives into my martini and places the chilled drink in front of me .
“ To your health sir , ” he says .
“ And you , ” I say , raising my glass .
The door to the bar swings open .
A leggy blonde walks in .
She looks around , takes off her coat , and plops her cute butt on the stool next to me .
She ’s already a bit drunk .
“ Hi , ” she says , flashing me her baby blues .
“ Well , ” I say , “ Hello there . ”
“ What are you having ? ” the girl says , pointing at my drink .
“ A dirty Ketel One martini . ”
“ Mmmmm , ” the girl purrs , “ I ’ll have one of those . ”
I slide my untouched drink towards her .
“ Why wait ? ” I say gallantly .
“ Why thank you ! ” the girl says happily .
“ Arthur , ” I say , “ I believe I need another drink . ”
Arthur shakes his head .
“ Coming right up , sir . ”
“ My names Waiter , ” I say to the girl .
“ What ’s yours ? ”
“ Jenna , ” the girl replies .
In the background I hear Arthur chortling .
I bite my lip to keep from laughing .
“ What a lovely name , ” I say .
“ Man , ” Arthur says winking , “ That porn demon gets around . ”
“ Huh ? ’ the girl says , looking befuddled .
“ Nothing , ” I say , “ You just walked into a conversation . ”
“ You ’re not making fun of my name are you ? ” the girl asks the bartender .
“ Not at all Miss , ” Arthur says , trying to keep a straight face .
“ Good , ” the girl replies .
“ Because there ’s no way my parents could predict my name ’d be used by a porn star . ”
“ You ’re much prettier than she is anyway , ” I say , pulling the heat off Arthur .
The girls blue eyes widen .
“ You think so ? ” she asks , shifting her long legs towards me .
“ You should be in pictures . ”
The girl looks at me with a trace of suspicion .
“ Are you teasing me ? ”
“ I only tease the people l like , ” I reply .
“ So ? ” the girl says , brushing the hair away from her face .
“ You like me ? ”
Before I can reply a young man comes up behind the leggy blonde and puts his arms around her .
“ Hey Jenna , ” he says , squeezing her tight .
“ Hey baby , ” the girl replies , giving the man a kiss .
“ You get us a table ? ” the man asks .
“ Not yet . ”
“ I need a table for two , ” the man barks , holding up two fingers .
“ Can I get a table here ? ”
“ Of course sir , ” Arthur replies , grabbing some menus .
“ Follow me . ”
“ Jenna , ” the man says , “ I ’ve gotta hit the john .
Order me an Absolut and cranberry when you get to the table . ”
“ Sure thing . ”
The boyfriend walks towards the mens room .
Jenna turns back towards me and smiles .
“ Thanks for the drink , ” she says , running a fingernail along the rim of her martini glass .
The girl ’s looking for a reaction .
I ’ve been in this situation before .
I ’ll be in this situation again .
Even though I ’m aggravated I ca n’t show a hint of emotion .
When in doubt , play it like Bogart .
“ Here ’s looking at you kid , ” I say , raising my glass .
The girl stares at me for a moment .
“ You ’re a funny guy , ” she says .
“ My dear , ” I reply , “ You have no idea . ”
“ Well , ” the girl says , mildly confused .
“ Have a nice evening then . ”
“ You too . ”
“ Bye . ”
Arthur and I watch the girl slide off her stool and stride into the dining room .
“ You wanna buy her boyfriend a drink too ? ” Arthur snickers .
“ Shut up Arthur . ”
“ Next drink ’s on the house , ” Arthur says sympathetically .
“ You look like you ’re gonna need it . ”
I watch as the blonde girl disappears behind the curtains separating the bar from the dining room .
“ I probably will Arthur , ” I mutter .
“ I probably will . ”
' Clean sweep ' : Bush replaces top general in Middle East who opposed troop surge
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 4 , 2007 Print This Email This Print page sponsored by Velvet Revolution .
In what appears to be a military shakeup surrounding Iraq , President Bush has replaced both the top US general in the Middle East and the top general in Iraq , ABC NEWS is reporting on air .
Admiral William J. Fallon will replace Gen. John Abizaid , US commander in the Middle East , who announced his retirement in December and was expected to leave the post in March .
Abizaid was a critic of Bush 's efforts to add more troops to Iraq , but the circumstances of his early departure are unclear .
" The president wants a clean sweep , " an official told ABC News .
" Fallon , who is in the Navy , is currently head of Pacific Command ; he will be overseeing two ground wars , so the appointment is highly unusual , " ABC reports .
According to a Kansas City Star article published December 24 , " Commanders have been skeptical of the value of increasing troops .
The decision represents a reversal for Casey , the highest - ranking officer in Iraq .
Casey and Gen. John P. Abizaid , the top commander in the Middle East , have long resisted adding troops in Iraq , David Petraeus will replace General George Casey , commander of US forces in Iraq .
Casey originally opposed the President 's plan to add troops in Iraq , arguing it could delay " the development of Iraqi security forces and increase anger at the United States in the Arab world . "
The LA Times recently reported that Abizaid 's departure could clear the way for a more aggressive strategy in Iraq .
Excerpts from LA Times article : # Abizaid 's planned departure clears the way for new Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to recommend his own commander , a decision current and former Defense officials say is nearly as important as the new administration strategy expected to be unveiled by Bush in January .
These officials said Gates faces a clear choice between generals who have agreed with Abizaid 's push to quickly hand over security responsibilities to Iraqi forces and a small but increasingly influential coterie of officers backing a more aggressive U.S. - led counterinsurgency campaign .
According to Defense officials , Abizaid submitted his retirement documents just over a month ago , shortly before Donald H. Rumsfeld was pushed out as Defense secretary .
One recently retired Army general said Abizaid had wanted to retire earlier but that Rumsfeld blocked the move , insisting his war commanders stay in place .
" Going to war is n't like having a regular job , " said the retired general , who , like the others , spoke on condition of anonymity because Abizaid 's plans had not been made public .
" It 's extremely stressful , it 's heavily responsible .
I can understand why he'd want to retire . "

Water said the underwear was flushed down a toilet and caused a blockage in a sewage pipe in Middleton - St - George , near Darlington .
Heavy rain , together with a build up of grease and fat , caused the pipe to burst and the road above to collapse .
The road will remain closed for days and Northumbrian Water estimates repairs will cost more than £ 15,000 .
The company has now urged residents to think carefully about what they flush away .
' Offending items '
A spokeswoman said : " If the underwear had not been flushed down the toilet , this would not have happened .
It was very irresponsible behaviour .
These pipes are not designed to carry bras and knickers
Northumbrian Water spokeswoman
" When we dug down to inspect the damage , we found a bra and knickers had snagged itself across the nine - inch diameter of the pipe .
" There was also a heavy build - up of grease and fat , which contributed to the situation .
We were forced to repair a 2 m section of sewer and a 10 m section of road was affected .
" These pipes are not designed to carry bras and knickers . "
The spokeswoman said it was impossible to trace the owners of the underwear .
She added : " Unfortunately no - one wants to even touch the offending items .
They will remain bagged for a time and then disposed of properly . "

What is critical thinking ?
Nobody said it better than Francis Bacon , back in 1605 : For myself , I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for the study of Truth ; as having a mind nimble and versatile enough to catch the resemblances of things … and at the same time steady enough to fix and distinguish their subtler differences ; as being gifted by nature with desire to seek , patience to doubt , fondness to meditate , slowness to assert , readiness to consider , carefulness to dispose and set in order ; and as being a man that neither affects what is new nor admires what is old , and that hates every kind of imposture .
A shorter version is the art of being right .
Or , more prosaically : critical thinking is the skillful application of a repertoire of validated general techniques for deciding the level of confidence you should have in a proposition in the light of the available evidence .

Detroit Chrysler worker speaks out on impact of mass layoffs
“ This is a major change in our lives and we have no control over it ”
By Jerry White
14 April 2007
The downsizing of the US auto industry is having a devastating effect on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people , particularly in the midwestern US states of Michigan , Ohio , Indiana and Missouri .
Over the past 18 months the Big Three automakers — General Motors , Ford and Chrysler — along with their parts suppliers have announced the elimination of more than 150,000 jobs .
Unlike the early 1980s — when the downturn in the industry was followed by a period of re-hiring — analysts are quick to point out that today ’s job cuts are part of the permanent shrinking of the US auto industry in line with the smaller market share controlled by the Big Three .
In addition , for every job eliminated by the auto corporations an estimated nine others will be wiped out at auto suppliers , car dealers and other dependent businesses .
In February , DaimlerChrysler revealed plans to wipe out 13,000 jobs at its Chrysler Group plants in the US and Canada .
The company ’s German executives also made clear their intention to end the nine - year - old merger with Chrysler and spin off the money - losing US operation .
This has sparked a wave of takeover offers from private equity firms , billionaire speculator Kirk Kerkorian and the non-union Canadian auto parts giant Magna .
The outcome of such a takeover would be the gutting of the wages as well as health care and retirement benefits of Chrysler employees .
The new owners would likely sell off the corporation ’s most profitable assets and dismantle the 80 - year - old auto company .
The threatened carve up of Chrysler is the latest blow to the state of Michigan , which is already reeling from decades of plant closings and layoffs .
In the 1950s , when the US auto makers enjoyed a near global monopoly , producing four out of every five of the world ’s cars , the state ’s manufacturing centers —
Detroit , Flint , Lansing and Saginaw — boasted some of the highest rates of home ownership and per capita income in the US .
Today , Michigan ’s official jobless rate — 6.6 percent — is second only to hurricane - torn Mississippi , and neighborhoods that were once the home to the highest paid industrial workers in America are experiencing a record number of home foreclosures , bankruptcies and demands for emergency food and medical assistance .
The exodus of workers and their families from the state has prompted comparisons to the mass migration of the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s , when tens of thousands of ruined farmers from Oklahoma and other states packed up their meager belongings and left for California .
According to the US Census Bureau , 42,300 people left Michigan last year , up from 29,700 in 2005 , and by far the largest migration out of the state since 1984 , when the near - Depression conditions in the auto industry forced thousands of workers and young people to leave Michigan in search of oil industry jobs in Texas and other southwestern states .
Describing current conditions in working class areas in Michigan , a New York Times writer recently noted , “ In some Michigan neighborhoods that have been home to auto workers , houses are now selling for less than the prices of some of the vehicles rolling off of assembly lines in Detroit , Dearborn , Lansing and elsewhere in the state . ”
Autoworkers and their families have been left entirely on their own by the United Auto Workers union , which , rather than opposing the mass layoffs , is assisting the auto bosses in the “ orderly ” downsizing of the industry .
After decades of labor - management collaboration at the expense of its members , the UAW bureaucracy is not even making a pretense of defending autoworkers ’ jobs and living standards .
On the contrary , the UAW recently suppressed a wildcat strike by workers at a North Carolina plant owned by DaimlerChrysler ’s Freightliner truck division , where 1,200 out of 4,000 workers are slated to lose their jobs .
In exchange for the union ’s cooperation in the dismantling of Chrysler , the company ’s potential buyers are reportedly considering giving the UAW bureaucracy an “ equity stake ” in the new company , including possible control of its multi-billion dollar pension fund .
UAW members have been forced to make the choice of taking a “ buyout ” to leave the industry or to try to hang on , hoping that they will survive the next round of mass layoffs .
The buyout package , for eligible UAW members with at least a year of seniority , includes a $ 100,000 lump sum and six months of limited medical coverage .
Having no confidence in the UAW , more than 4,300 Chrysler workers have already chosen to take early retirement or buyout packages , leaving their jobs , benefits and retirement packages behind them .
“ We ’ve been given only a few weeks to make a life - changing decision , ” said Robert who has worked at a Chrysler plant in the Detroit area for more than 15 years .
“ If I do n’t take the buyout and then get laid off , you will get put in the Jobs Bank , where you continue to get paid .
But after the next labor contract is signed in September , the Jobs Bank might be gone and we ’ll be put out on the streets with nothing .
“ If we have to relocate to find work somewhere else , we ca n’t sell our homes because housing prices have plunged and foreclosures have skyrocketed .
We ’ll have to take the kids out of school , with all the trauma that would cause , and move to another state .
Even if I were able to sell my house , I would take a big hit .
A lot of workers have been in denial , saying this ca n’t happen to us , but it is .
I ’ve been rushing around getting dental care for my kids because in a few weeks time I may not have coverage any more .
“ This is a major change in our entire lives and we have no control over it .
The people in power are making a lot of money .
How much money do they need — $ 40 million , $ 50 million ?
Look at the lives they have destroyed .
These buyouts are a horrible thing for the working class . ”
Robert described the mood of workers on shop floor as they awaited the long - anticipated downsizing announcement scheduled for Valentine ’s Day , February 14 .
“ For six weeks before the announcement we knew it was going to be bad news , we just did n’t know how bad .
We ’ve heard a constant barrage of rumors .
There was talk two years ago about the possible sale of the company , but the top executives denied it .
Then they said , yes , they were looking for people to buy the company .
The German division wants to dump the American division , and I think they are going to do it any way they can .
We are trying to get through this , but we ’re watching the factory disintegrate before our eyes .
The company began painting the massive stamping presses white , instead of Chrysler blue , and we told ourselves this place is getting ready to be sold .
“ Maximizing profits in the short - term is all they are concerned with .
We had a multi-million dollar piece of equipment that broke down .
Three or four years ago they would have flown someone in from Germany to get it going immediately .
This time it took 10 days just to get someone to look at it .
They wo n’t put the money out , and they ’ve laid off most of the machine repairmen .
This is a major sign to the employees that they are just going to let the plant die .
My personal belief is they will sell our building to an outside company to manage it .
It is n’t going to be Chrysler anymore .
“ When Tom LaSorda took over the Chrysler division as CEO , one of the first things he said was that his responsibility was to the shareholders , not the employees .
It ’s to the guys in the investment companies that are owned by elites , not guys like me who have 100 shares in my 401K .
After the job - cutting announcement , the stock went up $ 5.40 .
If I sold them , what would I make , $ 540 dollars ?
The big guys made millions and they knew what was going to happen beforehand .
They make more in a one - day transaction than a Chrysler worker makes in his entire career .
We ’re just trying to make ends meet and put food on the table for our kids .
Everyday we ’ve got this hanging over our heads .
These people are controlling our lives .
“ This is a very bad way of doing things .
You would think that there would be laws and corporate charters .
They are supposed to be socially responsible when they do business .
But obviously these things will never come up .
The Democrats are just like the Republicans .
They do n’t care .
What happens when you lose your house ?
What are they going to do ?
[ Michigan Governor ]
Granholm and the Democrats say they are for the working class and social programs , but in reality they are cutting the programs for the people also , while they are spending billions for the war in Iraq .
The Democrats speak for the corporations , not for the working people . ”
Robert addressed the efforts by Granholm and other Democratic politicians , as well as the UAW , to blame the loss of jobs on “ unfair foreign competition , ” in particular from the Asian carmakers .
“ Toyota is not the reason we are losing our jobs , ” he said .
“ The reason is that the people on the top of Chrysler just want to make more .
I call that the law of capitalism .
They need to keep expanding and making more money .
And they ca n’t get it out of the consumer who is n’t going to pay more for a car .
People are going to go with the cheapest car because they are struggling too .
What are you going to do if you can get a Toyota cheaper than a gas - guzzling Chrysler ?
“ I ’m not against globalization .
The nationalist ‘ Buy American ’ thing does n’t solve the problem .
These are multinational corporations that are abusing people all over the world , not just here in Detroit .
We need globalization , but there has to be a fairer way to do these things so that it helps everyone out , not just a few people at the top that are taking advantage of labor all over the world .
They are always searching for cheaper labor .
“ The UAW at Chrysler says ‘ Buy Chrysler . ’
Well , Chrysler is n’t an American company anymore — it ’s a German company .
As a whole , the company made $ 1.7 billion in profits last year .
We only began ‘ losing ’ money the minute we refused to give up the same health care concessions as the GM and Ford workers did .
DaimlerChrysler has cut jobs in Germany too .
Workers all over the world are facing the same struggle .
The Ford workers at the Fiesta plant in Russia just went on strike , and the company settled it by giving them an extra nickel . ”
Chrysler workers have been hit with one “ restructuring ” after another since the 1998 merger between Chrysler and Daimler Benz , including in 2001 when the company eliminated 26,000 jobs or one fifth of its blue and white collar workforce .
The United Auto Workers union , which along with the German IG Metall union , sits on DaimlerChrysler ’s supervisory board , has pressured its members into accepting speed - up and other cost - cutting measures , supposedly to save jobs .
The result has been the worsening of conditions of auto workers on the one side , and a windfall in payoffs to the company ’s German and US - based executives on the other .
Although the company lost $ 1.5 billion last year , Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda pocketed $ 3 million in compensation , including a $ 1.1 - million annual bonus , plus $ 2 million worth of shares .
Robert commented , “ They can not increase profits any more by reducing the materials coming into the factory .
Now they are going to start hitting us up for health care .
The shareholders are not making enough money .
They need to keep it coming in .
The only place they can squeeze it out of is the employees .
They ’ve already done everything to cut costs on steel .
They ’ve gone down to such thin gauge of metal we ’ve actually had the steel go through the whole process and customers will look at the body lines on the showroom floor and the panel will be splitting because the metal is so weak .
That ’s unacceptable .
You ca n’t produce cars like that .
But they ’ve shrunk down the amount of metal so much for one thing : to save money . ”
“ The union has enabled the destruction of jobs , ” Robert said .
“ There used to be a pattern for improvements every contract , now it ’s for concessions and reductions .
The auto companies already made these cuts — they ’re supposed to be financially sound .
How many of these ‘ turnarounds ’ are we supposed to go through ?
We went through a turnaround in 2001 that cost tens of thousands of jobs .
I watched people on the news losing their jobs .
They come up to them with a security guard to escort them out of the building .
I ’m talking about guys with 15 - to - 20 years who have given their lives to the success of the company .
And the company has n’t given any security to these workers .
It is n’t any ‘ team ’ if you ask me .
The only team is the guys higher up , the so - called coaches , along with the union .
They always push that ‘ team ’ stuff .
If any supervisor puts out a letter to the employees it ’s always addressed ‘ to the team . ’
What team ?
“ The older workers say let ’s keep what we got .
Who cares if they bring in a two - tier wage system ?
The union pushes this every - man - for - himself stuff .
There is no means of resisting through the union .
The union officials do n’t want their style of life disrupted at all .
We never see Ron Gettelfinger , the president of the UAW .
He does n’t come to the plant floor .
All we see of him is in the newspaper .
These are people who are holding our security in their hands .
But all they do is go along with the program .
Gettelfinger sits on the board of directors in Germany as a ‘ labor representative . ’
He knows what the company is doing .
There is no resistance at all anymore .
If any serious issues are raised at a union meeting , the local president will shut down the meeting .
“ The UAW is going along with the program .
The UAW leaders are too afraid if the employees walk out on strike that they will not get their paychecks .
And those are bloated paychecks from the top leadership down to the shop stewards in the plants .
Our steward gets paid for a 10 - to - 12 hour day — he could n’t care less about the employees . ”
The UAW is collaborating with the auto bosses efforts to drive out an entire generation of older workers who accumulated relatively higher wages and a measure of job security and retirement protections and replace them with a much smaller and more highly exploited workforce of low - wage and temporary workers .
Commenting on what the future holds for autoworkers Robert said , “ They are going to get rid of everyone making $ 27 an hour .
They do n’t want to have 10 - to - 12 job classifications any more .
They want two or three classifications at a low rate of pay .
They want the average worker who can take a part off the line and put it in a rack to also run over to the line to start it back up if it stops .
Now you need a skilled tradesman to do that .
That ’s what they are pushing with the Modern Operating Agreements and what they call our ‘ Smart Training ’ on how to work together as a team .
They are going to get rid of all of us and bring in low - pay and temporary workers .
Delphi wants to hire people for a year or two at a time .
That enables a company not to pay the benefits .
Having 30 years at a company is going to be a thing of the past .
“ They are shutting down plants all over the world .
I saw a cartoon showing two businessmen standing together .
The one guy looks at the other and says , ‘ What did you just tell that worker ? ’
The other guy responds , ‘ I told him to stop talking and work faster . ’
‘ How much are you paying him ? , ’ the other guy asks .
‘ I ’m paying him five dollars a day , ’ he says .
‘ Well how much are you making from what he is producing ? ’ the other guy asks .
‘ I ’m making $ 25 a day . ’
The other guy says , ‘ So in other words he ’s paying you $ 20 a day to tell him to work faster . ’
That ’s the reality of the capitalist system .
“ Fifty percent of the kids in college are going to be ending up working at a restaurant as highly - educated waiters who are going to be struggling every month to pay their bills .
They do n’t even know what is going to hit them once they graduate , because no one is telling them the truth .
How long will it take before people realize there has to be a change ?
Look at what is happening today .
Many people ca n’t put food on their tables .
Most are living on the edge .
People read about the war and they know the politicians , including the Democrats , are not telling the truth . ”

Scotland Yard detectives are to issue arrest warrants against three former KGB officers suspected of poisoning ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko .
Police have told sources close to Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina that they intend to lay charges of murder and poisoning against the men , who met the victim three weeks before his death in London .
The move will damage the already strained relationship between Downing Street and the Kremlin , which is almost certain to block any request for the men's arrest and extradition .

Putin
• Timeline of terror : how the poison spy drama unfolded
• Today 's news headlines
Warrants are expected to be issued against Andrei Lugovoy , Dmitri Kovtun and Vyacheslav Sokolenko within the next few weeks .
All three former agents have vehemently protested their innocence of any involvement in the murder plot .
They all claim that they , too , were contaminated with the deadly radioactive material polonium - 210 which poisoned Mr Litvinenko , a strong critic of President Vladimir Putin 's regime .
Mr Putin 's government is already furious with Tony Blair for granting political asylum to billionaire dissident Boris Berezovsky , who has continued to demand the overthrow of the Russian leader from his UK base .
Tensions increased further on Friday when EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson warned that relations with Moscow contained ' a level of misunderstanding , or even mistrust , we have not seen since the end of the Cold War ' .
Forty - three - year - old Mr Litvinenko , himself a former KGB officer who had been granted political asylum to live in Britain , suffered a horrific death in a London hospital on November 23 last year after poison caused his hair to drop out and his vital organs to close down .
Mr Litvinenko had previously met the three prime suspects - who are now all wealthy businessmen based in Moscow - at the Millennium Hotel in Piccadilly and a nearby sushi bar .
The Metropolitan Police refused to comment on the murder inquiry , but Litvinenko family sources told The Mail on Sunday police had enough evidence to bring charges ' within three weeks ' .
Britain has no extradition treaty with Russia , meaning that any trial would most probably have to be held in Moscow with the co-operation of the authorities there .
The Russians want Mr Berezovsky to face trial for calling last week for a revolution to overthrow President Putin and have twice demanded his extradition from Britain .
Mr Berezovsky , who has several substantial homes in the UK , said during a business trip to Israel last week : " I have no doubt that my extradition from Britain is impossible .
However much the Russian prosecutors would want it , I did n't break Russian or British laws . "
When asked about British unease over his comments on toppling President Putin , Mr Berezovsky said : " I did not get political asylum in Britain just to shut up . "
And , repeating earlier attacks on Mr Putin , whom he accused of corruption before escaping Russia , Mr Berezovsky added : " Any other way of changing this anti-constitutional regime , except for a coercive one which includes revolution , is impossible .
" I repeat it once again .
And I am not scared at all that as a result I can be extradited . "
Mrs Litvinenko , 44 , who called her late husband by his pet name " Sasha ' , and her 12 - year - old son Anatoly have been under police protection at a secret address ever since her husband 's death .
Before he died , her husband blamed Mr Putin and his regime for his murder , a claim strongly denied by the Kremlin .
In December , nine Scotland Yard detectives flew to Moscow as part of their investigation .
They were not allowed to interview Mr Lugovoy or Mr Kovtun directly , although they were present when Russian police officers interviewed them .
They were not granted any access to Mr Sokolenko .
Senior Russian prosecutor Konstantin Nikonov told The Mail on Sunday last night : " We have no information yet that the British authorities have requested moves to bring charges against Mr Lugovoy , Mr Kovtun and Mr Sokolenko . "
The Crown Prosecution Service said no decisions had been taken about charges in the Litvinenko case .
A few nights after he resigned his post as secretary of state two years ago , Colin L. Powell answered a ring at his front door .
Standing outside was Prince Bandar , then Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the United States , with a 1995 Jaguar .
Mr. Powell ’s wife , Alma , had once mentioned that she missed their 1995 Jaguar , which she and her husband had traded in .
Prince Bandar had filed that information away , and presented the Powells that night with an identical , 10 - year - old model .
The Powells kept the car  a gift that the State Department said was legal  but recently traded it away .
The move was classic Bandar , who has been referred to as Bandar Bush , attending birthday celebrations , sending notes in times of personal crisis and entertaining the Bushes or top administration officials at sumptuous dinner parties at Prince Bandar ’s opulent homes in McLean , Va. , and Aspen , Colo .
He has invited top officials to pizza and movies out at a mall in suburban Virginia  and then rented out the movie theater ( candy served chair - side , in a wagon ) and the local Pizza Hut so he and his guests could enjoy themselves in solitude .
He is said to feel a strong sense of loyalty toward Mr. Bush ’s father dating to the Persian Gulf war , which transferred to the son , whom he counseled about international diplomacy during Mr. Bush ’s first campaign for president .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , as the United States learned that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi and focused on the strict Wahhabi school of Islam that informed them and their leader and fellow Saudi , Osama bin Laden , Prince Bandar took a public role in assuring the Americans that his nation would cooperate in investigating and combating anti-American terrorism .
He also helped arrange for more than a hundred members of the bin Laden family to be flown out of the United States .
Even since he left the Saudi ambassador ’s post in Washington and returned to Saudi Arabia two years ago , Prince Bandar has continued his long courtship , over decades , of the Bush family and Vice President Dick Cheney , flying into Washington for unofficial meetings at the White House .
He cruises in without consulting the Saudi Embassy in Washington , where miffed officials have sometimes said they had no idea that he was in town  a perceived slight that contributed to the resignation of his cousin Prince Turki al - Faisal as ambassador to the United States last year .
He has been succeeded by Adel al - Jubeir , who is said to have strong support from the king .
Prince Turki was never able to match the role of Prince Bandar , whom the president , vice president and other officials regularly consult on every major Middle East initiative  from the approach to Iran to the Israeli - Palestinian peace process to Iraq .
Prince Bandar played a crucial role in securing the use of the Prince Sultan Air Base at Al Kharj , roughly 70 miles outside Riyadh , in the attacks led by the United States against Afghanistan and Iraq , despite chafing within his government .
He helped in the negotiations that led to Libya giving up its weapons programs , a victory for Mr. Bush .
He pledged to protect the world economy from oil shocks after the invasion , the White House said in 2004 , but he denied a report , by the author Bob Woodward , that he had promised to stabilize oil prices in time for Mr. Bush ’s re-election campaign .
Many dieters put on more weight than they lose
US researchers found people typically lose between 5 % and 10 % of their weight during the first six months of a diet .
But the review of 31 previous studies , by the University of California , said up to two - thirds put more weight on than they had lost within five years .
Repeatedly losing and gaining weight is linked to heart disease and stroke , the American Psychologist journal reported .
Keeping weight off is a life - long challenge
Dr Ian Campbell , of Weight Concern
Lead researcher Traci Mann said : " We found that the majority of people regained all the weight , plus more .
" Diets do not lead to sustained weight loss or health benefits for the majority of people .
" We concluded most of them would have been better off not going on the diet at all .
" Their weight would have been pretty much the same , and their bodies would not suffer the wear and tear of losing weight and gaining it all back . "
And she added some diet studies relied on participants to report their weight rather than having it measured by an impartial source while others had low follow - up rates which made their results unrepresentative .
Diets
She said this might make diets seem more effective than they really were as those who gained weight might be less likely to take part in the follow - ups .
In one study , 50 % of dieters weighed more than 4.99kg ( 11lbs ) over their starting weight five years after the diet .
The study did not name any diets in particular , but looked at a broad spectrum of approaches .
Professor Mann said in her opinion eating in moderation was a good idea for everybody as was regular exercise .
Dr Ian Campbell , medical director of Weight Concern , said too many people approached dieting as a short - term measure .
" Keeping weight off is a life - long challenge .
It is just like heart disease or mental health problems , if you stop taking your medicine you can get worse .
" People who are overweight often do n't have a balanced lifestyle and after losing weight too many stop keeping active or eating healthily . "

Wealthier people are more than twice as likely to develop the deadliest form of skin cancer , doctors have warned .
A study of 23,000 cancer patients has revealed that those living in affluent areas were two - and - a - half more times more likely to develop malignant melanoma than their less well - off counterparts .
Blamed on short periods of intensive exposure to the sun - such as that experienced during a holiday abroad - malignant melanoma affects more than 8,000 Britons a year and claims more 1,800 lives .
Known be to more common in women than men , research now shows a clear link between wealth and the cancer .
Analysis of the medical records of cancer patients in Northern Ireland showed that both sexes were two - and - a - half times more likely to suffer from malignant melanoma if they lived in an affluent area .
The middle classes were also at greater risk of basal cell carcinoma , a more common but more easily treatable type of skin cancer .
Rates of this cancer , caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight , were 41 per cent higher in middle - class men and 29 per cent more likely in middle - class women than in working - class people of a similar age .
Possible explanations include the middle classes taking more holidays in sunny places and being more likely to seek help for sun-damaged skin .
No link was found , however , between income and squamous cell carcinoma , the other major form of skin cancer .
The analysis of 12 years of medical records also showed the disease became more common with age .
The researchers , from Queen 's University Belfast and Royal Victoria Hospital , Belfast , said it is vital that future cancer services can cope with the ageing population .
Rates of skin cancer are already soaring .
The number of cases more than doubled in the last decade , to 70,000 a year in the UK alone .
Dr Susannah
Hoe , co-author of the study , published in the British Journal of Dermatology , said : " Although our research highlights that some sections of society face greater risks than others , the ' safe sun ' message is one we all need
to heed if we are to halt rising skin cancer rates . "
Recent research has shown that nearly one in two youngsters is ignoring advice on safe tanning .
By the age of 24 , a worrying 46 per cent of Britons have sun-damaged skin on their faces .
Rebecca Russell , of Cancer Research UK , said :
" This study adds to the evidence that the increase in the numbers of people holidaying abroad in recent years may contribute to the rising numbers of melanoma cases .
" As more and more people can afford to holiday abroad , it is important that everyone is aware of the risks associated with excessive sun exposure , so that we do n't see this trend increasing . "
The study is not the first to link cancer to wealth .
Other work has shown that breast cancer is more likely to strike middle - class women .
It is thought this can be explained by lifestyle differences .
Wealthier women are more likely to delay motherhood , have smaller families and use hormone replacement therapy .
All three can raise levels of the female sex hormone oestrogen - something known to fuel the growth of breast tumours .

Rosie O'Donnell is a great example of the failure of scientific education in this country .
Of late , Rosie has joined the " truthers , " using her show to flog the notion that the WTC was brought down in a government - planned controlled demolition .
I will have to yield to Popular Mechanics for most of the discussion about WTC7 .
However , I can , from my own engineering training , rebut one point on WTC1&2 .
( Note again , future commenters , this applies to WTC 1&2 .
There was a different dynamic at work in WTC 7 ) .
Rosie , as others have , made a point of observing that jet fuel does not burn hot enough to melt steel , and therefore the fire in the main towers could not have caused the structure to yield and collapse .
This is absurd .
It is a kindergartener 's level of science .
It is ignorant of a reality that anyone who has had even one course in structural engineering or metallurgy will understand .
The argument made that " other buildings have burned and not collapsed " is only marginally more sophisticated , sort of equivalent to saying that seeing an iceberg melts proves global warming .
( Note that this is all written by a person who has no faith in government and is at least as suspicious about government motivations at any truther ) .
Here is the reality that most 19 - year - old engineering students understand : Steel loses its strength rapidly with temperature , losing nearly all of its structural strength by 1000 degrees F , well below its melting point but also well below the temperature of burning jet fuel .
For three years I designed piping and pressure vessel enclosures at a refinery .
Many of the processes in a refinery crave heat and run better at elevated temperatures .
In fact , what refineries can do , and how efficient they can be , is really limited by the strength of steel at high temperatures .
Refineries end up being limited to process temperatures no higher than 600 to 800 degrees , and even then these require expensive special metallurgies .
Anything higher requires a very expensive vessel lined with some sort of ceramic insulation material .
The strength curve of steel vs. temperature is dependent on the type of steel , but the curve below is about what I remember from my old textbooks .
Note by 930 degrees the steel strength has dropped by half and in the next 100 degrees it halves again .
But the proof of what went wrong in WTC1 and WTC2 does not take a college education .
You only have to look at building codes .
Building codes generally require that structural steel members be coated with a fireproofing material .
As the critical temperature for steel is around 540 °C ( give or take , depending on whose country 's test standards one reads at the time ) , and design basis fires
reach this temperature within a few minutes , structural steel requires
external insulation in order to prevent the steel from absorbing enough
energy to reach this temperature .
First , steel expands , when heated ,
and once enough energy has been absorbed , it softens and loses its
structural integrity .
This is easily prevented through the use of fireproofing .
You have probably seen it - that foamy tan stuff sprayed on girders before the rest of the building is filled out .
In fact , this stuff is not fireproofing per se but insulation .
It is there to keep the structural steel cool during a fire , so the steel will not fail .
Generally the standards are set in the code that the insulation has to be able to stand X time of fire ( generally several hours ) and keep the steel below its critical yielding temperatures .
Engineers know that a building fire , which burns much cooler than a jet fuel fire , can cause steel members to weaken and fail and the building to collapse .
If this were not the case , then why do builders spend billions every year to insulate structural steel building components ??
I wrote about this issue in more depth here .
In this post , one of the commenters listed a series of building fires and asked , why did these buildings not collapse ?
The answer is : Because insulation is applied to the building structural steel members to try to prevent the collapse .
Even insulation is just a stopgap -- if the fire burns long enough and
hot enough ( or if the insulation is stripped off , say by an airplane
shearing through the building ) then the steel will heat up and fail .
So there are three reasons that some buildings have fires and do n't fail while the WTC did fail :
Some building fires can and do cause buildings to collapse .
Insulation on steel members help many buildings to survive , and often does save the building from collapse , but not always .
This building did collapse , at least the top 6 stores .
Oddly , this is actually used by truthers as further proof , somehow , that the WTC fires could not have brought down the building ( the link is actually one of their web sites , I think ) .
But in fact , the Madrid building failed the same way as WTC 1 and 2 , with the top six floors collapsing .
Since the building was not fully constructed on these top floors , there was not the huge weight collapsing that created the battering ram effect that brought down the WTC .
The Madrid floors took longer to collapse , but they were 1 ) under far less stress , since the building above them was not complete ; 2 ) the fire burned much cooler and 3 ) the insulation had not been mechanically scrubbed from the beams , so it took longer for the beams to heat up .
To me , this is a clear parallel to the official version of the WTC collapse , but even this is distorted somehow by the truthers .
Fuel burns hotter than normal building fires , so even insulated members will heat up faster .
I have many pictures in my personal collection of refinery fires where the main thing you can see in the aftermath is all the structural steel bent and collapsed .
Truthers may not be able to find many examples of building collapsing in a fire , but you would be hard - pressed NOT to find examples of collapsed structural steel at every refinery and petrochemical fire .
The insulation that normally protects buildings was stripped off by the mechanical action of an enormous airplane shearing through the building at 300 miles an hour .
This is in addition to the actual removal of some support columns by the crashing aircraft , which put more load on the remaining structure and thereby hastened the collapse .
postscript :
By the way , can anyone tell me why the so called " reality - based "
community , that so often criticizes the Right for theocratic attacks on
science , is so quick to fall for this pseudo - scientific junk ?
Update :
One other thought :
The hallmark of truthers is that they take small abnormalities or uncertainties in the failure analysis and event reconstruction as justification for throwing out the whole explanation of events in favor of an alternate series of events with much , much larger gaps , contradictions , and logical problems ( e.g. how did the buildings get wired for demolition without anyone noticing ?
or , how did the planes manage to crash into the precise floors wired for demolition without dislodging the charges and their wiring ?
or , how did such a massive conspiracy get pulled off without one leak when the administration can't even competently fire 9 US attorneys ? )
Anyone who has ever done root cause analysis of a catastrophic failure knows there are always questions no one can answer when all is said and done .
And people who say things like " always happen " or " can never happen " typically do n't have any real - world engineering experience .
Update2 : One other thought on WTC7 , since most of the sites I have visited over the last several days really seem to focus on WTC7 .
I consider our government capable of all kinds of hijinx , but why WTC7 ?
I would argue that about 0.00001 % of the outrage that resulted from 9/11 is attributable to WTC7 .
How many people not associated with the truthers have even heard of WTC7 ?
In fact , one could argue that the strike on the Pentagon was effectively irrelevant , since no one really even seems to remember that one .
One minor note : I saw on a conspiracy site the claim that all military planes were ordered to stand down on 9/11 .
I know from personal experience that can't possibly be true .
I was in Manhattan during 9/11 and remember well people in the streets hitting the ground in fear every time a military jet rocketed over the city .
I do n't buy all this conspiracy theory not because I think well of the government , but just the opposite .
I consider the conspiracies posited at these various sites to be orders of magnitude beyond this government 's capabilities .
Remember Coyote 's Law :
When the same set of facts can be explained equally well by A massive conspiracy coordinated without a single leak between hundreds or even thousands of people - OR - Sustained stupidity , confusion and / or incompetence Assume stupidity .
Update3 : I guess I need to throw out a few more things .
This was not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive rebuttal of the 9/11 conspiracy theories .
I merely used as a starting point one stupid comment by Rosie O'Donnell on melting , a comment I have heard a lot of times , and that I knew I could refute of my own knowledge .
Those who want to get mad at me because I did not refute this or that , sorry , go deal with the book by the Popular Mechanics guys .
The only other thing I can contribute other than engineering sanity is the fact I have participated in many engineering failure analyses and the fact that I watched the towers fall live , with my own eyes , from the streets of Manhattan .
Every single engineering failure analysis I have ever participated in , from refinery explosions to airplane crashes , has always left unanswered questions and nagging inconsistencies that had , I am sure , nothing to do with conspiracies .
We had many things we could never explain about a heat exchanger fire at our refinery in 1985 , but I do n't think that those unknowns and uncertainties leave the door open to blame government agents for the fire .
I 'll say again , if you want to argue that the WTC buildings were demoed by explosives , you have to explain how the explosives were laid , and , more important , how the explosives and their delicate wiring and detonators survived a plane crashing into the same floors .
And by the way , given that the buildings had not external markings showing the floors , how did the people flying the airplanes hit the exact correct parts of the building ?
For every problem with the core hypothesis I could name 10 problems with the truther alternative .
I have no problem with offering an alternative hypothesis to the original thesis , but it is silly to criticize the core thesis for small problems only to replace it with a hypothesis that has problems that are orders of magnitude larger .
March 19 , 2007  --
New e-mails released this evening by the Justice Department reveal the in - depth conversations Department of Justice staff members had about the eight U.S. attorneys fired last year .
The department released more than 3,000 pages of documents late Monday .
The e-mails detail conversations about attorneys targeted for dismissal .
There are no e-mails from Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who reportedly does not use e-mail , though the Justice Department says messages show some indication that Gonzales ' former chief of staff , D. Kyle Sampson , kept the attorney general apprised .
Heat From Democrats
The Justice Department has taken heat from Democrats , who stepped up harsh criticism and calls for Gonzales to step down last week .
" They [ the U.S. attorneys ] should not be sent packing on a whim , " said Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , adding , " especially when the circumstances suggest that their departures may have been motivated by politics . "
" First of all , he 's [ Gonzales ] not telling the truth .
These were all political , " declared Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" Never in the history of the country has anything like this ever happened .
What is done is untoward , it is wrong , it is unethical , it 's immoral .
I believe it 's illegal , and Gonzales should be fired or he should resign . "
The president addressed criticism about political motivations last week by dismissing it .
" I 've heard those allegations about , you know , political decision - making , " Bush said last Wednesday .
" It 's not true . "
Congress to Hear From Justice Department Officials
Several top officials at the Justice Department will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the coming months .
Gonzales will appear April 17 to answer questions about Department of Justice oversight .
The committee also voted last week to allow Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , to subpoena five current and former Justice Department officials , including Sampson , who stepped down last week amid the controversy .
Though the Justice Department has released e-mails and said it would allow those involved in the plan to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee , the White House has yet to provide e-mails , documents and witnesses to Congress in its investigation into the controversial firings .
Waiting for the White House
White House counsel Fred Fielding met with members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees last week , but the committees ' Friday deadline for a plan from the White House passed without a commitment from the counsel 's office .
" Given the importance of the issues under consideration and the presidential principles involved , " said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel , " we need more time to resolve them . "
The committees expect an answer from Fielding tomorrow , though Democrats on the committees are cautiously optimistic , as the White House could invoke executive privilege and refuse to allow any staff to testify .
" Despite those assurances and my continued hope that the White House will resolve these questions in a cooperative fashion , " House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. , D - Mich . , said in a statement Friday " The Committee must take steps to ensure that we are not being stonewalled or slow walked on this matter , " he said .
Conyers warned that he will schedule a vote on subpoenas in an attempt to force the documents ' release and witnesses to come forward .
Conyers ' counterpart on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , has already scheduled a committee vote on whether or not to issue subpoenas for White House personnel and documents for Thursday .
" I want testimony under oath , " Leahy said on " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " Sunday .
" I am sick and tired of getting half - truths on this . "
ABC News ' Jan Crawford Greenburg and Jack Date contributed to this report .
Something rather historic happened this past week .
The White House , for the first time ever on its Web site ( that I know of ) , recognized the legitimacy of gay couples as both married and as parents .
It was done , innocuously enough , when the White House published a photo of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s new grandson , the child of the VP ’s lesbian daughter and her lesbian spouse .
The White House not only published a photo of the child with the VP and his wife , but the caption was even more telling :
Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife , Lynne Cheney , welcomed their sixth grandchild , Samuel David Cheney , Wednesday , May 23 , 2007 .
He weighed 8 lbs. , 6 oz and was born at 9:46 a.m. at Sibley Hospital in Washington , D.C. His parents are the Cheneys ’ daughter Mary , and her partner , Heather Poe .
White House photo by David Bohrer
Did you catch that last sentence ?
The White House officially recognized a lesbian couple as co-equal parents of a child .
That not only is a recognition of the legitimacy of gay parents – i.e. , if one person is the birth mother and the other the mother ’s partner , both are the “ parents ” of the child , per the White House – but the White House is also , implicitly , recognizing the legitimate couple status of two gay people in love , i.e. , they are not simply two unrelated gay people , they are parents , akin to your parents , akin to a married couple .
Why do I say that the White House is de facto recognizing gay marriage ?
Because either Mary or her lover , or both , are not the biological mom of this child – with two women , only one can be the biological parent .
For the White House to recognize both as parents means that they are recognizing the legitimacy of the two women as one entity , the parent .
Anyway , it ’s a hell of a statement by any White House , let alone one of the most conservative in history , and one that prides itself on being so anti-gay .
JSpot asks a very good question about why the baby ’s photo is on the White House Web site :
I keep seeing an argument on the Internet , including in the comments here , that goes like this :
“ Copyright violation is not stealing .
If I steal something physical , the original owner no longer has it .
But if I violate a copyright , the original owner has lost nothing tangible .
So while copyright violation is illegal , it ’s very different from stealing .
In fact , it ’s good publicity and might even benefit the person from whom you stole . ”
I understand the point that copyright violations are different from theft of physical property , but is it a victimless crime ?
When you violate a copyright , you take something valuable from the copyright owner that he ca n’t get back .
You take his right to control where his creation is viewed and how .
It might be your opinion that the “ free publicity ” you provide outweighs the loss – and you might be right – but you ’ve taken from the creator the right to make the publicity - versus - overexposure decision himself .
That might not seem like a big deal to you , but it feels that way to the person who lost control of his art .
Let me give you an analogy .
Let ’s say your neighbor sneaks into your house while you are gone and borrows your underpants .
After wearing your underpants all day , the neighbor launders them , folds them neatly , and returns them to your house in perfect condition , all while you are gone .
He tells himself that he will say good things to people about your business – whatever business that is – so this arrangement is good publicity for you .
The next time he sees you , he tells you about the underpants because he figures you ’ll thank him for saying nice things about his business .
He informs you that it ’s a win -win scenario .
Given that you have full use of your property ( the underpants ) , is it a victimless crime ?
I would say the owner of the underpants lost something even though his property is physically the same .
Some people argue that copyright laws create an artificial property right that is inherently different , and less worthy than the more natural right to own physical property , such as your clothes .
But it seems to me that you only own your clothes because the law says so .
Absent any artificial laws , I could go into your closet and wear your clothes whenever I want .
All property rights are artificial .
Copyrights are no different .
For the record , I never mind when people make copies of Dilbert for their personal use .
If you want to e-mail your favorite comic to a friend , that ’s great .
We even make that easy by providing a button for that purpose on Dilbert.com .
But obviously there has to be a limit .
After I published my first best - selling book , The Dilbert Principle , within days it had been illegally scanned and was widely available on the Internet for free .
Technically speaking , it was n’t theft .
But I still lost something .
I ( and my publisher ) lost the ability to decide if , when , and how to publish as an e-book .
You ca n’t compete with “ free and immediate . ”
From a legal standpoint , taking a creator ’s right to control distribution of his art is not “ theft . ”
It ’s just “ taking something that used to legally belong to someone else and making it your own . ”
You may now activate your cognitive dissonance and explain in the comments that every time you violate a copyright , the free publicity it generates for the artist is proof of your goodness .
To make your argument extra powerful , note that you once knew a guy who bought an extra CD because of the 12,000 songs he took for free .
Go .

2d Wind on Impeachment
Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more …
Stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood ,
Disguise fair nature with hard - favour ’d rage ;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect …
The game ’s afoot : Follow your spirit ; and , upon this charge
Cry “ Impeach the Tyrants !
Vote 333 Now !!! ”
The psychological and neurobiological processes underlying moral judgement have been the focus of many recent empirical studies
1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 .
Of central interest is whether emotions play a causal role in moral judgement , and , in parallel , how emotion - related areas of the brain contribute to moral judgement .
Here we show that six patients with focal bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPC ) , a brain region necessary for the normal generation of emotions and , in particular , social emotions 12,13,14 , produce an abnormally ‘ utilitarian ’ pattern of judgements on moral dilemmas that pit compelling considerations of aggregate welfare against highly emotionally aversive behaviours ( for example , having to sacrifice one person ’s life to save a number of other lives ) 7,8 .
In contrast , the VMPC patients ’ judgements were normal in other classes of moral dilemmas .
These findings indicate that , for a selective set of moral dilemmas , the VMPC is critical for normal judgements of right and wrong .
The findings support a necessary role for emotion in the generation of those judgements .
April 1 , 2007  -- Martin Kruskal , a renowned mathematician and physicist at Rutgers University , died in December 2006 .
Of his many accomplishments there is an intriguing trick that almost anyone can appreciate .
I explain it here , and , prompted by April Fool 's Day , I also sketch a sort of biblical hoax based on it that I first proposed in my 1998 book " Once Upon a Number . "
Kruskal 's trick can be most easily explained in terms of a well - shuffled deck of cards with all the face cards removed .
The deck has 1s ( aces ) through 10s only .
Imagine two players , Hoaxer and Fool .
Hoaxer asks
Fool to pick a secret number between 1 and 10 .
For illustration , let 's assume Fool picks 7 .
Hoaxer goes on to instruct
Fool to watch for the card with his secret number -- in this case , the 7th card in the deck -- as Hoaxer slowly turns over the cards one by one .
When the card with the secret number is reached , Hoaxer directs
Fool to take the value of this card as his new secret number and to repeat the process .
Thus when the 7th card is reached -- let 's assume it 's a 5 -- Fool 's new secret number becomes 5 , and so he watches for the next card corresponding to this new secret number .
That is , he watches for the 5th card succeeding it in the deck .
Hoaxer continues to slowly turn over the cards one by one .
When the 5th succeeding card is reached -- let 's assume it 's a 9 -- Fool 's new secret number becomes 9 , and so he watches for the card corresponding to this new secret number .
That is , he watches for the 9th card succeeding it in the deck , and so on and on .
As they near the end of the deck , Hoaxer turns over a card and announces , " This is your new secret number , " and he is almost always correct .
Why Does It Work ?
The deck is not marked or ordered in any way , there are no confederates , there is no sleight of hand , and there is no careful observation of Fool 's reactions as he watches the cards being turned over .
How does Hoaxer accomplish this feat ?
The answer is cute .
At the beginning of the trick , Hoaxer picks his own secret number .
He then follows the same instructions he 's given to Fool .
If he picked a 3 as his secret number , he watches for the 3rd card and notes its value -- say it 's a 6 -- which becomes his new secret number .
He then looks for the 6th card after it -- say it 's a 4 -- and that becomes his new secret number , and so on and on .
Even though there is only one chance in 10 that Hoaxer 's original secret number is the same as Fool 's original secret number , it is reasonable to assume , and it can be proved , that sooner or later their secret numbers will coincide .
That is , if two more - or - less random sequences of secret numbers between 1 and 10 are selected , sooner or later they will , simply by chance , lead to the same card .
Furthermore , from that point on the secret numbers will be identical since both Fool and Hoaxer are using the same rule to generate new secret numbers from old .
Thus all Hoaxer does is wait until he nears the end of the deck and then turn over the card corresponding to his last secret number , confident that by that point it will probably be Fool 's secret number as well .
Note that the trick works just as well if there is more than one Fool or even if there is no Hoaxer at all ( as long as the cards are turned over one by one by someone ) .
If there is a large number of people and each picks his or her own initial secret number and generates a new one from the old one in accordance with the procedure above , all of them will eventually have the same secret number and thereafter the numbers will move in lockstep .
My Proposal for a Religious Hoax
Consider now a holy book with the compelling property that no matter what word from the early part of the book is chosen , the following procedure always leads to the same climactic and especially sacred word .
Begin with whatever word you like ; count the letters in it ; say this number is X ; proceed forward X words to another word ; count the letters in it ; say this number is Y ; proceed forward Y words to another word ; count the letters in it ; say this number is Z ; keep on doing this until the climactic and especially sacred word -- say " God " or " heaven " -- is reached .
( The letter count of each word plays the role of the numbered cards . )
It 's not too hard to imagine frenzied checking of this procedure using word after word from the early part of the holy book and the increasing certainty among some that divine inspiration is the only explanation for the fact that the procedure always ends on the sacred word .
If the generating rule were more complicated than the simple one above , the effect would be even more mysterious .
The reader can experiment with his own examples or check out the August 1998 , issue of Scientific American , where puzzlemeister Martin Gardner , who graciously blurbed my book , came up with an elegant illustration of its proposal for a religious hoax .
Martin Kruskal , I should note , was innocent of perpetrating any hoaxes .
He was simply a very fine applied mathematician .
In any case , Happy April Fool 's Day to Hoaxers and Fools alike .

The Controversy of Iraq Invasion – The world ca n’t forget about the damage caused by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The true reason behind the invasion remains a mystery until nowadays .
The former of US president , George W Bush claimed that Iraq hides dangerous nuclear weapons which later on proven to be wrong .
The effects and damages which are caused by the invasion are huge .
Many people killed and died because of the invasion .
– The Reason behind the Invasion
The controversy of the Iraq invasion which is done by the US government under the lead of George W. Bush becomes a hot topic around the world , even hotter than the amount of bonus for online poker games winner in https://agenbola108.cc .
Bush stated that Saddam Hussein and his reign have a nuclear weapon that can threaten the safety of the world .
Therefore , the US needs to make sure to destroy it by doing the invasion of Iraq and kill the leader and its people .
In fact , Iraq does n’t have such weapons just like George W. Bush said to the public .
However , the massive destruction of the war made the country broken into pieces .
Some people said that the reason said by Bush is only a diversion from the true reason behind the invasion .
There is an opinion that Bush wants to give a serious warning to other countries against the United States .
Destroying the heart of Arab , Bush and his reign would like to send an important message to other countries that tried to rebel that they will experience the same thing just like happened to Iraq and its leader .
Bush wants to make sure the position of America as the strong county in the world .
– The Controversy
The decision to do the invasion of Iraq considers as the global controversy in history .
The invasion gives a deep effect on the civilians who do n’t understand why the US army destroyed their homeland .
The war gives bad consequences for both countries where the economy life decrease and the cost of living go higher than expected .
The future of Iraq is not clear .
The people live in traumatic life and scared .
Moreover , when the world found out that the invasion is a big mistake ever done by the US government .
The world denounced the decision of former president Bush and his people to make one of the worst wars in history .
The world ca n’t forget about the damage caused by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Bush stated that Saddam Hussein and his reign have a nuclear weapon that can threaten the safety of the world .
In fact , Iraq does n’t have such weapons just like George W. Bush said to the public .
The decision to do the invasion of Iraq considers as the global controversy in the history .
FOR THE FIFTH SUMMER in six years , I ’m driving across the country .
Aside from the country ’s immense beauty , the decency of its people and the relative difficulty of finding a good cup of coffee near the interstate , one of the things you start to appreciate when you ’ve seen a lot of the United States is how sparsely populated it is , particularly in the middle .
It seems the welfare recipients need a lot of room .
I ’m referring , of course , to American farmers .
Or , more precisely , American farm owners , a.k.a. Welfare Kings .
There are few issues for which the political consensus is so distant from both common sense and expert opinion .
Right - wing economists , left - wing environmentalists and almost anybody in - between who does n’t receive a check from the Department of Agriculture or depend on a political donation from said recipients understand that Americans are spending billions to prop up the last of the horse - and - buggy industries .
At this nation ’s founding , nearly nine out of 10 workers were employed in agriculture .
By 1900 that fell to fewer than four in 10 .
Today , fewer than one in every 100 workers is in agriculture , and less than 1 % of gross domestic product is attributable to agriculture .
Yet this country spends billions upon billions of dollars subsidizing a system that makes almost everyone in the world worse off .
Advertisement
Our system is so complicated -- i.e. rigged -- that it ’s almost impossible to know how much agricultural subsidies cost U.S. taxpayers .
But we know from the Washington Post ’s recent reporting that since 2000 the U.S. government paid out $ 1.3 billion to “ farmers ” who do n’t farm .
They were simply “ compensated ” for owning land previously used for farming .
A Houston surgeon received nearly $ 500,000 to alleviate his hardship .
Cash payments have cost $ 172 billion over the last decade , and $ 25 billion in 2005 alone , nearly 50 % more than what was paid to families receiving welfare .
But those sorts of numbers barely tell the story of our appallingly immoral agricultural corporatism .
Subsidies combined with trade barriers ( another term for subsidy ) prop up the price of food for consumers at home and hurt farmers abroad .
This is repugnant because agriculture is a keystone industry for developing nations and a luxury for developed ones .
This keeps Third World nations impoverished , economically dependent and politically unstable .
Our farm subsidies alone -- forget trade barriers -- cost developing countries $ 24 billion every year , according to the National Center for Policy Analysis .
Letting poor nations prosper would be worth a lot more than the equivalent amount in foreign aid .
But Big Agriculture likes foreign aid because it allows for the dumping of wheat and other crops on the world market , which perpetuates the cycle of dependency .
Then , of course , there ’s the environment .
Subsidies wreak havoc on the ecosystem .
One small example :
There ’s a 6,000 - square - mile dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico , larger than Connecticut .
It ’s so depleted of oxygen because of algae blooms caused by fertilizer runoff that shrimp and crabs at the Louisiana shore literally try to leap from the water to breathe .
This is endangering the profitable Gulf fishing industry .
Most of the fertilizer comes from a few Midwestern counties that receive billions in subsidies ( more than $ 30 billion from 1997 to 2002 , according to the Environmental Working Group ) .
But , again , the full environmental costs are incalculable .
If you ’re hung up on global warming , consider that American farming is hugely energy intensive .
Those energy costs are not fully borne by the producer , so in effect the taxpayer is paying for greenhouse emissions that do not benefit him .
Moreover , across the U.S. , swaths of forests and wetlands have been cleared or drained to make room for farmland that would never earn a buck were it not for the generosity of Uncle Sam .
Who knows how much cleaner the air and water would be with those resources intact ?
And who knows how many more dubious “ wetlands ” would be free for productive economic development ?

There ’s a lot of romance about the family farm in this country .
But that ’s what it is : romance .
Most of the Welfare Kings are rich men -- buffalo farmer and CNN founder Ted Turner is one of the biggest .
Of course , there are small farmers out there , but they have no more right to live off the government teat than the corner bakery I so loved as a child but that could n’t keep up with the times .
We do n’t have a political system addicted to keeping bakers rich .
Meanwhile , our system -- chiefly the Senate , which gives rural states outsized power , and the Iowa presidential caucus , which forces politicians to whore themselves to agricultural welfare -- is rigged to prevent real free market reform .
I ’m all in favor of farming when it ’s economically feasible .
And while many of these folks I meet on my adventures are the salt of the earth , I do n’t see why they should n’t pull their own weight .
This view from the second stage engine of SpaceX 's second Falcon 1 rocket shows the booster 's first stage falling away towards Earth after its March 20 , 2007 launch .
The secondtest flight of the privately - builtFalcon 1 rocket failed to reach its intended orbit late Tuesday , nearly oneyear to the day of the booster 's ill - fatedspaceflight debut .
Thetwo -stage Falcon 1 rocket shot spaceward [ image ] from its Pacificisland launch site at 9:10 p.m. EDT ( 0110 March 21 GMT ) , but suffered aroll control malfunction 186 miles ( 300 kilometers ) above Earth before completing its flight plan , its SpaceExploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) builders said .
The rocket was intended toend its mission about 10 minutes after liftoff at an altitude of about 425 miles ( 685 kilometers ) .
VIDEO : SpaceX's Homegrown Falcon 1 Rocket 's Second Flight
" We didencounter , late in the second burn , a roll control anomaly , " SpaceXCEO Elon Musk told reporters , after the more than five - minute spaceflight .
" Butthat 's something that 's pretty straightforward to address . "
The rollcontrol glitch affected how the Falcon 1 booster 's second stage controlleditself in flight , sending the vehicle on a path that likely reentered the Earth ' satmosphere over the Pacific Ocean without completing a full orbit , Musk said .
Themalfunction could have been due to a range of issues , such as helium leak or aroll control jet glitch , but only a subsequent analysis will root out the cause , he added .
Theoff - nominal spaceflight capped a drama - filled countdown that included payload communicationsglitches and one pad abort a half - second after the Falcon 1 rocket 's engineignited .
Each of those issues was eventually resolved , and the rocket -- initially targeted for a 7:00 p.m. EDT ( 2300 GMT ) liftoff after a Monday scrub -- was again readied for launch within its four - hour flight window .
" This was apretty nerve - wracking day , " Musk said .
" The rocket business is definitely not alow - stress business , that 's for sure , but I do n't think I 'm disappointed .
Infact , I 'm pretty happy . "
The factthat the Falcon 1 rocket lifted off from its Kwajalein Atoll launch site in the Pacific Ocean , experienced successful first - stage and payload fairingseparations [ image ] -- as well as the ignition of its second stage -- proved that hundreds ofbooster improvements incorporated into the vehicle since its firstMarch 2006 failure were a success , the SpaceX chief said .
" Wesuccessfully reached space , and really retired almost all of the riskassociated with the rocket , " Musk added .
Asuccessful demonstration
SpaceXlaunched the Falcon 1 rocket primarily as a demonstration for the U.S. DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency to prove the booster 's capabilities , thoughthe rocket also carried a 110 - pound ( 50 - kilogram ) set of experiments , includingan automated flight safety system , low - cost satellite communications transceiver , and mechanical payload adapter ring .
" We , in the Washington D.C. office are celebrating with champagne , " Gwynne Shotwell , SpaceX vice president of business development , told reporters after the launch .
" Falcon 1 clearly got to space . "
Tuesday 's launchmarked SpaceX 's second Falcon 1 test flight after a fuelleak and fire led to the failure of its inaugural space shot last year [ image ] .
Initially attributed to human error , the failed launch was ultimately found tobe the result of a corroded aluminum nut , prompting the El Segundo , California - based firm to institute a host of rocketand ground facility improvements .
" It did n' ttake us one year to build the new rocket , " Musk told SPACE.com before Tuesday 'sspace shot .
" The delay of one year was used to allow us to develop the Falcon1 , version two . "
Standingabout 68 feet ( 21 meters ) tall , SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket is a two - stage boosterdesigned to carry satellite payloads of up to 1,256 pounds ( 570 kilograms ) intolow - Earth orbit for a flat price of about $ 7 million per space shot .
The rocket ' sfirst stage is designed to be reusable , and carries parachutes to slow itsdescent and make a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean for later retrieval andrefurbishment .
" The firststage should be currently floating around the Pacific Ocean , with our recoveryboat in hot pursuit , " Musk said after Tuesday 's launch .
Flights shouldresume
Musk saidhas said repeatedly that he firmly believed that any serious glitch to afflict thesecond Falcon 1 test would not prompt another one - year delay in flights .
SpaceXplans to launch at least two more Falcon 1 rockets this year , including asummer space shot to orbit the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory 's TacSat - 1satellite and a third mission to launch Malaysia 's Razaksat Earth - observationsatellite .
Both customers have pledged to stand by SpaceX , with the Razaksatteam offering a hearty congratulations following Tuesday 's liftoff , SpaceXofficials said .
" We feellike there 's really no need for an extra test flight , " Musk told reporters .
SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket is not only aimed at providing low - cost satellite launches .
Italso serves as a precursor to the launch firm 's planned Falcon 9 rocket , aheavy - lift booster currently under development to loft the firm 's manned Dragonspacecraft .
VIDEO : SpaceX Simulates Dragon's Flight to ISS
Slated tomake its first test flight in 2009 , SpaceX 's Dragon vehicle is the launch firm ' sentry in NASA 's CommercialOrbital Transportation System ( COTS ) , a program aimed at finding private crew andcargo services to support the International SpaceStation ( ISS ) .
But those future Falcon 9 flights are linked to the successof Falcon 1 , Musk has told SPACE.com .
Patti GraceSmith , the Federal Aviation Administration 's associate administrator COTS , wished SpaceX and their Falcon 1 rocket luck during Tuesday , as did NASA administratorMike Griffin .
" I 've got all fingers and toes crossed hoping that it works , " Griffin told SpaceNews , a sister publication to SPACE.com , following his address atthe 45th Robert H. Goddard Memorial Space Symposium in Adelphi , Md .
Musk saidthat despite the early end to today 's spaceflight , he considers the test asuccess and looks forward to the upcoming Falcon 1 missions .
" I think it 'sfair to characterize this as a success and a good day , " Musk said .
" Not aperfect day , but a good day . "

Teachers not staying in the profession , report finds
2007-06-20 12:04:00 PDT
SAN FRANCISCO --
About 500,000 teachers across the country give up on the profession every year -- a persistent churn and burn that costs the public schools an estimated $ 7.3 billion annually , according to a national report released today .
" Schools are able to hire enough teachers , but they just can't keep them in the classroom , " said Tom Carroll , president of the National Commission on Teaching and America 's Future , which conducted the study .
In San Francisco , the district spends an estimated $ 12 million to recruit , hire and train new teachers each year to replace those who've left , the researchers found .
The annual exodus is " draining resources , diminishing teaching quality , and undermining our ability to close the student achievement gap , " according to the report .
To stem the flow , districts must first determine the annual turnover rate and then focus on hiring well - prepared teachers who have a clear understanding of content , curriculum and how to manage a classroom , Carroll said .
And then , he added , they need mentoring and other support their first years .
The study analyzed five districts across the country , adding up all the costs associated with replacing outgoing teachers , including staff time spent interviewing , travel to recruitment fairs , professional development .
At the high end , Chicago spent nearly $ 18,000 on each of the 4,800 teachers who left every year .
Yet , in the much smaller community of Jemez Valley , N.M. , the district spent $ 4,366 on each departing teacher .

Homeowners Insurance Does Not Cover Many Types of Damage
Flood , earthquake , expansive soil , hurricane , landslide and subsidence damage is often not covered !
Article by : Hobart M. King , PhD , RPG
" All Perils " Means : Learn About the Geology Every year in every state , many property owners discover that their homeowners insurance policy will not pay when their homes are damaged by common geological processes such as earthquakes , expansive soils , floods , hurricanes , landslides and subsidence .
These homeowners probably had the impression that their " all perils " insurance policy would pay for almost any type of damage that their home would experience .
I felt the same way when I purchased my first homeowners insurance policy .
I distinctly remember sitting in the agent 's office and listening to him tell me that I was buying an " all perils " policy .
I felt good about that because I was covered for " all perils . "
I did n't read the policy word - by - word to see what it really covered - who reads 50 - page insurance policies issued by leading companies in the insurance industry ?
Everyone assumes that they cover everything .
It 's an " all perils " policy , right ?
A few years later , my work as a geologist brought me in contact with lots of homeowners who were unable to collect when their homes were damaged by floods , landslides , subsidence and other problems .
I was surprised at how many people received this rude insurance awakening .
At first I blamed it on " cheap insurance . "
Then I began to realize that the people I met under these circumstances were not going to have their losses covered by their insurance company - not even by the companies that I always thought were the leaders of the insurance industry .

An Idea for Insurance Companies : Perhaps insurance companies could generate an enormous boost in revenues by offering their current policies as " fire , wind and limited liability coverage " ( or another appropriate title ) .
They could then offer a real " all perils " policy for a higher price .
Do n't you think a lot of people would appreciate this clarity and security -- and opt for the upgrade ?
" Exclusions : What We Do Not Cover "
One day I received an updated policy from my insurance company in the mail and I decided to spend a little time reading .
I wanted to find out if my policy would cover the same disasters that I saw other people suffering .
Sure enough , the policy had an exclusions statement that listed a large number of geologic hazards .
The list of exclusions was almost identical to the table of contents of an environmental geology textbook .
There was no coverage for landslides , floods , mine subsidence , mud slides , mud flows , volcanic eruptions , surface water , sewage and a long list of other problems .
I have since looked at the exclusions statements of many homeowners insurance policies , and my personal opinion is that the typical homeowners insurance policy is often just a fire and limited liability policy - and maybe some coverage for damage done by falling objects and wind .
Your homeowners insurance probably does not cover half of the things that you assumed it would .
In my opinion , the " all perils " name is misleading because the coverage excludes so many different types of losses that commonly occur .
Many homeowners never learn about these exclusions until after they have paid premiums for many years and then suffer an uncovered loss .
The lesson to be taken away from this is : " Learn about the geology before you buy the house . "
If the home has some geological risk you should not buy it .
Or , you should know exactly what your risks are and either find specific insurance to cover them or live in the house informed of your exposure .
Below I have done my best to summarize what many homeowners policies do not cover and provide links to more detailed information .
More detailed learning for these topics can be obtained by reading an environmental geology book or taking an environmental geology course at a university .
For site - specific information you can contact a consulting geologist or the geological survey that serves the area where the house is located .
Expansive Soils Map
Over 50 percent of these areas are underlain by soils with abundant clays of high swelling potential .
Less than 50 percent of these areas are underlain by soils with clays of high swelling potential .
Over 50 percent of these areas are underlain by soils with abundant clays of slight to moderate swelling potential .
Less than 50 percent of these areas are underlain by soils with abundant clays of slight to moderate swelling potential .
These areas are underlain by soils with little to no clays with swelling potential .
Data insufficient to indicate the clay content or the swelling potential of soils .
Expansive Soils and Homeowners Insurance
In a typical year in the United States , expansive soils cause damage to more homes than earthquakes , floods , hurricanes , and tornadoes combined .
Most homeowners insurance policies do not cover damage from expansive soils .
Expansive soils contain a significant amount of clay which can expand when wet and shrink when dry .
These volume changes can generate enormous forces which can damage foundations , underground utilities , sidewalks , driveways and other parts of a home .
The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that one half of the homes in the United States are built on expansive soils , and one half of these will have some damage .
There are certain areas of the United States where expansive soils are beneath much of the land .
A general guide to where they are is shown in the map and references on this page .
In those areas where expansive soils are a known problem , professional inspection for the presence of expansive soils or expansive soil damage should be done before purchasing an existing home or construction lot .
Small areas of expansive soils occur almost anywhere so inspection is never a bad idea .
Many state geological surveys have detailed information about local expansive soil problems .
The United States Department of Agriculture has a publication titled " Understanding Soil Risks and Hazards " that explains some of the problems with expansive soils .

Earthquake Hazard Map Earthquake Insurance
The typical homeowners insurance policy does not cover damage from earthquakes .
A homeowner who desires this coverage normally needs to purchase a " named perils " policy - an earthquake insurance policy .
One way to do this is to ask your homeowners insurance agent if your policy provides earthquake coverage .
If the policy does not cover earthquake damage , then ask where you can purchase the coverage .
Some insurance companies will add earthquake insurance coverage to an existing homeowners policy for an additional annual fee .
In some geographic areas , earthquake insurance is available through government - sponsored programs such as the California Earthquake Authority .
Many insurance agents can advise on the companies and government programs that offer earthquake coverage in your area .
Another question that many homeowners ask is : " Do I need earthquake insurance ? "
There are a few situations where a homeowner must have earthquake insurance to comply with mortgage requirements .
However , for most people the answer depends upon where the home is located and the level of risk that the homeowner is willing to take .
The earthquake hazard map on this page shows the geographic variability of earthquake hazard in the conterminous United States .
Light gray areas on this map have the lowest hazard and the pink areas have the highest .
Earthquake insurance is probably a very good idea in the red , pink , and orange areas .
If I lived in these areas , I would buy the insurance for my residence and for a commercial building if I owned one .
It is a prudent idea in the yellow areas .
Earthquake hazards are lower in the green , blue , and gray areas .
If you live in one of these areas and want the peace of mind that you are financially protected in the event of damage , then the insurance is a good purchase .
I live in southwestern Pennsylvania and do not have earthquake insurance - perhaps I will regret that someday .
Flood Insurance According to the National Flood Insurance Program , floods are America 's # 1 natural disaster .
They occur in every state and almost every community .
Homeowners insurance usually does not cover flood damage so it is very important to understand the flood hazards at your location and obtain appropriate insurance coverage if needed .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provides address - specific flood hazard information on the FloodSmart website .
There you can type in your address and learn about the specific flood hazards at your location .
They also have information for assessing flood hazards and purchasing flood insurance .
FloodSmart recommends flood insurance even if you live in an area of low to moderate risk .
This is because 25 % of all flood insurance claims come from areas with minimal flood risk .
Flooding occurs there during exceptionally large flood events and also as a result of local drainage problems .
Purchasing insurance in these areas is often inexpensive - it starts as low as $ 59 / year for renters ( contents coverage only ) or $ 129 / year to cover a home and its contents .
Hurricane Insurance Homeowners insurance usually does not cover " hurricanes . "
Instead , the coverage or exclusion is based upon which element of a hurricane ( such as wind , waves or flooding ) directly caused the damage .
These issues are not easily resolved and often must be settled in court .
For example : a house was flooded by a storm surge , and the homeowner claims that since the surge was produced by wind that the damage should be covered .
The insurance company maintains that they do not pay for flood damage .
Many of these types of cases - based upon definitions and impacts - are difficult to resolve .
Persons who buy property in areas that might experience hurricanes should learn about the types of hazards that come with these storms and how they impact the specific location where they will live .
History is often a very good teacher .
For example , if a location was inundated by storm surge in the past , then a future inundation will probably occur .
Landslide Incidence / Susceptibility Map
Landslide Insurance Homeowners insurance usually does not cover landslide damage .
I have been to many homes that have been damaged by landslides and know of only one situation where the homeowners insurance company paid for the loss ( after a lawsuit determined that the damage was done by a rockfall and the policy did cover damage from falling objects ) .
Anyone who intends to buy or build a home on sloping land should be cautious about potential landslide problems .
Properties above a slope or at the base of a slope can also be at risk .
Although landslide problems occur in all 50 states , some areas have a much greater incidence than others .
The three factors which determine incidence are : 1 ) slope steepness , 2 ) soil strength , and 3 ) moisture content of the soil .
The landslide map on this page shows areas with a high incidence of landslide problems in brown and red .
Persons buying or building in these areas should be especially cautious because of the special conditions which occur there .
The best way to protect yourself is to avoid buying or building in hazardous areas .
If you are in doubt , have an expert inspect the site and look for building damage that indicates a building under stress .
Even if no landslide problems are revealed by the inspection , be aware that excavation , grading , or fill placement can increase landslide probability .
Also , landslide damage on adjacent properties is a good indicator that your home might be at risk - and will often result in difficult resale .
Always be cautious on slopes and seek expert advice if you are uncertain .
State geological surveys often have detailed information about local landslide hazards and problems .
Coal Field Map Karst Map Subsidence Insurance Subsidence is usually not covered by homeowners insurance .
The most common and damaging subsidence occurs in areas above underground mining .
Here , voids opened during mining slowly or suddenly collapse .
This can damage buildings , roads and utilities above .
Your home can be damaged or ruined by this type of subsidence or it can be condemned - even if it is not damaged .
Condemnation occurs when a government inspector determines that your home is unsafe for occupancy .
It can also occur if the utility and road infrastructure of a neighborhood becomes too expensive or impossible to maintain .
Then local government can condemn the property and prohibit occupancy .
If your home is condemned you are required to move out - even if you rent , owe $ 500,000 on the mortgage , or own the home free and clear .
Mine subsidence occurs where coal or another mineral resource has been removed below the surface .
The coal field map on this page and link to the USGS Coal Fields website shows where this is most likely to occur .
More specific information and underground mine maps can often be obtained from state geological surveys or mine regulation agencies .
These agencies can often tell you about minable resources beneath your property and provide information on past or present mining activity .
You do n't need mine subsidence insurance if your building is in an area with no minable resources below .
Avoiding properties above mined out areas is the best way to be safe from mine subsidence .
However , existing structures over mines can often be insured through government mine subsidence insurance programs or through supplemental policies from insurance companies .
Your homeowners insurance agent should be able to advise you on where it can be obtained , or you might contact a government agency in your state to ask .
The area where I live is entirely underlain by the Pittsburgh Coal , which was mined out decades ago .
Although the seam is a few hundred feet below the surface and there is no obvious subsidence damage in my area , I bought mine subsidence insurance from the Pennsylvania Mine Subsidence Insurance Fund .
For about $ 170 / year I have up to $ 250,000 in coverage .
Contact your insurance agent for information .
Subsidence can also occur from natural voids below , such as underground caverns in limestone .
Extensive cavern systems are beneath large areas of some states .
The United States Geological Survey has information on areas where potential karst subsidence can occur .
Subsidence also occurs in some areas where large volumes of water or oil are being extracted through wells .
In these areas the water aquifer or oil reservoir begins to compact , and that compaction results in subsidence or fissuring at the surface .
The United States Geological Survey has information about subsidence in response to water and oil production .

Death has closed the book on the controversial life of Harriet Klausner .
The prolific book reviewer had a unique talent that brought her online fame :
She could speed - read through up to six books a day .
Harnessing this skill , Klausner became a cultural phenomenon .
For much of the ‘ oughts , she was the # 1 ranked reviewer on Amazon.com .
As her influence in the book industry grew , publishers began sending her review copies of upcoming novels , sometimes as many as 50 a week .
In 2006 , Time Magazine even named Klausner a person who had significant impact on the information age .
That impact was lessened , somewhat , when Amazon instituted a new ranking system .
Although Klausner ’s “ top reviewer ” rating dropped to # 2,410 , the site continued to honor her contributions by naming her the # 1 Hall of Fame Reviewer — a recognition she earned in 11 different years .
“ During the 2000s , Klausner was a well - known name in online book circles , and it was rare to see any popular title on Amazon without a Klausner customer review at the top of the list .
She was an important part of the history of Amazon , and deserves to be remembered as such , ” TeleRead editor Chris Meadows said .
Born and raised in the Bronx , Klausner was always surrounded by literature .
Her father worked at the McGraw - Hill publishing house , which meant her childhood home was filled to the brim with books .
As an adult , she earned a master ’s degree in library science , did a stint as an advance reader for the Doubleday Book Club , labored at several book stores and worked as an acquisition librarian .
Klausner ’s desire to become a critiquing machine was sparked while writing a monthly review column of recommended reads .
Once her son Eric was born , she launched a freelance writing career and began building her brand as a popular reviewer of genre fiction .
“ I enjoy a heated romance , especially written by the Sandras — Chastain and Brown .
I love science fiction and fantasy when the realm feels real .
Horror is entertaining to me when the vampires seem as if they are another living ( dead ? ) species .
[ Dean ] Koontz remains my king .
However , I particularly take pleasure from almost all the sub -genres of mystery to include comic books starring Batman and Ms. Tree , ” Klausner once said .
Yet there were books that simply did n’t hold the Georgia resident ’s interest .
“ I do not enjoy nonfiction , ” she said , “ especially biographies ( boring ) or most westerns . ”
Illness and insomnia helped to turn Klausner into a homebound , book - reading , review - writing machine .
Over the course of 15 years , she posted 31,014 reviews on Amazon , including a positive critique of John Benedict ’s medical thriller “ Adrenaline , ” and a rave review for “ Onward , Drake ! ” by Larry Correia , both of which appeared just days before her death .
Thousands of readers revered her efforts , buying novels based on her generally glowing reviews .
Authors also considered the act of getting “ Klausnered ” a rite of passage since her reviews often helped to boost the average ranking of new tomes .
One author , John Birmingham , even named a character in his novel “ Designated Targets ” after her , though Klausner failed to disclose this fact when she reviewed the book .
Romance novelist Elizabeth Delisi , whose books received blurbable accolades from Klausner , praised her critiques .
“ Harriet was a wonderful reviewer , whose support of new authors gave many of them the hope to keep on writing .
She will be sorely missed , ” Delisi said in an online condolence book .
Sara Nelson , the editorial director of Amazon.com and a contributor to the blog Omnivoracious , described Klausner as the “ best kind of reader . ”
“ It ’s no surprise that she had major credibility with Amazon readers and book lovers ; her reviews garnered more than 119,000 ‘ helpful ’ votes over the years , ” Nelson noted .
“ In other words , people counted on her thoughts . ”
Klausner also had countless vocal detractors .
Many people posted complaints on her reviews claiming she was a fraud ; they simply did n’t believe she could possibly read so many books .
Others accused her of being a collective of reviewers all writing under the same moniker in order to achieve fame and receive free copies of books .
Some readers disliked the style of her reviews , which frequently just summarized the story with a bit of positive opinion at the end .
Some took issue with the fact that she gave so many four - or five - star ratings .
And then there were those who groused that Klausner did n’t disclose the fact that she received thousands of books , including not - for - sale advanced review copies , from publishers .
In profiles and interviews , Klausner addressed a few of these issues .
On Books ‘ N’ Bytes , she scoffed at the fraud claims , describing herself as a “ hyper- speed - reader . ”
She told The New York Times that she was able to get through so many novels because many were n’t very long .
“ You ever read a Harlequin romance ? ” she asked .
“ You can finish it in one hour . ”
Klausner also defended her decision to avoid writing negative reviews by declaring herself a member of the “ if you do n’t have anything nice to write , do n’t write anything at all ” school of literary criticism .
If , after 50 pages , a book did n’t capture her interest , she ’d just cast it aside and move on to another .
“ I have one basic criterion : A book should entertain me and take me away from the rest of the world , ” she told the Wall Street Journal .
To the rest of her detractors , Klausner ’s response was simple and pointed : “ Get a life .
Read a book . ”
Klausner died on Oct. 15 .
Cause of death was not released .
She was 63 .
When describing how she ’d like to be remembered , Klausner said her husband Stan had already devised the perfect epitaph : “ Give me literature or give me death . ”
As I ’ve mentioned before , my mother is battling cancer .
Due to this , I ’ve spent more time in hospitals over the past few months than I have in my life before now .
And in so doing , I ’ve drawn some scary conclusions about where our industry may be headed .
When I got into the industry 20 years ago ( yes , it ’s true … ) , it was quite realistic to think that a hot - shot programmer could be an expert in everything they touched .
In my case , I got hired to write software on a DEC VAX using VAX Basic .
Now , I was a dyed in the wool Pascal fanatic , and the idea of using “ Basic ” was abhorrent to me .
But not as abhorrent as not having a job ( this was during the Reagan - era recession after all ) , and besides , I loved the VAX and this was a VAX job .
What I learned , was that VAX Basic was n’t “ Basic ” at all .
It was a hybrid between FORTRAN ( the native VAX language ) and Pascal .
A couple months later , I was an expert at , not only the VMS operating system , but at this new language as well .
It was my sixth programming language , and after a while learning a new language just is n’t that hard .
My point is this : as a junior ( though dedicated ) programmer , I knew pretty much everything about my operating system and programming language .
For that matter , I was versed in the assembly language for the platform too , though I did n’t need to use it .
Fast - forward 8 years to 1995 : the beginning of the end .
In 1995 it was still possible for a dedicated programmer to know virtually everything about their platform and language .
I ’d fortunately anticipated the fall of OpenVMS some years earlier , and had hitched my wagon to Windows NT and Visual Basic .
Windows NT was , and is , at its core , the same as OpenVMS ( same threading , same virtual memory , etc. ) and so it was n’t as big a shift as it could have been .
The bigger shift was from linear / procedural programming to event - driven / procedural programming …
But , in 1995 it was quite realistic to know the ins and outs of VB 3.0 , and to fully understand the workings of Windows NT ( especially if you read Helen Custer ’s excellent book ) .
The world had n’t changed in any substantive way , at least on the surface , from 1987 .
Beneath the surface the changes were happening however .
Remote OLE Automation arrived with VB 4.0 , rapidly followed by real DCOM .
SQL Server appeared on the scene , offering an affordable RDBMS and rapidly spreading the use of that technology .
( Note that I ’d already worked with Oracle at this point , but its adoption was restrained by its cost .
Regardless of the relative technical merits of SQL Server , its price point was an agent for change . )
And , of course , the HTTP / WAIS / Gopher battle was resolved , with HTTP the only protocol left standing .
Not that anyone really cared a lot in 1995 , but the seeds were there .
Now step forward just 3 years , to 1998 .
Already , in 1998 it was becoming difficult for even a dedicated developer to be an expert in everything they used .
Relational databases , distributed programming technologies , multiple programming languages per application , the rapidly changing and unreliable HTML and related technologies .
And at the same time , it is n’t like Windows GUI development went away or even stood still either .
Also at this time we started to see the rise of frameworks .
COM was the primary instigator – at least in the Microsoft space .
The face that there was a common convention for interaction meant that it was possible for people to create frameworks – for development , or to provide pre-built application functionality at a higher level .
And those frameworks could be used by many languages and in many settings .
I smile at this point , because OpenVMS had a standardized integration scheme in 1987 – a concept that was lost for a few years until it was reborn in another form through COM .
What comes around , goes around .
The thing is , these frameworks were beneficial .
At the same time , they were yet another thing to learn .
The surface area of technology a developer was expected to know now included everything about their platform and programming tools , and one or more frameworks that they might be using .
Still , if you were willing to forego having friends , family or a real life , it was technically possible to be an expert in all these things .
Most of us started selecting subsets though , focusing our expertise on certain platforms , tools and technologies and struggling to balance even that against something resembling a “ normal life ” .
Now come forward to today .
What began in 1995 has continued through to today , and we 're on the cusp of some new changes that add even more complexity .
Every single piece of our world has grown .
The Vista operating system is now so complex that it is n’t realistic to understand the entire platform – especially when we ’re expected to also know Windows XP and Server 2003 and probably still Windows 2000 .
For many of us , the .NET Framework has replaced the operating system as a point of focus .
Who cares about Windows when I ’ve got .NET .
But the .NET Framework is now well over 10,000 classes and some totally insane number of methods and properties .
It is impractical to be an expert on all of .NET .
Below the operating system and .NET , the hardware is undergoing the first meaningful change in 20 years : from single processor to multiple processors and / or cores .
Yes , I know multiprocessor boxes have been around forever – our VAX was dual CPU in 1989 .
But we are now looking at desktop computers having dual core standard .
Quad core within a couple years .
( I know most people went from 16 to 32 bits – but the VAX was 32 bit when I started , and 64 bit when I moved to Windows , so I ca n’t get too excited over how many bits are in a C language int .
After you 've gone back and forth on the bit count a couple times it does n't seem so important . )
But this dual / quad processor hardware is n’t uniform .
Dual processor means separate L1 / L2 caches .
Dual core means separate L1 , but sometimes combined L2 caches .
AMD is working on a CPU with a shared L3 cache .
And this actually matters in terms of how we write software !
Write your software wrong , and it will run slower rather than faster , thanks to cache and / or memory contention .
( This sort of thing , btw , is why understanding the actual OS is so important too .
The paging model used by OpenVMS and Windows can have a tremendous positive or negative impact on your application ’s performance if you are looping through arrays or collections in certain ways .
Of course Vista changes this somewhat , so yet again we see expansion in what we need to know to be effective … )
At least now we only have one real programming language : VB / C# ( plus or minus semi-colons ) , though that language keeps expanding .
In .NET 2.0 we got generics , in 3.5 there ’s a whole set of functional language additions to support LINQ .
And I ’m not even mentioning all the little tweaky additions that have been added here and there – like custom events in VB or anonymous delegates in C# .
And how many of us know the .NET “ assembly language ” : CIL ?
I could code in the VMS macro assembly language , but personally I struggle to read anything beyond the simplest CIL …
I could belabor the point , but I wo n’t .
Technology staples like SQL Server have grown immensely .
Numerous widely used frameworks and tools have come and gone and morphed and changed ( Commerce Server , SharePoint , Biztalk , etc ) .
The point is that today it is impossible for a developer to be an expert in everything they need to use when building many applications .
As I mentioned at the beginning , I ’ve been spending a lot of time in hospitals .
And so I ’ve interacted with a lot of nurses and doctors .
And it is scary .
Very , very scary .
Why ?
Because they are all so specialized that they can’t actually care for their patients .
As a patient , if you do n’t keep track of what all the specialists say and try to do to you , you can die .
An oncologist may prescribe treatment A , while the gastro - intestinal specialist prescribes treatment B . And they may conflict .
Now in that simple case , the specialists might ( might ! ) have collaborated .
But if you are seriously ill , you can easily have 4 - 8 specialists prescribing treatments for various subsystems of your body .
And the odds of conflict is very high !
In short , the consumer ( patient ) is forced to become their own general physician or risk serious injury or death at the hands of the well - meaning , but incredibly - specialized physicians surrounding them .
And I think this is where our industry is headed .
I know people who are building their entire career by specializing on TFS , or on SharePoint Server , or on SQL Server BI technologies , or Biztalk .
And I do n’t blame them for a second , because there ’s an increasing market demand for people who have real understanding of each of these technologies .
And if you want to be a real expert , you need to give up any pretense of expertise in other areas .
The same is true with the Windows / Web bifurcation .
And now WPF is coming on the scene , so I suppose that ’s a “ trifurcation ” ?
( apparently that ’s a real word , because the spell checker did n’t barf ! )
What amazes me is that this insane explosion in complexity has occurred , and yet most of my customers still want basically the same thing : to have an application that collects and processes data , generates some reports and does n’t crash .
But I do n’t think this trend is reversible .
I do wonder what the original OO people think .
You know , the ones who coined the “ software crisis ” phrase 20 or so years ago ?
Back then there was no real crisis – at least not compared to today …
So what does this mean for us and our industry ?
It is an incredible shift for an industry that is entirely built on generalists .
Companies are used to treating developers like interchangeable cogs .
We know that ’s bad , but soon they will know it too !
They ’ll know it because they ’ll need a bigger staff , and one that has more idle time per person , to accomplish things a single developer might have done in the past .
Consulting companies are built on utilization models that pre-suppose a consultant can fill many roles , and can handle many technology situations .
More specialization means lower utilization ( and more travel ) , which can only result in higher hourly rates .
Envision a computer industry that works like the medical industry .
“ Developers ” employed in corporate settings become general practitioners : people who know a little about a lot , and pretty much nothing about anything .
Their role is primarily to take a guess about the issue and refer the customer to a specialist .
These specialists are almost always consultants .
But those consultants have comparatively low utilization .
They focus on some subset of technology , allowing them to have expertise , but they ’re largely ignorant of the surrounding technologies .
Because their utilization is low , they are hopping from client to client , never focused entirely an any one – this reduces their efficiency .
Yet they are experts , and they are in demand , so they command a high hourly rate – gotta balance the lower hours somehow to get the same annual income …
Many projects require multiple specialists , and the consumer is the only one who knows what all is going on .
Hopefully that “ general practitioner ” role can help – but that ’s not the case in the medical profession .
So we can extrapolate that in many cases it is the end consumer , the real customer , that must become tech - savvy enough to coordinate all these specialists as they accidentally conflict with each other .
Maybe , just maybe , we can head this off somewhat .
Maybe , unlike in the medical industry , we can develop generalists as a formal role .
Not that they can directly contribute much to the effort , but at least the people in this role can effectively coordinate the specialists that do the actual work .
Just think .
If each cancer patient had a dedicated general practitioner focused on coordinating the efforts of the various specialists , how much better would the results be ?
Of course , there ’s that whole issue of paying for such a dedicated coordinator – somehow who ’s continuing education and skills would have to be extraordinary …
There was a question about whether we had a business model :
You mentioned that you have started it all because you loved working on this project , but now you fantasize about getting bought .
But does your startup have a business model ?
I mean , if you do n’t get both and your project is finished enough to be released , do you have a model about how to make money out of it ?
Too many startups these days seem to have no business model whatsoever , unless it is “ gee , I hope my project is interesting enough to Google , Yahoo or some other big double - oh player that I get bought ” .
Yes , we have a business model .
We have released our product and have actual users actually using it on the actual Internet .
I know it sounds like complete Web 2.0 assholery to say this , but our business model ultimately revolves around a new revolutionary form of contextual advertising .
In fact , it 's so contextual that it knows what ads to render before users even request the page ( but that 's as much as I can tell you here ) .
From the onset the plan was two parts : 1 ) get a ton of users , 2 ) turn each and every one of those users into a veritable gold mine , like a magic satchel that 's always filled with tasty treats every time you open it , despite how many you may have taken out .
In between , we had the option step 1.5 ) get bought by Google - Yahoo - Microsoft - Ebay - Amazon .
We have yet to accomplish steps 1 , 1.5 , or 2 .
Honestly , though , I 've never understood why people get so pissy about how there are all these companies starting up without any idea how to get revenue .
Why do you give a fuck if other people are being morons ?
For those of you with rock solid business plans for getting revenue , looking down from your tower at the rest of us , you should be happy that you 're competition is so stupid .
For those of you who do n't have your own web startup , who are n't working for a web startup , and who are n't bankrolling a web startup , shut the fuck up .
I am sick and tired of reading bitchy blog posts complaining about companies that do n't have an obvious revenue model , written by people who are n't even in the game .
Yes , maybe 99 % of web startups will go down the shitter when Bubble 2.0 bursts .
But at least we 're playing the game , not sitting on the sidelines .
Benchwarmers .
And if I 'm in that 1 % , I 'll be laughing all the way to the Lamborghini dealership .

Ippolito was running a software development firm in Tampa , Florida , with more work than he knew what to do with .
Whenever he released a new program , people emailed him asking for little modifications .
“ I had all these people kind of bothering me , and I could n’t keep up , ” Ippolito says .
“ I saw there was a need out there : People had these small software projects that they wanted to get done , but they did n’t have access to good programmers . ”
In 2001 , Ippolito created Rent A Coder with the idea of helping his supplicants find qualified software developers to take on their little jobs .
In just over three years , the site–a sort of eBay for software projects –has exploded , attracting a cumulative 45,000 buyers who ’ve posted projects and 121,000 coders around the globe offering to take on work .
Rent A Coder is n’t without rivals ; Elance.com and ScriptLance offer similar services .
These networks are n’t just for programmers anymore–there ’s work for Web designers , translators , proofreaders , and writers .
Posting a project on Rent A Coder is free , as is bidding on it .
Once the work gets assigned , the buyer puts the project cost into escrow ; when the programming is done , the developer gets paid , less a Rent A Coder fee of between 7.5 % and 15 % .
As on eBay , both parties can rate each other at the end of a transaction .
The site is a window into the distributed , hypercompetitive future of work : Coders , mostly from the United States , India , Romania , Ukraine , Russia , and Pakistan , dive into the fray to bid on projects .
Those with the best reputations , based on past work , can command a premium ; many newcomers work at a loss for several projects to build credibility .
The corresponding challenge for those who commission projects , such as Darren Gates of the Los Angeles Web site Tufat.com , is managing far - flung contractors via email and instant messages .
Gates , who sells inexpensive add - ons such as chat rooms for Web sites , typically works with five to eight programmers simultaneously , especially those in Eastern Europe .
( In 2004 , “ two of my programmers had to take a two - month break because of the Ukrainian election crisis , ” he says .
“ They were involved with the protests , and I was crossing my fingers , hoping it would n’t turn into a civil war . ” )
Sometimes , when he needs a design project done , Gates hires several designers through Rent A Coder to see whose work he likes best .

" These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles underlying what we are doing .
Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect ( intellect catching up with intuition ) , sometimes they were identified as they were happening , sometimes they were formulated .
They can be used as a pack ( a set of posibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind ) or by drawing a single card from a shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation .
In this case the card is trusted even if it appropriateness is quite unclear .
They are not final , as new ideas will present themselves , and others will become self - evident . "

ON JUNE 6th a premature report of a big Turkish invasion of northern Iraq rocked markets .
Certainly thousands of Turkish troops , backed by tanks and artillery , have massed for a possible offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in Iraq .
Martial law has been declared in three of Turkey 's Kurdish provinces .
This follows rising violence against soldiers in Turkey .
On June 4th seven Turkish soldiers died when Kurdish rebels raided an outpost in the province of Tunceli .
In May six civilians were killed by a suspected PKK suicide - bomber in Ankara .
All this increases the pressure on Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , to strike the PKK in its mountain strongholds in Iraq .
General Yasar Buyukanit , chief of the general staff , has called a putative cross - border incursion “ necessary ” and “ useful ” .
Deniz Baykal , the main opposition leader , is in favour .
But the American defence secretary , Robert Gates , said this week that the United States was squarely opposed to unilateral Turkish action , which would destabilise the only calmish bit of Iraq .
The Americans would prefer the Turks to use the Iraqi Kurds to help them make peace with the PKK .
The PKK itself wants to draw more Turkish forces into Iraq ( the Turks have kept some 1,000 soldiers there since an incursion in the 1990s ) because , as a source suggests , “ this could provoke armed confrontation between Turkey and America . ”
It would also upset the European Union .
A few days before this week 's alleged invasion , two American fighter jets had strayed from Iraq into Turkish airspace .
The Americans said this was an “ accident ” , but some Turks saw a warning that America might side with the Kurds against them .
Yet most Americans acknowledge that their refusal to heed Turkish calls to attack the PKK is now the main cause of rampant anti-Americanism in Turkey .
Catching a few PKK ringleaders could improve matters .
The Iraqi Kurds are unwilling to co-operate mainly because they see the PKK as a bargaining chip to get the Turks to recognise their quasi- independent status in Iraq .
The Turks are against a referendum in Kirkuk this December that might lead it to join the Kurdish region .
Massoud Barzani , the Iraqi Kurdish leader , threatens trouble in Turkey 's mostly Kurdish south - eastern provinces , where his popularity is now starting to rival that of the captured PKK leader , Abdullah Ocalan .
Most Iraqi Kurds consider their quasi - independent state as the real target of any Turkish incursion .
But after two decades of battle , some 16 cross - border incursions and 40,000 dead , Turkey 's leaders , military and civilian alike , know that force alone cannot solve Turkey 's Kurdish problem .
The generals may have another reason for sabre - rattling .
By insisting on government approval to strike in Iraq , they are shifting the blame for the violence to the Americans and the Iraqi Kurds — and to Mr Erdogan .
With each Turkish casualty Mr Erdogan risks losing nationalist votes .
Yet if he orders a full invasion , Turkey may just get bogged down and face new enemies .

Hit reddit / digg and send this to the other linkfarms fresh today , let 's get Luis some more eyes for this re-post .
The Title
To start , it is important to note the strangeness of the article ’s title ; it calls Peak Oil a theory and implies it distorts the debate .
Peak
Oil is often labeled as a theory , usually by those not so acquainted with the study of resource depletion .
A peak in time is a mathematical result of growing consumption of a finite resource ; in the case of oil the peak phenomenon is already observable in more than 50 producing countries .
As an oil expert Dr. Jackson surely knows this , so why call it a theory ?
As for the second part of the title , it is hard to consider why the Hubbert Peak should distort the debate or energy policy .
Should n’t an open and enlightening debate consider all hypotheses ?
Moreover , if a peak in oil production is an observable phenomenon , why not consider as such ?
Take for instance the United Kingdom , can the stakeholders make the right decisions on energy policy without considering the peak in internal production in 1999 ?
Resources or Reserves ?
After an introductory account of his points Dr. Jackson dives into his arguments , immediately producing an important affirmation :
Our analysis finds that the remaining global oil resource base is actually 3.7 trillion bbl — three times as large as the 1.2 trillion bbl estimated by peak oil theory proponents .
Strange words , considering researchers using the Hubbert method usually do not work with ‘ resources ’ , for the method produces a number for ultimate recoverable reserves .
But in that case , considering the known result of Prof.
Deffeyes of 1000 Gb for remaining recoverable reserves [ 1 ] , and using a world mean recovery rate of 27 % , the implied remaining resource is 3700 Gb , the same number Dr. Jackson puts forward .
Further down Dr. Jackson continues :
[ … ] world oil production will not peak before 2030 [… ]
How can world oil production peak after 2030 with a remaining resource of 3700 Gb ?
For that to happen the worldwide recovery rate would have to go well over 50 % , something highly unlikely to happen when more than half of the world ’s oil fields produce less than 20 kb/d [ 3 ] , and are located on ever remote regions .
Such a scenario could eventually actually make the case for a fall in world mean recovery rate , not the opposite .
Before considering further arguments it is important to note that such discrepancies in Dr. Jackson ’s discourse seem to be caused by a mistake in conflating resources with reserves ( and probably the opposite ) .
Some clarification by Dr. Jackson on these first paragraphs of his article would be of help .
Hubbert ’s forecast
In Fig. 2 there ’s a graph representing the US Lower - 48 production and Dr. Hubbert ’s forecast .
Something is wrong with this graph , which gives the idea that Dr. Hubbert ’s forecast is somewhat astray from actual production .
Using the graph depicted by Dr. Hubbert himself in his famous 1956 paper and the historical data published by the EIA the result is somewhat different :
M. King Hubbert ’s projections found in his 1956 article Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels and subsequent production published by the EIA .
Production did n’t completely follow the curve forecast by Dr. Hubbert , but it has kept evolving close to it , sometimes below , other times above it .
Differences in excess of 60 % , like pointed in Dr. Jackson ’s article , are absent .
Of note it is also a fact that using this data up to 2005 , Hubbert ’s method continues to forecast a figure for ultimate recoverable reserves of 200 Gb .
Above ground factors
Following Dr. Jackson admits to a peak lead by above ground factors :
An apparent peak in world oil production could appear if above - ground issues such as war , political change , or intractability in decision making by governments limit upstream investment and activity .
[ The ] model formulated by the late M. King Hubbert fails to recognize that recoverable - reserves estimates evolve with time and are subject to significant change .
What is left unsaid is that these constraints arise from the fact that oil production has peaked in the countries where consumption is higher ( e.g. North America , Europe ) .
In the XXI century oil production is no longer controlled by private owned companies from large consumer countries , but mostly by state owned companies in the countries where production surpluses still exist ( e.g. OPEC ) .
Indeed , recoverable reserves change with time .
Backdated proven plus probable conventional oil reserves have been declining since the early 1980s [ 2 ]
But this focus on reserve numbers misses the main issue : oil production .
A large figure for reserves or resources does not necessarily imply a higher production rate ; take for instance oil shale or oil sands .
Hubbert ’s method
But Dr. Jackson explains his concerns about reserves :
Hubbert ’s method requires accurate knowledge of the ultimate recoverable reserves of an area .
This is the key sentence of this article , Dr. Jackson shows he does n’t know or does n’t understand what the Hubbert method is .
Also known as Hubbert Linearization , this method uses past production data as its sole , the ultimate recoverable reserves is the
Reserve Growth
The focus on reserves continues :
The U.S. Geological Survey , notably , points out that reserves growth accounted for 86 % of total additions to reserves in the United States since 1950 and 86 % of the additions to reserves in the North Sea since 1985 .
These reserves additions are a well known artifact of under - reporting practices used by private owned oil companies in order to avoid taxes .
This is highlighted by the fact that the reported reserves to production ratio ( R/P ) for the United States has been around 10 years since the 1920s [ 4 ]
This argument is itself supportive of the Hubbert method , for both the United States and the United Kingdom are countries where the Hubbert curve models production remarkably well [ 5 ] .
The fact that the method appears to work in some areas and not others suggests it is of limited use and even fundamentally flawed .
There are in fact some countries or producing areas where the Hubbert method cannot be directly applied .
Such is the case when more than one discovery cycle unfolds , which eventually produces an asymmetric production curve .
The political factors referenced before can also constrain production ( e.g. Iran , Russia ) .
There ’s no reason to think that the Hubbert method is flawed in the face of this .
Technology
[ The Hubbert method has ] the underlying premise that technology is static [… ]
Those who believe a peak is imminent tend to consider only proven remaining reserves of conventional oil , which they currently estimate at approximately 1.2 trillion bbl .
Dr. Jackson makes the case that the Hubbert method does not take into account the technological developments that improve oil recovery .
Considering again the cases of the United States and the North Sea , these were areas entirely unconstrained where better technology was readily applied for years ( decades ) .
Still they peaked ; still they followed the Hubbert curve .
Further lack of knowledge on the Hubbert method emanates from Dr. Jackson ’s words .
Beyond insisting that foreknowledge of existing reserves is a precondition to apply the Hubbert curve , a number of 1200 Gb is mistakenly associated with its results .
As stated before , currently the Hubbert method points towards ultimate recoverable reserves of 1000 Gb ( a number also given by other mathematical forecasting techniques ) which is inline with current known proven plus probable reserves of around 800 Gb .
This number of 1200 Gb is not associated with any known forecasting method for conventional oil .
Unconventional Oil
Dr. Jackson then addresses unconventional oil :
Those who believe a peak is imminent [ … ] plays down the importance of unconventional reserves in the Canadian oil sands , the Orinoco tar belt , oil shale , and GTL projects .
So far the arguments have been made around conventional oil , for which the Hubbert method provides an important forecasting tool , as discussed above .
Non-conventional oil has to be modeled separately , for it represents a new cycle in production .
It too can be the subject of a Hubbert - like analysis , in which case it will yield results not very far from those presented by Dr. Jackson .
Unconventional oil is not a factor of disagreement between early and late peakers .
However , there are several factors that prevent unconventional oil from having great impact on the overall production of liquid energy sources : lower recoverable reserves , lower production rates , lower net energy yields , etc .
As seen in Fig. 1 provided by Dr. Jackson , it is the peak in conventional oil production that marks the end of liquids fuels production growth .
If that peak comes sooner , say in the next 5 years like the mathematic models forecast , the lesser the impact unconventional oil will have .
Data
CERA draws both on its own databases and those of its parent company IHS , which has the world ’s most complete proprietary databases on oil production and resources .
Hubbert - posited post - peak reservoir decline - curve assumptions are rebutted by observation that the geometry of typical oilfield production profiles is often distinctly asymmetrical and does not generally show a precipitous mirror - image decline in production after an apparent peak
The peak argument is not presented in the context of a credible systematic evaluation of available data ;
This information is quite relevant , for IHS ’s is also the database used by Dr. Jean Laherrère , one of the prime researchers of the Hubbert curve .
It ’s with this same data that Dr. Laherrère arrives at a figure of 1000 Gb for remaining recoverable reserves for conventional oil , using several mathematical tools , like the Hubbert curve .
Why is Dr. Jackson ’s CERA arriving at different results ?
With what forecasting tools ?
Again Dr. Jackson shows some lack of understanding of the Hubbert method , which is not supposed to model individual field production .
Also , there are no assumptions made on individual field production profiles when it is used .
This is one of the strengths of the Hubbert methodology , it can be used with any underlying individual field profile .
Again the United Kingdom is a good example , where individual fields tend to have highly asymmetrical profiles , with fast growth and slow decline , but the Hubbert curve can be used to effectively model the region as a whole .
Apllying the Hubbert method to the public databases of BP , EIA or even IHS results in a short term peak .
Does Dr. Jackson imply that these databases are not credible ?
Methodology
At base , their methodology is to apply decline curves against currently proven reserves and declare that the game , and the argument , is over .
Oil is too critical to the global economy to allow fear to replace careful analysis about the very real challenges with delivering liquid fuels to meet the needs of growing economies .
With this sentence Dr. Jackson demonstrates even further his lack of understanding of what the Hubbert method is .
This particular description has no relation whatsoever with the curve fitting techniques applied successfully to oil production by the late Dr. M. King Hubbert .
No one will disagree , but it is of at least the same importance to not allow optimism to replace careful analysis .
Final Comments
A short term peak in world wide conventional oil production is a result of several different mathematic techniques : the Hubbert method [ 1 ] , Creaming Curve [ 2 ] , Loglet analysis [ 6 ] , the Generalized Bass Model [ 7 ] , to name a few , using different datasets ( e.g. , EIA , BP , IHS , Wood Mackenzie ) .
All these models point towards a figure for remaining recoverable reserves of 1000 Gb and a production peak for conventional oil in the next 5 to 6 years ; Dr. Jean Laherrère and Prof. Kenneth Deffeyes are two of the excel figures in this area .
Using accounting techniques , country by country [ 8 ] or project by project [ 9 ] , other researchers arrive at similar conclusions .
Dr. Jackson simply presents a number of 3700 Gb , without further detailing the mathematical or accounting techniques used to forecast a peak in world conventional oil production beyond 2030 .
As a follow up to this dialogue , Dr. Jackson is invited to learn and apply the Hubbert method to one of the available world historic production datasets .

Star Trek The Next Generation Turns 20 March 12 , 2007
Posted by showmescifi in scifi
It ’s hard to believe that it has been 20 years since Star Trek The Next Generation ( TNG ) first premiered .
I remember very well the first time I saw the first episode ( Encounter at Farpoint ) thinking man they sure do zoom in alot on that Picard guy , but holy crap Q is cool .
While you ca n’t argue with the fact that Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan really brought back Star Trek as a franchise .
You similarly simply cannot argue that Star Trek TNG is not responsible for the resurrection of Star Trek on TV .
TNG introduced us to androids and klingons on the bridge , a blind ship ’s engineer .
Q , the Borg , the holodeck .
Ferengi and countless other icons that are now staples of the SciFi lexicon .
Two of the best TNG episodes ever are the first episode ( Encounter at Farpoint ) and the very last one , All Good Things Must Come To An End .
It was a show that has held our attention and imaginations for 20 years .
It was also the last Star Trek in which Star Trek creator and visionary Gene Roddenberry had a direct hand .
It ’s unfortunate that it did come to an end , and now with TNG ’s cast no longer in the Star Trek movies it is somewhat sad to think that it has been 20 years since it all began .
It is even sadder given the dismal failure that was Star Trek Enterprise and the disaster in progress known as Star Trek XI .
Perhaps TNG ’s writers did have to right in the end as all good things must come to and end .
Star Trek as The Next Generation officially turns 20 the week of September 28 , 2007 .
Starting from March of 2007 Paramount will start to roll out a new 20th Anniversary logo on the StarTrek.com site as well as on licensed Star Trek products .

動的配列への追加コストはなぜ O( 1 ) ?
動的配列への追加コスト は O(1 ) ってのは覚えていればそれだけの話ですが，どうしてかと言われると意外と難しいものです． というのも , このO(1)ってのは動的配列の実装方法に強く依存しているからです．実装を知っていないと答えられません．一般論として，1つ要素を追加するとき，配列に空きがなかったら新しく配列を作り直して全要素をコピーする必要があります．コピーのコストは
O( n ) だから，追加コストも O( n ) になるという議論が混乱の元になっています．
こういうときは，要素追加を n 回繰り返したときの計算量を n で割った平均をとるという解析方法が使われるそうです．一般に , ある operation C の計算量 を C を n 回行ったときの計算量 O( n ) を n で割った値 O( n ) / n で評価する手法を ならし解析 ( amortized analysis ) と言うそうです．さて，std :: vector や perl の配列といったほとんどの動的配列は，足りなくなったら配列を2倍にしていくという
実装が使われています．このアルゴリズムの「ならし解析」をやってみます.追加を
n 回繰り返したとき，配列を倍々にしていくので，コピー( 再配置) が起きる回数は log n 回です． 各再配置で 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 .. と要素をコピーするので，全体の総和は1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... 2 ^( log n ) = 2 ^ ( log n +
1 ) - 1 =~ 2n となります．コピーが発生しない場合の数は n - log(n ) =~ n 回です ．( log n は無視できる ) .二つを合計すれば，高々 3n の要素がコピーされることになります．これを n で割った値 が
１つの要素を追加するときの平均的な計算量なので，結果として
O( 1 ) が導かれます．一般的に配列サイズを指数的に増やしていけば
O(1 ) になります．動的配列の実装方法は倍々以外にも考えられます．たとえば，固定長
k だけ逐次増やしていく実装の 「
ならし解析」はどうなるでしょうか．再配置が行われる回数 : n/kコピーの要素の数 : k + 2 k + 3 k + ... + n/k * k = k * ( 1 + 2 + ... + n/k ) = k * n/k ( 1 + n/k ) =~ ( n^2)/k1要素の平均計算量 : O ( ( n ^ 2 ) /k ) = O( n/k)なんと!
固定長で増やしていく実装だと，O(n ) になってしまいます．動的配列の要素追加コストが
O(1 ) になるといのは，倍々にしていくという内部の実装があってはじめて言えることです.
逆に言えば，倍々にする理由付けもこの議論から行えます．

I love shoving around large amounts of data .
Unicode is an industry standard for encoding data in most every written script there ’s ever been .
It has over 97,000 characters .
A while ago I read about a guy who made his own Unicode poster and I realized I had an opportunity for a fun project .
I think Unicode is an invaluable and beautiful project , and this is my tribute to it .
Unicode puts out PDF code charts of each and every glyph so people can have some idea of what they should look like ( though the actual display to the user is left up to fonts ) .
If you ’d like to see one , the chart for Linear B is a nice little example .
Because I did n’t want to mess around with putting dozens of PDFs together , I just grabbed the single 30 MB 777 - page PDF for the latest version , 4.1.0 .
( New versions are released as they add more scripts — cuneiform is scheduled for 5.0 , yay ! )
Looking at the PDF ( whether you grabbed the small example or decided to be macho and pulled up the whole thing ) , it ’s obvious that the “ one big table per page ” approach makes it pretty easy to extract the glyphs .
I wrote a program to do this , because it would be stupid and ultimately self - defeating to open the PDF with GIMP to manually select and save each glyph .
First , I used ghostscript to convert the PDF to a series of 600 DPI pngs , one image per page .
This took about 39 minutes and 471MB of disk space .
( I ’ll explain why I converted at such a high resolution in about two paragraphs . )
Next , I wrote a Python script using the Python Imaging Library to analyze every page , locate the glyph table if the page has one , and walk through the table exporting each glyph to its own individual PNG .
The 769MB of individual glyph images took about 5.6 hours to rip .
And that ’s OK !
I kept the code simple to read because performance does n’t matter .
That ’s an odd thing to say for a program that takes hours to finish , but you only ever run this program once .
Note , that ’s never an excuse for shoddy quality , because you never run a program just once .
Yes , those two statements are at odds .
If you do n’t see that they ’re both true , you have not yet learned the Tao of Code .
Well , there ’s one important step elided from the previous paragraph : figuring out which glyph is which so I know what the filename should be .
Every glyph is labeled with a four or five - digit hexadecimal number , but of course the label is part of the image rather than text .
Converting images to text is known as OCR ( optical character recognition ) and it ’s difficult to avoid errors .
In my favor I had images that were big ( 600 DPI , see , I told you I ’d get back to it ) , error - free , and black - and - white ; but a strike against me was that it ca n’t spell - check a word like “ A29C ” .
After trying a few different OCR programs , I got ocrad working well ( with a little tinkering , it often mistook the number 0 for the letter O ) .
Well , mission accomplished .
I ’ve ripped 97,715 glyphs from the Unicode code charts to individual PNGs .
So what should I do with them all ?
I work at Hostway , a web hosting company with about a dozen offices worldwide .
I picked up a copy of our logo in vector format from one of our graphic designers and resized it until it had about the same number of black pixels as I have glyphs .
Then , of course , I wrote another script to render a final image .
It created a huge new image in which every pixel from the source was a downsampled ( because I ’m printing at 300 DPI ) glyph , and it tries to make sure it puts the darkest glyphs in place of the darkest pixel so I have a ( very ) rough antialiasing effect to soften the edges of letters .
( If it ’s not already painfully obvious , yes , I did ascii art as a teenager . )
This script immediately crashed and burned .
The problem is scale .
The source image is 1618 x 151 pixels , and I ’m outputting at 300 DPI : 1618 x 151 x 300 x 300 = 20.9GB .
As cool as it would be , I just do n’t have that much RAM .
I had to break up the image into pieces three feet wide , which is good because that ’s also how wide the biggest printer in the office is .
And I got to write a great error message : “ Ca n’t create images this big .
Reduce max_piece_width or buy more RAM . ”
Made of 16 images totaling 310MB ( it took 45 m ) , the Hostway logo worked out to be 6 feet tall and 46 feet long .
My boss told me it was “ too big ” to hang up .
I told him that was “ exactly the point of the whole thing ” .
I ’ll change his mind yet — everyone in the office I show it to loves it , so it ’s just a matter of time .
I presented the code at the June 2006 meeting of ChiPy and it was well - received .
One attendee told me afterwards it was the funniest , nerdiest presentation he ’s ever seen , which I consider high praise .
As promised , I ’m sharing the source code .

You ’ll have to be a little familiar with graphics and Python to make use
of this .
It is not a copy of all the glyph graphics , and I will not
provide you with them or make posters for you , so please do n’t ask .
I ’d love to hear what about what you do with it , please do something cool and post a comment or trackback .
THERE is a moment at Angkor , the vast complex of ancient temples in the Cambodian jungle , that every visitor hopes for .
Perhaps it comes while passing under a 60 - foot - high gate carved a thousand years ago , or at sunrise when the lotus - like spires are reflected in a placid pool of water .
Or maybe it comes when you encounter a centuries - old tree , growing straight from a sandstone slab and slowly devouring a temple .
These are the moments that John McDermott specializes in .
A 52 - year - old photographer from Little Rock , Ark. , Mr. McDermott may be the Ansel Adams of Angkor .
In the last decade , his photographs have almost become the definitive images of the temples .
His pictures — the silhouette of a stone lion at sunset , monks resting on a windowsill , apsara dancers primping before a performance — are not just beautiful but iconic .
Mr. McDermott did n’t deliberately set out to become the unofficial court photographer of Angkor .
He first visited in 1995 , when he was living in Bangkok .
Back then , the only lodgings were tents and small guesthouses , and few if any tourists traipsed through .
To capture the eerie calm , he had planned his trip to coincide with a total solar eclipse .

“ The light does really funny things during an eclipse , ” he said .
“ First of all , it ’s devoid of color , becomes monochromatic , sort of platinum .
And then it ripples and does unusual things , so the whole setting becomes quite surreal ” — as if Angkor Wat , with its graciously decaying walls and bas - relief depictions of Buddhist hell , was n’t surreal enough already .
A Japanese tourist poses with Sydney Harbor in the background in a file photo .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The best tourists in the world are the Japanese , followed by Americans and the Swiss , a survey based on views from hoteliers across Europe said Wednesday .
Japanese tourists stood out for being polite and tidy , securing 35 percent more votes than the Americans who came second .
Swiss tourists were commended for being quiet and considerate , unlike the Britons who were judged to be the fifth worst tourists because of rude behavior , noise and a miserly attitude to tipping .
But despite their faults , hoteliers do look favorably upon British spending habits voting them the third biggest holiday spenders after Americans and Russians .
Based on responses from 15,000 European hoteliers , the survey carried out on behalf of travel Web site Expedia showed that the worst tourist nation was France , followed by India , China and Russia .
Britain was second in the worst - dressed tourist table which was headed by the Americans , and fifth in the least - generous table which was headed by the Germans .
Hello Professor Mankiw , I am a second - year economics student at the University of California , Davis .
I was wondering if you could share your opinion on the career options provided by a Ph.D in economics compared to those of an M.B.A. , particularly with regards to earning potential .
Historically I have preferred business school for its good " bang for the buck , " but lately I have thought that immediate graduate school might be my best option , given the relative strengths and weaknesses of my track record ( i.e. , stronger academics than work experience ) .
Could you tell me which option you would prefer in my position ?
You do n't have to make any sort of absolute , unequivocal statement , but I appreciate any advice you can offer .
Thank you very much for your time .
Sincerely ,

A blog reader asks for advice : I believe that from a purely financial standpoint , an MBA is a better investment than a PhD .
An MBA is only a two - year program , whereas a PhD is typically four to six years .
The extra time for a PhD probably not yield the extra income needed to make it a good investment of your time .
A typical Harvard MBA gets a starting salary a bit over $ 100 K ; the typical econ PhD does not start much higher than that .
But the issue is not entirely pecuniary .
The question you should be asking yourself is what kind of job you want to have when you conclude your education .
A PhD makes sense if you want to consider the possibility of being an academic .
You may pursue a PhD and then decide along the way to pursue a different path than being a professor .
That is okay : Many PhD students leave for the private sector when they are done with their degrees , and they get very good jobs there .
But if you are sure from the beginning that you want some kind of private - sector job , then the MBA is probably the better route .

Mr Spock 's green blood is down to copper
The man emulated Star Trek 's Mr Spock - the Enterprise 's science officer who supposedly had green Vulcan blood .
In this case , the unusual colour of the 42 - year - old 's blood was down to the migraine medication he was taking .
The man 's leg surgery went ahead successfully and his blood returned to normal once he had eased off the drug .
Dark green
The patient had been taking large doses of sumatriptan - 200 milligrams a day .
This had caused a rare condition called sulfhaemoglobinaemia , where sulphur is incorporated into the oxygen - carrying compound haemoglobin in red blood cells .
Describing the case in the Lancet , the doctors , led by Dr Alana Flexman from St Paul 's Hospital , Vancouver , wrote : " The patient recovered uneventfully , and stopped taking sumatriptan after discharge .
" When seen five weeks after his last dose , he was found to have no sulfhaemoglobin in his blood . "
The man had needed urgent surgery because he had developed a dangerous condition in his legs after falling asleep in a sitting position .
The surgeons performed urgent fasciotomies - limb - saving procedures which involve making surgical incisions to relieve pressure and swelling caused by the man 's condition , known as compartment syndrome .
In compartment syndrome , the swelling and pressure in a restricted space limits blood flow and causes localised tissue and nerve damage .
It is commonly caused by trauma , internal bleeding or a wound dressing or cast being too tight .
According to the science fantasy television series Star Trek , Mr Spock had green blood because the oxygen - carrying agent in Vulcan blood includes copper , rather than iron , as is the case in humans .
Mr Spock had a human mother , and Vulcan father , from whom he inherited his inability to make sense of human emotion , as well as his green blood .

Word から印刷するのが一番きれいだと思います 。
基本的に Java などの経験があって関数型はよく知らないという人向けですが、関数型言語既習者でも
Erlang 特有の考え方で新鮮な部分がいくつかあると思います。特にエラー処理の考え方
（ Let it Fail） の部分は面白くて、例えば gen_tcp : listen という関数が成否とソケットをまとめてタプルで返すとしたら
{ok , ListenSocket} = gen_tcp: listen ( 8080 , [ binary ] )
としてしまう（ok は定数で ListenSocket は変数）。これで成否が ok でなかった場合はマッチングエラーになるけれどもそれでよくて、特に追加でエラー処理のコードを書こうとするなと。OCaml とかでも let による束縛は実際にはパターンマッチなので左辺に定数を書くことは不可能ではないけれどもあまりやらないような気がします（少なくともコンパイラは警告をだす）。
他にも代入の一切ないコードでプロセスを使ってオブジェクト指向をやるところとかは成程と思えると思います。
入門ドキュメントとして不満な部分も若干ありますが（例えば後半に行くにつれて「やり方だけ示して実際のコードは提示しない」という割合が増えていくとか。しかし文書のメジャーバージョンがまだ

AS DANIEL JONES walked through Circular Quay and towards the ferry terminal 12 nights ago , someone called his name .
Mr Jones , an outspoken 20 - year - old student activist , turned to face a man he had never met .
Smiling and wearing a blue bomber jacket , the man introduced himself simply as Ahmed .
Ahmed , with a beard and receding dark hair , said he was from intelligence at NSW Police and had an offer to make .
He wanted the student to spy on his fellow activists before the APEC meeting in September .
In return Ahmed implied he could help " make arrangements " about charges Mr Jones faces over his part in last year 's G20 protests in Melbourne .
The approach is the latest example of action taken by the authorities to monitor and
Due to the enormous impact that credit reports have on the ability of an individual to get a loan , the United States government has made it possible for every citizen to obtain a free copy of their credit report every twelve months .
This free credit report was given a great deal of attention over the past few years , and thus many people are at least peripherally aware of the ability to get a free credit report .
FreeCreditReport.com is advertising heavily on television lately , promising to give you this free credit report just by visiting their site .
This seems appropriate , right ?
After all , everyone gets a free credit report … so we just go to FreeCreditReport.com and get it …
Do n’t .
Instead of giving you the free credit report that is promised by the FTC , FreeCreditReport.com actually requires you to sign up for a program called Triple Advantage , a credit monitoring program that costs $ 12.95 a month .
This service merely emails you if there is a change to your credit report at a very hefty cost , particularly when the government gives you a credit report for free every year .
Do n’t like that option ?
Well , you could instead just pay Experian $ 14.95 to give you your credit report instead … or , even better , pay $ 40 and get your report from all three credit agencies .
If you just want to see your credit report , do n’t visit FreeCreditReport.com unless you want to pay for something that the FTC has already guaranteed you for free .
So how do I actually get my free credit report ?
Take a peek at the FTC ’s page on the topic .
The actual place to go for the free credit report from the federal government is annualcreditreport.com .
This is the only site that will actually be able to give you your report without either allowing others to have access to the report or being required to buy other products .
Interestingly , this information is actually stated on the front page of FreeCreditReport.com , but it ’s done in tiny blue text on a blue background that makes it almost impossible to read .
Coincidence ?
What do you think ?
By Sarah Rainsford
BBC News , Turkey
In eastern Turkey family honour is all - important .
People are killed because of it and so - called blood money is paid to restore it .
One former butcher is dedicating his life to resolving feuds and ending family vendettas .
I met Metin in a funeral parlour in Diyarbakir .
Metin and his father seek help
Metin was in his twenties - and in serious trouble .
He had violated the strict code of honour that rules much of south - eastern Turkey , and he knew he was lucky to be alive .
Eighteen months ago , Metin married .
He had kidnapped the girl he loved because he could not afford a dowry .
The couple have since had a baby but the bride 's brothers are after them .
They believe killing the couple will cleanse the family honour .
As he told me his sorry tale , Metin 's eyes brimmed with tears of desperation .
At one point he rounded on his elderly father , half deaf and stooped over a walking stick .
" I had to steal her , " Metin wailed in accusation .
" You never gave me any money for a dowry - you never even sent me to school ! "
His poor father looked like he had been punched in the stomach - and I gulped back a lump in my own throat .
" I have not got any money , " he protested , " or I 'd have given it to you . "
Peace mission
Luckily for Metin , what his father did have was an idea .
He brought his son into town to visit the man locals here have nicknamed the " President of Peace " .
A funeral parlour is the HQ for Sait's ( centre ) peace mission
The district funeral parlour is now an unofficial headquarters for his peace missions : a spacious hall lined with sofas , and with a never - ending supply of sweet , soothing tea .
Sait is actually a butcher by trade , but he handed his shops over to his sons six years ago to devote himself full - time to peace .
Since then he says he has resolved more than 400 feuds .
According to ancient tradition here , if a man is killed his soul cannot be at peace until blood has been cleansed with blood .
That tradition is clearly still strong .
The sofas in Sait 's office were filled with men , seeking his mediation .
Yusuf was there to beg Sait for help , after one of his relatives killed a man in a fist fight .
Now his entire family is in fear and in hiding - waiting for the other side to take revenge .
Mehmet 's son was sent to prison for killing a man - but the victim 's family demanded their own form of justice .
So Mehmet had to flee town with his entire family , tearing them from their land , and their income .
Sait told me he sees little sign that modernisation is having much impact on attitudes in this neglected , mainly Kurdish corner of the country .
It is a place where social pressure is nothing to do with having the latest gadget or label .
Here it can be a matter of life or death .
Clan - based society
A sociologist I tracked down in Diyarbakir smiled at my efforts to understand what drives these bloody vendettas .
Sait has devoted himself to mediating between feuding families
" If you have a blood feud in your family and you do n't take revenge , no - one will talk to you because you are dishonourable , " Mazilar explained .
" It 's thought you have a problem and you are afraid to deal with it . "
I could really feel that pressure when Sait took us to meet one of the families he is working with .
The men were out on the terrace as we arrived , a row of solemn faces on blue plastic chairs .
They are still mourning the death of their relative Hamza .
The unwritten local rule says his family should take blood in revenge for his shooting .
I got the distinct impression at least one brother was itching to do so , but Sait the peacemaker had stepped in and the killing is on hold .
Truce
Now Sait is shuttling between the two families , attempting to negotiate conditions for peace .
Sait oversees a truce and a handshake of peace
Until he succeeds though , whether that takes a week or a year , the killer 's family has to stay indoors .
Venturing out would be seen as a provocation and - Hamza 's brother told me openly - in that case , he would have to kill .
It could have been a deeply depressing visit to Diyarbakir - but before I left , there was one uplifting moment .
Sait invited us to watch as the hapless Metin was reconciled with the father of his stolen bride .
The peacemaker had promised to find funds himself to help Metin make his bride an honest wife .
As that news sunk in - young Metin 's whole body seemed to unwind .
He smiled for the first time since we had met and happily pulled out a photograph of his baby boy .
The truce will remain precarious until the day the money comes through .
But for Metin it does seem that the patient negotiations of Sait's President of Peace may have just paid off .

OAKLAND , Calif. , May 31 — For Mary Kalin- Casey , it was never about her cat .
Ms. Kalin-Casey , who manages an apartment building here with her husband , John Casey , was a bit shaken when she tried a new feature in Google ’s map service called Street View .
She typed in her address and the screen showed a street - level view of her building .
As she zoomed in , she could see Monty , her cat , sitting on a perch in the living room window of her second - floor apartment .
“ The issue that I have ultimately is about where you draw the line between taking public photos and zooming in on people ’s lives , ” Ms. Kalin - Casey said in an interview Thursday on the front steps of the building .
“ The next step might be seeing books on my shelf .
If the government was doing this , people would be outraged . ”
Her husband quickly added , “ It ’s like peeping . ”
Ms. Kalin-Casey first shared her concerns about the service in an e-mail message to the blog Boing Boing on Wednesday .
Since then , the Web has been buzzing about the privacy implications of Street View — with varying degrees of seriousness .
Several sites have been asking users to submit interesting images captured by the Google service , which offers panoramic views of miles of streets around San Francisco , New York , Las Vegas , Miami and Denver .
On a Wired magazine blog , for instance , readers can vote on the “ Best Urban Images ” that others find in Street View .
On Thursday afternoon , a picture of two young women sunbathing in their bikinis on the Stanford campus in Palo Alto , Calif . , ranked near the top .
Another showed a man scaling the front gate of an apartment building in San Francisco .
The caption read , “ Is he breaking in or has he just locked himself out ? ”
Those clever folks at the MIT Media Lab have done it again .
This I/ O brush looks like what I think of as the kind of brush men used to use for shaving , but it picks up color , texture , and movement of any brushed surface .
Sound amazing ?
It is .
According to the Media Lab I / O brush web site , they 're looking into a consumer version .
What do you think a system like this would cost ?
I 'm thinking it would n't actually be that expensive .
Existing monitors could be adapted for touch screen .
There 's a camera , a couple of LEDs , and two touch sensors .
None of that 's particularly expensive , I do n't think .
I 'll be in line for this , that 's for sure :)
Via Iowa Independent :
Former U.S. Sen .
Mike Gravel , D - Alaska , is running , at age 76 and after years out of the public arena , the longest of long - shot candidacies for the presidency .
With his colorful confrontations of other Democratic candidates during a recent debate in South Carolina , Gravel has generated some buzz in the liberal blogosphere — and he even earned some time with MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews .
Gravel conducted a one - on - one , 45 minute conversation with Iowa Independent fellow Douglas Burns .
Iowa Independent :
When I watched the debate the other night , and do n’t take this the wrong way , but you seem awfully angry for a 76 - year - old .
Why are you so angry ?
Is TIOBE Fatally Flawed ?
update : As Bogdy mentions in the comments , my reasoning here was based on false assumptions .
It still seems clear that ranking APL above Haskell , along with other anomalies , disqualifies TIOBE for any serious purpose , at least past the top ten or so languages .
My rankings should be ignored , though .
During a debate at work about using Haskell for a project , a coworker pointed out that Haskell is ranked # 41 on the TIOBE .
On further investigation , things look really fishy .
Common interpretations of TIOBE include the amount of “ community ” , “ buzz ” , or “ excitement ” around a language .
By none of these standards can APL reasonably edge out Haskell .
I dug further .
Summary of findings : the TIOBE is severely broken .
It is falling victim to the fact that search engines grossly overestimate their number of results .
For example , if I search Google for “ haskell programming ” , as TIOBE does , the resulting page proudly estimates 44,500 results .
However , if I click through the results , I hit the end of the list after only 652 .
Nice for marketing Google , perhaps , but it seems the estimate was rather poor .
Similar things happen with other languages .
TIOBE , despite using several search engines , seems to correlate well with Googles estimated ( i.e. , phony ) number of results .
It correlates very badly with the actual number of results .
Here ’s my corrected TIOBE list , built only from the top 50 languages in the original list .
In order to comply with Google ’s terms of service , I painstakingly did this by hand ; so I did n’t go any further .
There are some things that are initially surprising ; but some thought indicates they may be reasonably expected .
Languages near the top tend to be those that are somewhat old ( more time to write about them ) or commonly used – past or present – in business and / or the academic world .
That ’s because these languages have a reason to have a lot of web pages written about them .
One example : Prolog clearly is n’t a commonly used language nor one with a lot of community , but it ’s taught by just about every computer science department in the world ’s “ programming languages ” intro courses , because they feel better including something besides imperative and functional languages .
Hence , it ’s been written about a lot .
One can see the effect of the “ big community ” effect though , if only in languages that appear above where you ’d expect to see them .
I also split Lisp / Scheme into Lisp and Scheme separately , and dropped Natural because Googling for “ natural programming ” turned up more irrelevant results than relevant ones .
Without further delay , the “ Chris ” update to the TIOBE list .

The Scout
Synopsis : Albert Brooks is a scout who finds Brendan Fraser ( Steve Nebraska ) in Mexico .
Steve can throw and hit and run like nobody ’s business .
Yankees , contract , playoffs , blah blah blah .
Hilarity does not ensue .
Sins committed : Turning Brendan Fraser into a caricature of a caricature of a baseball player .
Giving Albert Brooks a job as a scout .
Giving Brendan Fraser a 112 MPH fastball .
Making Ozzie Smith — a career .262 hitter — the climactic character in Steve ’s quest to throw an 81 - pitch game ( all fastballs , of course ) .
Redeeming qualities :
At one point Steve makes a tortilla - face mask by biting holes in it to give it eyes and a mouth .
That ’s about it .
How it could have worked :
If Steve had Bert Blyleven ’s curveball , Nolan Ryan ’s fastball , and Johan Santana ’s changeup and was pitching a perfect game instead of an impossible game .
Also , no helicopters .
The Air Up There
Synopsis : Kevin Bacon plays a former NCAA star and NBA prospect who blew out his knee and is now a college basketball assistant who goes to Kenya to recruit a player he sees in the background of a video .
Sins committed : Trying to make us believe that Kevin Bacon , a guy who ’s maybe pushing 5 ’ 10 ” ( Ed. note : Mr. Bacon claims to be 5 ' 11 " ) , is a former NBA prospect .
Using the same “ blew out his knee ” premise as “ The Mighty Ducks . ”
The African tribes featured in the movie use a basketball game to settle land disputes .
The movie ’s premise is as thin as the simile you ’re in the middle of reading .
Redeeming qualities : Bacon ’s costar , Charles Gitonga Maina Ngatia was a nice surprise .
A nun says a curse word , too .
How it could have worked : Cast someone who was n’t in “ Footloose ” as the star .
Flip the premise around , having the tribe trying to get the college to recruit their talented player for the tribe 's benefit rather than having the college recruit the player for the college 's benefit .
The Cutting Edge
Synopsis : Can a former hockey player tame a firebrand figure skater ?
Olympics , here we come .
Sins committed :
It ’s about figure skating and blowing out knees .
Or eyes , or whatever the hell happened to the hockey player .
He got what he deserved .
Redeeming qualities : Some of the skating scenes are nice .
You can get brownie points for watching it with the girlfriend .
A League Of Their Own
Less figure skating , more blowing .
Synopsis : Girls play baseball because men are storming the beach at Normandy .
Also , Geena Davis is a sex symbol and her sister Tank Girl is a brat .
Sins committed : Rosie O’Donnell , Madonna and Jon Lovitz have significant roles in this movie .
It ’s forty - eight minutes too long .
“ This Used to Be My Playground ” is inexplicably the theme song for the movie .
The tone can be described as , “ Whininess with a hint of Lovitz . ”
Davis comes back for the final game of the playoffs after leaving her team in the lurch , suits up , and goes on to purposely throw the game so that her sister - the same sister Davis forced her team to trade away - feels good about herself .
She drops the fucking ball .
She ’s , like , 6 ’ 8 ” 230 and her sister ’s 5 ’ 1 ” 105 .
No way .
Redeeming qualities : Tom Hanks writes on a child ’s souvenir baseball , “ Avoid the clap , Jimmy Dugan . ”
Jon Lovitz says the words “ pickle tickle . ”
How it could have worked : Davis ’s whiny fucking sister could have gotten knocked cold when they collide at the plate and Davis could have not dropped the ball .
Davis could call for a pitch up in the zone again to strike her stupid - ass sister out .
They could have decided not to make the movie at all .
That would have worked for me .
Eddie
Synopsis : I prefer not to .
Sins committed :
All of them .
Redeeming qualities : None .
How it could have worked :
If they did n’t make it .
Fever Pitch
Synopsis : Jimmy Fallon sure does love the Red Sox .
Drew Barrymore sure does love her job .
Jimmy Fallon sure does love Drew Barrymore so long as she ’s not interfering with the Red Sox .
There is sex somewhere in there , too .
And Johnny Damon .
But not both at the same time ( Thank you God / Moses / Jesus / Mohammed [ pbuh ] / Vishnu / Buddha / Zoroaster / Ra and so forth ) .
Sins committed : Putting Jimmy Fallon in a movie .
Remaking a British movie adapted from a British novel about soccer into an American movie adapted from the same British book about baseball .
Walking on the field as the Red Sox won their first world series since before Warren Gamaliel Harding was in office .
Voice over at the end that tidies up the movie .
Redeeming qualities : “ The Wedding Singer ” version of Drew Barrymore showed up , and she is cute .
Jimmy Fallon only has about one - half of the lines in the movie , which means about one - half of it is watchable .
How it could have worked : Force Jimmy Fallon to take acting classes .
Use the source material rather than just nicking its title .
The Babe
Synopsis : Babe Ruth was a god among men and a real jerk - off .
Sins committed : Focusing only on the terrible qualities of The Great Bambino .
Wasting John Goodman in a role that is curiously one - dimensional given the reverence that exists for Babe Ruth .
Redeeming qualities : Most of the baseball scenes were filmed at Wrigley .
How it could have worked :
The writer could have written Babe Ruth in a manner similar to Mickey Mantle in “ 61 * , ” flawed but having redeeming qualities .
Amazing Grace and Chuck
Synopsis : Kid wo n’t pitch anymore because of nuclear weapons .
Boston Celtics star Amazing Grace Smith concurs .
Then a bunch of other people do , and then Amazing Grace dies .
Oh , and somehow this makes the USA and USSR disarm .
Sins committed : Giving Alex English an acting job and calling him “ Amazing Grace Smith . ”
Pretending that the powers that be in DC and Moscow somehow care what children do .
Wasting Atticus
Finch in a maudlin anti-war movie that is completely divorced from reality .
The fact that I had to watch this movie in a required home economics class in 7th grade .
Creating a world in which the US and Soviet Russia agree to nuclear disarmament — you know France would get cocky if that happened , and we do n’t need snooty Frenchmen pointing their atomic bombs at us .
Redeeming qualities : Gregory Peck is great , of course .
Jamie Lee Curtis is in her “ Trading Places ” prime .
Celtic Pride
If everyone wants to get rid of nuclear weapons , that ’s great .
I ’m all for it .
But if the president decides to get rid of nuclear weapons because Alex English quits playing basketball and kids decide not to speak , I ’m a little concerned that this could be a tactical error .
Perhaps if the movie ended with the protest having no effect whatsoever , it might have been palatable .
I do n't want to be cynical .
I mean , I believe the children are our future .
So long as we teach them well , we can let them lead the way .
We just have to , you know , show them all the beauty they possess inside .
Synopsis : Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd love the Celtics and Damon Wayans plays for the Jazz and they ’re in the NBA Finals and they get Damon Wayans drunk and sort of kidnap him and then who the hell cares .
Sins committed : Casting Damon Wayans as a professional basketball player .
Getting around trademarks by having Marv Albert call the NBA Finals the “ NBA World Championship ” in his announcing .
Having Damon
Wayans make fun of Dan Aykroyd ’s character because he ’s a plumber , which makes Wayans even less likable , if that is possible .
Larry Bird and Deion Sanders both have cameos .
Redeeming qualities : Aykroyd ’s character Jimmy : " This drink is called Jimmy ’s dick .
It ’s short , fat , but it fills the gap . ”
While I was watching it , I was thinking of a good episode of “ The Wonder Years , ” and I was probably thinking that because of Daniel Stern .
How it could have worked :
It could have been funny .
Somehow , the same guy who wrote this steaming pile , Judd Apatow , also wrote “ The 40 - year - old Virgin . ”
Maybe it would have been funnier if Steve Carrell played the Damon Wayans character .
His hairy manimal chest would have looked great in the scoop neck Utah Jazz jersey .
Summer Catch
Synopsis :
Guy wants to play baseball for a living , gets a shot in the Cape Cod League , and decides to walk off the mound during a no- hitter in order to catch a girl before she leaves on a plane for San Francisco , as though people do n’t have telephones .
Sins committed :
The aforementioned no -hitter decision .
The fact that the scouts give him a $ 75,000 signing bonus even though he quit on his team with two outs left in his no-hitter .
Forcing us to envision a world where Freddie Prinze , Jr. is a baseball player .
Redeeming qualities : Jessica Biel .
Brittany Murphy is rather cute as well .
Matthew Lillard is occasionally funny .
How it could have worked :
He could have finished his stupid no-hitter .
It ’s only , like , 5 minutes .
Just pitch quickly , and it ’ll be over .
Maybe she ’s gone , maybe she ’s not , but at least he finished it .
Disagree ?
Have other suggestions ?
Make yourself known in the comments , sucker .
Story Highlights •
Female pilots successfully completed same tests as Mercury men in early 1960s
• Doctor says the women were as good as the men , if not better
• They never got a chance to go to space
• Women argued their case before Congress but their efforts failed
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
Nearly half a century ago , 13 female pilots proved they were as fit to go into space as the men who became immortalized as America 's first astronauts , the Mercury 7 .
The women underwent the same intensive medical tests , at the same Albuquerque , New Mexico , clinic , administered by the same staff , as the men did two years earlier .
" When you put them next to the men , they were as good or better , " recalled Dr. Donald Kilgore , who helped test both the men and women between 1959 and 1961 at the Lovelace Clinic .
( Watch the women describe the medical tests they underwent )
What was the women 's biggest obstacle ?
" Ovaries , " said Kilgore .
" The world just was n't ready at that time . "
On Saturday , the " Mercury 13 " women received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh at its commencement .
" While the Mercury 13 did not get their shot at space -- at least not yet -- they refused to let someone else trim their dreams .
They fought for what they wanted , what they believed in , and spoke out against discrimination , " said keynote speaker Martha Ackmann , author of " The Mercury 13 : The Untold Story of Thirteen American Women and the Dream of Space Flight . "
Recognition has been slow in coming , but in recent years the women have been honored by the Adler Planetarium , Women in Aviation International as well as their state aviation halls of fame .
An exhibition about their tests is now on display at the International Women 's Air and Space Museum in Cleveland , Ohio .
Ace pilots
The 13 included Jerrie Cobb , Gene Nora Jessen , Wally Funk , Irene Leverton , Myrtle " K " Cagle , Jane Hart , Jerri Truhill , Rhea Hurrle Woltman , Sarah Ratley , Bernice " B " Steadman , Jean Hixson , Jan Dietrich and Marion Dietrich , Jan 's twin .
( Learn more about the Mercury 13 ) .
" We proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that women could do it , " said Truhill , now 78 .
" It just took NASA 30 years . "
Her fellow " girls , " as Truhill calls the pilots , range in age from late - 60s to 85 .
Marion Dietrich and Jean Hixson have died .
It was Cobb , Truhill 's friend from air races , who first attracted the interest of Dr. Randy Lovelace .
By 1960 , the 28 - year - old Cobb had set four world aviation records for speed , distance and absolute altitude .
Lovelace was chairman of NASA 's Special Life Sciences Committee and had helped draw up the criteria for NASA 's first astronaut candidates .
He had heard that Russia was considering sending a woman into space .
Women were physically smaller , lighter and would take up less oxygen than men .
The question was : Could they withstand the psychological and physical stresses of space ?
In a private effort , Lovelace decided to put Cobb through all phases of the Mercury astronaut tests to find out how women held up .
She so impressed Lovelace that he wanted to find out :
Was she a fluke , or were women as viable as men to be space capsule candidates ?
With Cobb's help , Lovelace recruited another 25 female pilots to undergo the same tests .
Twelve passed " with flying colors , " said Kilgore .
Ice water was injected into their ear canals to induce vertigo .
They swallowed rubber tubes to test their stomach acid .
For a sensory isolation test , they were submerged in water and darkness .
Blood was drawn , stools were counted .
And there were all those enemas .
" They emptied you out , " said Gene Nora Jessen .
" They did lots and lots of X - rays .
I do n't know how we do n't have cancer . "
Cobb would refer to herself and the finalists of this first round of testing as FLATS , for " First Lady Astronaut Trainees . "
Program canceled
Once the women were past the physical tests , they were invited to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola , Florida , for flight tests .
This second phase of testing would address NASA 's requirement that an astronaut must be a military test pilot , and for the women it represented a taste of what was unattainable .
A military test pilot had to have graduated from one of the test pilot schools , and enrollment of females into U.S. military academies was still nearly 15 years away .
Days before reporting to Pensacola , the women received telegrams that their program had been canceled .
Cagle recalls crying about the news : " My husband said , ' Honey , look how close you came .
Look at who did n't make it . ' "
Kilgore said that while there was no official intent to put women in the space program , Lovelace thought he could do the tests and prove the women qualified .
His position with NASA " meant that he was in the position to send recommendations , " Kilgore said .
He never got that far ; the Navy said no .
Efforts by Cobb and Hart to get women included in NASA went as far as Capitol Hill in 1962 , where they testified on behalf of the Mercury 13 women at congressional hearings .
The efforts failed , and less than a year later , Russia launched Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman in space .
Not until 1983 -- more than 20 years later -- did the United States send its first woman , Sally Ride , into space .
Giant American data peddler ChoicePoint last week unveiled a new system in the United Kingdom for analyzing the thousands of license plate numbers collected by automated cameras nestled surreptitiously throughout the English heather .
Called the " analyst's workstation " and designed by i2 , a Choice Point - owned company , the system interfaces with three major databases and uses license plate information to help cops bust bad guys .
Say a passerby spots a suspicious green lorry idling near the scene of a burglary and gets a partial read on the tags .
The workstation can call up a list of matching vehicles in the area .
If John Smith , the notorious bandit , was rolling through the neighborhood in his green 2001 Ford Windstar at the time , the police now have a good suspect .
The last time we mentioned ChoicePoint in connection with license plate reading ( LPR ) technology , we got a stern reprimand from corporate flack Chuck Jones , who took issue with our quoting an
LPR expert opining that ChoicePoint , which already harvests extensive personal info from the government , might one day find a use for trading in LPR data .
" To be clear , Choice Point does not obtain or sell – and is not interested in obtaining and selling – license plate information collected from license plate reading ( LPR ) equipment , better known as traffic or red light cameras .
ChoicePoint is not in the business of monitoring the daily location of consumers . "
\–Chuck Jones
In a follow - up e-mail , Jones said Choice Point would never be interested in such a market .
Our LPR expert tends to disagree .
To be clear ourselves , when reached by phone in Cambridge , i2 spokeswoman Sarah
Cooper said i2 does not obtain or sell LPR data .
No word yet on when or if the analyst 's workstation will reach American shores .

The gay left voices the usual whines about gays becoming conservative and losing their edge now that we have some modicum of equality in one state .
Yes , gay culture will undoubtedly and is undoubtedly becoming more mainstream .
So what ?
No one 's stopping anyone , gay or straight , from being as radical and as subversive as they want .
Is n't it funny how the Christianist right and the queer left are both upset - but for diametrically different reasons ?
The Christianists think that gay marriage will undermine straight marriage - even though divorce rates have fallen to historic lows in the gay marriage era .
Leftists fear that without oppression , they will have no politics left - even though gay people are now far more openly represented across the political spectrum .
Both extremes , I think , are wrong .
Gay culture has a very vibrant and diverse future ahead of it - right , left , radical , conformist and everything in between .
And straight families will be much stronger for bringing their gay sons and daughters into a full and respectful embrace .
Which reminds me .
I have a frigging wedding to plan .

Top state schools could face a barrage of compensation claims for cherry - picking the brightest pupils .
Parents will challenge the widespread use of " backdoor " selection techniques that are favouring middle - class high - fliers .
The prospect follows a damning official ruling against one of the most prestigious comprehensives in the country - Lady Margaret School in South - West London .
It was found to be flouting national admissions rules by using " unfair and subjective " criteria as well as misusing entrance tests meant to ensure it had a mixed - ability intake .
Local government ombudsman Tony Redmond highlighted " very serious faults " .
He ordered the former grammar school in Parsons Green to pay £ 500 compensation each to two sets of parents who complained their children had been unfairly turned down in September 2005 .
The school was also told to offer the children places .
The decision raises the prospect of similar challenges to over - subscribed schools around the country .
Lady Margaret , an all - girls Church of England school which receives 600 applications a year for 90 places - is regularly among the top five comprehensives for GCSE and Alevel results .
Mr Redmond 's report says it used extensive background details on applicants - ranging from their attendance record at primary school to their family holidays and hobbies - when deciding places .
It also insisted on meetings with prospective parents - another breach of the rules .
Applicants were required to write personal statements , including paragraphs on family , pets , hobbies and holidays .
Mr Redmond said this was " very likely to have favoured the more articulate family and the more able child " .
University research has suggested as many as one in four secondary schools operate " selection by stealth " , often using tactics that breach the Government admissions code .
Methods include giving priority to children of school staff or former pupils and to those who state the school as first choice .
Ministers have introduced a tougher admissions regime from September 2008 which threatens to catch out many more schools unless they carry out urgent reforms .
Lady Margaret - where pundit Janet Street Porter was a pupil - said it was conducting a full - scale review of admissions and considering introducing a lottery to replace many of its current criteria .
Chairman of governors Richard Waterhouse said Mr Redmond 's recommendations would be considered and added : " The new admissions policies required in 2008 will remove a lot of pressure from governing bodies . "
Mr Redmond 's report showed that the school had been flouting admissions rules for years .
He said he had found " some of the most extensive problems and flaws with school admissions criteria that I have seen " .
In common with growing numbers of over - subscribed schools , Lady Margaret had introduced a banded admissions system to ensure it has a " genuinely comprehensive " intake .
Pupils are placed in bands on the basis of results in ability tests and schools are required in law to take representative numbers from each band .
But the ombudsman found the governors were prepared to allow 27 per cent to be taken from the highest group and only 18 per cent from the lowest .
Between 2003 and 2005 , some 17 per cent of pupils were admitted from the top band and only 12 per cent from the bottom .
The school was also found to be exceeding its legal quota of pupils scoring highest in English and maths ability tests .
The Department for Education concluded during the investigation that the arrangements were " not in accordance with the legal requirement " and " unacceptable " .
Pupils applying for one of 50 " church " places - allocated on the basis of commitment to the Anglican faith - were required to fill in questionnaires spelling how they practice their faith .
Mr Redmond said : " Although the governors deny this was the case , it is possible the questionnaire may give an indication of factors other than knowledge of the Christian faith and could thus favour the more able child . "
Uptime is a measure of the time a computer system has been “ up ” and running .
Uptime is a great measure of how good a Web hosting provider is at keeping their systems up and running .
If a hosting provider has a high uptime percentage , then that means that their servers stay up and running and so any site you host with them should stay up and running too .
Since
Web pages can't keep customers if they are down , uptime is very important .
There are 2 types of uptime in web hosting industry .
One is the Network Uptime , and the other one is Server Uptime .
Network uptime is talking about the availability of the network , which including the network within the data center and the connection out to the Internet .
Network is usually very stable , so a lot of web hosting service providers would like to give you a guarantee on it .
And server uptime refers to the availability of your web hosting server from outside the data center .
This will directly determine how possible your site will be accessed without any problem .
Considering the fact that most uptime guarantees are given on a monthly basis , if your website was down 10 % of the time , it means if was down for about 3 days .
If you run a decently visited website a 10 % downtime costs you ( in loses ) way more that the monthly cost of web hosting .
Searching for a 99 % uptime guarantee hosting provider is not an easy work on web .
As there are a lot of companies who says they offer 100 % uptime guarantee which is not possible .
So , do n't go with their promotion offers which are made to market their product .
Uptime is a reflection of how long the machine that is running your website stays up and running .
But that machine can be up and working and your website down .
If you are n't maintaining the Web server software ( and other software like PHP and databases ) for your site , you should make sure that your hosting agreement includes guarantees for the software running time as well as hardware uptime .

Some polling centres saw just a trickle of voters
Turnout for the vote was 27 % , the justice ministry said , although some independent groups put it at 5 % .
The country 's main opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood , boycotted the vote and criticised the amendments as paving the way for a police state .
A senior Muslim Brotherhood official said the result was forged .
The 34 constitutional amendments include a ban on the creation of political parties based on religion , and sweeping security powers .
The government says the changes will deepen democracy , but opponents say it will be easier to rig future elections .
OFFICIAL RESULTS 9,701,833 people voted , 27.1 % of the country 's 35,865,660 eligible voters ' Yes ' vote 75.9 % , ' no ' vote 24.1 %
President Hosni Mubarak hailed the result on Monday .
" The people are the real winners in this referendum .
What has been achieved does not represent the end of the road , " he said .
Mr Mubarak promised further political , economic and social reforms but gave no specific details .
Mohamed Habib , the deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood , said the government had made up the referendum result .
" It is 100 % forged ...
They are lying , " he told the Reuters news agency .
Sweeping powers
Under Egyptian election laws , a low turnout does not affect the outcome , as a simple majority of votes cast is required for victory .
Even before the official results were announced , the government papers were celebrating a successful referendum , BBC Cairo correspondent Heba Saleh says .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We have no democracy in Egypt .
It is already a police state .
Osama , Fujairah
Send us your comments
Their front pages gloat about what they describe as massive participation and the failure of the opposition boycott .
It is a different picture in the private and opposition papers which report a low turnout of 10 % or under , our correspondent says .
Religious ban
Officials say the changes will allow the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law to replace the emergency legislation in place since 1981 , giving police wide powers of arrest and surveillance .
KEY AMENDMENTS
Article 5 :
Bans political activity / parties based on religion Article 88 :
Removes judicial supervision of elections Article 179 :
Invokes special powers to fight terrorism
Analysis : ' Permanent emergency '
In addition , the amendments ban all religious - based political activity and parties , a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood - an Islamic party banned in Egypt which represents the strongest opposition force .
The Brotherhood ran in the legislative elections in 2005 , with candidates standing as independents , and won 88 seats in parliament .
The amendments also allow the adoption of a new election law and do away with the need for judicial supervision of every ballot box .
Opposition groups have voiced fears about the wording of the articles on the new anti-terrorism law because it will be possible to bypass the constitutional guarantees protecting basic freedoms .
Human rights group Amnesty International has called the changes the greatest erosion of human rights since a state of emergency was declared after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat 26 years ago .

In the post “ Ron Paul â€ ” Federal Reserve To Blame For Housing Bubble ”
Warbs noted that Ron Paul was blaming the fed for creating , and perpetuating the housing bubble , which is about to burst and deliver a big smackdown to the economy .
“ When the bubble finally bursts completely , millions of Americans will be looking for someone to blame .
Look for Congress to hold hearings into subprime lending practices and â€œpredatoryâ€ mortgages .
Weâ€™ll hear a lot of grandstanding about how unscrupulous lenders took advantage of poor people [ ed : Chris Dodd is already doing it ] , and how rampant speculation caused real estate markets around the country to overheat .
It will be reminiscent of the Enron hearings , and the message will be explicitly or implicitly the same : free - market capitalism , left unchecked , leads to greed , fraud , and unethical if not illegal business practices .
But capitalism is not to blame for the housing bubble , the Federal Reserve is .
Specifically , Fed intervention in the economyâ€ “ through the manipulation of interest rates and the creation of moneyâ€ “ caused the artificial boom in mortgage lending .
The Fed has roughly tripled the amount of dollars and credit in circulation just since 1990 .
Housing prices have risen dramatically not because of simple supply and demand , but because the Fed literally created demand by making the cost of borrowing money artificially cheap .
When credit is cheap , individuals tend to borrow too much and spend recklessly .
â€¦ Unless and until we get the Federal Reserve out of the business of creating money at will and setting interest rates , we will remain vulnerable to market bubbles and painful corrections .
If housing prices plummet and millions of Americans find themselves owing more than their homes are worth , the blame lies squarely with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke . ” — Ron Paul
Though Brad does n’t quite agree with the entirety of Pauls comments , he goes on to note :
“ Paul also points out the use of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offload risk ( which many investors consider to be implicitly guaranteed by the US Government ) .
He doesnâ€™t mention the use of derivatives to slice - and - dice the risk and further offload it onto the market , but his point still stands .
The Federal Reserve has flooded the market with money , and that money has been chasing returns .
Housing has been the â€œhotâ€ asset class , creating an unsustainable bubble .
When that bursts , it will be a lot worse than the tech stock bubble , because it actually hits people right at home . ” …
You flood the market with money , and you see what happens .
The rich , who have the ability to move money around chasing these asset classes , get richer .
They buy second homes or investment properties to ride the appreciation wave , increasing demand .
The poor and middle class , who are just trying to get ahead , struggle to keep their incomes constant or rising relative to the cost of goods .
And when housing becomes the asset class bubble , they get priced out of homes and lenders must resort to â€œcreativeâ€ financing to allow them to buy .
Then , when the returns on investment start drying up , the demand of speculators and investors dries up , and home prices collapse .
The bubble is bursting .
The particular nature of the housing market , as a relatively illiquid asset , is making this occur more slowly than a stock bubble would occur .
But itâ€™s occurring nonetheless .
Blame can be spread around , of course , especially to some of those subprime borrowers who purchased homes they cannot afford .
But Ron Paul is right , it is clear that the Fedâ€™s loose money policy created this bubble , and they deserve a great deal of blame when it bursts . ”
I ’m sorry , but the most basic market principle of libertarianism is that rational actors , will act with informed self interest , to produce optimal results in a market .
This is n’t anyones FAULT , but the people who bought houses they could n’t afford ; and the people who lent them the money to do so .
No -one was deceived by the fed , or the lenders .
There ’s no such thing as a predatory mortgage on a new house you ca n’t afford .
Lenders are n’t trying to put people into loans they cant pay back , they LOSE money on foreclosures .
No -one was deceived by the fed keeping relatively loose money .
The fed could have done whatever they wanted with interest rates ; people were too caught up in the “ gold rush ” mentality to care .
In fact , during this “ boom ” we ’ve seen the fed put the biggest peacetime interest rate increases in place , month after month , ( in 2000 , and then again in 2002 and 2003 ) , and all it did was slow things down slightly .
THere was no deception involved here , except self deception .
Everyone thought they could keep surfing the wave ; and they pretended that it would never reach the the shore .
As far as I ’m concerned , none of this is a problem from a market standpoint .
There is no point in this cycle where we could have legitmately said , “ OK , now it ’s time for the government to step in a do something ” .
This is just a natural economic cycle ..
Or did people forget that markets have boom and bust cycles naturally ; based on the psychology of the market ?
Oh wait , yes , that ’s right , they did .
So a bunch of sub - prime lenders are going to fail .
Oopsie …
That ’s going to put pressure on a lot of major banks who invested , or underwrote those subprimes .
Oopsie …
A bunch of builders and contractors are going to go under now , because they were only in existence to take advantage of the bubble .
Oopsie …
A whole bunch of people are going to lose those houses they could n’t afford ; or the second or third houses they bought on spec , to try and sell for far more than they were worth in a rational market .
Oopsie …
None of these are BAD THINGS .
Markets make mistakes , and this is the corrective mechanism .
If you over invest in something shaky , you get what you deserve .
If you bought a house you could n’t afford , because someone was stupid enough to give you a loan you could n’t pay back , whose fault is that ?
YOURS , that ’s who .
If the lender who loaned you the money goes under , because you and all your neighbors default on his loans , whose fault is that ?
HIS , that ’s who .
You both made decisions , knowing what the consequences of those decisions could be , and willfully choosing to ignore them .
The most basic freedom of the market , is freedom to fail ; because failure makes markets strong .
What we ’re seeing right now , and will see over the next .. oh I ’d say two years … is the principle of freedom to fail in action .
People made risky gambles , and they lost ; that ’s what happens sometimes .
When the dust clears ; you can bet that those involved wo n’t do that again … or at least the ones with any brains will anyway .
The other idiots will be off looking for another boom to bust .
Now , what WOULD be a problem , is if , as Paul suggests ( and I think it ’s entirely likely ) ; the government decides it “ must do something ” , to protect those fools from the consequences of their actions .
THAT , would be a BIG problem .
Tony Blair agreed to commit British troops to battle in Iraq in the full knowledge that Washington had failed to make adequate preparations for the postwar reconstruction of the country .
In a devastating account of the chaotic preparations for the war , which comes as Blair enters his final full week in Downing Street , key No 10 aides and friends of Blair have revealed the Prime Minister repeatedly and unsuccessfully raised his concerns with the White House .
He also agreed to commit troops to the conflict even though President George Bush had personally said Britain could help ' some other way ' .
The disclosures , in a two - part Channel 4 documentary about Blair 's decade in Downing Street , will raise questions about Blair 's public assurances at the time of the war in 2003 that he was satisfied with the post - war planning .
In one of the most significant interviews in the programme , Peter Mandelson says that the Prime Minister knew the preparations were inadequate but said he was powerless to do more .
' Obviously more attention should have been paid to what happened after , to the planning and what we would do once Saddam had been toppled , ' Mandelson tells The Observer 's chief political commentator , Andrew Rawnsley , who presents the documentary .
' But I remember him saying at the time : " Look , you know , I can't do everything .
That 's chiefly America 's responsibility , not ours . " '
Mandelson then criticises his friend : ' Well , I 'm afraid that , as we now see , was n't good enough . '.
Opponents of the war , who have long claimed that the Pentagon planned a short , sharp offensive to overthrow Saddam Hussein with little thought of the consequences , claimed last night that the programme vindicated their criticisms .
Sir Menzies Campbell , the Liberal Democrat leader , told The Observer : ' These frank admissions that the Prime Minister was aware of the inadequacies of the preparations for post - conflict Iraq are a devastating indictment . '
Blair 's most senior foreign affairs adviser at the time of the war makes clear that Blair was ' exercised ' on the exact issue raised by the war 's opponents .
Sir David Manning , now Britain 's ambassador to Washington , says : ' It 's hard to know exactly what happened over the post - war planning .
I can only say that I remember the PM raising this many months before the war began .
He was very exercised about it .'
Manning reveals that Blair was so concerned that he sent him to Washington in March 2002 , a full year before the invasion .
Manning recalls : ' The difficulties the Prime Minister had in mind were particularly , how difficult was this operation going to be ?
If they did decide to intervene , what would it be like on the ground ?
How would you do it ?
What would the reaction be if you did it , what would happen on the morning after ?
' All these issues needed to be thrashed out .
It was n't to say that they were n't thinking about them , but I did n't see the evidence at that stage that these things had been thoroughly rehearsed and thoroughly thought through . '
On his return to London , Manning wrote a highly - critical secret memo to Blair .
' I think there is a real risk that the [ Bush ] administration underestimates the difficulties , ' it said .
' They may agree that failure is n't an option , but this does not mean that they will avoid it . '
Within a year Britain lost any hope of a proper reconstruction in Iraq when post - war planning was handed to the Pentagon at the beginning of 2003 .
Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's envoy to the postwar administration in Baghdad , confirms that Blair was in despair .
' There were moments of throwing his hands in the air : " What can we do ? "
He was tearing his hair over some of the deficiencies . '
The failure to prepare meant that Iraq quickly fell apart .
Greenstock adds : ' I just felt it was slipping away from us really , from the beginning .
There was no security force controlling the streets .
There was no police force to speak of . '
The revelation that Blair was ' exercised ' in private will raise questions about his public assurances .
The former Labour leader , Neil Kinnock , told the programme he was given a personal assurance by Blair that he was satisfied by the preparations .
' I said to Tony , are you certain ? '
Kinnock told the programme .
' And when he said : " I 'm sure , " that was a good enough reassurance . '
Condoleezza Rice , then Bush 's national security adviser , confirms that the President offered Blair a way out .
Bush told Blair : ' Perhaps there 's some other way that Britain can be involved . '
Blair replied : ' No , I 'm with you . '
· The Rise and Fall of Tony Blair will be screened on Channel 4 next Saturday .
[ Haskell - cafe ] the case of the 100 - fold program speedup
One of Alan Perlis 's " Epigrams in Programming " is " A language that does n't affect the way you think about programming , is not worth knowing " .
I recently had an experience that demonstrated this principle .
I had to write some code that took a polygon ( encoded in WKT , a standard format for geographic information exchange ) , computed its intersection with several rectangles , and then compute the centroid of each one of these intersections .
No problem , I thought .
People who know more than me about this geometry stuff have written an open - source library , OGR , which has functions for parsing WKT , computing intersections , computing centroids , and computing all sorts of other things .
And there are Python bindings for OGR so I do n't have to wrestle with C++ to solve my problem .
So I wrote a Python program that used OGR to crunch the numbers , ran it through the data set we needed to process , and ... it took over sixteen hours to run .
Since we want to have this program process this data set with every build of our software , adding sixteen hours to our build time was not a pleasant thought .
Then I thought about some of the things I 'd read about optimization of functional programming languages , and said , " Hey !
The algorithm for clipping the polygon to the rectangle is producing a sequence of vertices , and the algorithm for computing the centroid is consuming a sequence of vertices .
I can do some deforestation here ! "
It took me a week to figure out the right algorithm for combining these two procedures and write some almost - working code that implemented it .
It took a co-worker of mine another few days to find the bugs that had eluded me .
But after the program worked for my test cases , I ran it again on the full data set ... and it took ten minutes .
In other words , I sped up the code by two orders of magnitude .
And I did n't even have to drop into C++ to do the number - crunching ; I used OGR to parse the WKT strings and to look up the coordinates of each vertex of the polygon , but the algorithm itself was implemented in Python .
w00t !
[ Ross ] Via The Plank , the latest Rasmussen poll has Obama tied with Hillary nationwide .
And this related survey , I think , is telling :
Thirty - three percent ( 33 % ) of Likely Voters say they ’d definitely vote for Illinois Senator Barack Obama ( D ) .
That ’s the highest total received by any of ten leading Presidential hopefuls included in the poll .
Thirty - three percent ( 33 % ) also say they ’d definitely vote against Obama giving him a net differential of zero ( 33 % definitely for minus 33 % definitely against equals net differential of 0 ) .
All other candidates have a net differential in negative territory meaning more people are set to definitely vote against them rather than for them .
Other polling during the past month found Obama ’s favorability ratings have increased to the highest level of any 2008 candidate .
In a way , it 's the opposite of Dean - versus - Kerry in 2004 - this time around , it 's the outsider candidate , Obama , who looks like a better bet for the general election , and the insider , Hillary , who looks like more of a gamble .
That landscape may shift as Obama becomes better known and his rivals start going after into him , but if it lasts till primary season , it 's a dynamic that could play a powerful role in tipping undecided , victory - hungry Dems into the Illinois Senator 's column .

Power , Politics , & Social Change by G. William Domhoff
Welcome to WhoRulesAmerica.net , a site about how power is distributed and wielded in the United States .
It both builds upon and greatly supplements the book Who Rules America ? , now in its 7th edition .
The book 's new subtitle , " The Triumph of the Corporate Rich , " reflects the success of the wealthy few in defeating all of their rivals ( e.g. , organized labor , liberals , environmentalists ) over the course of the past 35 years .
The story of how the corporate rich won all the big battles is complicated , but most of the answers are in the new Who Rules America ?
and / or this Web site ; you can also watch some videos of Bill giving invited lectures on the topic .
Among the many things you 'll find here : supplementary information and updates for readers of WRA ; an overview of the American power structure at the national level and an in - depth look at power at the local level ; a look at the wealth and income distribution in the U.S. ; and an overview of the Four Networks theory of power , which provides the best general theory of power and social change within which to situate the class - domination theory we 've developed specifically for the United States .
There 's a special section ( including photos and first - hand accounts ) about a unique elite social club that 's been holding its annual California summer retreat for well over a century : The Bohemian Club & The Bohemian Grove .
And there are analyses of social movements and social change based on research in the social sciences ; critiques of alternative theories of power ; links to Web sites and books about power and social change in the United States ; and much more .
You can use the menu on the left side of the page to navigate through the site ( each section heading clicks open to reveal several documents ) .
Questions and Answers
Q : So , who does rule America ?
A : The owners and managers of large income - producing properties ; i.e. , the owners of corporations , banks , other financial institutions , and agri-businesses .
But they have plenty of help from the managers and experts they hire .
You can read the essential details of the argument on this site , or read the new seventh edition of Who Rules America ?.
Q : Do the same people rule at the local level that rule at the federal level ?
A : No , not quite .
The local level is dominated by the land owners and businesses that own downtown real estate and big shopping malls .
They come together as growth coalitions , which turn cities into " growth machines " when they gain control of local government .
Everything is about land values for them , and that requires office buildings , stadiums , museums , concert halls , shoppers , conventions , and tourists .
Q : Do they rule secretly from behind the scenes , as a conspiracy ?
A : No , conspiracy theories are all wrong for many reasons .
It 's true that some corporate leaders lie and steal , and that some government officials — including the President — initiate secret actions and then try ( and usually fail ) to keep them out of the newspapers .
But those activities are not what is meant by a conspiracy theory , most of which involve an imagined small group of people secretly plotting to gain or retain control of the government through illegal means .
Q : Then how do they rule ?
A : That 's a complicated story , but the short answer is through lobbying , open and direct involvement in general policy planning on the big issues , participation ( in large part through campaign donations ) in political campaigns and elections , and through appointments to key decision - making positions in government .
Q : Are you saying that elections do n't matter ?
A : No , but they usually matter a lot less than they could , and a lot less in America than they do in other industrialized democracies .
That 's because of the nature of the electoral rules and the unique history of the South .
Q : Does social science research have anything useful to say about making progressive social change more effective ?
A : Yes , it does , but few if any people pay much attention to that research .
Q : Is WhoRulesAmerica.net connected to the " Who Rules America ? " documents on natvan.com or ncoal.com ?
A : No !
Those sites ( and many others with documents purporting to tell you " who rules America " ) are run by white supremacist / neo - Nazi organizations .

RENEGADE RNA : CLUES TO CANCER AND NORMAL GROWTH
Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered that a tiny piece of genetic code apparently goes where no bit of it has gone before , and it gets there under its own internal code .
A report on the renegade ribonucleic acid , and the code that directs its movement , will be published Jan. 5 in Science .
MicroRNAs , already implicated in cancer and normal development , latch on to and gum up larger strands of RNA that carry instructions for making the proteins that do all the cell ’s work .
They are , says Joshua Mendell , M.D. , Ph.D. , an assistant professor in the McKusick - Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Hopkins , like “ molecular rheostats that fine - tune how much protein is being made from each gene . ”
That ’s why normally microRNAs always have appeared to stick close to the cell ’s protein - making machinery .
But during a survey of more than 200 of the 500 known microRNAs found in human cells , Mendell ’s team discovered one lone microRNA “ miles away ” --- in cellular terms --- from all the others .
“ It was so clearly in the wrong place at the wrong time for what we thought it was supposed to be doing that we just had to figure out why , ” says Hun - Way Hwang , a graduate student in human genetics and contributor to the study .
Consisting of only 20 to 25 nucleotide building blocks ( compared to other types of RNA that can be thousands of nucleotides long ) , each microRNA has a different combination of blocks .
Mendell ’s team realized that six building blocks at the end of the wayward miR -29 b microRNA were noticeably different from the ends of other microRNAs .
Suspicious that the six - block end might have something to do with miR -29 b ’s location , the researchers chopped them off and stuck them on the end of another microRNA .
When put into cells , the new microRNA behaved just like miR -29b , wandering far away from the cell ’s protein - making machinery and into the nucleus , where the cell ’s genetic material is kept .
The researchers then stuck the same six - block end onto another type of small RNA , a small - interfering RNA or siRNA that turns off genes .
This also forced the siRNA into the nucleus .
According to Mendell , these results demonstrate for the first time that despite their tiny size , microRNAs contain elements consisting of short stretches of nucleotide building blocks that can control their behavior in a cell .
Mendell hopes to take advantage of the built - in “ cellular zip code ” discovered in miR -29b as an experimental tool .
For example , he plans to force other microRNAs and siRNAs into the nucleus to turn off specific sets of genes .
Mendell ’s team is actively hunting for additional hidden microRNA elements that control other aspects of their behavior in cells .
They also are curious to figure out what miR - 29b is doing in the nucleus .
Because microRNAs have been implicated in cancer as well as normal development , Mendell hopes that further study of miR -29 b will reveal other , hidden functions of microRNAs .
The research was funded by the March of Dimes , Rita Allen Foundation and the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research .
Authors on the paper are Hwang , Erik Wentzel , and Mendell , all of Hopkins .

From the very start , directories have served a very useful purpose on the Internet .
( One I find useful for example is Free Web Directory ) .
News sites can also be considered directories : they index and categorize news stories !
What about categorizing software ?
In the open source world you get Savannah , SourceForge , Freshmeat ; there are still , believe it or not , shareware and freeware directories like FileBuzz , PCWin Download Center and Freeware Downloads ( although you need to be careful , as they are not like their free - as - in - freedom counterparts ) .
The following lecture by Edwin Land , given at MIT in 1957 , is one of the most inspiring comments ever made on the role of a technical university .
At MIT , it is cited as a prime motivator for the development of UROP ( Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program ) , although UROP addressed only a fraction of Land 's vision and there was a 12 - year gap between the lecture and the launch of the UROP program .
Land 's 1950 's language sounds sexist to modern ears , but if we get beyond that , we can see that Land 's vision is even more pertinent as a direction for the university of the year 2000 , and the potential to use computer communications in place of Land 's " movie theaters " suggests a role for educational technology within an overall framework of educational excellence .
For some salubrious debunking , both of Land 's vision ( " a male chauvinist , sexist , pipe dream " ) and of the notion that it was an important stimulus for UROP , see Folk History : How Things Happen by MIT Physics Professor Malcolm Strandberg . -- Hal Abelson
GENERATION OF GREATNESS
The Idea of a University in an Age of Science EDWIN H. LAND
President , Polaroid Corporation Ninth Annual Arthur Dehon Little Memorial Lecture
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
May 22 , 1957
Introduction
The Arthur Dehon Little Memorial Lectureship was established in 1944 with funds donated by Arthur D. Little Inc. , in memory of its founder .
The series was initiated with the broad purpose of promoting interest in and stimulating discussion of the social implications inherent in the development of science .
Dr. Edwin H. Land , 1957 holder of the Lectureship , has joined a host of distinguished predecessors in bringing to the institute community fresh insights and provocative comments on the world around us .
It is commonly believed , and to a certain degree correctly so , that educational institutions are inherently conservative and are too often resistant to change .
In the face of this tradition , it is important that we in the institutions listen carefully to our critics and provide a forum for the educational innovator .
Dr. Land has reminded us that the humanistic quality of learning has been neglected far too frequently .
Education , particularly in the large universities , has become primarily concerned with subject matter rather than the development of the individual student .
Dr. Land has correctly stated that the university must redress this unbalance and , at the undergraduate level , bring our focus upon the individual student and the potential which he brings to college .
The growing recognition that we can no longer be prodigal with human resources and the urgent importance of developing to the fullest our available talent add further emphasis to Dr. Land 's plea for a bolder effort to release the full creative abilities of the students .
While there may be practical limitations to the feasibility of some of Dr. Land 's specific proposals , it behooves all of us , educators and laymen alike , to embrace his concern for the full development of the creative powers which are inherent in each and every individual .
No one who heard Dr. Land lecture on the evening of May 22 .
1957 , could fail to have been moved by his eloquence and his penetrating understanding of our educational problems .

Generation of Greatness
The Idea of a University in an Age of Science
Beyond his deep respect for the members of M.I.T.'s faculty and administration , your speaker brings to this review two primary ideas -- love of science and faith in youth .
In the two weeks during which I was your guest here at M.I.T. , I have had some twenty meetings with groups of the faculty and with groups of undergraduates .
I have been to dinner at a Fraternity house .
I have had graduate students and undergraduates come to dinner with me .
I have seen the remarkable Survey of Scholastic Enthusiasm conducted by undergraduates in recent years , and I have had the advice of a student group of the Arthur Dehon Little Lecture Committee .
Nothing which I saw changed the latent conviction that I brought with me , that the freshmen entering our American universities have a potential for greatness which we have not learned how to develop fully by the kind of education we have brought to this generation from the generations of the past .
Everything that I saw strengthened this conviction .
Everywhere I went there was the deep concern of the faculty and administration for doing the teaching job better .
And everywhere I could sense a deep feeling in the undergraduates I met : none of them dared to express it , but every one of them felt , in his heart , that if a way could be found of nurturing the timid dream of his own potential greatness which he brought from his family and school , if somehow he could tie on to the greatness in the faculty and the administration , then his dream might be coming out differently .
The Age of Greatness
What do I mean by greatness as I have used it in the title of this lecture ?
What do I mean by the Generation of Greatness ?
I mean that in this age , in this country , there is an opportunity for the development of man 's intellectual , cultural , and spiritual potentialities that has never existed before in the history of our species .
I mean not simply an opportunity for greatness for a few , but an opportunity for greatness for the many .
I believe that each young person is different from any other who has ever lived , as different as his fingerprints : that he could bring to the world a wonderful and special way of solving unsolved problems , that in his special way , he can be great .
Now do n't misunderstand me .
I recognize that this merely great person , as distinguished from the genius , will not be able to bridge from field to field .
He will not have the ideas that shorten the solution of problems by hundreds of years .
He will not suddenly say that mass is energy , that is genius .
But within his own field he will make things grow and flourish ; he will grow happy helping other people in his field , and to that field he will add things that would not have been added , had he not come along .
I believe there are two opposing theories of history , and you have to make your choice .
Either you believe that this kind of individual greatness does exist and can be nurtured and developed , that such great individuals can be part of a cooperative community while they continue to be their happy , flourishing , contributing selves -- or else you believe that there is some mystical , cyclical , overriding , predetermined , cultural law -- a historic determinism .
The great contribution of science is to say that this second theory is nonsense .
The great contribution of science is to demonstrate that a person can regard the world as chaos , but can find in himself a method of perceiving , within that chaos , small arrangements of order , that out of himself , and out of the order that previous scientists have generated , he can make things that are exciting and thrilling to make , that are deeply spiritual contributions to himself and to his friends .
The scientist comes to the world and says , " I do not understand the divine source , but I know , in a way that I do n't understand , that out of chaos I can make order , out of loneliness I can make friendship , out of ugliness I can make beauty . "
I believe that men are born this way -- that all men are born this way .
I know that each of the undergraduates with whom I talked shares this belief .
Each of these men felt secretly -- it was his very special secret and his deepest secret -- that he could be great .
But not many undergraduates come through our present educational system retaining this hope .
Our young people , for the most part -- unless they are geniuses -- after a very short time in college give up any hope of being individually great .
They plan , instead , to be good .
They plan to be effective , They plan to do their job .
They plan to take their healthy place in the community .
We might say that today it takes a genius to come out great , and a great man , a merely great man , cannot survive .
It has become our habit , therefore , to think that the age of greatness has passed , that the age of the great man is gone , that this is the day of group research , that this is the day of community progress .
Yet the very essence of democracy is the absolute faith that while people must cooperate , the first function of democracy , its peculiar gift , is to develop each individual into everything that he might be .
But I submit to you that when in each man the dream of personal greatness dies , democracy loses the real source of its future strength .
Idea of the University
The thing that we cannot realize in university life is the extent to which our natural concern with the past in what we teach has tied us to the past in how we teach .
It is essential for the faculties of our universities to realize that we have not created this problem , we have inherited it .
De Toqueville enjoyed pointing out a peculiar characteristic of American democracy : it solves the problems that occur , as they come along , in a new way .
What new ways , right for this generation , would we like to see in university life ?
Attitude Toward the Undergraduate
My first proposal concerns the attitude of the university towards the undergraduate .
We find that in other areas in modern life , the attitude toward individuals is changing very , very rapidly .
Thus , coming into a university from industry , one is surprised to see that entering pupils are treated as young and immature .
To anybody on the outside it is self - evident that these boys coming in are not boys .
It is self - evident that these men coming in are men .
These are the ones who , at seventeen , would have been fighting the bears in the caves of old : who , at seventeen , would have been diverting the streams that came to flood their nomadic valleys .
The fact that civilization is becoming more intricate must not mean that we treat men for a longer period as immature .
Does it not mean , perhaps , the opposite : that we must skillfully make them mature sooner , that we must find ways of handling the intricacy of our culture ?
Now this error in attitude -- mistaking these men for boys -- permeates the whole scholastic domain , permeates it so thoroughly that it is hard for anyone within the domain to recognize it .
What do I mean by saying that a man is treated as a boy ?
I mean that he is told , the moment he arrives , that his secret dream of greatness is a pipe - dream ; that it will be a long time before he makes a significant , personal contribution -- if ever .
He is told this not with words .
He is told this in a much more convincing way .
He is shown , in everything that happens to him , that nobody could dream that he could make a significant , personal contribution .
He is given courses , he is instantly given tests , and he is given examinations .
Now I ask you , if this is preparation for life , tell me where , where in the world , where in the relationship with our colleagues , where in the industrial domain , where ever again , anywhere in life , is a person given this curious sequence of prepared talks and prepared questions , questions to which the answers are known ?
Where again is he ever marked in this way ?
Where again is a structure of authoritarianism masked by the genuine friendliness of the democratic people who are his leaders ?
Where ever again is a person brought to the day of judgment every single week ?
One may be inclined to say : After all , it 's just part of a system .
But consider this :
The first thing a mark tells you is whether what you said is true .
When the professor says , " Hand back what I said , " the professor is telling the student that what he , the professor , said is true .
Now the role of science is to be systematic , to be accurate , to be orderly , but it certainly is not to imply that the aggregated , successful hypotheses of the past have the kind of truth that goes into a number system .
If we wonder why so few pupils survive the university system in the country today -- survive to come out asking the right questions , feeling free to question the authority of science although they have mastered the techniques -- I suspect it starts here .
I say that our system of tests and grades , as it now exists , is one source of the low yield of great men from our universities .
The marking system is a traumatic experience from which most students emerge with a deep determination never to get into a situation where they can be marked again .
They just wo n't ever again take a chance .
Another example of the attitude toward these incoming men is the honor system .
In this survey of scholastic enthusiasm that I mentioned earlier , there is a good deal of discussion of the honor system , of its use in other colleges , and of whether or not we ought to have it at M.I.T .
Is it too much to hope that an inspired undergraduate body would need no policing system , even that of its own " honor " ?
One feels , when among our young students , that they are honest and honorable and full of ideals , that they come to the door of our universities with the dream of being our colleagues ; that if we could provide them intimate leadership there would be no discipline to which they would not subject themselves and no task so arduous in the pursuit of knowledge and science that they would not devote themselves fully to it .
But if we imply , as I believe we do by our present attitude , that we do not have this kind of faith in them , then their own strength wanes and they cannot believe the best of themselves .
What then should our attitude be , and how might we express it ?
The Usher
I would dream that when a freshman enters the university , he would become at once a member of a small group , perhaps of about ten men .
He would be associated at once with a mature , established scholar whose first interest is the education -- I use the word in its broadest sense -- of this incoming group and of the ten who came in the year before .
The functions of these scholars will appear as I go along .
Let me just refer to him , for our present purposes , as an usher -- someone who leads you through the door -- and describe him as a scholar who has a warm feeling for teaching , has succeeded enough in his field so that he is emerging from the fast - flowing part of the stream of his career , past the exciting rocks and chasms of his earlier years , and entering onto the pleasant , broad part of the river where he can relax a bit .
One of these ushers would greet each group of ten men as they came to the university .
He would associate them with him as his colleagues -- junior colleagues , to be sure , but as men capable at once of behaving as men , capable of the greatness that I have described .
He would help these young colleagues look over the university , talk over the professors , talk over the courses ; he would start them reading , and then start them going to some lectures .
And he would start each one on a personal research project .
The Personal Project
I believe each incoming freshman must be started at once on his own research project if we are to preserve his secret dream of greatness and make it come true .
I believe , indeed , that the scientific experience should come earlier than the first year of college .
I would urge that just as democracy initially meant the right of man to defend himself , to have a sword , and then meant the right to write , and then meant the right to read -- so , now , democracy means the right to have the scientific experience .
This does not mean that everybody is a scientist in the professional sense .
It does not mean that , any more than that everyone who can write is a writer in the professional sense .
But just as an English teacher in the high school can give an assignment to write an original theme , so a science teacher in the high school should give an assignment to do an original piece of scientific work .
I hope to convince you that this is feasible , that it is as normal for the young pupil in high school , or even in grade school , to carry out an original scientific investigation as it is for him to write his paper about what happened to the black and white horse out in the barn .
The proper kind of respect for distinguished people and distinguished accomplishments can be acquired only by actual participation in scientific research -- what was valid in their spirit and their facts -- what was necessarily of transient importance -- how they related themselves to nature -- and how any scientist must relate himself to nature and nature to himself .
None of this can be understood except by a person who has himself been a scientist .
A contemporary man who has not participated intimately in actual work in science is , in my opinion , not a modern man .
I believe that this experience in science should come early in the life of all of our pupils .
Now , I expect you to say that it is inconceivable that we could provide enough experiments for all these students .
That objection , I think , arises from the fact that the teachers in a great university are distinguished people .
They are in fields that have come a long way .
They are in fields of great current importance .
Each is working out at the farthest end of one predominant line within his field .
Now , for a young man to catch up with all the distinguished workers along that line , to pass them , and to make a contribution is indeed an almost unthinkable thing .
The ordinary tendency , then , of a distinguished person in any field is to feel that no matter how much he admires and respects the young man , he cannot impose on him the requirements of contribution in that line where so many great men are working .
What I would like to urge is then in between all of these major lines of scientific investigation there are vast areas as yet unexplored .
What would be one ?
Consider the recent work of Von Frisch , which shows that bees find their way by the polarized light of the sky .
Von Frisch 's work suggests the kind of project our young man could undertake .
We suggest to the entering freshman : Von Frisch has found that bees find their way by polarized light .
Your problem is to find out what , if anything , in the bee 's eye , is the analyzer for that polarized light ?
Immediately , the first day the man starts on that problem , he is the world 's authority on it .
No one else is working in his domain ; he is on his way ; he is a self - respecting individual ; he is motivated in a hundred different ways ; he is our colleague .
Similarly he could have been the one to find out how bees talk to one another , how they take ordinary drones and somehow convert them into scouts that go out and find new sites for the hive and come back and tell the hive about them .
He could find out what happens in the town meetings of the bees when the scouts come back and the hive votes on which scout to believe .
Thus it is apparent that there are areas where untrained people may work effectively and with limited equipment .
Our pupil does n't need a big laboratory to do this , he needs freedom ; he needs encouragement .
Introductory Courses
The next proposal I wish to make concerns the nature of the courses through which entering students are introduced to the various disciplines .
It seems to me that the introductory courses which are designed , supposedly , to teach the whole freshman class about chemistry , and physics , and mathematics , to serve as background in these fields , have instead a tendency to be given as survival courses .
That is , a man who is inherently a chemist will survive an introductory course in chemistry ; a man who is not inherently a chemist will not want to hear of chemistry again .
Similarly , I think a physicist , looking at a student , does not ask , " How can I help this boy become a great man in some field ? " , but " Is this boy potentially a great physicist who will some day work in my field ?
Is he someone with whom I might identify myself , and to whom I would be proud to pass on what I know ? "
While this is an understandable attitude , it does n't solve the problem of how we make chemists and mathematicians have a deep feeling for physics .
I think the " school science " approach does ; and I think the general education course at its best does also -- where by the best we mean the brilliant presentation of the most precisely delineated ideas , and I think we must say this to each department : " Sharpen up the edges of ideas for the students in fields other than your own .
They will not have years in which to find out what you meant , years during which they might achieve a sense of rich insight into your domain .
But they are intelligent , they are earnest in their own department ; they will profit all their lives from one year of brilliant teaching . "
Now this takes time , patience , and talent , and the question immediately arises :
How can we find the time ?
One proposal that interests me is to take the good lecturers at the moment when they are most excited about a new way of saying something , or at the moment when they have just found something new , and make moving pictures of them right in class .
" Can the lecture with the vitamins in ! "
Although I have not been in a university all my life , most of my friends have , and many a wonderful evening has been spoiled because a friend had to go home to do his lecture over .
The same lecture ?
Yes , the same lecture .
Why did he have to do it over ?
Because he had a little new insight .
And so he redid that part , and became excited , and when he gave his lecture the next morning , everybody saw that he was excited , and the lecture was wonderful .
( Actually , when he redid his lecture , he dropped out the idea he was excited about the previous year , which was just as important -- but he could n't get excited about it again . )
With the movie we can capture the excitement , as well as the substance , of the best lectures .
The lecturer can be freed of much of the burden of the total review of his field every year .
He can devote himself to what he is excited about this year ; to the new discovery , to the increment in knowledge , to correcting what he said before , to a fresh statement about an extensive new area .
When our new , mature freshman comes in , then , to the new regenerated university of the 1960's , he will find a building which combines a series of movie theaters with a storehouse of great lectures .
In these theaters , groups of students see many of the lectures that today must be given , in person , by their professors .
Later , each student can see these lectures over again , whenever he wants to .
As you watch these movies we are about to show , you will find , I think , that in several respects the movie can actually be better than the lecturer in person .
One can see , in the movie close - ups , what actually occurs in his demonstration .
You will also observe in yourself a curious objectivity .
In an actual lecture , there is often a high and somewhat irrelevant emotional content , one way or the other , positive or negative ; either one is too sensitive to the teacher or one is too insensitive ; either one is too wide awake or one is too sleepy .
One senses the presence of the man , in addition to , and outside of , anything that he has to say about the subject of the lecture .
I think you will find in these movies that while you can feel the warmth of the personality of the lecturer , you can at the same time retain a relaxed objectivity that should speed the learning process .
These movies represent three different experiments .
In one , Professor Hans Mueller , a very popular and effective lecturer , talks in his field of optics about the scattering of light .
In this experiment , the movie camera was brought in while he was giving his lecture .
Just a fragment of the lecture is shown .
The second film is of Professor Ernst Guillemin .
He has just described how an abrupt truncation of the band width affects the transmission of a signal and he is about to describe how this effect may be minimized .
The third was prepared by Professor Jerrold Zacharias and Professor Tom Jones as part of their school science work .
It is a complete lecture - demonstration about the pressure of light .
The movies were then shown and Dr. Land proceeded to his concluding remarks .
In our reconstitution of the university of the future , we have made these proposals :
The university would accept the young men coming to it as men , and in the course of doing so , it would discard the present grading system in favor of one which would enable the student to check his accomplishment but would not encumber the relationship between the student and his professor .
It would cherish and nurture the dream of greatness that these young men bring with them when they come to the university , in particular by giving each of them , from the start , a research project of his own .
It would introduce them to the several fields of science through courses designed nor to screen out nonspecialists , but rather to give them the essential insights and ideas in these fields .
It would give them , in their introductory courses and in all of their courses , the best teaching of the best lecturers , by preserving and multiplying these lectures in motion pictures .
It would give them intimate association , from the first , with a mature colleague -- the usher .
The Function of the Usher
I have saved till last my discussion of the usher .
Why do we need the usher ?
What do these ushers do ?
What are they like ?
Their function is to take these young men as they come to the university and see that they become , during the first two years , sophisticated in science generally , and sophisticated in the world of literature and the arts generally .
They would see that these first two years are dedicated to a deliberate program of induction into mental maturity .
Just as the ages of five , six , and seven are when a child learns languages quickly , the years from seventeen to nineteen are peculiarly the years in which a man reaches out to try and understand the universe in every possible way .
The ushers encourage this reaching out , stimulate and guide it .
As they acquire insight into the personality and the needs of the incoming man , they open the doors of the university to him ... the right doors , at the right time .
They build , with each man , a program of reading , of lectures , of seminars .
When the usher feels his group of students is ready to talk with a great professor , he arranges for the meeting , seeing to it that the students are prepared ahead of time to ask the right questions .
We have already seen the usher starting his men on their personal research projects .
As each man pursues his investigation , his usher is the trusted and trusting friend , the master whose criticism he can ask for and take without losing face ; he is the senior colleague who knows his way around in all of the fields that the investigation will inevitably come to involve .
But perhaps the usher 's greatest contribution is merely to be what he is -- when he is not being consciously and explicitly a guide and counselor .
The usher , remember , is a great man in his field .
He has not dropped his career .
He is actively engaged in his own field , contributing to it through his own first - rate research .
Can we find such men ?
For a university of the size of M.I.T. , we would need ninety of them .
Could we find enough of these great men to go around ?
I think we could .
I think that there comes a point in each career where a man begins to get as deep satisfaction from bringing younger men along as he gets from making scientific contributions to his field .
There comes an age when suddenly this , too , seems to be fun .
It comes , I think , about the time that presbyopia sets in .
At that moment , the things to which he has been devoting all his life -- the finding of a great law , the isolation of the compound , the working out of the structure , having more and more graduate students , working for one academy after another and then for the Nobel Prize -- all of that is very important , but instead of seeming of cosmic importance , it seems important only if he can do it in a happy , healthy world , only in a world in which he is deeply concerned about people .
You will find these ushers , I would say , by searching among the great scientists who have arrived at this stage .
These ushers would be well paid .
Because they would be well paid , they would only have to take those consulting jobs that appealed to them .
They could be made exempt from serving on committees .
In thinking about what the human animal might have gone through in the evolutionary process , have you wondered how some of the small changes which must have occurred could have had survival value ?
Have n't you wondered how they could have survived , when , in all of our experimental work every small change we make dies ?
I think that each of us , in each of our fields , has come to this conclusion : that every once in a while , after we have tried a multitude of little changes , each of which dies , we make a little change that gives an important result in terms of the whole .
We make a little change in one of the independent variables that gives an enormous change in a dependent variable that controls the behavior of the whole structure .
How many changes must have occurred in the human eye , occurred and died , before one change came along -- an apparently trivial change like a little red-sensitivity in the retina along with the black - and - white sensitivity -- that gave the whole animal a significant increase in its power to perceive and hunt down its enemies and find its food .
This is the kind of change that survives .
In my opinion , neither organisms nor organizations evolve slowly and surely into something better , but drift until some small change occurs which has immediate and overwhelming significance .
The special role of the human being is not to wait for these favorable accidents but deliberately to introduce the small change that will have great significance .
To treat young men like men ; to use modern recording techniques to capture the moment of exciting teaching ; to gather ninety great men out of our one - hundred and seventy million -- these , in retrospect , will seem like small changes indeed if they succeed in building a generation of greatness .
Edwin H. Land
Dr. Edwin H. Land , president of the Polaroid Corporation , is an imaginative scientist , an ingenious inventor , and a successful industrialist .
In 1956 he was appointed part - time Visiting Institute Professor at MIT , the first Fellow of the new School for Advanced Study .
It was intended that he devote as much attention to Institute educational and research activities as his duties at Polaroid might permit .
The A. D. Little Lecture and the two weeks of intensive conferences which preceded it constitute Dr. Land 's formal entry into Institute affairs .
A native of Connecticut , Dr. Land attended Norwich Academy ( Conn . ) and Harvard University .
He began his studies of the polarization of light while in college and established Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge in 1937 for the manufacture of optical devices employing the principles of polarization .
In 1932 , Dr. Land announced at a Harvard University colloquium the invention of the first light - polarizing material in sheet form , subsequently applied to sunglasses and camera filters , special ray filters and sighting devices for military instruments , " 3 - D " motion and still pictures , and non-dazzling automobile headlights .
He is the inventor of the Land Camera , introduced in 1947 , which makes possible immediate development of photographs .
Dr. Land is now working on new one - step photographic processes , films , and cameras .

Want to buy a home , but hampered by bad credit , an empty bank account or no job ?
No problem !
That may sound like an exaggeration of a late - night infomercial .
But it is , in effect , the pitch that a number of Web sites are making to consumers , saying insolvent home shoppers can be made to look more attractive to lenders .
The sites , for example , offer better credit scores by hitching customers to a stranger ’s credit card , or providing them pay stubs from a bogus company .
One has even offered a well - stocked bank account to rent for a month or two .
Industry experts say these sites , which are relatively new , played a role in fueling the rampant mortgage fraud that has caused a huge spike in loan defaults in recent months because people bought homes they could not afford .
“ There is a whole underground world — an online cottage industry — that has grown up that allows anyone to commit mortgage fraud , ” said Constance Wilson , executive vice president at the financial fraud detection firm Interthinx .

The survey recommended tours of duty should be shortened
The survey , by an army mental health advisory team , sampled more than 1,700 soldiers and marines between August and October 2006 .
It examined their views towards torture and the Iraqi civilian population .
A Pentagon official said the survey had looked under every rock and what was found was not always easy to look at .
The Pentagon survey found that less than half the troops in Iraq thought Iraqi civilians should be treated with dignity and respect .
More than a third believed that torture was acceptable if it helped save the life of a fellow soldier or if it helped get information about the insurgents .
About 10 % of those surveyed said they had actually mistreated Iraqi civilians by hitting or kicking them , or had damaged their property when it was not necessary to do so .
Troops suffering from anxiety , depression or stress were more likely to engage in unethical behaviour , together with those who had had a colleague wounded or killed in their unit .
Shorten deployments
A key recommendation to emerge was to shorten the tours of duty .
Those deployed longer than six months , or who had been to Iraq several times , were more likely to suffer from mental health problems .
But presently thousands of extra troops are being sent to Iraq as part of an offensive to try to curb the insurgency by October .
Tours are being extended , and units that do go home are being allowed less time to recover before being sent back .
Let the fun begin !

What is Suicide Food ?
Suicide Food is any depiction of animals that act as though they wish to be consumed .
Suicide Food actively participates in or celebrates its own demise .
Suicide Food identifies with the oppressor .
Suicide Food is a bellwether of our decadent society .
Suicide Food says , “ Hey !
Come on !
Eating meat is without any ethical ramifications !
See , Mr. Greenjeans ?
The animals are n’t complaining !
So what 's your problem ? ” Suicide Food is not funny .
Hold onto your hats .
( Or should that be dollars ? )
The Amero is coming .
I ’ve heard a lot of talk over the last few years about a new currency called the Amero that will replace dollars and pesos .
I thought at first it was just conjecture and gossip , but the more I have researched it , the more I believe it is not only real … but coming soon .
And as a writer who has your best monetary interests at heart , I feel you need to know at least a little about this .
A North American Union ( NAU ) with a common currency is not a new idea .
Herbert G. Grubel , a senior fellow of the Fraser Institute , came out with a book entitled “ The Case for the Amero ” in September of 1999 .
But the mass media has largely ignored it , with both the supporters and critics of the plan being relegated to obscure talk radio and Internet sites ( hopefully , this one does n’t fall into the latter ) .
However , since 1999 a case has been building for the new currency , and some believe the current administration is setting the stage for the introduction of the Amero very soon , as soon as 2010 some believe .
The lack of serious intervention on illegal immigration coupled with the continued devaluation of the dollar and its weakness in the world economy is in fact the perfect place to set the foundation for a new currency .
Or so I ’ve been told by various economists with far more smarts than myself .
The Security And Prosperity Partnership Of North America .
This is where many people believe the Amero will stem from .
This is not a phantom organization or conspiracy theory , the SPP exists and you can view it yourselves at www.spp.gov .
It was a ' dialogue ' ( some say agreement ) between President Bush , Prime Minister Harper and President Fox to enhance security and prosperity among the three nations ( prosperity for whom is obviously debatable ) .
What you ’ll notice is that the SPP is a trilateral partnership established to keep North America a safe and secure place to live and work .
So why the open borders and lack of serious control on illegal immigration ?
Surely such a plan would involve tighter security , not weaker .
Well , it comes down to this .
If there is a plan in the works to create a union of Canada , the USA and Mexico , the last thing you ’d want to do is close the borders .
Quite the opposite .
You want open borders .
It ’s good for business .
And as we all know , big business and large multi-national corporations are always looking for new ways to make a profit .
The NAU and the Amero is one such way .
The AMERO – who benefits ?
That ’s the big question .
Now , in Europe the Euro was not such a bad idea ( although I know many people who disagree ) .
The countries of Europe are all fairly well matched economically .
So , it made sense to simply create a Euro and encourage cost - effective trade between all the separate nations ( of course my home country Great Britain is still being difficult … as we always are ) .
It also reduced a whole bunch of costs associated with exchange rates , fees and so forth .
However , Canada , the USA and Mexico are hardly the same economically .
For a world super - power like the USA to consider diluting its economy with that of Canada and a ‘ third world ’ nation like Mexico , rife with corruption , seems at first ill - conceived .
Unless , of course , the ultimate goal is to create “ corporatism ” – the merger of big business with big government ( and something Mussolini referred to as the foundation of fascism ) .
Basically , with the NAU , multinationals are dealing with one currency ( the Amero ) , one controlling entity ( government ) and one set of rules for all .
And the benefit ?
Simple .
To enable the sale , purchase and movement of goods across the former three nations effortlessly and cheaply .
And let ’s not forget the creation of a super - cheap workforce and the eventual destruction of the middle class ( which is already happening ) .
As you can tell , I ’m clearly not a supporter of the NAU .
But I ’m not a supporter of any policy that seeks to make the rich even richer , and make a profit at the expense of the public .
As Tom DeWeese wrote in his article for the American Policy Center , “ The SPP is not about free trade .
Its use of public / private partnerships creates an elite of certain , chosen global corporations which basically become part of government at the expense of their competition and our national independence . ”
The NAFTA Super Highway .
Also known as the Trans Texas Corridor , this is another huge benefit to big corporations that would be made possible by the NAU and the Amero .
It is basically a massive super - highway , ten lanes wide , with rail lines , utility corridors and natural gas and oil power lines running down the center .
It ’s purpose ?
To transport containers loaded in foreign lands ( Indonesia , China etc ) from Mexican ports , through the USA and up to Canada with massively reduced transportation costs .
Such a move would only decrease the security of America , to such an extent that the borders would literally be wiped out .
And the flood of Mexican trucks using the highway would not be required to meet current US standards of safety .
Getting the picture ?
At the end of the day , the Amero is a move to will make a select few so rich , they ’ll make Bill Gates look like a welfare case .
Money is power … and ultimately , that ’s what this is all about .
What can you do about it ?
Well , keeping yourselves informed is the first step .
I have n’t even scratched the surface here .
So far , the public has been kept in the dark about the Amero and the NAU , and before you get a chance to protest you ’ll be spending you new , devalued currency and wondering what happened .
Here are the links to several sites you can read .
I have included information that ’s both for and against the NAU and Amero , you are all smart people , you can chew the facts over and make up your own minds .
More reading .

Blue Cross of California “ routinely ” violated state law when it canceled individual health insurance coverage after policyholders got pregnant or sick , making no attempt to determine whether they did anything to merit such “ harsh ” treatment , according to a state investigation of practices that appear to be industrywide .
State regulators plan similar investigations of other health plans in California , and the findings against Blue Cross ratchet up the risk of liability for other insurers , many of whom face lawsuits from consumers who claim they were illegally dumped and subjected to substantial hardships .
As a result of its unprecedented investigation , the Department of Managed Health Care on Thursday said that it had fined Blue Cross $ 1 million -- an amount immediately criticized by canceled policyholders and consumer advocates as too small to matter to an insurer whose parent company , WellPoint Inc. , earned $ 3.1 billion in profit last year on revenue of $ 57 billion .
Indianapolis - based WellPoint disputed the findings , saying it acted legally and that some rescissions are necessary to combat fraud .
Advertisement
“ The vast majority of Blue Cross ’ rescissions are unquestionably proper under any criteria , ” WellPoint said .
At issue are individual policies , the type needed by consumers who cannot get group coverage from employers or others .
Although insurers cannot deny coverage to members of group plans , state law allows insurers to deny granting individual policies to applicants with preexisting medical conditions .
The state investigation found that Blue Cross used computer programs and a dedicated department to systematically investigate and cancel the policies of pregnant women and the chronically ill regardless of whether they intentionally lied on their applications to cover up preexisting medical conditions -- a standard required by state law for canceling individual policies .
Regulators examined 90 randomly selected cases of policy cancellations -- out of about 1,000 a year in California -- and found violations in each one .

“ This looks like ‘ Rescission Inc. , ’ ” said Bryan Liang , director of the Institute of Health Law Studies at California Western School of Law in San Diego .
“ It ’s clear if 100 % of these individuals had their policies illegally pulled , that means that there ’s a problem .
These are just the tip of the iceberg . ”
The state report said the legal standard for cancellation was high because it put plan members at great risk -- financially and medically -- and because it left physicians and hospitals holding the bag for services rendered in good faith and often with prior authorization from the insurer .
“ Rescission is the harshest possible punishment , ” Department of Managed Health Care Director Cindy Ehnes said .
“ It leaves providers unpaid and it leaves the enrollee uninsurable . ”
About 6.5 million California residents lack health insurance .

Ehnes said she hoped that the latest fine -- and a vow by the agency to review the company ’s progress in 18 months -- would encourage Blue Cross , the state ’s largest health plan , to change and set an example for others .
“ They feel clobbered by this fine , ” she said .
“ It ’s not intended to go easy on them . ”
The department also plans to open similar investigations of Kaiser Permanente next month and , later , Blue Shield of California , HealthNet and PacifiCare , she said .
“ We are now trying to clean up an industry practice , ” Ehnes said .
“ We insist on fair processes . ”

The Blue Cross investigation was fueled by Los Angeles Times stories that disclosed that the insurer , along with other health plans , routinely canceled coverage of individual policyholders after they got sick , prompting some to lose their homes and suffer other hardships .
Blue Cross disputed the state ’s findings in a detailed response filed with the department .
Among other things , the company said that “ the underpinnings of the report are based largely on factual errors by the department ’s reviewers . ”
Ehnes said the reviewers relied on documentation in the company ’s case files .
The company also said it had made substantial changes since January 2004 to early 2006 , the period reviewed by the department .

The department ’s report noted that the company had taken steps to improve its process for reviewing applications for individual policies , to determine whether applicants are truthful about their medical conditions .
But it concluded that the company had not yet adequately addressed its failure to show willful misrepresentation on the part of the policyholders targeted for rescission .
Blue Cross parent WellPoint said in a statement Thursday that it continued to disagree about what the law requires .
“ California law is clear that rescission generally does not require a showing of intent to deceive or willful misrepresentation , ” WellPoint spokeswoman Shannon Troughton said .
“ All that is required for misrepresentation to be ‘ intentional ’ is that the true facts be known to the applicant .
If the applicant had no present knowledge of the facts sought or failed to appreciate the significance of information , an incorrect or incomplete response would not constitute grounds for rescission . ”
The company reiterated its assertion that rescissions affected a small portion of its business .

Troughton said the state agency notified the company Thursday of its intent to file the accusation and impose the fine .
The notice also said that before filing the accusation , Blue Cross would have an opportunity to show why it was not in violation of the law , she said .
The Department of Managed Health Care also is reviewing a number of individual complaints of allegedly improper rescissions involving Blue Cross and other insurers .
Those cases also could result in fines and coverage reinstatement .
Blue Cross is appealing a $ 200,000 fine imposed in September , the first in an individual rescission case .
In that matter , the department accused the health plan of illegally canceling a woman ’s medical policy because she did not disclose corrective surgery she had undergone 23 years earlier .
After that accusation , the company said it would make a series of revisions , including the development of new application language ; new written policies and procedures ; the creation of a rescission review panel , including at least one physician ; and the appointment of a consumer ombudsman for rescissions .
Advertisement
WellPoint said Blue Cross would continue trying to resolve its differences with regulators .
But , it maintained , “ Blue Cross has a rigorous and thoughtful process it follows in every case where rescission review occurs because health insurance is so critically important to each and every one of our members . ”
Jerry Flanagan , a patient advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights , said the investigation ’s findings should help the department move forward in its effort to develop regulations to clarify the law and toughen sanctions for rescission scofflaws .
“ Patients do not go to medical school and rarely know of or understand the information in their medical records , ” he said .
“ That ’s why the law requires plans to check medical records ahead of time and bars them from rescinding coverage unless they can show the patient lied on their application . ”
William Shernoff , a Claremont lawyer who is representing former policyholders in a class - action suit against Blue Cross , said the department ’s report corroborated what he found through depositions of company employees and documents obtained through discovery .

“ They basically do n’t attempt to prove willful misrepresentation , and their medical underwriting is lax in most cases , ” he said .

IT was two years ago , in June 2005 , that residents of the Upper West Side got their first glimpse of the two glass - sheathed towers that were to rise on Broadway at 99th Street .
The local community board was having its monthly land use meeting — not generally an occasion of high drama — and Gary Barnett , president of the Extell Development Company , came to share renderings of his proposed buildings .
As he unveiled them , a gasp was heard throughout the room .
“ People shrieked , ” recalls Sheldon Fine , chairman of Community Board 7 .
Mr. Barnett had spent millions of dollars acquiring air rights from properties next to his own lots on the east and west sides of Broadway .
These air rights , as the neighborhood came to learn , allowed him to build hundreds of feet higher than the 16 - story ceiling that defines much of Broadway above 96th Street .
For those who still did n’t grasp Mr. Barnett ’s intentions , the name he gave his towers was a hint : Ariel East and Ariel West .
According to Mr. Barnett , the name Ariel was borrowed from a star .
In fact , the only celestial body commonly known by that name is one of the moons of the planet Uranus , but the message was clear .
Mr. Barnett aimed high .
Not since Donald Trump ’s Riverside South project in the early 1990s , said Mr. Fine , has a set of buildings on the Upper West Side aroused as much opposition as Mr. Barnett ’s towers .
Petitions circulated , gathering signatures by the thousands .
Demonstrators took to the streets .
None of this , however , did anything to stop the towers .
Floor by floor they rose , plywood forms giving way to rebar and concrete , and finally to acres of glass .
Residents will begin moving into Ariel East in September and into Ariel West later in the year .

A cow that took a wrong turning ended up going for a dip in a swimming pool in Pittsfield , Massachusetts .
The adventurous animal had apparently escaped from a nearby farm with several other cows on Monday .
Police officers eventually rescued the cow with a ramp and netting and the animal was subsequently returned to its field .
According to Pittsfield police , the cow weighed close to 455 kilograms ( 1000 pounds ) .
Germany :
The founding of the " Left Party "
Oskar Lafontaine 's demagogic clichés
By Ulrich Rippert
28 June 2007
At the recent founding conference of the “ Left Party ” — through the merging of the Party of Democratic Socialism - Left Party and the Election Alternative — the speech by co-chairman Oskar Lafontaine met with a storm of enthusiasm and standing ovations from the delegates and guests .
Lafontaine styled himself in the tradition of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht , fulminating against war and capitalism , and expressing his support for the general strike “ as a means of democratic struggle . ”
However , if his words are examined somewhat more closely , it is clear that the radical clichés served only to cover over his complete adaptation to the existing bourgeois order .
As in his earlier speeches and writings , Lafontaine ’s main theme was to advocate a return to the policy of social reforms that was practiced in the 1970s in West Germany .
Accordingly , the third role model he cited , alongside Liebknecht and Luxemburg , was the social democratic chancellor of that time , Willy Brandt .
Nowhere in his speech did Lafontaine deal with the fact that the globalisation of production has undermined the policy of social reformism .
He did not mention the fact that the decline of social democracy is a worldwide phenomenon .
Neither did he draw up a balance sheet of the policy and role of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , in which he was a member for 40 years , including serving as its chairman .
It was a speech full of subterfuge and contradictions , which sought to suffocate any serious thought — a deliberately diversionary political manoeuvre .
Twelve years earlier , Lafontaine delivered a similar speech at the SPD ’s Mannheim party congress .
At that time , he also appealed to “ the hopes of millions ” and pledged himself to a “ left of centre majority ” ; whereupon he was elected chairman of the SPD , much to the surprise of the incumbent Rudolf Scharping .
In his recent speech , he characterised the SPD functionaries — the same ones who acclaimed him 12 years ago — as “ reformist hooligans , ” whose retrogressive measures had destroyed the welfare state in the subsequent years .
Lafontaine did not explain how this had come about and what lessons should be drawn .
As SPD chairman , Lafontaine was the architect of the SPD - Green Party coalition following the election victory of 1998 .
His resignation as finance minister and party chairman a few months later does not change the fact that the Gerhard Schröder ( SPD ) - Joschka Fischer ( Green Party ) government was the result of his project of bringing the two parties together in office .
He shares responsibility for the social misery about which he now loudly complains .
Today , Lafontaine no longer advocates an SPD - Green Party alliance , but one between the SPD and the newly founded Left Party he leads .
His aim is to establish coalitions between the Left Party and SPD at the federal and state level .
He claims the Left Party would drive the SPD forward towards social reforms .
After everything that has happened over the past years , anyone who believes this is either politically naive or a willing dupe .
The delegates at the founding congress of the Left Party in Berlin only needed to look out of the window .
For six years , Berlin city hall has been governed by the SPD in alliance with the Party of Democratic Socialism .
The precursor to the Left Party has already shown what the radical clichés uttered at its party congresses really mean when they are put into practice and it assumes government responsibility .
Under the rule of the SPD - PDS coalition in the Berlin city legislature , some 15,000 public service jobs have been destroyed , salaries cut by 10 percent , drastic reductions implemented in pay and staffing in public transport and at universities and schools , as well as the imposition of large increases in student fees and child care charges .
Furthermore , 65,000 dwellings belonging to the GSW public housing corporation were sold off to the American investor and speculator Cerberus .
This all puts Berlin in top place among Germany ’s länder ( states ) when it comes to public sector cuts .
More clearly than in his earlier speeches , Lafontaine portrayed the welfare state as a pillar of bourgeois social order .
“ We are the party of the welfare state , ” he told the delegates , and stressed why it was so dangerous to systematically dismantle such a set - up — because “ millions of Germans identified it with their state . ”
If people had been asked in the past , “ what do you value about your state , your nation , then they would have said the welfare state , ” Lafontaine said .
He warned that the destruction of the welfare state leads to the destabilisation of the existing social order ; the “ reformist hooligans ” had no idea how dangerous their neo-liberal policies were .
By “ defending the welfare state ” Lafontaine means subordination to the national state .
It should not be accepted that “ robber baron capitalism , the finance capitalism operating worldwide should do so without the national states putting an end to its negative activities and imposing limits , ” he said .
This appeal for the national state to impose limits on international capitalism is reactionary and utopian .
It boils down to protectionist measures and the walling off the borders .
It stands contrary to a socialist perspective , which counterposes to global capital the international unity of the working class .
It serves to divide the working class , orienting workers to the national interests of “ their own ” country .
This nationalist orientation weighs far more heavily than everything else that Lafontaine said in his speech against the Iraq war and the deployment of Germany ’s armed forces in Afghanistan — and as always using grandiose clichés .
Thus , he quoted the French socialist Jean Jaurès , who on the eve of the First World War said , “ Capitalism carries war within itself as do clouds the rain ! ”
But subordination to the national state and national interests is the direct precursor to supporting imperialist wars , which are always justified in the name of the national interest .
Nobody has made this clearer historically than the SPD , when the party voted for war credits in August 1914 .
In this question too , Lafontaine is a social democrat through and through .
Lafontaine ’s nationalist reaction to globalisation is directly linked to his social orientation .
The Left Party regards the effects of globalisation from the same view point as a small businessperson , who feels threatened by the power of the global corporations and who calls upon the national state for help in order to impose customs barriers , tax reductions and other protectionist measures and competitive advantages .
Lafontaine said that there were 3 million small enterprises in Germany , “ which employ fewer than 10 people and have a turnover of less than € 10 million . ”
These are “ important enterprises in our national economy ” and represent the “ most important partners ” for the Left Party , because “ even in these , exploitation and self exploitation can be found . ”
These small firms have to be particularly fostered , according to Lafontaine .
The collaboration of the Left Party and the trade union bureaucracy also runs along the same nationalist lines .
All the executive committee speakers — Gregor Gysi , Lothar Bisky and Lafontaine — emphasised the presence at the party congress of a large number of union officials and official delegations from individual domestic and foreign trade unions .
While millions of workers daily experience the fact that union officials and the works councils collaborate closely with the corporate boards of directors as accomplices in implementing lower wages and welfare cuts , the Left Party praises the union bureaucracy as its most important political ally .
Fausto Bertinotti , the chairman of the Italian party Rifondazione Comunista , was also fêted at the congress as a “ long - standing friend . ”
This , more than anything else , makes clear where the political journey of the Left Party is heading .
For quite some time , Rifondazione Comunista has been heralded by so - called “ lefts ” throughout Europe as the shining example for a “ left - wing party , ” like the one that has now been founded in Germany .
Like the Party of Democratic Socialism , Rifondazione Comunista developed in 1991 as a product of the decay of Stalinism .
At that time , Bertinotti , who began his political career in the Socialist Party under Bettino Craxi , crossing over to the Italian Communist Party ( PCI ) in 1967 and afterwards making his livelihood as a trade union functionary , rejected the transformation of the Italian Communist Party into an openly social democratic party , instead creating Rifondazione , in which numerous old Stalinists and their hangers - on once again found a home .
In spring of last year , Bertinotti was elected president of the chamber of deputies in Rome .
Not only did he thereby take on the third - highest public office in Italy , but his party also became an important prop of the Prodi government , which is carrying out harsh attacks against the working class and has sent Italian troops to Afghanistan and Lebanon .
Summarising Lafontaine ’s speech and developments at the congress , the following balance sheet can be drawn up :
The Left Party is not an imperfect or confused expression of political ferment and the search for viable answers to the great problems of society .
It does not reflect the moods that now prevail in workplaces and which could be seen in the readiness to strike by workers at Deutsche Telekom , Airbus or in the auto industry .
Rather , in view of increasing disillusionment with the SPD , the Left Party is trying to create a bureaucratic instrument that can suppress any debate over socialist perspectives and prevent a radicalisation of the working class .
While many disillusioned workers are turning away from the SPD , the Left Party seeks to preserve illusions in a social reformist programme .
" Fabbing " a Lego tire .

The Altair 8800 , introduced in the early 1970s , was the first computer you could build at home from a kit .
It was crude , did n't do much , but many historians would say that it launched the desktop computer revolution .
Hod Lipson , Cornell assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , thinks a little machine he calls a Fab@Home may have the same impact .
Some day , Lipson believes , every home will have a " fabber , " a machine that replicates objects from plans supplied by a computer .
Such devices could change how we acquire common products , he suggests : Instead of buying an iPod , you would download the plans over the Internet and the fabber would make one for you .
Such machines could evolve from the 3 - D printers currently used by industrial engineers for " rapid prototyping . "
They design parts in computer - aided design programs and feed the designs to 3 - D printers to make working plastic models .
A 3 - D printer has a small nozzle that scans back and forth across a surface , depositing tiny droplets of quick - hardening plastic .
After each scan , the nozzle moves up a notch and scans again until it has built up the complete object , layer by layer .
With multiple nozzles or a means of swapping supply cartridges , the machine can create objects made of many different materials .
An electronic circuit , for example , can be made by combining an organic semiconductor , metallic inks and ceramic insulators .
Price tags for these machines average around $ 100,000 , but you can build your own Fab@Home for about $ 2,300 worth of off - the - shelf parts .
The prototype , designed by Evan Malone , a Ph.D. candidate in Lipson 's Computational Synthesis Laboratory , is slower than the commercial models , and its resolution , or ability or produce fine detail , is lower , but people are finding practical -- and often unexpected -- uses for it .
A high school student in Kentucky is " fabbing " chocolate bars .
Commercial machines can't be modified , which , Lipson says , impedes the progress of the technology , but the Fab@Home is " open source . "
Anyone can download the plans at www.fabathome.org , which is getting about 20,000 hits a day .
The site also includes construction hints , ideas for applications , notes on the history of 3 - D printing and discussion groups .
People are invited and encouraged to make improvements , and a sort of cult is slowly forming .
So far , Lipson says , about a dozen people have said they are building one , and he knows of three that are actually up and running -- two at the University of Washington and one in Innsbruck , Austria .
Lipson 's group has built several and lent a couple to other researchers .
Some recent developments :
• Biologists at Rockefeller University have been using a Fab@Home to deposit slime mold cells in various arrangements to see how the distribution influences their ability to form colony organisms .
• The British magazine Auto Express suggests that fabbers could be used to make auto parts , allowing individuals to customize cars in ways that were previously available only to those with large manufacturing facilities .
• While the usual expectation is to make solid objects out of epoxy or other quick - hardening plastic , the Fab@Home also can be used with plaster , Play - Doh , silicone , wax ( to make forms for casting ) , low - melting - point metals and a variety of other materials .
• Cornell graduate student Dan Periard and Jennifer Yao '08 have been loading commercial frosting into the machine to make cake decorations .
It 's not frivolous work , Lipson says : Because frosting dissolves in water it can provide temporary support for hollow structures and later be washed away .
• A high school student in Kentucky is experimenting with a heated syringe to " fab " with chocolate .
Future fabbing machines will have to shift from one raw material to another in midstream and probably deposit material in three dimensions , not just layers , says Lipson .
Research in his lab is taking early steps .
Malone has built a machine that uses a rack of interchangeable cartridges to make devices out of several materials at once .
So far , it has made a working battery , complete with outer case .
Malone 's long - range goal is to " print " a complete robot , including limbs , actuators , control circuitry and batteries .
Meanwhile , Lipson says , just as the Altair inspired tinkerers to add disk drives , keyboards and monitors and write operating systems and word processors , perhaps the Fab@Home will inspire new fabbing technology .

I ’ve been wondering about this for a while .
We hear about how the more popular web frameworks can scale with an n-tier architecture , but what about Seaside ?
Session state is maintained inside of the Squeak image , and unlike other web frameworks it does not save session state to a database .
I imagine it lacks that capability at this point .
The more popular web frameworks gain scalability by allowing you to configure them so they save state to a database or some other form of persistence that is universally available to all of the web servers in a farm .
This way the same application can be installed on multiple servers , and a load balancer can assess how busy any server is and switch a client to a server that is less busy , even while the user is in the middle of using the application , while still maintaining application state for that client .
This is done so that everyone can have their requests answered in a reasonable amount of time without bringing a server to its knees .
Ramon Leon at On Smalltalk has made a good start at providing an answer on how to scale Seaside .
His answer is to run multiple Squeak images at the same time , and have a load balancer choose which image a client is directed to .
After that point the client will continue to interact with the image that was chosen for it , without switching to other images in mid-use .
He called this a “ sticky session ” scheme .
He provides some details about how to set this up , but since the load balancing scheme he ’s using is very similar to how Ruby on Rails ( RoR ) is load balanced he directs people to look up on the web how it ’s done for RoR.
RoR and Seaside are similar in that both run their own simple http servers .
I ’m not sure if RoR ’s server has a name , but Seaside ’s is called “ Comanche ” .
Since they both have a similar http setup it ’s possible to use the same load balancing software with both .
He goes into detail describing his maintenance tools ( shell scripts ) , since there are some reliability issues with the software he uses .
He has no major complaints with it though .
I ’m real happy Ramon talked about this .
He is answering the questions anyone curious about Seaside would have about the viability of deploying it in a corporate environment .
Keep up the good work , Ramon .
We 've all probably experienced Security by Obscurity .
Most of us have now seen Security by Oblivity .
Kurt G. is the only one I know who has come face - to - face with Security by Insanity ....
It all began on the first interview , the moment I entered their building .
I was asked to sign a four - page Non-Disclosure Agreement and was sternly warned that no recording devices of any kind were allowed in the building .
It did n't seem that unheard of , so I assured them that I had no intention of recording the interview and signed the agreement , thereby swearing on my life that I would never describe to another living soul what I saw on the premises that day .
To this day , I cannot reveal which motivational poster I saw framed in the only room I was allowed to see : the conference room off the entrance .
The interview was not terribly off - base , though it did strike me as odd that I would have to wait for the second interview to see their shop floor .
And that was if I was " lucky . "
As the hiring manager put it , " we do n't kiss on the first date . "
I guess that was all it took for me to agree to a second interview , one week later .
When I arrived for the second interview , they reminded me that no recording devices were allowed , and that I would have to sign yet another Non-Disclosure Agreement before I could even be considered for entry in the inner sanctum that lay beyond the conference room door .
After a brief chat and some discussion amongst themselves , they deemed that I was trustworthy enough to see the secret realms and guided me inside .
The core of their daily activity was in the electronics workshop , in which a few dozen subdued technicians hunched quietly over their test circuits , jotting down notes .
I was told that technicians ' notebooks were locked up every night in a safe to make sure not even a single scrap of paper could leave the building undetected .
Additionally radios , laptops , recordable media , and even music playing devices were banned from entering the premises .
Makes sense , after all .
Music leads to dancing .
By now you may have guessed that this interview happened at Area 51 and this company was reconstructing a top secret warp drive engine salvaged from a UFO .
Not quite .
They were making test equipment for timing circuits .
That 's it .
That was their big secret ( pray I do n't get sued ) .
The company 's claim to fame was that they made the best damn circuit test equipment money could buy .
Though it was n't for sale yet ( it was still being tested ) , they were certain that their phantom competitors were trying to steal their ideas .
In fact , they came right out and asked me if I worked for the archrivals , and also reminded me that I better not be lying because I already signed paper stating that I was not a corporate spy .
Thank goodness I was n't a spy .
At the end of the second interview they handed me a 14 page contract , a mere review copy of their standard Employee Agreement .
The document mostly spelled out the various entertainment devices employees were not allowed to bring into the building , the number of minutes per lunch break , and the process of turning in notebooks at of the end of each day .
This did n't mean that I was hired ; it was simply an opportunity to read through the contract in case I had any questions about it .
In the meantime , once they were sure I was not a corporate spy , they might ask me back for a third interview .
Another week passed and I was back in their conference room , ready to discuss the Employee Agreement .
The first question I had was about the workweek : the contract described a forty - hour week in one part , yet mentioned that employees would work six days a week , eight hours a day .
Before I could finish the question , the VP suddenly froze and starred stunned by my copy of their Sacred Contract .
He saw my pencil marks on the page , where I underlined the two conflicting sections .
He snatched the document out of my hand and glared at the pencil markings .
He flipped from page and to page , and to his disgust he found MORE PENCIL MARKS !
Not just in the margins , but on the words themselves !
Pencil marks !
There were ugly questions marks , lines , arrows , and circles around words ; it was appalling to him !
He looked up from the paper and gave me stare of utter sadness and betrayal .
" You ... altered The Contract " he mumbled .
" No , " I corrected him , " I made a few notes on the review copy you gave me ; you told me to review it , and so , these are my notes . "
" You altered ... The Contract ! , " he insisted .
" Errm ... no , " I did n't know how simplify it further him , " this is not a contract unless we both sign it .
Nothing has been signed yet .
You told me last week that this is just a review copy , and those pencil marks are just my comments about it . "
The VP sat silent and confused .
He flipped through my copy again , growing more and more disgusted at each pencil mark .
He dashed out of the conference room in search of a pencil eraser .
He return moments later , exasperated and unable to find a pencil eraser anywhere in the building because .
After all , erasers can be used to alter data and , therefore , were a security risk .
Only pens were allowed in the building .
Blue ink , to be exact .
He had no idea what to do ; he had no access to the tools that could remove my offensive markings on The Contract .
I offered this brilliant can - do solution instead : " You could just go back to your desk and print a new copy , right ? "
That made no sense to him .
No , ca n't do that .
He shook his head .
No. NO !!!
I calmly tried to explain it to him : " We do n't have to sign this copy of The Contract .
If we 're going to sign anything , you 'd print a fresh copy , and then we would sign that copy . "
He could n't hear me .
There were pencil marks on The Contract !
Pencil marks !
He grabbed my pencil marked pages and bolted out the door again , leaving me alone in the conference room to contemplate the horrible things I had done .
After about fifteen minutes , three people entered the conference room .
They did not sit .
They stood over me .
The first speak was the President and Founder of the company .
" Did you ... do this ? " she asked referring to pencil markings on The Contract .
" Yes , you gave a copy for review , and asked me to review it , so I sketched a few comments on my copy . "
" YOU ALTERED THE CONTRACT !!! " she yelled , glaring at me in disbelief .
" That 's not a contract unless we both sign it . "
I tried to explain again .
" Nobody signed that . "
" We ca n't sign this ! " she said , " YOU ALTERED IT !!! "
" I did not expect to sign that . "
I said , " I always assumed we 'd sign a fresh copy .
You guys can print another copy of this document , ca n't you ? "
Rather than answer my question she announced " Now I have to call my lawyer ! " and stormed out of the room .
The VP and head of HR were left standing there wagging their heads at me .
" You should n't have done that , " one of them gravely mumbled at me .
" No , you ca n't alter a contract . " the other chimed in .
We sat in silence for several minutes until the President returned , resolute with her lawyer 's verdict .
I assumed that , at this point , he 'd congratulate me for being on Candid Camera .
Not quite .
" We can not sign this copy ; we have to destroy it and print a new copy . "
That seemed reasonable .
Everyone agreed that would solve our great dilemma .
" BUT THIS TIME ... " she sternly warned me , " DON'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO IT ! "
I apologized and assured her that I would not even think to do such a horrendous crime to any graven images of The Contract .
With peace and calmness restored , the VP explained to me the Saturday work policy : everyone has to work on Saturday , including the engineers , which would be me .
Any more questions ?
I did n't dare ask , so the interview was over .
Just for laughs , I waited by the phone for a few weeks just in case they made me an offer .
This was America in the 90's so could I expect an amazing salary ?
A signing bonus ?
A company car ?
Stock options ?
Keys to the time share in Bermuda ?
Not quite .
They called me with their best offer : $ 23 K / year .
Salary .
No benefits .
For 48 hours / week .
And they said they were being generous because their normal starting pay for engineers was $ 22 K .
I laughed and hung up the phone .
They did n't call back .
I threw away The Contract .
The Vatican described abortion as " murder "
The Vatican , which regards life as sacred from the moment of conception , said it was an " inevitable consequence " of the group 's policy change .
Amnesty said it was not promoting abortion as a universal right .
But the group said that women had a right to choose , particularly in cases of rape or incest .
" No more financing of Amnesty International after the organisation 's pro-abortion about - turn , " said a statement from the Roman Catholic Church 's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace .
The Church 's request covers funding from Catholic groups , non-governmental organisations , parishes , schools and individuals .
' Misrepresented account '
The council 's president , Cardinal Renato Martino , described abortion as " murder " .
" And to justify it selectively , in the event of rape , that is to define an innocent child in the belly of its mother as an enemy , as ' something one can destroy ' , " the cardinal said .
According to Roman Catholic doctrine , life - which begins with conception - must be respected .
Amnesty says it does not take any position on whether abortion is right or wrong .
But it defended its new position in support of abortion for women when their health is in danger or human rights are violated , especially in cases of rape or incest .
" We are saying broadly that to criminalise women 's management of their sexual reproductive right is the wrong answer , " Amnesty 's deputy Secretary General Kate Gilmore told Reuters news agency .
" The Catholic Church , through a misrepresented account of our position on selective aspects of abortion , is placing in peril work on human rights , " Ms Gilmore said .
Some 45 million unintended pregnancies are terminated around the world every year , the World Health Organisation says .
Nearly 70,000 women die annually from unsafe abortions , it says .
THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE : are you surprised that " My Humps " won the poll ?
First , a note on what we mean by the worst lyrics of all time .
Keep in mind this is n’t a constitutional friggin ’ ammendment , we bent our own rules along the way .
The Phoenix.com set out to isolate the single line , or at most a couple of lines , within a popular song that was the most horrific , the most god awful , the most offensively bad .
The rest of the song ’s lyrics could be worthy of Dylan ( a guy who has been known to write a few bum lines every now and again ) .
The music could ’ve been Mozart ( or Thom Yorke ) .
We wanted the worst lines .
And we got them .
And , before everyone starts in on us : yes , we know , it 's hard to write a song , we 've never written any popular songs , these people sleep with beautiful women and / or men and / or both , yadda yadda yadda .
Right , we 're aware .
Save the keystrokes , Mr. Aiken .
THE SONG : Black Eyed Peas , " My Humps "
THE LYRIC : “ My hump , my hump , my hump , my hump , my hump ,
My hump , my hump , my hump , my lovely lady lumps . ”
THE VERDICT : This has got to be the least appealing description for the female anatomy every conceived .
THE SONG : LFO , “ Summer Girls ”
THE LYRIC : “ New Kids
On the Block had a bunch of hits / Chinese food makes me sick /
And I think it 's fly when girls stop by for the summer , for the summer . ”
THE VERDICT : We would print out the whole song , but we threw up after they rhymed “ speakin ’ ” with “ Alex P. Keaton . ”
THE SONG : Chubb Rock , “ Mr. Large ”
THE LYRIC : “ Like Mario Puzo , I 'm The Don. W - W - I'M - THE - SHIT-DOT-COM ”
THE VERDICT : We keep trying to get to this website .
Keep getting error messages .
Oh , wait .
Yeah , he only says two Ws .
The last W was obviously being reserved for “ what the fuck ? ”
THE SONG : Eminem , " Ass Like That "
THE LYRIC : “ I ai n’t never seen an ass like that /
The way you move it , you make my peepee go DOING DOING DOING ”
THE VERDICT : One ' doing ' would have sufficed , no ?
THE SONG : Avril Lavigne , " Sk8r Boi "
THE LYRIC : “ He was a boy , she was a girl / Can I make it any more obvious . ”
THE VERDICT : Ma’am , could you make it a bit more obvious ?
We ’re not all sophisticated like y’all Degrassi - watching Canadians .
By the way , it 's been pointed out before , but we 've never known a " Sk8tr Boi " who had anything resembling girl trouble .
THE SONG : Warrant , " Cherry Pie "
THE LYRIC : “ Swingin ' in the living room / Swingin ' in the kitchen / Most folks do n't / ' cause they 're too busy bitchin ' / Swingin ' in there ' cause /
She wanted me to feed her /
So I mixed up the batter / And she licked the beater . ”
THE VERDICT : The reason most people do n’t swing ?
Because they ’re too busy bitching .
Makes sense to us .
THE SONG : Spice Girls , “ Wannabe ”
THE LYRIC : " If you wanna be my lover , you gotta get with my friends ”
THE VERDICT : Okay , no guy is going to say no to that ( as long as Gerri turns the lights off ) .
THE OTHER LYRIC : “ Make it last forever .
Friendship never ends ”
THE VERDICT : Okay , girl power , we get it .
Do n’t really see how it has anything to do with us guys , but fine .
STILL MORE LYRIC : “ If you wanna be my lover , you have got to give ”
THE VERDICT : Alright , now it ’s getting a little annoying .
I ’m fucking all four of your friends , like you told me to in the first line .
What else do you want ?
THE FINAL LYRIC : " Taking is too easy , but that 's the way it is . ”
THE VERDICT : Slam your body down and zigazig ah , indeed .
And yeah , we know , 1996 called and they want their jokes back .
THE SONG : Train “ Drops of Jupiter ”
THE LYRIC : “ Can you imagine no first dance , freeze dried romance five - hour phone conversation / The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me ”
THE VERDICT : First we ’re traveling in space all fine and dandy , then he starts name - dropping fads from the year 2000 as if it ’s a VH1 special and he ’s Hal Sparks .
Soy Lattes ?
Tae Bo ? Yes , Venus did blow our minds .
THE SONG : America , " A Horse With No Name "
THE LYRIC : " There were plants and birds and rocks and things "
THE VERDICT : What , did he get tired ?
Rocks and things ?
Try a fuckin’ cactus .
Dirt ?
Bugs ?
THE SONG : Limp Bizkit , " Break Stuff "
THE LYRIC : " It 's just one of those days / When you do n't wanna wake up / Everything is fucked / Everybody sucks / You do n't really know why / But you wanna justify / Rippin ' someone 's head off "
THE VERDICT : Music is supposed to move people .
This song just happened to move people to assault women and set fires at Woodstock ’99 .
Where there is demand there is growth .
The annual rise in tourists , and the country ’s emerging middle - to - high end consumers , is driving the property demand upwards .

# 8 = Volume 3 , Part 1 = March 1976 Charles Elkins Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION
Novels : Historical Materialism Distorted into Cyclical Psycho- History Among SF series , surely none has enjoyed such spectacular popularity as Isaac Asimov ’s FOUNDATION stories .
Asimov has been awarded a Hugo " for the best all time science fiction series , " and many SF aficionados describe their first encounter with Asimov ’s novels in religious terms .
Alva Rogers ’ response is typical : the FOUNDATION stories , he says , " are some of the greatest science fiction ever written , with a Sense of Wonder in the underlying concept that is truly out of this world . "
1
Moreover , despite some genuine questions which serious SF critics , such as Damon Knight , have raised with regard to the underlying concept of THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY , it continues to go through printing after printing .
1 . It is difficult to put one ’s finger on precisely what element or elements so fascinate readers .
From just about any formal perspective , THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY the foundation trilogy is seriously flawed .
The characters are undifferentiated and one - dimensional .
Stylistically , the novels are disasters , and Asimov ’s ear for dialogue is simply atrocious .
The characters speak with a monotonous rhythm and impoverished vocabulary characteristic of American teenagers ’ popular reading in the Forties and Fifties ; the few exceptions are no better — e.g. the Mule , who , in the disguise of the Clown , speaks a pseudo - archaic courtly dialect , or Lord Darwin , who speaks like Elmer Fudd , or the archetypal Jewish Mother who can say , " So shut your mouth , Pappa .
Into you anybody could bump . "
2
The distinctive vocabulary traits are as a rule ludicrous : God ! is replaced by Galaxy ! , and when a character really wants to express his disgust or anger , he cries , " Son - of - a - Spacer ! " or " I do n’t care an electron ! " ( § 1:5:1 ) .
To describe the characters ’ annoyance , arrogance , or bitterness , Asimov uses again and again one favorite adjective and adverb , sardonic ( ally ) : " Sutt ’s eyes gleamed sardonically " ( § 1:5:1 ) ; " Mallow stared him down sardonically " ( § 1:5:4 ) ; " Riose looked sardonic " ( § 2:5 ) ; " [ Devers ] stared at the two with sardonic belligerence " ( § 2:5 ) " ‘ What ; ’s wrong , trader ? ’ he asked sardonically " ( § 2:7 ) ; " The smooth lines of Pritcher ’s dark face twitched sardonically " ( § 3:2 ) ; " But Anthor ’s eyes opened , quite suddenly , and fixed themselves sardonically on Munn ’s countenance " ( §3:20 ) .
Evidently , all people in all time periods will be sardonic .
In the 12,000th year after the founding of the First Galactic Empire , characters still use terms drawn from the " western " — e.g. " lynching party " ( § 2:7 ) — and slogans imported from the political slang of our times — e.g. " lickspittle clique of appeasers out of City Hall " ( § 1:3:2 ) .
Nor is this merely a question of literary niceties .
If language is both a symbolic screen through which we filter reality and an instrument by which we explore and change reality , then Asimov ’s style is totally inappropriate .
He has imported a watered - down idiom of his time — the banal , pseudo - factual style of the mass - circulation magazines — into a world twelve thousand years into the future , with no change at all !
The consciousness of his characters , as it is objectified in speech , shows absolutely no historical development and hence fails to evoke in the reader any feeling for the future universe they inhabit .
The " Foundation " novels also fail by Asimov ’s own definition of what he calls " social science fiction . "
In an essay written shortly after their publication , Asimov defined it as " that branch of literature which is concerned with the impact of scientific advance upon human beings . " 3
In another essay , entitled " When Aristotle Fails , Try Science Fiction , " Asimov argued that SF " deals with the possible advances in science and with the potential changes — even those damned eternal verities — these may bring about in society . "
4
These precepts do not square with his novels .
There is no indication in the FOUNDATION stories that scientific advances — e.g. traveling faster than light , developing atomic technology , predicting and controlling human events , controlling minds , etc. — have any effect on people .
Man remains essentially the same ; the springs of human action are unchanged .
This conflict between Asimov ’s precepts and practice is a consequence of contradictory notions he holds about the nature of historical change .
Despite his contention that SF deals with change , and moreover that " scientific - economic change is master and political change is the servant " so that " technological changes lie at the root of political change " 5 — Asimov does not believe in significant change .
More precisely , he does not believe that scientific advances will entail any changes in men ’s mutual relationships : " Hate , love , fear , suspicion , passion , hunger , lust ... these will not change while mankind remains " ; history repeats itself ( in large outline at least ) " with surprising specificity . "
6
Citing Toynbee ’s cyclical theory of history as a basis for social theorizing and extrapolating from it into the future — a procedure which Toynbee explicitly rejected7 — Asimov creates a future political structure modeled on the Roman and British empires .
" In telling future history , " he relates , " I always felt it wisest to be guided by past history .
This was true of the ‘ Foundation ’ series too . "
8
That past history should serve as a guide for future history is a dubious assumption at best .
It certainly undercuts any notion of significant change .
Moreover , it is a fetter on the imaginative possibilities of the speculative novel .
Instead of events growing out of the inner logic and premises of the narrative situation , the plot and characters are forced to conform to a predetermined template .
Thus , not only is the concept itself questionable , but its use as a structuring and thematic device leads one to suspect a deficiency in imaginative vision .
As a guiding framework for SF , it has as a rule disastrous consequences .
Damon Knight rightly argues that it is not SF , " any more than the well known western with rayguns instead of sixshooters ....
It ’s of the essence of speculative fiction that an original problem be set up which the author is obliged to work out for himself ; if the problem is an old one , and he has only to look the answers up in a book , there ’s very little fun in it for anybody ; moreover , the answers are certain to be wrong . "
9 2 . Considering these problems , then , to what can one attribute the extraordinary success of THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY ?
I would suggest that the " Sense of Wonder in the underlying concept " which so captivates readers is a concept of history which is , in its grand sweep , similar to one of the main ingredients of Marxism — historical materialism — which had captured and is capturing the imagination of millions ( although Asimov ’s use of it , as I shall argue , is a crude caricature of this concept , a simplistic distortion similar to other varieties of " vulgar " Marxism of the period when the " Foundation " stories were being written ) .
The perspective of historical materialism entails the assertion of overriding historical laws .
In its cruder versions , it involves the old puzzle of historical inevitability ( predestination ) versus free will , which itself flows out of the often unsuccessful yet desperately necessary , and therefore always repeated , struggles of men to control their personal futures and the future of their societies .
Consider this discussion of freedom versus necessity between the old , powerless patrician , Ducem Barr , who understands the implications of Seldon ’s Plan , and the eager , ambitious and headstrong General of the Galactic Empire , Bel Riose : [ Barr ]
Without pretending to predict the actions of individual humans , it [ Seldon ’s Plan ] formulated definite laws capable of mathematical analysis and extrapolation to govern and predict the mass action of human groups .... [ Riose ]
You are trying to say that I am a silly robot following a predetermined course of destruction .
[ Barr ]
No , I have already said that the science had nothing to do with individual actions .
It is the vaster background that has been foreseen .
[ Riose ]
Then we stand clasped tightly in the forcing hand of the Goddess of Historical Necessity .
[ Barr ] Of Psycho - Historical Necessity .
[ Riose ]
And if I exercise my prerogative of freewill ?
If I choose to attack next year , or not to attack at all ?
How pliable is the Goddess ?
How resourceful ?
[ Barr )
Do whatever you wish in your fullest exercise of freewill .
You will still lose .
[ Riose ) Because of Hari Seldon ’s dead hand ?
[ Barr ]
Because of the dead hand of the mathematics of human behavior that can neither be stopped , swerved , nor delayed .
( § 2:3 ) The logic of history is equated with the logic of the natural sciences .
Bayta , the woman who eventually thwarts the Mule ’s efforts to locate the Second Foundation , says , " The laws of history are as absolute as the laws of physics , and if the probabilities of error are greater , it is only because history does not deal with as many humans as physics does atoms , so that individual variations count for more " ( § 2:11 ) .
From the Encyclopedia Galactica , one learns that Seldon ’s Plan can be reduced to " The synthesis of the calculus of n- variables and of n- dimensional geometry " ( § 3:8 ) .
Using incredibly complex mathematics , Seldon ’s Plan predicts the fall of the decadent First Galactic Empire ( read Roman Empire ) , the rise of the Traders and Merchant Princes ( read bourgeoisie and nationalism ) , the growth of the First Foundation ( read postindustrial , bureaucratic - technological society ) , its interaction with the long hidden Second Foundation and the eventual creation of the Second Galactic Empire , a civilization based on " mental science " ( read Asimov ’s utopian vision ? ) .
It ’s a fascinating concept .
Moreover , at least on a superficial level , the conceptual parallels with classical Marxism are clear .
Donald Wollheim , despite his crude caricature of Marxism , is correct in his " conjecture that Asimov took the basic premise of Marx and Engels , said to himself that there was a point there [ i.e. in Marxism ] — that the movements of human mass must be subject to the laws of motion and interaction , and that a science could be developed based upon mathematics and utilizing all the known data ... " 10 Is not Seldon ’s discovery precisely that which Marxists claim to have made ?
In his speech at Marx ’s funeral , Frederick Engels asserted that " just as Darwin discovered the law of evolution in organic nature , so Marx discovered the law of evolution in human history ....
Marx also discovered the special law of motion governing the present day capitalist method of production and the bourgeois society that this method of production has created .
" 11 Similarly , just as Seldon concentrates not on the individual but the masses , so — as Lenin says — " historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with scientific accuracy the social conditions of the life of the masses and the changes in these conditions ....
Marxism indicated the way to one all - embracing and comprehensive study of the processes of the rise , development , and decline of socio- economic systems ....
Marx drew attention and indicated the way to a scientific study of history as a simple process which , with all its immense variety and contradictions , is governed by definite laws . "
12
It is this concept , that history has " definite laws " which cannot only be made intelligible but can give insight into the course of future historical events , which so intrigues both the readers of the FOUNDATION novels and those who study Marxism .
Moreover , whether embodied in Seldon ’s Plan or the concept of historical materialism , this idea is the very stuff of drama , for it inevitably raises the question of human free will versus historical determinism , a problem fraught with dramatic tension from Sophocles ’ Oedipus Rex through the present .
In the 1930 ’s , the mechanistic conception of Marxism was founded on such works as Plekhanov ’s The Role of the Individual in History ( 1898 ) , Kautsky ’s The Class Struggle ( 1910 ) , Bukharin ’s Historical Materialism ( 1921 ) , and Stalin ’s Leninism ( 1924 ) .
Bukharin , for example , asserted that " society and its evolution are as much subject to natural law as is everything else in this universe ...
Socialism will come inevitably because it is inevitable that men , definite classes of men , will stand for its realization , and they will do so under circumstances that will make their victory certain .
"

It was precisely this crude conception of historical inevitability culminating in Stalin ’s widely propagated writings , that dominated the thinking of a large majority of American radicals and concerned social activists throughout the Thirties and into the Fifties , in and out of the Communist Party .
( Much of Marx ’s and Engels ’ writing was still untranslated ; the German Marxists ’ and Antonio Gramsci ’s works were unknown ; most George Luk�cs ’ essays were unavailable .
What Marxist theory Americans received was basically what was filtered through the USSR under Stalin . )
Obviously , this was an interpretation of history containing built - in contradictions and producing psychological as well as political tensions .
On the one hand , it created an impression that there was an inevitability to history which would run its course without any need for action .
On the other hand , it encouraged a feeling that intense activity was necessary to bring about the fulfillment of the inevitable end .
This dilemma — given a predetermined outcome , to act or not to act — is exactly what Asimov ’s characters experience .
It generates the dramatic tension in his novels .
If Seldon ’s Plan is correct , the correct interpretation of history , what actions should the characters take when faced with the necessity of making crucial decisions ?
The hero of the First Foundation , Salvor Hardin , decides to wait until the " crisis " itself ( an attack by another planet ) limits his choice to one and only one course of action .
He argues that the future is n’t nebulous .
It ’s been calculated out by Seldon and charted .
Each successive crisis in our history is mapped and each depends in a measure on the successful conclusion of the ones previous .... at each crisis our freedom of action would become circumscribed to the point where only one course of action was possible .... as long as more than one course of action is possible , the crisis has not been reached .
We must let things drift so long as they possibly can .... ( § 1:3:2 ) Hardin is content to follow the logic of Seldon ’s Plan ; he will do " one hundred percent of nothing . "
By contrast , other characters , such as Bel Riose and Dr. Darell , resist the implications of the Plan and of historical inevitability : " he ( Darell ) knew that he could live only by fighting that vague and fearful enemy that deprived him of the dignity of manhood by controlling his destiny ; that made life a miserable struggle against a foreordained end ; that made all the universe a hateful and deadly chess game " ( §3:14 ) .
Ultimately , resistance is futile ; all actions merely confirm the inevitability of Seldon ’s Plan .
The engrossment , the " Sense of Wonder " evoked by the FOUNDATION TRILOGY , lies in the readers ’ discovery of this fact .
Over and over again the question is raised ( by the characters and the readers ) : is Seldon ’s Plan still operational ?
Has the Mule ’s interference negated the Plan ?
And time and again , just as Oedipus and Sophocles ’ audience come to understand the power of Apollo over man ’s destiny , Asimov ’s characters and readers come to comprehend the full implications of " Psycho - Historical Necessity . "
This understanding evokes a mixture of futility and awe .
Wollheim is on the right track in pointing out the probable Marxian " influence " on Asimov .
Asimov must have been aware of Soviet Marxism : his parents immigrated from Russia in 1923 , six years after the October Revolution .
Moreover , 1939 , the year Asimov began writing his future history , was the year of the Soviet - Nazi Pact , and he has recalled how he was caught up in the events unfolding in Europe .
14 Further , if Asimov was at all aware of the all - pervading political and intellectual milieu of the New Deal decade , he would have been exposed to the clamorous controversies between the Left and the Right as well as within the Left of the time ( e.g. the passionate debates generated by the disillusionment of many prominent intellectuals with the Stalinist brand of Marxism and the American Communist Party ’s submission to the Soviet dogma ) .
15 While Asimov does not mention any involvement in radical politics , Sam Moskowitz credits him with helping to found the Futurian Science Literary Society in 1938 , a society which James Blish says " was formed exclusively for those who were either actual members of the Communist Party or espoused the Party ’s policies . "
The members " did endorse the Marxist view of change , or whatever version of it the American CP was wedded to at the time .
" 16 To what degree Asimov was acquainted with Marxism at first hand is not of great import .
He was certainly aware both of some of its slogans and of its power to arouse allegiance among intellectuals and crucially alter the tempo of world history .
3 . However , awareness is one thing , understanding another .
What Asimov accepted as the " underlying concept " of the FOUNDATION TRILOGY is the vulgar , mechanical , debased version of Marxism promulgated in the Thirties — and still accepted by many today .
Indeed he takes this brand of Marxism to its logical end ; human actions and the history they create become as predictable as physical events in nature .
Furthermore , just as those scientific elites in our world who comprehend nature ’s laws manipulate nature to their advantage , so too the guardians and the First Speaker , who alone understand Seldon ’s Plan , manipulate individuals and control the course of history .
" Psycho - history is , " as Wollheim quaintly puts it , " the science that Marxism never became " 17 ( a point to which I will return in the final section ) .
With the proviso that neither Wollheim nor Asimov has understood Marxism , and that one should substitute " mechanical pseudo - Marxism " for their mentions of it , it is precisely this treatment of history as a " science " above men , which accounts for the FOUNDATION TRILOGY ' s ideological fascination and evocativeness as well as for its ultimate intellectual and artistic bankruptcy .
Reading the FOUNDATION novels , one experiences an overriding sense of the inevitable , of a pervading fatalism .
Everything in the universe is predetermined .
Unable to change the pre-ordained course of events , man becomes , instead of the agent of history , an object , a " pawn " ( using Asimov ’s chess metaphor ) 18 in the grip of historical necessity — i.e. of the actualization of Hari Seldon ’s calculations .
Except for the Mule , a non-human , only those who understand Seldon ’s Plan — the First Speaker and the twelve guardians — are free .
They , the elite , are the only ones free to determine history , to make certain that Seldon ’s Plan is realized ; so that in 600 years the Second Foundation produces an elite group of psychologists " ready to assume leadership " and create the Second Galactic Empire .
The ignorant masses ( those with whom Seldon ’s mathematics is supposed to deal ) would resent " a ruling class of psychologists " because " only an insignificant minority ... are inherently able to lead Man through the greater involvement of Mental Science " ( § 3:8 ) .
Hence , it is absolutely imperative that the Plan be kept secret .
No psychologist is permitted on the First Foundation .
Seldon " worked with mobs , populations of whole planets , and only blind mobs who do not possess any foreknowledge of the results of their actions ....
Interference due to foresight would have knocked the Plan out of kilter " ( § 1:3:2 ) .
Throughout the FOUNDATION TRILOGY , the masses are held in supreme contempt .
They are described as " the fanatic hordes , " " the featureless ... mob " ; their primary quality seems to be " incoherence " ( § 2:14 ) .
The masses must be governed by a higher authority ; they are not fit to rule themselves .
This is the First Speaker ’s job : " For twenty - five years , he , and his administration , had been trying to force a Galaxy of stubborn and stupid human beings back to the path —
It was a terrible task " ( § 3:8 ) .
The sense of fatality and futility evoked in the " Foundation " novels is a consequence of the reader ’s recognition that not only will Seldon ’s Plan remain hidden but even those who preserve it are almost overwhelmed by its complexity .
A few will be free ; the rest will be under the thumb of those who can understand the Plan .
The First Speaker ( and clearly Asimov himself , along with many other SF writers such as Robert Heinlein ) envisions a society organized not according to the principles of equality but according to a hierarchy of merit .
It is a society similar to the one urged by Saint - Simon , the French utopian thinker ; he also argued for a society governed by savants ( mathematicians , chemists , engineers , painters , writers , etc. ) , who would form a Council of Newton and , because they were men of genius , would have the right to determine human destiny .
19
In the FOUNDATION TRILOGY , the masses merely follow .
Unable either to discover or comprehend the Plan ’s " synthesis of the calculus of n-variables and n- dimensional geometry , " the great majority of mankind is at the mercy of complex forces which they can neither understand nor control , and surrender their freedom to a techno - bureaucratic elite .
Asimov thus expresses a modern version of Saint - Simon ’s ideology of the expert , making for the rule by such an elite .
The realization that Seldon ’s Plan and the Second Foundation will remain a mystery and that the Second Galactic Empire will come to pass despite the actions of the great mass of humanity , gives Asimov ’s FOUNDATION TRILOGY its aura of fatalism .
Que sera , sera .
It seems to me that this attitude is one of the major reasons for the endurance of the FOUNDATION novels , just as it is one of the fascinations inherent in a crude reading of Marxism .
In many ways , fatalism is an attractive way of coming to terms with one ’s world .
It implies and evokes a certain passivity .
It is , in essence , a frame of adjustment which cautions man to submit to the inevitable .
At its worst , this attitude encourages a slavish submission to circumstances .
At its best , fatalism and its assumptions have been the basis for the tragic hero ’s confrontation with Fate and his sublime but ultimately futile struggle to control and overcome it .
But Asimov ’s characters are not tragic heroes .
They are nondescript pawns , unable to take their destiny into their own hands .
There is no fear or pity to evoke a tragic catharsis .
Instead there is complacency .
The Foundation Trilogy ends on a note of one - upmanship .
After all that has happened , history is still on its course and Hari Seldon wins again .
4 . Thus , the similarities of the underlying concept of the FOUNDATION novels with even a vulgar Marxist version of historical materialism sheds some new light on their fascination and staying power .
However , one must also conclude that Asimov ’s failure to grasp the complexities of historical materialism and the humanistic emphasis of Marxism constitutes their major intellectual and artistic deficiency .
This needs to be emphasized because at least one influential critic , Donald Wollheim , juxtaposes the " Foundation " novels with certain tenets of Marxism and argues that the validity of the " underlying concept " and the strengths of the novels lie in their deviation from Marxism .
In so doing , he continues to propagate a thoroughly distorted view of Marxism and produces a misleading evaluation of Asimov ’s achievements .
For example , Wollheim ’s argument that Asimov ’s psychohistory is the exact science that " Marxism thought it was and never could be " 20 entails a doubly preposterous comparison .
To take Marxism first , Marx and Engels never claimed for their theories the status of " exact science . "
They were always careful to describe the " laws " of historical development as " tendencies . "
Marx warns that his theory of the capitalist mode of production assumes " that the laws of the capitalist mode of production develop in pure form .
In reality there is always an approximation .
" 21 Similarly , Engels writes that no economic law " has any reality except as approximation , tendency , average , and not immediate reality .
This is partly due to the fact that their action clashes with the simultaneous action of other laws , but partly due to their nature as cancepts .
" 22 So much for Wollheim ’s assertion that Marxism claimed to be an exact science .
Second , to focus now on psychohistory , Wollheim fails to point out that those who articulate Seldon ’s Plan consistently confuse determinable and determined .
Note that Ducem Barr ( quoted above in section 2 ) says that Seldon ’s mathematics can simultaneously " predict " and " govern " the action of large groups .
( He does n’t say how this happens . )
Seldon ’s Plan is designed not only to predict future galactic history but to prevent the anarchy which would follow the collapse of the First Galactic Empire .
Its power to control rests on the ability of the elite who guard the Plan to calculate all the possible variations , to keep the Plan secret from the rest of humanity , and to intervene , if necessary , to keep the Plan operational .
To those who do not understand Seldon ’s " little algebra of humanity " ( § 3:8 ) , man ’s destiny appears fixed and inevitable .
Man is seen merely as an object of history rather than , dialectically , as a subject and object in the making of history .
For Marxists , however , history is neither determinable nor determined by a set of abstract equations .
History is people acting .
Moreover , people come to understand historical " laws " because in their action they simultaneously change history — each other and their social institutions — and are changed by it .
Marx came to the conclusion that " the logic of history was thoroughly objective and communicable .
It could be grasped by the intellect , and at the same time — since it was the history of man — it was capable of modification as soon as men understood the nature and process in which they were involved : a process whereby their own creations had assumed an aspect of seemingly internal and inevitable laws [ Seldon ’s Plan ! — note CE ] .
History therefore culminated not in the intellectual contemplation of the past , but in a deliberate shaping of the future . "
23 For Marx and Engels , the choices people make about their lives , their morals , their praxis ( creative action ) and their knowledge of their particular situation — all of these are included in the " laws " of social development .
Marx believed that capitalism would be replaced by socialism because it not only had fatal economic limitations but also because those limitations would lead the great mass of humanity — not merely an elite — to adopt his theory as a guide to action .
Marx did not relieve men of moral responsibility : " Underlying the whole of his work , providing the ethical impulse that guided his hopes and his studies , was a vision and theory of human freedom , of man as master of himself , of nature and of history . "
24 Behind Seldon ’s psychohistory lies the assumption — shared by Asimov — that mankind will not fundamentally change , that basic human drives are universal and eternal .
Marx disagrees .
His optimism is based on a rejection of this cyclical view of history .
History sometimes may , but as a rule does not — and certainly does not have to — repeat itself .
This rejection may help explain why some critics acquainted with Marxism are so exasperated by what they see as the essentially conservative nature of much contemporary SF .
For example , Franz Rottensteiner charges that " present day science fiction , far from being the literature of change , is as a rule very conservative in its method as well as content .
While paying lip service to change and offering some background slightly changed in relation to the author ’s environment , it actually comforts the reader with the palliative that nothing will ever really change , that we ’ll always be again what we have been before , in this world or the next ; as below , so above ; as on earth , so in the after life , Amen . "
25 For Marxists , however , technological change inevitably leads to changes in consciousness .
If technological change , then change in the means of production ; if change in the means of production , then change in the relations of production ; if change in the human relations accompanying production , then changes in the superstructure ( art , religion , philosophy , politics , etc. ) ; if change in the superstructure , then change in human consciousness .
Moreover , this dialectic is reversible ; at given epochs — such as our own — human consciousness itself intervenes powerfully in changing the basic substructure of society ( its materials and relations of production ) .
26 Marxism not only posits significant social change as men make their history , but Marx insists that man himself , literally his physical senses , is subject to alteration .
In his intercourse with nature , man changes nature and himself .
Marx writes ,
" The development of the five senses is the labor of the whole previous history of the world .
" 27 The revolution which brings communism will constitute " a universal act of human self - change .
" 28 Men will literally be different from what they have been in the past .
By contrast , these relationships are not explored in the FOUNDATION TRILOGY .
Areas of social reality , such as interdependence of political power , ideology , technological development and the evolution of specific economic structures appear as separate autonomous sectors .
While Seldon recognizes that economic cycles are variables which his Plan must take into account ( § 1:1:4 ) , and while Asimov depicts the economic power of the First Foundation supplanting the political rule of the Empire ( as if they were two entirely separate conditions ) , the relationships between economic and political power are not clear ( §2:10 ) .
The Machiavellian power struggles that constitute the essential plot of the Foundation Trilogy are expressed almost exclusively in psychological terms .
Politics and political savvy are equated with psychology ( § 1:2:3 ) ; the Mule gains supremacy by controlling his enemies ’ emotions ; the ultimate goal of the guardians of Seldon ’s Plan is establishing the Second Galactic Empire , which is described as a society ruled by psychologists skilled in " Mental Science " ( § 3:8 ) .
( It could be a " science " because Seldon assumes , as does Asimov , that " human reaction to stimuli would remain constant " [ §2:251 . )
Human misery is not the result of external political , social , or economic oppression ; rather it is the consequence of man ’s failure to communicate ( § 3:8 ) .
Furthermore , this failure is not a result of social , political or economic differences but of the failure of language itself !
Things would be fine if man could get along without human speech .
Even here , however , Asimov never attempts to make the connections between these elements ( i.e. the social , psychological , political , linguistic , economic , etc. ) clear .
Thus , on the one hand , there is in Marxism a sense of almost unlimited possibility , of hope , of freedom ; on the other hand , there is in the FOUNDATION novels a sense of predestination , of remorseless logic , a pervading fatalism .
Except for the elite who understand Seldon ’s Plan , the rest of mankind are ignorant counters in the grip of an idea which stands over against them as universal , immutable , external law .
From a Marxian perspective , this is the very essence of slavery .
Unable to comprehend the laws of nature or historical development , man is a slave to these laws , just as any animal is a slave to external circumstances .
Uncognized laws are manifested as " blind " Necessity .
Man ’s freedom is determined by his ability to understand himself and to make his world comprehensible .
Once understood , previously mysterious events lose their transcendent nature , their " fetishistic " quality as Marx would say ; they become demystified and lose their power to move men through mystery .
In striking contrast to Asimov ’s depiction of Seldon ’s Plan , it is the possibility that all men can ultimately comprehend those hidden and complex forces at work on them that gives Marxism its vision of hope .
It is this comprehension which creates the conditions for freedom .
By the same token , it is the reader ’s recognition that Seldon ’s Plan and the Second Foundation will remain a mystery and that the Second Galactic Empire will come to pass regardless of any actions by the mass of humanity which gives the Foundation Trilogy its aura of fatalism and complacency .
Yet why not ?
From a Marxian perspective , Asimov ’s depiction of the particular future embodied in the " Foundation " stories is an accurate reflection of the material and historical situation out of which these works arose : the alienation of men and women in modern bourgeois society .
For Marxists , alienation describes a situation in which the creations of people ’s minds and hands — whether they be goods or complex social systems — stand over against and dominate their creators .
Alienation is a consequence of man ’s impotence before the forces of nature and society , and of his ignorance of their operations .
Alienation abates to the extent that man ’s knowledge and powers over nature and his social relations are increased .
Thus , in one sense , Asimov ’s Foundation Trilogy endures because of its fatalistic perspective .
It accurately sizes up the modern situation .
Reading these novels , the reader experiences this fatalism which , in a Marxist analysis , flows from his own alienation in society and his sense of impotence in facing problems he can no longer understand , the solutions of which he puts in the hands of a techno - bureaucratic elite .

ABSTRACT
This essay speculates on what elements in the Foundation stories of Asimov have so fascinated readers .
The characters are undifferentiated and one - dimensional .
Stylistically , the novels are disasters : Asimov ’s ear for dialogue is atrocious .
To describe characters ’ annoyance , arrogance or bitterness , Asimov uses again and again one favorite adjective and adverb , " sardonic [ ally ] . "
Evidently , all people in all time periods will be sardonic .
Asimov imports a watered - down idiom of his own time into a world twelve - thousand years into the future , with no change at all .
This essay argues that what Asimov accepted as the " underlying concept " of the Foundation trilogy is the vulgar , mechanical , debased version of Marxism promulgated during the 1930s — and still accepted by many today .
Indeed he takes this brand of Marxism to its logical end : human actions and the history they create become as predictable as physical events in nature .
Everything in the universe is preordained .
Reading these novels , readers experience a fatalism that ( in a Marxist analysis ) actually flows from their own sense of alienation and impotence in the face of problems they no longer even understand .
Asimov ’s answer to this modern problem of alienation is also the source of his popular appeal : he envisions humanity in the capable hands of a techno - bureaucratic elite .
Back to Home
It was three weeks ago that my virtual world disintegrated .
I had been struggling with a digital littering problem in my Social Simulation Research Lab and I wanted to automate the cleanup process .
As the home of my PhD research is the virtual world of Second Life , I need to ensure that my online space looks professional and tidy so any potential participants who visit will instantly recognise my good intentions .
I 'd spent days lining up little planks of wood , straightening out the interactive books on the shelves and placing the windows just so .
All that I needed to do , I was assured , was flick a little switch and foreign objects would be removed .
I flicked .
Then everything disappeared .
You must n't underestimate how much time I 'd put into this place .
I was so proud .
I had taken people on guided tours .
I had spent hours indexing the resources .
More pressing , an in - world educational newspaper was doing a write - up on the library the next day and I was anticipating a tsunami of attention from the academic community .
Unfortunately , all this was moot .
At that moment it was gone .
A few days later , after I 'd cobbled together what passed as a shadow of the former lab , a Second Life - wide controversy exploded .
The CopyBot hack ( The duplicitous inhabitants of Second Life , November 23 ) wreaked havoc on the economy , threatening mass closure of the tens of thousands of businesses which produce the real - life livelihoods of many of its commercial property owners .
I admit that at the time the potentially devastating effects did n't faze me ; an automated replication of in - world properties sounded just what I needed when my virtual space experienced cosmic meltdown .
But the more I hear about it , the more excited I get about the implications .
Second Life has reached a philosophical crisis and the result is potential civil war .
The formerly libertarian landscape has been overrun by rampaging nouveau - capitalists .
They want centralised governance and stern economic ruling .
Everyone is a potential thief .
Fingers are being pointed and , in some extreme cases , avatars are being attacked .
The digital idyll has become a world of accusations , violence and bitter political dispute .
And so , once again , the real world comes crashing in .
Sooner or later , most online communities reach this crisis point because the ideals of the founders are replaced by regulations demanded by the different types of people who interact in them .
We should n't be surprised ; what we do when we interact online is replicate the social practices we are familiar with offline .
Inspired by this milestone , I 'm going to add a wing to my new lab .
And inside will be a shrine to CopyBot , the little hack that transformed Second Life into a real world .

When you 're speaking at the Game Developer 's Conference , it 's probably not a good idea to fill yourself up with beer before taking the podium and going after Nintendo 's throat .
OK , so Maxis developer Chris Hecker was n't really drunk , but the story would make a lot more sense if he was , in my opinion .
What did he say ?
" The Wii is a piece of s***! "
Hecker began his talk , which was called " Fear of a Wii Planet . "
He blasted a few bars of Public Enemy to set the tone .
Hecker said the Wii is nothing more than two GameCubes stuck together with duct tape , and that the console is n't powerful enough to provide the next - gen experience he has been waiting for .
Although he stated the system is " severely underpowered , " Hecker noted that he was n't simply referring to the Wii 's graphical capabilities .
He wants to spend a console 's CPU making games more intelligent , and he has found the Wii does n't have the power to process things like complicated AI .
He goes on to say that Nintendo does n't take games seriously as art and also that they need to " make a serious console that does n't suck ass . "
This would probably attract from scorn if it was said in the comments of a post here , but to use this wording when you 're talking at the GDC ?
Bad form .
I 'm guessing Mr. Hecker received quite the talk from his corporate bosses when his rant made the game press , because today he 's trying to make nice .
I do n't know who has read the internet , yesterday .
In a [ unintelligible ] panel I said a bunch of things .
I was trying to be thought provoking and entertaining and fun and a lot of the stuff went too far over the top — on the entertaining and fun side , so that it was no longer thought provoking , just inflammatory .
And in the process I hurt a bunch of people I care about .
And so , I want to apologize now .
When I 'm on stage , I 'm me .
I 'm talking talk from me .
From me .
I 'm not representing EA or Maxis .
I want to make two things perfectly clear .
I do not think the Wii is a piece of shit .
Nintendo needs to be applauded for trying to interface on the controller front , the user interface front , on making games accessible , on making a console that you do n't need to mortgage your house to afford .
Secondly , it 's totally obvious — and I 'm sorry that I implied otherwise — that everyone at Nintendo is passionate at making great games .
Some of the games give me hope that we will be seen as an art form on par with movies and books .
That 's quite the turnaround , is n't it ?
I 'm not sure what would cause one to make such an ill - advised speech to begin with , but going back and saying the opposite the next day is almost as bad .
So what was his point ?
Is the Wii the best thing since sliced bread , or worthless ?
The Wii is such a darling in the press that a few well - earned criticisms of the system would have made his point far better than the fanboy - ish rant he delivered .
Crazy stuff in the water there at GDC .
Who knew some of the sessions could be like forum discussions ?
Hi ! ^_^ Okay , so
it 's not a giant Easter
Island stone head [ those are called Moai ] ...
I made that picture hehe .
But it IS a small Moai .
You s
ee , the story is quite strange , and
at the same time common , you 'll see why .
My final project was due to midnight , and my computer 's clock was screami
ng 12:01 am . Y
ou can prolly imag
ine my face [ and
my teammate 's ] and humor .
Programming a game was not an e
asy task , especially under our circumstances [ also ridiculously akward ... t
rust me
]
So at that point , I compile the game .. and my laptop [b
rand new ]
died .
Instantly .
Should n't have
messed with dire
ct hardware accessing and using lots of resource
s at the same time .
Anyways , I try to save something into my PNY 512MB green usb drive , booting from 3 different linux live - cds until it worked [ let 's not forget we 're almost one hour late here ... and it's l
ate at night and we had n't s
leept for 2 days in a row ] .
I plug my usb drive to my team 's laptop and ... it cracks .
IT 'S FREAKING UNBELIAVABLE !
I break it appart so I can plug just the chip .
We rescue some files , we finish our final project at 9am .
My laptop is dead .
My USB drive is broken .
I am in the middle of finals .
Funny as hell :)
Anyways , vacations came .
Wha
t to do with my broken drive ?
Mod it .
How ?
With a toy .
And lots of hot glue .
WARNING !
Hot , burning stuff is involved here .
Burn yourself at
your own risk - ask for help if you are a kid ;)
And damage to your usb drives are not my responsability .
I only state here what
I did and worked for me .
Okay ...
MATERIALS [ everything ' I ' needed ] :
- A [ preferably broken ] usb drive ; this PNY h
as a sma
ll chip , dunno about others
- A hot glue gun
-
Glue sticks [ yyyyup , for the glue gun :o ]
- A hollow toy .
- Magic tape
- A knife
- A fridge
- A little brother
HOW IT'S DONE :
Step 1 .
Find several toys as candidates for your project .
I first saw some Mega Blocks , a Mew figurine , and some other toys around in my bedroom .
The Moai head was my choice because of it's size and shape ; it 's hollow , about the width of the usb 's chip , and not
too big .
I also liked th
e color , pink is one of my favorite color
s [so
what ?
xD ] , and it made me remember the hea
d in the movie Night at the Museum ... ohhh did I laugh with that movie !
hahaha .
The downsides were some holes at the top of the head [ it was
a Play - Dough mold , kinda ] and the bottom is kinda
big , so plugging it could be difficult in some circumstances .
Step 2 .
Have your little
brother firmly grab the
tiki head [ he's 11 by the way , and I was tak
ing care that he would n't get burnt ] .
Now with one hand place the chip in the desired position .
MAKE
SURE ENOUGH PART OF THE USB PLUG IS OUT OF THE
TOY OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE IT LATER
!
Fill with hot glue .
Be careful , though , since you have to s
tart from the bottom , so if it gets solid before going all the way down , the head
will be half empty !
Also , I had to cover the holes I mentioned at the top of the head with some magic tape .
No big deal .
Step 3 .
Put it in the fridge so it co
ols down faster :)
Step 4 .
Now it 's all solid [ make sure of that ] take the knife and carefully clean the USB plug and the glue
"h
airs "
that could be around there .
And that 's it !
:D YAY !!
If you want , as an optional 5th step , reburn VERY carefully the little glue edges so it 's all neat .
I chose to put the chip upside - down because the face side is thicker , and it would have be
en really difficult to plug it anywhere , so I have to turn it face down , and plug it to my laptop .
The green led looks cool through the glue ^_^
My next project : a cap for the usb plug xD jk ...
I hope this mmm " tutorial " helps in case someone wants to do something similar to mine .
If you do , let me know !
Peace .

I 've been in the Army for four years now .
Two of them deployed , part of the 3rd Brigade , 3rd ID .
I 've served in all of the three most violent parts of Iraq .
I spent the first 6 months of OIF III in al - Khalis , just north of Ba'qubah in the Diyala Province .
I spent the second 6 months in that modern day Khe Sahn , the little slice of Hell known as Ar Ramadi .
I got mortared more times than I could count .
I broke my leg .
I lost friends there .
I came back on crutches .
I got married .
And barely two months after that , barely more than a year home , I 'm on another flight back to this place .
And after we got here , they told us this time it would be 15 months .
Subject to extensions , as well .
My contract of enlistment expires in July .
This July .
I 'm being stop - lossed for over a year because the Army is so desparate for soldiers .
By the end I 'm going to have more time in combat than anyone in my entire family back to WWII .
I 'm not going to see my wife for but 15 days in over a year .
I do n't even wake up during mortar attacks anymore .
I 'm tired of the heat , of carrying an M16 everywhere , of listening to the local Iraqi government rep explain why he needs more money to advance a project that 's a year behind .
I 'm tired because I just came off of one shift at the battalion TOC , and have just a few hours downtime until the next one .
So I send out this diary , this first post on DailyKos and ask everyone back home , and the people who just voted to keep me here for months more ; bring me home .
Hell , just listen to my story from the whole last tour : All Quiet On The Southwest Asian Front

Just get me out of here .
Democrats in both chambers of Congress are on the case of the fired U.S. Attorneys as well as ethical breaches within the Justice Department .
According to Robert Novak :
House Democrats , led by Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel , are targeting Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the Justice Department under him in a wide - ranging congressional investigation .
The point of the Democratic attack is dismissal of seven U.S. attorneys , all involved in probes of public corruption .
On Thursday , Emanuel sent Gonzales his second letter demanding the appointment of Carol Lam , fired as U.S. attorney in San Diego , as an outside counsel to continue her pursuit of the Duke Cunningham case .
Whether or not it 's wide - ranging or an attack ( thanks , Novak ) , the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have been aggressively pursuing the case .
Rep.
Emanuel began the charge a few weeks ago , demanding that Gonzales reappoint Carol Lam , who led the Duke Cunningham investigation while U.S. Attorney in California .
" To remove the cloud of politics over Ms. Lam ’s dismissal , and to ensure there are no delays in the investigation of the Cunningham matter , I call on you to immediately name Carol Lam as outside counsel with all necessary resources to continue her excellent work on the Cunningham case and related matters , " Emanuel wrote .
Having received no response from Gonzales to that request , Committee Chair Conyers , along with Reps.
Berman , Emanuel , and Sanchez followed up with a second letter , this time requesting further information as to why Lam was dismissed , and oh , by the way , what about the other six ?
Carol Lam 's indictments of Foggo and Wilkes underscore the importance of last week 's request and the need for an explanation of why these diligent public servants were dismissed .
It is vital that U.S. Attorneys be able to prosecute wrongdoing free from political pressure .
We are pleased that the Department of Justice has also agreed to brief members of the House Judiciary Committee on the dismissals of Carol Lam and other U.S. Attorneys .
We look forward to further details regarding the date for that briefing and your response regarding the request to appoint Carol Lam as an outside counsel to finish the Cunningham and related investigations .
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and their staff did receive a briefing from Justice on the issue , and came away unimpressed .
At issue for the Senators was the dismissal of H.E. Cummins in Arkansas at the apparent behest of the White House .
Ms. Miers , the aides said , phoned an aide to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales suggesting the appointment of J. Timothy Griffin , a former military and civilian prosecutor who was a political director for the Republican National Committee and a deputy to Karl Rove , the White House political adviser .
Later , the incumbent United States attorney , H. E. Cummins III , was removed without explanation and replaced on an interim basis by Mr. Griffin .
Officials at the White House and Justice Department declined to comment on Ms. Miers ’s role in the matter .
Paul J. McNulty , the deputy attorney general , said at a hearing last week that Mr. Cummins had done nothing wrong but was removed to make room for Mr. Griffin .
It was not known at the time Mr. McNulty testified that Ms. Miers had intervened on Mr. Griffin ’s behalf .
Senators Schumer and Feinstein both expressed dissatisfaction with the briefing and the lack of answers they received .
Feinstein also took up the case of Carol Lam on the Senate floor last week .
It 's likely that the Senate Judiciary Committee will follow the House 's lead , and begin inquiries of their own .
Finally , there 's also the case of Sue Ellen Wooldridge :
Last March , Sue Ellen Wooldridge , then the head of the Justice Department 's environmental division , bought a $ 1 million vacation home with Don R. Duncan , the top lobbyist for oil company ConocoPhillips .
Nine months later , Ms. Wooldridge signed off on a settlement agreement that let ConocoPhillips delay the installation of pollution - control equipment and the payment of fines .
Just to make matters cozier , the third owner of the beach house is J. Steven Griles , the former No. 2 official at the Interior Department who 's now the target of a Justice Department criminal investigation into his dealings with lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Oh , and Ms. Wooldridge , who lives with Mr. Griles , once worked with him at Interior , where she gave Mr. Griles ethics advice and defended his actions during an inspector general investigation .
Both Conyers and Waxman have opened investigations on this issue .
This is the Justice Department Gonzales built .
It 's the kind of ethical mess you might expect to see with a real estate lawyer , known more for a dogged loyalty to the man who made his career than to any dedication to the rule of law , serving as the nation 's chief law enforcement officer .
These investigations are likely to provide more than enough fodder for Congress to consider hearings into Gonzales 's fitness to serve as the U.S. Attorney General , as if his views on habeas corpus were n't enough .
I 'm with John Dean .
In the history of U.S. Attorney Generals , Alberto Gonzales is constantly reaching for new lows .
So dubious is his testimony that he is not afforded the courtesy given most cabinet officers when appearing on Capitol Hill : Congress insists he testify under oath .
Even under oath , Gonzales 's purported understanding of the Constitution is historically and legally inaccurate , far beyond the bounds of partisan interpretation .
Dean says he should resign .
I say he should be impeached .
Imagine surgery that could be performed without general anaesthetic , requires hardly any recovery time , and leaves you with no visible scars .
The catch : it may also leave a very unpleasant taste in your mouth – along with part of your spleen , prostate or perhaps your gall bladder .
Transgastric surgery , or natural orifice translumenal endosurgery ( NOTES ) , as it is officially known , involves passing flexible surgical tools and a camera in through the patient ’s mouth to reach the abdominal cavity via an incision made in the stomach lining .
Once the operation is over , the surgeon draws any removed tissue back out through the patient ’s mouth and stitches up the hole in the stomach .
To some it may sound disgusting , to others the prospect of scar - free surgery may sound too good to be true .
Either way it ’s coming .
In the past couple of weeks three separate surgical teams say they have carried out NOTES procedures on humans – surgical firsts for both Europe and the US .
And doctors in India say they have performed appendectomies through the mouth .
At the Ohio State University Medical Center , in Columbus , US , 10 patients were diagnosed for possible pancreatic cancer using procedures that entered their bodies via their mouths , while two women , one in New York , the other in Strasbourg , France , had their gall bladders removed by surgeons using a variation in the technique – they reached the abdominal cavity through an incision in the vagina .
Advertisement
Like all surgery , NOTES is not without risk – including the possibility of internal bleeding , or post - operative pain caused by inflating the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide to make it easier to work in .
However , the success of the operations may now open the floodgates for large numbers of surgeons who are desperate to try NOTES , making it easier for them to gain ethical approval to try the technique .
Better than keyhole
In many ways , transgastric surgery is a natural extension of keyhole surgery , in which slim surgical tools are inserted into the abdomen via small incisions in the skin , avoiding a large cut in the belly .
It has now become routine for procedures such as gall bladder removal .
Transgastric surgery promises to go one better .
Much of the discomfort and recovery time after conventional surgery – even keyhole surgery – is due to the incisions made in the abdominal wall .
However , because transgastric surgeons reach the abdominal cavity through the mouth , there is no need for an incision , so patients should be back up on their feet much faster , says Jürgen Hochberger at St Bernward Hospital in Hildesheim , Germany .
Although an incision is still made in the stomach lining , this is relatively painless , because the stomach has fewer nerve fibres that register pain than our skin .
“ Even with keyhole surgery , patients stay off work for several days , ” says Lee Swanstrom , director of the Oregon Clinic in Portland , US , which specialises in gastrointestinal and keyhole surgery .
“ With NOTES they could go back to work the same day . ”
The reduced pain also makes it possible for the procedure to be carried out under mild sedation , rather than general anaesthetic .
Consequently , elderly or infirm patients who would not be fit enough to receive a general anaesthetic , could still be treated .
Lowered infections
Going in through the stomach may also reduce the risk of post - operative infections with , say , the drug - resistant superbug MRSA , which often lives on the skin .
“ If you do n’t have skin incisions then you do n’t get MRSA , ” says Paul Swain , an endosurgeon at Imperial College , London , UK , who is leading UK research into NOTES .
And while there is a risk of infecting the abdominal cavity with bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract , animal studies suggest that risk is small .
“ Stomach acid is pretty cleansing .
Not many bugs can stand it , ” Swain says .
At least that ’s the theory .
“ At this stage it ’s all assumption , ” says Per - Ola Park who has been leading NOTES research at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg , Sweden .
While highly complex procedures have been successfully demonstrated in pigs , it is difficult to gauge details like levels of pain in animal tests , Park says .
Until the evidence is in , there is a danger that NOTES will become over - hyped , with patients becoming blind to the risks , warns Ara Darzi head of surgery at Imperial College London who helped pioneer keyhole surgery in the UK .
However , Swain thinks that if surgery can ultimately be made pain - free , convalescence - free and scar - free , whilst reducing the risk of complications and infections then it is something to be greatly encouraged .
“ Given the choice patients are obviously going to vote to have no scars and are right to do so , ” he says .
I guess the deadline may have come and gone for getting in PEPs for Python 3000 .
Guido ’s already written up a PEP Parade .
Of particular interest to me has been the appearance of PEPs for Abstract Base Classes ( PEP 3119 ) and the more exhaustive PEP 3124 which covers “ Overloading , Generic Functions , Interfaces , and Adaptation . ”
Both of these aim to provide ways of saying “ this is file - ish ” , “ this is string - ish , ” without requiring subclassing from a concrete “ built - in ” type / class .
But I think they both fall short a little bit , while zope.
interface ( from the Zope 3 family ) provides the best solution .
PEP 3119 ( Abstract Base Classes ) has a section covering comparisons to alternative techniques , and it specifically mentions “ For now , I ’ll leave it to proponents of Interfaces to explain why Interfaces are better . ”
So this is my brief attempt at explaining why .
A quote from PEP 3119 that I particularly like is “ Like all other things in Python , these promises are in the nature of a gentlemen ’s agreement … ”
The Interfaces as specified and used in Zope 3 and some other systems are the same way .
They are not “ bondange and discipline ” Interfaces .
They are not the ultra - rigid Eiffel contracts , nor are they the rigid and limited Interfaces as used by Java .
They are basically a specification , and they can be used ( as mentioned in PEP 3119 ) to provide additional metadata about a specification .
There are some simple tools in zope .
interface.verify to check an implementation against a specification , but those are often used in test suites ; they ’re not enforced hard by any system .
The agreement might be “ I need a seekable file ” , which might mean it expects the methods / messages ‘ read ’ , ‘ seek ’ , and ‘ tell ’ .
If you only provide ‘ read ’ and ‘ seek ’ , then it ’s your fault for not living up to the agreement .
That ’s no different than the Python of today .
What Interfaces and Abstract Base Classes aim to provide is a better clarification of what ’s expected .
Sometimes “ file - like ” in Python ( today ) means it just needs a ‘ read ’ method .
Sometimes it means the full suite of file methods ( read , readlines , seek , tell ) .
Same thing with sequences : sometimes it just means “ something iterable ” .
Other times it means “ support append and extend and pop ” .
Another side benefit of Interfaces as specification is that they provide a common language for , well , specifications .
Many PEPs propose some sort of API , especially informational PEPs like WSGI ( PEP 333 ) or API for Cryptographic Hash Functions ( PEP 247 ) .
I ’ll use PEP 247 as an example for my attempt at explaining why Zope 3 ’s Interfaces are Better .
A problem with Abstract Base Classes is this : they ’re limited to classes .
Even when PEP 3119 mentions Interfaces , it does so like this :
“ Interfaces ” in this context refers to a set of proposals for additional metadata elements attached to a class which are not part of the regular class hierarchy …
It then goes on to mention that such specifications ( in some proposals and implementations ) may be mutable ; and then says that ’s a problem since classes are shared state and one could mutate / violate intent .
That ’s a separate discussion that I ’m not going to go into here .
What is important is this severely limited focus on classes .
zope.interface works on objects as well , and not just normal ‘ instances of a class ’ object , but on classes themselves , and also modules .
There are two important verbs in zope .
interface : implements and provides .
provides is the most important one - it means that this Object , whatever that object may be , provides the specified interface directly .
implements is often used in class definitions .
It means “ instances of this class will provide the specified interface ” .
It can also be thought of in terms of Factories and / or Adaptation - “ calling this object will give you something that provides the desired interface . ”
“ What does that matter ? ” you might ask .
Well , there are all sorts of ways to compose objects in Python .
A module is an object .
It has members .
A class is an object .
An instance of a class is , of course , an object .
Functions and methods are also objects in Python , but for the most part what we care about here are Modules , Classes , and Instances .
Because when it comes down to actual usage in code , it does n’t particularly matter what an object is .
In PEP 3124 , the author ( Phillip J Eby ) shows the following interface :
class IStack ( Interface ) : @abstract def push ( self , ob ) " " " Push ' ob ' onto the stack " " " @abstract def pop( self ) : " " " Pop a value and return it " " "
Ignore the @abstract decorators , as they ’re artifacts of the rest of his PEP and / or related to PEP 3119 .
What is important is the use of self .
“ self ” is an artifact of implementation that is invisible to use .
Sure , you can write a Stack implementation like this .
( Note : I ’m going to use zope . interface terminology and style from here on out ) :
import zope.interface class Stack ( object ) : zope.interface.implements ( IStack ) def __init__ ( self ) : self ._stack = [ ] def push ( self , ob ) : self._stack.append( ob ) def pop( self ) : return self._stack.pop ( )
But when it ’s being used , it ’s used like this :
def do_something_with_a_stack( stack ) : stack.push ( 1 ) stack .push ( 2 ) # ... top = stack.pop ( ) stack_instance = Stack ( ) IStack.providedBy( stack_instance ) # True IStack.providedBy( Stack ) # False do_something_with_a_stack(stack_instance ) # works fine do_something_with_a_stack( Stack ) # raises an exception because ` Stack.
push ( 1 ) ` is passing ` 1` # to `self` .. unbound method , bla bla bla .
Notice that there is no ‘ self ’ reference visibly used when dealing with the IStack implementation .
This is an extremely important detail .
What are some other ways that we may provide the IStack interface .
One way is to do it with class methods and properties , effectively making a singleton .
( This is n’t a good way to do it , and is just here as an example ) .
import zope.interface class StackedClass ( object ) : zope.interface.classProvides( IStack ) _stack = [ ] @classmethod def push ( class_ , ob ) : class_._stack.append(obj ) @classmethod def pop( class_ ) : return class_._stack.pop ( ) IStack.providedBy( StackedClass ) # True do_something_with_a_stack( StackedClass ) # this time it works , because ` StackedClass.push ( 1 ) ` is a class method , # and is passing `StackedClass` to the `class_` parameter , and `1` # to `ob` .
Another variation of the above is using Static Methods :
import zope.interface class StaticStack ( object ) : zope.interface.classProvides( IStack ) _stack = [ ] @staticmethod def push ( ob ) : StaticStack._stack.append( ob ) @staticmethod def pop ( ) : return StaticStack._stack.pop ( )
Again , StaticStack.push ( 1 ) and StaticStack.pop ( ) work fine .
Now lets try a third way - in a module !
Let ’s call this module mstack ( file - mstack.py )
import zope.interface zope.interface.moduleProvides( IStack ) _stack = [ ] def push ( ob ) : _stack .push ( ob ) def pop ( ) : return _stack.pop ( )
Then in other code :
import mstack IStack.providedBy( mstack ) # True mstack.push ( 1 ) mstack.push ( 2 ) print mstack.pop ( ) # 2
So whether we ’re dealing with the instance in the first example ( stack_instance ) , the classes in the second two examples ( StackedClass and StaticStack ) , or the module in the last example ( mstack ) , they ’re all objects that live up to the IStack agreement .
So having self in the Interface is pointless .
self is a binding detail .
Jim Fulton , the main author of zope .
interface , taught me this a long time ago .
Because in Zope 2 , you could also make an IStack implementation using a Folder and a pair of Python scripts .
Well , those Python scripts ( as used in Zope 2 “ through - the - web ” development ) have at least 4 binding arguments .
Instead of ‘ self ’ , the initial arguments are context , container , script , traverse_subpath .
Just like self is automatically taken care of by the class - instance binding machinery , the four Zope Python Script binding arguments are automatically taken care of by Zope 2 ’s internal machinery .
You never pass those arguments in directly , you just use it like push ( ob ) and pop ( ) .
So there it is - many ways to provide this simple “ Stack ” Interface .
And I believe that both [ PEP 3119 ] and [ PEP 3124 ] are short sighted by focusing on the class - instance relationship exclusively ( or so it appears ) .
And since many objects , particularly instances , are mutable , one could compose an IStack implementation on the fly .
class Prototype ( object ) : " " " Can be anything ... " " " pstack = Prototype ( ) pstack._stack = [ ] def pstack_push ( ob ) : pstack._stack.append( ob ) def pstack_pop ( ) : return pstack._stack.pop ( ) pstack .push = pstack_push pstack.pop = pstack_pop #
Now we can say that this particular instance provides the IStack # interface directly - has no impact on the `Prototype` class zope.interface.directlyProvides ( pstack , IStack ) pstack.push (1 ) pstack.push ( 2 ) print pstack.pop ( ) 2 # We can remove support as well del pstack .
push zope.interface.noLongerProvides(pstack , IStack )
Examples of dynamically constructed objects in the real world - a network services client , particularly one that ’s in an overwraught distributed object system ( CORBA , SOAP , and other things that make you cry in the night ) .
Dynamic local ‘ stub ’ objects may be created at run time , but those could still be said to provide a certain interface .
So now let ’s look at whether it matters that you ’re dealing with a class or not :
@implementer ( IStack ) def PStack ( ) : pstack = Prototype ( ) pstack._stack = [ ] def pstack_push ( ob ) : pstack._stack.append( ob ) def pstack_pop ( ) : return pstack._stack.pop ( ) pstack .push = pstack_push pstack.pop = pstack_pop zope.interface.directlyProvides ( pstack , IStack ) return pstack @implementer ( IStack ) def StackFactory ( ) : # Returns a new ` Stack` instance from the earlier example return Stack ( ) import mstack import random @implementer ( IStack ) def RandomStatic ( ) : # chooses between the two class based versions and module return random.choice ( [ StackedClass , StaticStack , mstack ] )
All three are factories that will return an object that provides an IStack implementation , which is exactly the same as the Stack class in the first example .
That also claimed that it implements ( IStack ) .
When the class is instantiated / called , a new object is made that provides the IStack interface .
In Python , another thing that does n’t really matter is whether something is a class or function .
All of the following lines of code yield a result that is the same to the consumer .
The internal details of what is returned may vary , but the IStack interface works on all of them :
Stack ( ) # class PStack ( ) # ' Prototype ' dynamically constructed object StackFactory ( ) # Wrapper around basic class RandomStatic ( ) # Chooses one of the class / static method implementations .
And whether we ’re looking at the class implementation , or any of the factory based implementations , the result should be the same :
IStack.implementedBy( Stack ) # class # True IStack.providedBy( Stack ) # False IStack.providedBy( Stack ( ) ) # True IStack.implementedBy( PStack ) # Factory # True IStack.providedBy( PStack ) # False IStack.providedBy( PStack ( ) ) # True
No matter which method of instantiation is used , they should all pass the verifyObject check , which checks to see whether all of the specified members are provided and that the method / function signatures match the specification
from zope.interface import verifyObject verify_stack = partial ( verifyObject , IStack ) all ( verify_stack , [ Stack ( ) , PStack ( ) , StackFactory ( ) , RandomStatic ( ) ] ) # True
Now the class - based options will fail on the implemented By check , because it ’s the Class that provides the implementation , not an instance like with Stack
IStack.implementedBy( StackedClass ) # False IStack.providedBy( StackedClass ) # True IStack.providedBy( StackedClass ( ) ) # False
“ OK ” , you might say , “ but still , why does it matter ?
Why might we really care about whether these abstract specifications work only with classes ?
It seems smaller , simpler . ”
The main advantage is that specification should ( generally ) make no assumptions about implementation .
If the specification , aka “ gentlemen ’s agreement ” is generally met , it should n’t matter whether it ’s provided by a Class , an instance , a module , an extension module , or some dynamically constructed object .
The specification language should be the same
Going back to PEP 247 , the “ cryptographic hash API ” : there is a specification in that module about what the ‘ module ’ must provide , and for what the hash objects must provide .
Consider also the WSGI spec , the DB - API specs , and all of the other formal and informal specs that are floating around just in the PEPs .
Using zope.
interface , those specifications can be spelled out in the same fashion .
WSGI just cares about a particular function name signature .
It can be provided by a single function in a simple module , or as a method from an object put together by a large system like the full Zope 3 application framework and server .
It just wants a callable .
This is a little bit ugly in zope .
interface … but in reality , actually , I think it works .
Here ’s how it could be specified :
class IWSGIApplication ( Interface ) : def __call__( environ , start_response ) : " " " Document the function " " " # and / or use tagged values to set additional metadata
This just means that a WSGIApplication must be a callable object taking environ and start_response arguments .
A callable object may be a function ( taken from PEP 333 ) :
def simple_app ( environ , start_response ) : " " " Simplest possible application object " " " status = ' 200 OK ' response_headers = [ ( ' Content - type ' , 'text / plain ' ) ] start_response( status , response_headers ) return [ ' Hello world !
']
Or a class ( the __init__ is what is callable here ) .
Maybe the WSGI spec might also state that the result “ should be iterable ( support __iter__ ) ”
Maybe that ’s loosely enforced , but the following example shows how the class can make separate declarations about what the class directly provides , and what its instances implement .
Instead of using any decorators or magic - ish “ class decorators ” ( the implements , classProvides calls above ) , we ’ll make the declarations for both AppClass and simple_app in the same manner , which matches the style in PEP 3124 .
class AppClass ( object ) : def __init__( self , environ , start_response ) : self.environ = environ self . start = start_response def __iter__( self ) : status = ' 200 OK ' response_headers = [ ( ' Content - type ' , 'text / plain ' ) ] self.start ( status , response_headers ) yield " Hello world !
" from zope .
interface import directly Provides , classImplements # Both ' simple_app ' and ' AppClass ' are callable with the same arguments , # so they both * provide * the IWSGIApplication interface directly Provides ( simple_app , IWSGIApplication ) directly Provides ( AppClass , IWSGIApplication ) #
And we can state that AppClass instances are iterable by supporting # some phantom IIterable interface classImplements ( AppClass , IIterable )
What are the benefits of this , beyond just having a common way of spelling specifications ?
Instead of , or in addition to , abstract base classes , the core Python libraries can include all of these specs , even if they do n’t provide any concrete implementation .
Then I could have a unit test in my code that uses verifyClass or verifyObject to ensure I stay inline with the specification .
def test_verifySpec(self ) : verifyClass ( ICryptoHash , MyHashClass )
Then , if the specification changes in a new version of Python or in a new version of someone elses library or framework , I can be notified .
Of if the specification undergoes a big change , a new spec could be written , such as IWSGI2 Application .
Then by process of adaptation ( not covered in this post ) or interface querying , a WSGI Server could respond appropriately to implementations of the earlier spec :
if IWSGI2Application.providedBy( app ) : # Yay !
We do n't have to do anything extra !
# ... do wsgi 2 work elif IWSGIApplication.providedBy( app ) : # We have to set up the old `start_response` object # ... do wsgi 1 work else : raise UnsupportedOrUndeclaredImplementation ( app )
Adaptation could provide a means of doing the above … ( still , not going into the details .. trying not to ! )
@implementer ( IWSGI2 Application ) @adapts ( IWSGIApplication ) def wsgi1_to_wsgi2 ( app ) : return wsgi2wrapper ( app ) #
And then , replacing the `if , else` above : wsgi_app = IWSGI2Application ( app , None ) if app is None : raise UnsupportedOrUndeclaredImplementation ( app ) # ... do wsgi2 work
When you have both specification and adaptation , then you can write your code against the spec .
In the above example , the main code does IWSGI2Application ( app , None ) which means “ for the object app , give me an object that provides IWSGI2 Application , or None if there is no means of providing that interface . ”
If app provides that interface directly , then app is returned directly .
Otherwise an adaptation registry is found , and it ’s queried for a callable object ( an adapter ) that will take ‘ app ’ as its argument and return an object that provides IWSGI2 Application .
Another example : knowing that Python 3000 is going to change a lot of core specifications and implementations , such as the attributes for functions ( func_code , func_defaults , etc ) .
If an IPy2 Function interface were made ( and zope. interface or something like it was added to Python 2.x ) , then code that works with function object internals could program against their preferred spec by adding a line of code :
func = IPy2Function ( func ) if my_sniffer(func.func_code ) : raise Unsafe ( func )
On Python 2 , you ’d get the regular function straight through .
In Python 3000 / 3.0 , an adapter would translate __code__ into func_code , for example .
I do n’t expect this to happen in reality , but it ’s an example of how migration paths could be made between two major software versions , allowing code to run in both .
By taking advantage of this system , my company has seen more re-use with Zope 3 than at any time in our company history .
And because ( most of ) Zope 3 is programmed against specification , we ’ve been able to plug in or completely make over the whole system by providing alternative implementations of core specs .
This is very hard to do in native Zope 2 ( the CMF , on which Plone is based , was probably the first Zope system that started these concepts , which Plone and others were able to take advantage of by providing new tools that matched the provided spec ) .
At the heart of it , again , is the gentlemen ’s agreement , but brought out in full : it does n’t matter who you are or where you came from ( ie , it does n’t matter what classes are in your family tree or if you are a simple module ) , as long as you get the job done .
There ’s a simple contract , and as long as the contract is fulfilled , then everybody is happy .
But if the gentlemen involved can only come from the class system , then there ’s still a nasty aristocracy that excludes a large chunk of the populace , all of whom can potentially fulfill the contract .
Let ’s not cause an uprising , OK ?

A top United States Intelligence official has said that the next attack on America could come out of the Al Qaeda organised in Pakistan , saying President Pervez Musharraf needs to do more to come to terms with the terror outfits trying to ' rebuild ' in the country .
On being asked whether an attack on the US could come from terror outfits based in Iraq or Pakistan , National Intelligence Director Admiral Mike McConnell told the Senate Armed Services Committee , " My belief is the attack most likely will be planned and come out of the leadership ( Al Qaeda ) in Pakistan . "
" The camps that have been established in Pakistan are in an area that has never been governed by any power , a state or outside power , in that region because it is such rugged country and fierce individual tribal interests .
And so to the best of our knowledge the senior leadership , number one and number two , are there , and they are attempting to re-establish and rebuild and to establish training camps , " McConnel said .
The top intelligence official told lawmakers Pakistan could do more in coming to terms with the Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the purpose of the visit of the US Vice - President
Dick Cheney to Islamabad was to impress upon the fact that it has to be ' more aggressive ' in going after it .
" We believe they could do more .
And the issue of being elected for the next term is the issue that that the Pakistan President is wresting with , " McConnell said .
McConnell said with the signing of the agreement with the tribal leaders in the frontier area , the ' capabilities of Al Qaeda for training and so on increased .
Therefore , the vice president 's visit and others visit ( is ) to make the case that we have to be more aggressive in going after Al Qaeda in Pakistan .
The balancing act , of course , is the President 's standing in that country with an election coming up this fall . "
In his opening remarks , Senate Panel Chairman Carl Levin hammered Pakistan , including making a reference to terrorism across the border with India .
" In Afghanistan , the resurgence of the Taliban , the deteriorating security situation and the flourishing sanctuary across the border in Pakistan drive home the fragile hold that we have in this volatile region .
" Long - term prospects for eliminating the Taliban threat appear dim so long as the sanctuary remains in Pakistan , and there are no encouraging signs that Pakistan is eliminating it , " the top Democrat from Michigan said .
" Pakistan is an ally in the war on terrorism , but , as Director McConnell 's prepared statement emphasizes , it is a major source of Islamic extremism ; it is a sanctuary for Al Qaeda , the Taliban and extremist operating against India over Kashmir ; and a past and potential future source of dangerous nuclear proliferation , " he added .
The disappearance last week of a Transportation Security Administration hard drive that contains personal data on 100,000 TSA employees has raised the frightening prospect that terrorists might soon be able to identify the undercover air marshals who toil to keep our skies safe .
With their brush cut hair , bull necks and oh - so - casual Dockers attire , air marshals have never blended in too well .
They 're the serious looking chaps who board planes early .
But letting their names , birth dates and Social Security numbers walk right out of TSA headquarters in Arlington , Va. , boggles the mind .
This is the agency that 's supposed to screen crazies from getting on planes ?
" When you can't even secure computers inside TSA , it kind of makes you wonder , " said Sen .
Pat Leahy ( D - Vermont ) at a Senate Judiciary hearing on Tuesday .
A federal criminal probe into the hard drive theft is underway .
The FBI and Secret Service are helping out .
Apparently , the TSA is unsure whether the drive was stolen or simply lost .
TSA administrator Kip Hawley downplayed the threat to air marshals yesterday .
But some law enforcement experts see it differently .
It would n't require much effort to use information from the drive to identify and track down air marshals .
" There are grave security concerns here , " said Bruce Schneier , an information security expert testifying before Congress this morning .
At least TSA 's web designers have their $ #* % together .
The agency quickly worked up a slick flash presentation about the incident .
The effect is kind of like having someone scream at you repeatedly that everything is under control .
Sure .
We believe you .
Kristof : US should stop biting tongue on Israel RAW STORY
Published : Saturday March 17 , 2007 Print This Email This
Whether they have " learned to muzzle themselves " or they " just do n't get it , " US politicians should stop biting their tongues when it comes to Israel , New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof argues in Sunday 's paper .
" Democrats are railing at just about everything President Bush does , with one prominent exception : Bush 's crushing embrace of Israel , " Kristof writes .
And since " [t ] here is no serious political debate among either Democrats or Republicans about our policy toward Israelis and Palestinians , " Kristof believes , the " silence harms America , Middle East peace prospects and Israel itself . "
" Within Israel , you hear vitriolic debates in politics and the news media about the use of force and the occupation of Palestinian territories , " Kristof notes .
" Yet no major American candidate is willing today to be half as critical of hard - line Israeli government policies as , say , Haaretz , the Israeli newspaper . "
According to Kristof , " Hard - line Israeli policies have profoundly harmed that country 's long - term security by adding vulnerable settlements , radicalizing young Palestinians , empowering Hamas and Hezbollah , isolating Israel in the world and nurturing another generation of terrorists in Lebanon .
The Israeli right 's aggressive approach has only hurt Israeli security , just as in much the same way that Bush 's invasion of Iraq ended up harming U.S. interests . "
Discussing what happened after Hezbollah kidnapped and killed Israeli troops last summer , Kristof believes that " Bush would have been a much better friend to Israel if he had tried to rein in Olmert , " after the prime minister " invaded Lebanon and thus transformed Hezbollah into a heroic force in much of the Arab world . "
" So let 's be better friends -- and stop biting our tongues , " Kristof argues .
Excerpts from op - ed : # One reason for the void is that American politicians have learned to muzzle themselves .
In the run-up to the 2004 Democratic primaries , Howard Dean said he favored an " even - handed role " for the United States -- and was blasted for being hostile to Israel .
Likewise , Barack Obama has been scolded for daring to say : " Nobody is suffering more than the Palestinian people . "
In contrast , Hillary Rodham Clinton has safely refused to show an inch of daylight between herself and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
A second reason may be that American politicians just do n't get it .
King Abdullah of Jordan spoke to Congress this month and observed : " The wellspring of regional division , the source of resentment and frustration far beyond , is the denial of justice and peace in Palestine . "
Though widely criticized , King Abdullah was exactly right : from Morocco to Yemen to Sudan , the Palestinian cause arouses ordinary people in coffee shops more than almost anything else .
You can argue that Arabs pursue a double standard , focusing on repression by Israelis while ignoring greater human rights violations by fellow Arabs .
But the suffering in Palestinian territories , while not remotely at the scale of brutality in Sudan or Iraq , is still tragically real .

Last year , amid the din of its boardroom - spying scandal , Hewlett - Packard quietly achieved a milestone :
It edged out IBM in 2006 revenue , becoming the world ’s largest tech company .
But in keeping with the no-nonsense style of Chief Executive Mark Hurd , there were no high - fives or laudatory e-mails to employees .
In Hurd ’s HP , the goal is to keep moving forward .
As this turnaround master enters his third year at the helm of the computer and printer giant , it is clear that his nose - to - the - grindstone focus is yielding remarkable success .
HP ’s stock is up 88 percent since Hurd arrived from NCR .
The Palo Alto company shot past archrival Dell to become No. 1 in personal computers .
It also surpassed IBM as the tech revenue leader .
With Hurd ’s intense focus on cutting costs , HP continued its remarkable financial turnaround even as the boardroom scandal gave it a black eye .
The behemoth ’s sales grew a respectable 7 percent in the most recent four quarters , continuing its reign as No. 1 on the Silicon Valley 150 list .
Yet as impressive as those accomplishments have been , the next act may be even more challenging for Hurd and one of the valley ’s most storied businesses .
Hurd , who replaced the ousted Carly Fiorina in April 2005 , has made his reputation and found much success to date by cutting costs and wringing out inefficiencies .
Now he needs to get HP on a path of consistent growth .
“ We ’ve got work to do , ” Hurd said , in one of his typical statements last month at a technology conference .
“ We have made some progress … but not a lot . ”
Hurd declined to be interviewed for this report .
Initially viewed by some as purely an operations executive , and feared by employees for his “ slash and burn ” reputation , Hurd has proved to be a better strategist than many expected .
After replacing some top executives with key hires ,
Hurd now has a team of lieutenants on whom he counts for frank discussions of their businesses .
As a result of careful study over the past two years , Hurd & Co. have developed a strategy to grow in software , services , mobile computing , printing and tech infrastructure .
` Strategy ’ discussions
“ The discussions he has with me and the board are a lot more around the strategy of the company and where we are taking it , ” said Shane Robison , an HP executive vice president and chief strategy and technology officer .
HP ’s progress over the past two years has been impressive .
In fiscal 2006 , which ended in October , revenue grew 6 percent to $ 91.7 billion , while profit soared to $ 6.2 billion , up from $ 2.4 billion .
“ We love him , ” said Daniel Renouard , an analyst with W.R. Baird .
“ He has done wonderful things with what was viewed as a dinosaur a few years ago . ”
In a bid to reduce chaos and redundancies , some of which came about as a result of HP ’s $ 19 billion purchase of Compaq Computer , Hurd eliminated three tiers of management , decentralized sales and marketing , and gave his top executives more control over their own budgets .
In the past year and a half , the company has cut 14,790 jobs , or roughly 10 percent of the workforce , while also launching early retirement programs and tightening up on retirement benefits .
In the quest for additional cost savings , Chief Information Officer Randy Mott , who joined HP from Dell , has been leading a makeover of the technology systems that run HP .
The company has consolidated its data centers to six from 85 and reduced the number of internal software applications to 1,500 from 5,000 , using as much standards - based technology as possible , including everything it can from HP .
The tech revamp within HP is aimed at helping the company sell its computers , software and services to corporate chief information officers .
“ When I am selling to large banks and large auto companies , there is nothing more powerful than saying we have deployed this inside HP , ” said Ann Livermore , executive vice president in charge of HP ’s server , software and services business .
Communication style
While Hurd has given his managers more authority and makes them more accountable , his cell phone seems glued to his ear as he constantly checks in with them for brief chats or leaves voice - mail messages .
Satjiv Chahil , the marketing guru of HP ’s PC business , got an inkling of Hurd ’s style his first day at HP in September 2005 .
“ So what ’s our message ? ” Chahil recalled his new boss asking , getting right to the point .
Hurd was interested in Chahil ’s ideas to rejuvenate HP ’s staid PC brand .
Hurd made other key hires to round out his inner circle .
Todd Bradley , the senior vice president in charge of the PC business , joined in 2005 from palmOne , where he was CEO .
Among HP ’s businesses , the PC division has seen one of the biggest turnarounds , surpassing troubled Dell in market share and improving profit margins .
Bradley sees big growth potential for HP in mobile , connected devices .
“ The key difference vs. 2 1/ 2 years ago is we focus on both costs and growth , ” said Bradley , who joined HP in 2005 .
An ad campaign for PCs developed by Goodby , Silverstein & Partners , “ The Computer Is Personal Again , ” featuring fashion designer Vera Wang , Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Shaun White and others , has received kudos in the PC and advertising industries , helping make HP ’s brand seem cooler and hipper .
“ The concern two years ago that they could never hold up against Dell has gone away , ” said Carl Claunch , an analyst with Gartner .
To boost growth in its lucrative printing business , which accounts for more than half its operating profit , HP is creating new services and technologies .
Vyomesh Joshi , senior vice president of HP ’s imaging and printing business , said the company is now bent on moving from “ printers to printing . ”
As one example , he cites HP ’s acquisition in 2005 of Snapfish , a digital - photo - printing service that lets consumers order photos over the Internet and receive them at home or pick them up at Walgreen ’s or at retailers ’ photo kiosks .
HP also has targeted professional - class printers for businesses as another area of expansion .
Its recent purchase of software maker Tabblo is aimed at improving – and spurring – the printing of pages from the Web .
“ We want to capture not only pages from the PC , but from the Web , ” said Joshi .
“ You do n’t want to just think about printers shipped , but how many pages are being printed . ”
Room for improvement
One of HP ’s biggest challenges remains its corporate server , software and services business .
It includes low - margin commodity servers , aging product lines , as well as the faster - growing software and services businesses .
In 2006 , HP lost market share in servers while rivals Sun Microsystems and IBM added share .
“ We have n’t seen much of a change in systems , ” said John Fowler , executive vice president of systems at Sun .
Hurd “ has n’t figured out a way to fix it . ”
But as HP continues to cut costs , it ’s looking to invest more in some key areas such as software .
Since the beginning of 2006 , HP has purchased nine software and service companies , including Mercury Interactive , a developer of application - testing software .
Analysts estimate HP will add nearly $ 1 billion in revenue annually through acquisitions .
Revenue targets
HP ’s goal is to consistently increase sales by 4 percent to 6 percent a year , hitting $ 100 billion in revenue in fiscal 2008 – no small feat for a company that size .
Some analysts now are focusing on HP ’s hefty earnings growth instead , but many also hope HP over - delivers on its targets .
The current consensus on Wall Street is for HP ’s revenue in fiscal 2007 to grow 8 percent , slowing down to 5 percent growth in fiscal 2008 .
“ While HP must ultimately make the transition to growth , we see additional opportunities for cost reduction … and potential for stronger growth , ” Andy Neff , an analyst at Bear Stearns , wrote in a recent report .
By many accounts , Hurd has instilled a fear of complacency within the company .
So when HP inched past IBM in sales recently , there was nary a twitter in HP ’s cubicles or executive offices .
“ We think that once you start high - fiving , then you are showing that you are weak , ” Livermore said .

Technical Report 227
August 1998
Abstract :
File systems and databases usually make several synchronous disk write accesses in order to make sure that the disk always has a consistent view of their data , so that it can be recovered in the case of a system crash .
Since synchronous disk operations are slow , some systems choose to employ asynchronous disk write operations , at the cost of low reliability : in case of a system crash all data that have not yet been written to disk are lost .
In this paper we describe a software - based Non Volatile RAM system that provides the reliability of synchronous write operations with the performance of asynchronous write operations .
Our system takes a set of volatile main memories residing in independent workstations and transforms it into a non-volatile memory buffer - much like RAIDS do with magnetic disks .
It then uses this non-volatile buffer as an intermediate storage space in order to acknowledge synchronous write operations before actually writing the data to magnetic disk , but after writing the data to ( intermediate ) stable storage .
Using simulation and experimental evaluation we demonstrate the performance advantages of our system .
To decouple the application performance from the high disk latency , Fast Non-Volatile RAM ( NVRAM ) , has been proposed as a mean of speeding up synchronous write operations [ 2,27,10 ] .
Applications that want to write their data to disk , first write their data to NVRAM ( at main memory speed ) , and then , they continue with their execution .
At the same time , the data are also asynchronously written from the NVRAM to the disk .
If the system crashes after the data are written in the NVRAM , but before they are written to the disk , the data are not lost , and can be recovered from the NVRAM when the system comes up again .
NVRAM modules can have various forms , but most usually they consist of battery - backed low power SRAM .
The main disadvantage of these products is their high price - they cost four to ten times as much as volatile DRAM memory of the same size [ 2 ] .
To reduce cost and increase performance , researchers have proposed the use of FLASH ( EEPROM ) memory to construct large non-volatile main memory storage systems [ 27 ] .
FLASH chips retain their contents even after a power failure , have price comparable to DRAM memory of the same size , but have very high write latency .
An NVRAM system consisting of FLASH chips coupled with a small amount of battery - backed SRAM has low read and write latency , but also has a high - cost , making it suitable only for high - end workstations .
In this paper we describe a software - only method to develop an NVRAM system , which does not require specialized hardware .
To provide a non-volatile storage space , we use several independent , but volatile data repositories .
Data that need to be written to non-volatile storage are written to more than one volatile storage repository .
Data loss would occur , if all volatile storage repositories lose their data , an event with very low probability for all practical purposes .
Our system uses the main memories of the workstations in a workstation cluster , as the independent storage repositories .
Thus , if an application wants to write some data to non-volatile memory , it writes the data in its own memory , and the memory of another workstation in the same cluster .
As soon as the data are written in the main memory of another workstation , the application is free to proceed .
While the application computes , the data are also asynchronously written to disk .
If the workstation on which the application runs crashes before the data are completely transferred to disk , the data are not lost , and can be recovered from the remote memory where they also reside .
Both local and remote workstations are connected to independent power supplies , so that a power outage will not result in data loss for both workstations .
The notion of redundancy has been extensively used in the past to provide various forms of reliability , ranging from RAIDS [ 8 ] to large scale geographically distributed databases .
Recent architecture trends in the area of interconnection networks , and Networks of Workstations ( NOWs ) make the idea of using the main memory of remote workstations ( within the same workstation cluster ) to develop an NVRAM system more attractive than ever because :
Bandwidth in Local Area Networks has increased rapidly : current computer networks consisting of Fast Ethernet and ATM connections are not uncommon .
These connections provide a bandwidth of 100 - 155 Mbps. Multi-Gigabit - per - second networks have also appeared in the market .
Thus , interconnection network bandwidth is now comparable ( within the same order of magnitude ) to main memory bandwidth , which implies that memory to memory transfers between workstations can happen at a rate similar to memory - to - memory transfers within a workstation , and of course much faster than disk - to - memory transfers .

The Latency of Local Area Networks has decreased significantly : several computer networks provide end - to - end latency as low as a few microseconds [ 5,13,19,23 ] .
Optimized software implementation on standard ATM networks provide latency as low as a few tens of microseconds [ 24,25 ] .
Thus , the transfer of small amounts of information between main memories takes only few tens of microseconds , while disk - to - memory transfers require at least a few milliseconds , even for very small amounts of information .
The above architecture trends suggest that memory to memory transfers between workstations in the same LAN is significantly faster than disk to memory transfers .
Both the latency and the bandwidth of remote memory are orders of magnitude better than these of magnetic disks .
Thus , an implementation of NVRAM based on memory - to - memory transfers is bound to be significantly faster than an implementation of NVRAM based on memory - to - disk transfers .
In this paper we describe such a software - only implementation of an NVRAM system .
Section 2 places our work in the context of the current state of the art .
Section 3 describes the design of our system on a network of workstations .
Section 4 presents our performance results .
Finally , section 5 summarizes our work , and concludes the paper .
Related Work
Baker et al. have proposed the use of NVRAM to improve file system performance [ 2 ] .
Through trace - driven simulation they have shown that even a small amount of NVRAM reduces disk accesses between 20 % and 90 % even for write - optimized file systems , like log - based file systems .
Their main concern , however , was that NVRAM may not be cost effective yet .
Our work is complementary to that of Baker et al. , since we propose an inexpensive software - only method to implement NVRAM , and realize the performance benefits they have predicted .
Recently , research groups have started exploring the issues in using remote memory in a workstation cluster to improve file system performance [ 1,9,11,20 ] and paging performance [ 4,12,14,18 ] .
While all these systems use remote memory as a large file system cache , we propose to use remote memory as a fast non-volatile storage medium .
That is , most of the previous work has used remote memory to improve read accesses ( through caching ) , while we propose to use remote memory to improve synchronous write accesses ( through the creation of a non-volatile buffer ) .
We view our work as complimentary to previous work , in that they can easily be extended to incorporate our approach .
Most of the mentioned file systems already keep at least two copies of several pages for performance reasons , and thus can be extended to use these copies for reliability reasons as well .
In that sense our NVRAM system can improve the performance of Persistent and Recoverable main memory systems [ 6,22 ] .
The Harp file system uses replicated file servers to tolerate single server failures [ 16 ] and speedups write operations as follows : each file server is equipped with a UPS to tolerate power failures , and disk accesses are removed from the critical path , by being replaced with communication between the primary and backup servers .
Although our work and Harp use similar approaches ( redundant power supplies and information replication ) to survive both hardware and software failures , there are several differences , the most important being that we view network memory as a temporary non-volatile buffer space , while Harp uses full data mirroring to survive server crashes .
The Rio file system avoids destroying its main memory contents in case of a crash [ 7 ] .
Thus , if a workstation is equipped with a UPS and the Rio file system , it can survive all failures : power failures do not happen ( due to the UPS ) , and software failures do not destroy the contents of the main memory .
However , even Rio may lead to data loss in case of UPS malfunction .
In these cases , our approach that keeps two copies of sensitive data in two workstations connected to two different power supplies , will be able to avoid data loss .
In effect , Rio makes a single workstation more reliable , while our approach achieves reliability through redundancy .
It is like making a single disk more reliable vs. using a RAID .
Vista [ 17 ] is a recoverable memory library being implemented on top of Rio .
Ioanidis et al. have proposed the use of remote memory to speed up synchronous write operations used in the Write Ahead Log ( WAL ) protocol [ 15 ] .
In their approach , they replicate the Log file in two main memories and substitute synchronous disk write operations with synchronous remote memory write operations and asynchronous disk write operations .
PERSEAS [ 21 ] is another user - level transaction library that uses ( remote main memory ) mirroring to survive crashes .
In contrary to [ 15 ] and [ 21 ] , we describe and evaluate a kernel - level system that will benefit all applications running on top of it , not only applications that have been compiled and linked with the special libraries described in [ 15,21 ] .
Our work is also related to previous work in RAIDs [ 8,26 ] , in that we both use redundancy to improve reliability and recover lost data in case of a crash .
However , our work focuses in recovering lost main memory information , while the work in RAIDs focuses on recovering lost disk information .
Compared to previous approaches in developing NVRAM systems , our work has the following advantages :
We propose an inexpensive way to built NVRAM systems .
Our system uses the existing and otherwise idle main memory in a workstation cluster .
Previous approaches to building NVRAM were either too expensive ( e.g. battery - backed SRAM systems ) , or too slow ( e.g. magnetic disks ) , or suitable for systems that require hundreds of MBytes of NVRAM ( e.g. FLASH memory ) .
Our approach provides a fast and light - weight recovery mechanism .
In traditional NVRAM systems , if the workstation that has the battery - backed SRAM chips , or the FLASH chips crashes and takes a long time to come up again ( e.g. possibly due to irrecoverable hardware problems ) , the information contained in the NVRAM system is not accessible .
The only way to access the information is to manually remove the NVRAM cards from the workstation , plug them in another workstation , and access them from their new place .
This procedure may induce several minutes , or even hours of idle time - which is in several cases as frustrating as data loss .
In our NVRAM system , if the client workstation crashes , the data are still accessible , since they are in the main memory of another workstation and can be accessed through the network within milliseconds .
If , on the other hand , the server crashes , the data are still in the main memory of the client and are being scheduled to be ( asynchronously ) written on the disk .
Data loss would occur only if both client and server do down at the same time .
2
Remote Memory NVRAM
The purpose of the NVRAM servers is to accept data from clients so that data reside in at least two workstations : the client and at least one server .
Each NVRAM server allocates a main memory segment ( hereafter called the NVRAM segment ) which it uses to write the data it accepts from the clients .
A client that wants to store its data into stable storage , before being able to proceed , sends its data to the NVRAM server and asynchronously sends the data to the disk .
As soon as the NVRAM server acknowledges the receipt of the data , the client is free to proceed with its own work .
An NVRAM server continually reads data sent by the clients , and stores them in its own memory .
If its NVRAM segment fills up , the server sends a message back to the client telling it to synchronously write to the disk all its data that correspond to the NVRAM segment .
4
After the client flushes its data to the disk , it sends a message to the server to recycle the space used by those data .
Effectively , the server acts as a fast non-volatile buffer between the client and its disk .
This fast non-volatile buffer may improve the performance of the file system significantly as we will see in section 4 .
It is possible that a client workstation crashes after it sends its data to the NVRAM server , but before the data are safely written to the disk .
In this case , the data are not lost , and can still be found in the main memory of the NVRAM server .
When the crashed workstation reboots , it will read its data back from the NVRAM server .
If the server detects a lost client , it sends all its main memory data to a magnetic disk .
If the client detects a lost server , or a disconnected network , it synchronously writes all its data to disk , and continue doing so for all msync ( synchronous disk write ) operations , until the server , or the network is up and running again .
We should emphasize that all the above situations do not lead to data loss , but only a graceful degradation of system performance .
Since , however , workstation crashes and network disconnections do not last for long , we expect the performance degradation due to them to be unnoticeable .
Our system will experience data loss , only when both the client and the server crash within a short time interval , an event with very low probability .
If for example , the client and the server crash independent from each other once a month , both of them will crash at the same time interval ( of e.g. one minute ) once every a thousand years .
It is true , however , that several machines may go down within a short time interval , but this is usually a result of a scheduled shutdown , in which case our system can also shut down gracefully ( i.e. flush dirty data to magnetic disk ) as well .
Our NVRAM system instead of using a synchronous disk write operation at commit time ( to force the data to the disk ) , it uses a synchronous network write operation ( to force a copy of the data to the remote server ) , plus an asynchronous disk write operation .
Since both the latency and the bandwidth of modern networks are significantly better than the latency and the bandwidth of modern magnetic disks , we expect that the latency of a synchronous network write operation to be much lower than that of a synchronous disk operation .
Performance Evaluation
In our experiments we will demonstrate how our software - based NVRAM system can improve the performance of software systems that make frequent use of synchronous disk write operations ( like file systems and databases ) .
Traditionally , synchronous disk write operations block the system , until the data are safely written to disk .
In our NVRAM system instead , a synchronous disk write operation will be implemented as a synchronous network write operation , and an asynchronous disk write operation .
Thus , instead of waiting for the data to be safely written to the disk , the system will send a copy of the data to the remote memory server , and wait for the data to be written to the remote memory .
In this way , our NVRAM system replaces a synchronous disk write operation with a synchronous network write operation , which we expect to result in performance improvement .
We have experimented with three system configurations :
DISK : This is a traditional system unmodified .
Synchronous write operations are handled by the operating system without our intervention .
The operating system sends the write requests to the disk and waits for them to complete .

NVRAM -ETHERNET :
This is the same system as previously , with the exception that client and server applications communicate via an Ethernet interconnection network .
Sequential Accesses
We open a reasonably large file ( 100 Mbytes long ) , and write sequentially to it in blocks 8 Kbytes long .
After each block is modified , we call the msync operation to make sure that the block is written into stable memory , and continue with writing the next block .

We see that as little as 1 Mbyte of remote RAM is enough to achieve significant performance improvements compared to DISK .
debit - credit : a processes banking transactions very similar to the TPC-B .
order - entry : a benchmark that follows TPC-C and models the activities of a wholesale supplier .
We run the benchmarks and obtained traces of their transaction_commit operations .
For each transaction , we recorded - at commit time - a list of all the database regions that are modified and must be sent to stable storage .
Our traces record the regions at the locking boundary of the application , and are therefore more detailed than block - based traces .
Later , we map each of these regions into ( possibly multiple ) operating system pages or disk blocks .
DISK : At each transaction_commit time we invoke the ( simulated ) msync system call which synchronously sends to the magnetic disk all operating system pages that have been modified by the transaction .
We use the disk simulator provided by Greg Ganger , Bruce Worthington , and Yale Patt from http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/disksim/ .
The disk simulated is a Seagate ST41601N ( modified to include a cache of 320 Kbytes ) .

The disk simulated is a Seagate ST41601N ( modified to include a cache of 320 Kbytes ) .
DISK - ASYNC : This is the same system as DISK with the difference that the write operations to disk proceed asynchronously , that is , the transaction_commit operation returns as soon as the data have been scheduled to be written ( at some later time ) on disk .
It is obvious that this configuration does not provide the reliability implied by transaction_commit or by msync .
However , we use it as a upper bound on the performance of any system that would use layer of Non-volatile memory between the file system disk and the disk .

However , we use it as a upper bound on the performance of any system that would use layer of Non-volatile memory between the file system disk and the disk .
NVRAM : This is our proposed system , which when the msync system call is invoked , it writes data to remote memory synchronously and to the magnetic disk asynchronously .
The msync system call returns as soon as the data have been safely written to remote memory .
Our simulations were run on a cluster of SUN ULTRA II workstations connected with an ATM switch .
The disk access times are simulated times provided by the disk simulator , while the data that should be sent to remote memory ( in the simulated system ) are actually sent to the remote server 's memory using TCP / IP on top of ATM .
Figure : Performance ( in transactions per second ) of the three system configurations for our two applications .
The disk simulated is a Seagate ST41601N .
Figure 2 shows the ( simulated ) performance of our system as compared to traditional disk - based systems for a block size of 8 K bytes .
We see that a synchronous disk suffers a significant penalty compared to an asynchronous one ( roughly 1/3rd to 1/4th of the performance ) ; this result is of course expected and represents the cost of a simple implementation of reliability .
Furthermore , we see that our NVRAM system achieves almost the same throughput of the asynchronous disk ( within 3 % ) ; compared to the synchronous disk , the NVRAM system performance is between 3 to 4 times better .
As we describe earlier , the NVRAM system achieves this performance improvement by decoupling all the synchronous transaction operations from the disk .
In addition , the asynchronous disk operations may ( and actually do ) overlap with the synchronous network operations , with the net effect of hiding some part of the synchronous operations .
Note however , that even the NVRAM system is still limited by the disk because is is fast enough to saturate the effective bandwidth of the asynchronous disk .
Sophisticated database systems use group - commit to improve the performance of their transactions .
In group commit , transactions are commited in groups .
All transactions in the group perform their ( synchronous ) disk write operations at the group commit time .
Thus , the magnetic disk receives several write accesses which can be scheduled and merged effectively , reducing seek and rotational latency .
Table 2 shows the performance of our system vs. the performance of a group commit system that commits 100 transactions at a time ( requiring a little more than 3 Mbytes of intermediate buffer space ) .
We see that our approach results in 4% - 40 % performance improvement , mostly due to the fact that group commit has to make a synchronous disk write operation ( every 100 transactions ) while our system can proceed fully asynchronously .
Even if group commit had the same performance as our system , it would still have two major disadvantages :
Our approach can speed - up synchronous disk write operations that originate from any application running on the system , while group commit applies only to databases , and only to those that it has been explicitly programmed in .
Group commit results in significant transaction latency , since the first transaction of the group cannot commit until the last transaction of the group starts , executes , and commits .
Thus , the latency experienced by each transaction may easily reach up to several seconds .
On the contrary , the latency experienced by each transaction in our system is in the order of a few milliseconds .

The disk simulated is a Quantum Viking II 4.55S .
Figure 3 presents the performance of four system configurations when the simulated disk is a Quantum Viking II 4.55S ( 4.5 Gbyte disk ) .
As previously , we see that our approach is significantly ( 3 - 4 times ) faster than the synchronous disk .
It achieves 5 - 40 % higher throughput ( and two orders of magnitude lower latency ) than group - commit .
Finally , our approach is within 2 - 3 % of asynchronous disk .
Summarizing , our performance results suggest that our approach combines the performance of asynchronous disk operations ( within 3 % ) with the reliability of synchronous disk accesses .
Conclusions
We have implemented our system on a workstation cluster , evaluated its performance and compared it against the performance of disk - based systems .
Based on our experience we conclude :
Network Memory provides an attractive alternative to hardware battery - backed NVRAM systems .
The main advantage of our system is its low cost .
It uses existing ( and otherwise unused ) resources to create a non-volatile memory buffer .
Network Memory has ( practically ) the same performance as methods that provide no reliability .
Our results suggest that the performance of our system is the same as the that of a system doing asynchronous disk write operations .
The performance benefits of software - based NVRAM will increase with time .
Current architecture trends suggest that the gap between processor and disk speed continues to widen .
Disks are not expected to provide the bandwidth and latency needed by synchronous write operations , unless a breakthrough in disk technology occurs .
On the other hand , interconnection network bandwidth and latency keeps improving at a much higher rate than ( single ) disk bandwidth and latency , thereby increasing the performance benefits of using remote memory in software - based NVRAM systems .
Meanwhile , the amount of memory in workstation increases , reducing in this way the cost of an NVRAM server .
Based on our experience in building the NVRAM system , and our performance measurements , we believe that software - based NVRAM is an inexpensive alternative to hardware NVRAM systems , and can be used to speed up several system components , including file systems and databases .

Sotiris Ioannidis is now with the University of Rochester .
Evangelos P. Markatos , Gregory Maglis , and Dionisions Pnevmatikatos are also with the University of Crete .
In this case , however , we could use two or even three servers to make data available even after the crash of two - three workstations .
Although high degrees of data replication seems to add significant overhead our performance results suggest that sending data to remote main memories over a fast network in negligible compared to sending data to a magnetic disk .
In this paper we will use the term workstation to mean either a workstation or a high - end personal computer .
Most probably all these data would already reside in the disk , since they were asynchronously written to the disk when they were initially sent to the NVRAM server .

Southern Ocean Nears CO2 Saturation Point
By Stephen Leahy
May 17 ( IPS ) – Climate change has arrested the Southern Ocean ’s ability to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere , researchers announced Thursday .
That will make it more difficult to stabilise carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels in the atmosphere and to reduce the risks of extreme forms of global warming .
The Southern Ocean has been absorbing less CO2 from the atmosphere since 1981 , even though levels have increased 40 percent due to burning of fossil fuels .
Oceans absorb half of all human carbon emissions , but the Southern Ocean is taking up less and less and is reaching its saturation point , reported an international research team in the journal Science .
This is the first evidence of the long - feared positive feedbacks that could rapidly accelerate the rate of climate change , pushing impacts to the extreme end of the scale .
“ This is serious .
All climate models predict that this kind of feedback will continue and intensify during this century , ” said Corinne Le Quere of Britain ’s University of East Anglia and the paper ’s lead author .
“ With the Southern Ocean reaching its saturation point , more CO2 will stay in our atmosphere , ” Le Quere said in a statement .
This new research is not reflected in the recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
“ This finding could make a significant difference in some of the IPCC projections , ” said co-author Thomas Conway of the Global Monitoring Division of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) in Boulder , Colorado .
“ If this study holds up , it means the rate of increase CO2 in the atmosphere will be faster , ” Conway told IPS .

Bound for Glory : America in Color
Exhibition Home
September 8 –January 21 , 2006
Bound for Glory : America in Color is the first major exhibition of the little known color images taken by photographers of the Farm Security Administration / Office of War Information ( FSA / OWI ) .
Comprised of seventy digital prints made from color transparencies taken between 1939 and 1943 , this exhibition reveals a surprisingly vibrant world that has typically been viewed only through black - and - white images .
These vivid scenes and portraits capture the effects of the Depression on America ’s rural and small town populations , the nation ’s subsequent economic recovery and industrial growth , and the country ’s great mobilization for World War II .
The photographs in Bound for Glory , many by famed photographers such as John Vachon , Jack Delano , Russell Lee , and Marion Post Wolcott , document not only the subjects in the pictures , but also the dawn of a new era — the Kodachrome era .
These colorful images mark a historic divide in visual presentation between the monochrome world of the pre-modern age and the brilliant hues of the present .
They change the way we look — and think about — our past .

Mr Pillar says warnings about the post - Saddam chaos were ignored
Paul Pillar writes in the Foreign Affairs journal that the White House used the intelligence to justify a decision it had already reached .
Mr Pillar was the national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia from 2000 to 2005 .
The Bush administration has yet to respond to Mr Pillar 's accusations .
The White House has previously denied claims that it manipulated intelligence to gather support for the war .
' Ill will '
" Official intelligence on Iraqi weapons programmes was flawed , but even with its flaws , it was not what led to the war , " Mr Pillar writes .
Instead , he says that the White House " went to war without requesting - and evidently without being influenced by - any strategic - level intelligence assessments on any aspect of Iraq " .
" It has become clear that official intelligence analysis was not relied on in making even the most significant national security decisions , that intelligence was misused publicly to justify decisions already made , that damaging ill will developed between policymakers and intelligence officers , and that the intelligence community 's own work was politicised , " Mr Pillar writes .
He also blames the Bush administration for ignoring warnings that Iraq could easily fall into violence and chaos after the war to topple Saddam Hussein .
" In a deeply divided Iraqi society , with Sunnis resentful over the loss of their dominant position and Shia seeking power commensurate with their majority status , there was a significant chance that the groups would engage in violent conflict , " Mr Pillar writes .
His comments come in a website preview of the March / April issue of Foreign Affairs , which is published by the Council of Foreign Relations .
The council is an independent US body aimed at improving understanding of foreign affairs .

1. Introduction
Marriages are a time for high spirits , celebration , and warm feelings .
Mathematics has a reputation of being an impersonal subject , with austere pleasures rather than a subject of high emotion or celebration .
Yet , there is a body of mathematical results known as marriage theorems .
Why marriage theorems ?
One reason is the playfulness and whimsey of mathematicians , who enjoy spinning out seemingly artificial tales and giving these tales names forming analogies or connections with everyday experiences .
The other is that perhaps by serendipity , two of mathematics ' marriage theorems are causes for celebration , high spirits , and warm feelings .
These theorems involve such intuitively appealing yet deep ideas that they serve as a metaphor for the marriage of the emotional and intellectual , examples of mathematics at its most transcendent .
The unexpected dividend in both cases is that ideas born of theoretical mathematics have shown many applied directions .
2. Philip Hall 's Marriage Theorem
Suppose that one has a collection of men and women .
Each man knows exactly k women and each woman knows exactly k men .
Is it possible to marry off everyone so that in each resulting couple the man and woman know each other ?
Perhaps only a mathematician would use the term marriage for such a situation !
Yet , the theorem that gives insight into this situation is as wondrous as the experiences that lead to marriage in the real world .
Here is a mathematical model which tries to frame the problem above , though it does not quite take the path followed by Hall ( about which more later ) .
Suppose we represent the men by a collection of dots , and the women by a different collection of dots , as shown in Figure 1 below .
Note that , for the moment , we need to have the same number of men and women .
In the diagram shown , each man is connected to 3 women and each woman is connected to three men , there being five men ( top set of dots ) and five women ( bottom set of dots ) .
Figure 1
Figure 1
A more general situation occurs if we have equal numbers of men and women but we do not necessarily have the same number of women known by each man and by each woman .
Can you see why it is impossible to marry off all the men to women they know in the diagram above ?
( Hint : Look at the men at the far left and the far right ! )
By contrast , in the diagram below , all the men can be married off to women they know .
Can you see how to pair off the men and women so that they know each other ?
Not a total triviality .
Here is a solution :
Figure 2
Figure 2
So , we have several issues to address here :
When can one marry off the men to the women , and is there an algorithm , a simple set of rules , that can be followed , that will find such a pairing when one exists in a reasonable amount of time , even for large numbers of men and women ?
The ideas that lie behind this marriage theorem were discovered independently in several different contexts .
The Hungarian graph theorist Dénes König ( 1894 -1944 ) , the British group theorist Philip Hall and others all found their way to the circle of ideas involved .
A rare photo of Dénes König , kindly provided by Filep László Philip Hall
Hall had come across his theorem in 1935 ( as a result about cosets in group theory ) ; in recent years it is typically stated as a theorem about sets .
The basic idea is to define a system of distinct representatives ( SDR ) .
Think of having a list of committees which have potentially overlapping membership .
The goal is to elect a different chairperson for each committee .
Abstracting , we have a collection of ( unordered ) sets of objects whose members have been chosen from some list M of objects .
The connection with marriage theorems is that one can think of the sets as being the names that each woman lists for the men ( who are the elements of the set M , which explains the use of the letter M ) whom she would accept as a mate .
Assigning each woman a unique man means finding an SDR for the women 's sets .
Hall 's
Theorem states that an SDR exists if and only if for any number i of the women ( for i equal to one up to the total number of women ) the lumping together of the men on the lists of the i women contains at least i men .
( If , for example , 5 of the women only have 4 men on their lists of potential mates , no marriage assignment is possible . )
The statement of Hall 's Theorem , though very elegant , does not lead immediately to finding an SDR in an efficient way , it only gives a test to see if such an SDR exists .
The role of an SDR in the set formulation is related to the notion of a matching in a graph .
In this setting , finding an SDR becomes more practical .
A matching in a graph is a collection of edges ( line segments ) which have no vertex in common .
Given a graph one can look for matchings which have the property that no edge can be added to the matching .
Alternatively , one can look for a matching with the largest possible number of edges .
A graph is said to have a perfect matching when every vertex of the graph is the endpoint of some edge in the matching .
A necessary condition for this to happen is that the graph have an even number of vertices .
However , graphs which have an even number of vertices need not have a perfect matching .
The red lines in Figure 2 above represent a perfect matching .
Interpreting the vertices as women and men shows how to marry off the women to men they know .
Dénes König , who helped reenergize the study of graphs ( which was first investigated by Leonard Euler ) , made important contributions to the theory of matchings by showing how to find matchings in an efficient manner .
Extensions of the idea of matchings allow the graph to have weights assigned to the edges .
For example , one might have a collection of people and jobs for which these individuals are qualified .
If personi is qualified for job j there is an edge between the vertices representing i and j .
This edge can be assigned a weight which indicates :
a .
The amount of time that it will take i to complete j , or
b . The efficiency with which i will be able to carry out j , or
c. The cost of completing j if i does j .
This leads to problems of matching workers to jobs to maximize something ( perhaps the efficiency with which all the jobs can be completed ) or minimize something ( the cost of completing the jobs with a particular assignment of workers ) .
Researchers have been successful in obtaining many theoretical and applied results for problems of this sort , including , in many cases , polynomial time ( i.e. reasonably practical ) algorithms for solving them .
3. Beyond the Hall Marriage Theorem
The Hall Marriage theorem aims to examine when it is possible to marry a collection of men to a collection of women who know each other .
However , one can imagine that this might not be a very satisfactory situation because the people who are paired are not happy with the partners that they are assigned .
A natural way to try to do better is to ask the men how they rank the women and the women how they rank the men .
It is this straightforward idea that leads to a remarkable story of the interplay of theoretical and applicable ideas .
The model is usually referred to as the Gale - Shapley Marriage Theorem .
David Gale David Gale
Lloyd Shapley Lloyd Shapley
In fact , David Gale and Lloyd Shapley were not the first to either think of the model or apply it to a practical situation .
None the less Gale and Shapley showed that there was a truly remarkable mathematical theorem that governed what happened in this situation .
Let us consider the simplest version of the Gale - Shapley framework , which has been extended in many directions , some of which I will mention .
Suppose that we have two sets of equal size : a set of men and a set of women .
Each man produces a ranking for each woman where indifference is not allowed .
Each woman produces a ranking for each man where indifference is not allowed .
For example , if the men's names are Man 1 , Man 2 , and Man 3 ; and the women 's names are Woman 1 , Woman 2 , and Woman 3 , then the rankings produced might look like :
Men 's rankings of the women :
1st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice Man 1 Woman 1 Woman 2 Woman 3 Man 2 Woman 1 Woman 3 Woman 2 Man 3 Woman 3 Woman 2 Woman 1
Table 1
Women 's rankings of the men :
1st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice Woman 1 Man 2 Man 3 Man 1 Woman 2 Man 1 Man 3 Man 2 Woman 3 Man 3 Man 1 Man 2
Table 2
Our job is take these rankings and marry the men to the women , but how are we to judge when one way of pairing off the people into couples is better or worse than another way ?
For example , here are some potential pairings :
Arrangement 1 :
Man 1 with Woman 1
Man 2 with Woman 3
Man 3 with Woman 2
or alternatively
Arrangement 2 :
Man 1 with Woman 3
Man 2 with Woman 1
Man 3 with Woman 2
In Arrangement 1 , Man 1 is very content - he got his first choice .
Woman 1 , however , finds herself paired with her least favorite .
Man 2 in this arrangement gets his second choice , he preferring Woman 1 , and we have already noted that Woman 1 would prefer any of the other men to the one she was assigned .
Thus , this arrangement tempts Man 2 and Woman 1 to " have an affair " because each prefers the other to the mate they were assigned .
When this phenomenon happens for any man / woman pair , that pair is known as a blocking pair for the matching .
If a pairing of men and women has no blocking pair , then the assignment or matching is called stable .
Thus , a marriage arrangement is unstable if for some man / woman pair , that pair would prefer each other to the partners they were assigned by the arrangement .
Unfortunately , Arrangement 2 is also unstable .
Man 1 and Woman 2 would prefer each other to the mates they have been assigned .
Note that it may seem to be hard to find a stable matching , but given a proposed matching we can check for a given man whether or not he is a member of a blocking pair .
Take Arrangement 2 above , and Man 2 .
Is he a member of a blocking pair ?
Since he was assigned Woman 1 , his first choice , he can not be a member of any blocking pair .
What about Man 3 ?
He is mated with Woman 2 , his second choice .
Hence , we need only check if he forms a blocking pair with the woman he ranked first , namely , Woman 3 .
Since Woman 3 prefers Man 3 to the person she was paired with ( Man 1 ) , the two form a blocking pair .
In this example we have 6 potential ways to marry off the men to women and we can check them all to see what happens .
Can you find an assignment where the stability condition holds ?
The obvious question is whether for any n ( at least 2 ) , given arbitrary ranking tables for n men and n women , there is a way of marrying the men to the women in such a way that the assignment is stable .
The amazing theorem , due to Gale and Shapley , is that not only can one prove the existence of such a stable marriage assignment in all cases , but there is an algorithm that finds such a marriage assignment in a reasonable amount of time .
4. An Algorithm for Finding a Stable Marriage
How can one find a stable marriage based on the rankings that men and women produce of each other , such as Table 1 and Table 2 above ?
Here is a way to find a stable matching .
Imagine that each woman sits behind a desk that has been set up in a gym , with a large sign having her name on it .
All the men wait until a start signal is given .
When they hear this signal , each man heads off to the table of the woman whose name is highest on his list .
Some women may find that several men arrive at their desk and other women that no man arrives .
If a woman has several suitors , she temporarily accepts the one among them that is highest on her ranking , sending any others back to the starting line .
If a woman has exactly one suitor , she temporarily accepts him .
Thus , each woman who gets one or more proposals takes the best she can get at the given stage but hopes that perhaps some better ( higher on her preference schedule ) suitor might come along later .
In the example illustrated in Table 1 and Table 2 , suppose the start signal for Round 1 is given .
Men 1 and 2 head off for the desk of Woman 1 while Man 3 heads for the desk of Woman 3 .
Since Woman 3 has only one offer , she provisionally accepts the man who makes the offer , Man 3 .
( Actually , Man 3 is her first choice , so Woman 3 is very pleased to get his offer . )
Woman 1 , having the choice of Man 1 or 2 as suitors , provisionally accepts Man 2 , and thus , Man 1 heads back to the starting line .
In Round 2 , when the signal is given Man 1 now goes to the next highest woman on his list who has not sent him packing previously .
Thus , Man 1 next proposes at the desk of Woman 2 .
Since Woman 2 has no provisional suitor , she accepts Man 1 , and now , since each woman has exactly one man at her desk , we have found a matching :
Woman 1 is matched with Man 2 .
Woman 2 is matched with Man 1 .
Woman 3 is matched with Man 3 .
Often one must go through many rounds before one reaches a situation where each woman has one man at her desk .
However , if one obtains a matching in this way , it is not hard to see that it must be stable .
Since the men and women are in competition with each other for highly ranked mates , it may not be clear how good or bad the stable matching we get from the procedure above is from the viewpoint of an individual man or woman .
However , it turns out that the stable matching that we get when the men propose ( i.e. women set up desks , and men " move around " ) is as good as any stable matching we can get from the point of view of each individual man , and is as bad as any stable matching can be from the point of view of each individual woman .
Thus , this matching is known as the Male Optimal Stable Matching .
We could design a procedure in which we reverse the roles of the men and women :
The women make proposals during the rounds of the procedure and the men set up the desks to receive proposals from them .
In our example , when the signal for the start of Round 1 is heard , Woman 1 heads for Man 2's desk , Woman 2 heads for Man 1 and Woman 3 heads for Man 3's desk .
The result is that each man has one suitor so we immediately get the stable matching :
Man 1 is matched with Woman 2 .
Man 2 is matched with Woman 1 .
Man 3 is matched with Woman 3 .
Since each woman got her first choice , they are quite happy , and this stable matching is the Female Optimal Stable Matching .
In fact , in this example the Male Optimal and Female Optimal Stable Matchings are identical .
However , this is not always the case , as the following example shows .
1st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice Man 1 Woman 1 Woman 2 Woman 3 Man 2 Woman 1 Woman 3 Woman 2 Man 3 Woman 1 Woman 2 Woman 3
Table 3
1st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice Woman 1 Man 2 Man 3 Man 1 Woman 2 Man 1 Man 3 Man 2 Woman 3 Man 2 Man 1 Man 3
Table 4
The Male Optimal Stable Matching is :
Woman 1 with Man 2
Woman 2 with Man 3
Woman 3 with Man 1 ,
while the Female Optimal Stable Matching is :
Man 1 with Woman 2
Man 2 with Woman 1
Man 3 with Woman 3 .
In this case , we get two different stable matchings depending on whether the men make the proposals ( Male Optimal ) or the women make the proposals ( Female Optimal ) .
One easy and clever way to extend the Gale - Shapley idea is to acknowledge that some men or women , given the collection of choices available to them , would rather be single than married to some ( or perhaps all ) of the mate choices .
One can incorporate this idea into the ranking of a man or woman by requiring that they list themselves in the ranking of the members of the opposite sex with the understanding that , say , for a woman 's ranking of the men , men to the right of her own name are people whom she would rather not marry .
Thus , if Woman 2's ranking were : 1 , 3 , ( Woman 2 ) , 2 , then Woman 2 would rank being paired with Man 1 , highest , Man 3 , next highest , but would prefer to be single rather than to be married to Man 2 .
Similarly , if Man 3 had the ranking 1 , 3 , 2 , ( Man 3 ) for women , this would mean he prefers the women in the order Woman 1 first , .... , and Woman 2 lowest , but prefers even Woman 2 to remaining single .
With the obvious extension of the blocking concept and stability it is possible to show that there are always stable assignments .
In some of these stable assignments some men and women may not get mates .
Rather amazingly , however , for any man or woman , if he or she remains single in one stable matching , then that person would remain single in all stable matchings !
This remarkable theoretical result has intriguing significance in some of the many applications of the Gale - Shapley model .
5. Hospitals and Residents
When students are trained to become physicians they typically attend medical school after graduating from college .
In medical school the future doctors are exposed to extensive text book learning about medicine as well as the opportunity to work with real patients .
However , not surprisingly it is highly desirable that beginning doctors get extensive experience with patients before they practice medicine on a regular basis .
The system of " internships " and " residencies " provides this training whereby , when doctors obtain their medical degrees from a medical school , they go through hands - on training with patients before fully completing their medical training .
This creates a situation where hospitals are interested in students with various specialty interests and achievements in medical school , and students have interests in getting their training in specific hospitals .
Students often show a preference for hospitals in cities or at prestigious universities rather than hospitals in rural settings .
This situation is very similar to a marriage !
The hospitals want to rank the students and the students want to rank the hospitals and we want to be able to pair the students and hospitals so that no pair would rather be paired with each other than with their assigned mates .
Note that hospitals often seek many students but a student can only get a position at one hospital .
Much research has been done to try to find good ways of creating such matchings and addressing the social consequences of the fact that rural hospitals do not get enough students .
The Gale - Shapley model , extended to the case of unacceptable partners , helps give insight into why rural hospitals do not always get the students they want .
The medical education profession had actually found its way to using a hospital ranking / student ranking matching system to pair hospitals to students and this system was in place before Gale and Shapley did their work !
The descendant of this system is known today as the National Resident Matching Program ( NRMP ) .
The system that was put in place in 1952 , while not explicitly stating any mathematical result in support of the system that was used , did , in fact , produce stable marriages .
More importantly , the system was very successful .
It brought order to a " market " that up until that time had been chaotic .
What had been happening before the voluntary national clearing house system was started was that hospitals were making offers to students earlier and earlier in their medical school careers in the hopes of having the necessary future doctors they needed .
As a result , these offers were being made before detailed information about student success in medical school was available and before students really knew what specialties they would pursue .
It is interesting that regional systems which developed in Great Britain to match doctors to hospitals were sometimes successful and sometimes not .
In examining those regional systems that worked versus those that " fell apart " due to students working outside the system , the key turned out to be that nearly always , the systems that used algorithms which guaranteed stability for the matchings were successful , while those that were not stable did not function well .
This empirical information was an interesting vindication that the " theoretical " notion of a stable matching was an important one for practical applications .
The NRMP has over the years been the source of a complicated debate over which stable matching algorithm best met the collective needs of students , hospitals , and the nation .
Not all of the debate centered around the matching aspects of the process .
Some claimed that the system violated anti-trust laws by allowing hospitals to get a cheap source of qualified " laborers . "
Alvin Roth ( now at Harvard University ) has been a pioneer in exploring the economic implications of two - sided matching markets ( in particular the NRMP ) and in exploring how to design systems such that they are well accepted .
By clarifying how the system has worked in practice and providing detailed nuances of the goals of the students and hospitals , Roth has tried to make the NRMP work better .
Mathematics often progresses by simplifying a situation down to its skeletal essence and in this form getting a striking theorem , one like the Gale - Shapely Marriage Theorem or the Hall Marriage Theorem .
However , once one has a spectacular result of this kind it becomes common to try to extend the domain of the theorems to different but related territory .
As the system for pairing hospitals and interns evolved , strains developed in the system .
One strain was that many doctors married (! ) in medical school .
Naturally , these couples wanted to be assigned to the same hospital or at the very least to a hospital in the same or nearby city .
However , it might well happen that hospitals did not have equal interest in the two married people , who might have rather different appeal ( i.e. one might have been a much better student than the other ) .
This problem with meeting the needs of married students has resulted in a rising level of medical school graduates who have chosen not to work through the NRMP .
Unfortunately , it is known that trying to extend the Gale - Shapley Theorem to a model that incorporates dealing with " pairs " can not always be guaranteed to provide a stable matching in all situations .
A nice example of this is another attempt to extend the idea of pairings , present in both the Hall Theorem and the Gale - Shapley Theorem .
Again one has 2n people , but this time , instead of having two sexes and wanting to marry off men and women , the 2n people are perhaps of the same sex .
Think of the people being paired for the purpose of making them roommates .
In this case each of the 2n people rates all the other people , and again one wants to pair off the people so that the assignment of roommate pairs is stable .
In this case it is not that hard to find examples where there is no stable matching .
Negative results of this kind , where examples show there is no general theorem , rarely put mathematicians off .
The new challenge is to find what additional special conditions on the rankings produced allow one to find a stable matching .

The valuable cargo was probably being shipped from Cadiz to Rome
Thirty metres ( 100 ft ) long and holding 400 tonnes , it is the largest Roman ship found in the Mediterranean .
Chief amongst the goods the ship was carrying were hundreds of jars of garum - a fish sauce which was a favourite condiment for rich Romans .
It was accidentally discovered in 2000 by sailors whose anchor snagged a jar .
The ship is in great condition and extremely accessible - lying in just 25 m of water , and 1.5 km ( one mile ) from the coast of Valencia .
" I am not going to say it was on the beach but almost , " said Carles de Juan , who is co-director of the wreck 's research team and was among the first divers to examine it .
We knew it was an important find , but had no real idea until now .
It is an exceptional find
Project co-director Carles de Juan
Mr de Juan said that the storm must have been of immense strength to drive such a vessel so close to shore .
" The crew did not care about the cargo or money or anything .
They headed for land to save their lives , " he said .
First proper study
Once news of the ship 's discovery was announced in 2000 , souvenir hunters targeted it , forcing the Spanish authorities to erect a steel cage around the wreck to protect it .
After years of arranging funds , expertise and equipment , a proper exploration of the site began in July of this year .
Since then , marine archaeologists have been conducting the painstaking work of cataloguing what was on board .
" We knew it was an important find , but had no real idea until now , " Mr de Juan said in an interview with the Associated Press after he and project co-director Franca Ciberchinni of Italy 's University of Pisa presented their first academic report on the site .
" It is an exceptional find , " Mr de Juan added .
An estimated 1,500 two - handled amphorae , or clay jars , were on board .
Aphrodisiac
The researchers established from remains of fish bones inside that the metre - high jars , which lay undisturbed but with eroded seals , were carrying garum .
The highly - prized delicacy was served to wealthy Romans as an accompaniment to a wide variety of dishes and was believed to be an aphrodisiac .
It is thought that the ship was also carrying ingots of lead to be used in plumbing and copper , which could be mixed with tin to make bronze artefacts .
The last time a Roman ship of similar size and good condition was discovered was off Corsica in 1985 .
" For archaeologists , a sunken ship is a historic document that tells us about ancient history and how its economy worked , " Javier Nieto , director of the Centre for Underwater Archaeology of Catalonia , said of the find .
" This ship will contribute a lot , " he added .
Can a Penny Dropped From a Building Kill a Pedestrian Below ?
Some say a penny dropped from a high building can kill , but is it true ?
May 3 , 2007  --
Have you heard this one ?
That a penny thrown off the top of the Empire State Building could kill a pedestrian below ?
Or that it would go through the sidewalk ?
Many visitors outside of the famous skyscraper we spoke to had heard all about killer pennies .
" Anybody who gets hit by that penny is about to die , ' cause that 's a long way for a penny to fall , " said one young man .
" It could actually go through someone 's skull , " said another .
Tourists at America 's tallest building , the Sears Tower in Chicago , agreed .
" If it hit concrete it would probably be smashed into little bits , or just flattened out if it landed sideways , " said one man .
" I think it would go through the roof of a car , sink into the cement , or hurt someone , " said one woman .
" Not a pleasant thought .
Do n't want to try it , but it would be kind of interesting to find out , " she said .
We thought so too , so we asked University of Virginia physics professor Louis Bloomfield about it .
" They 're thinking of a world without air ... but air resistance is a big deal for little things .
It slows down leaves , it slows down raindrops and it slows down pennies , " he said .
" The penny is heavier [ than a raindrop ] but it flutters as it comes down .
It 's very unstable in the air . "
Bloomfield has heard about the myth so often he tackles it in his latest book , " How Everything Works . "
" Pennies , they 're not aerodynamically stable ... they catch a lot of wind ... basically they 're safe , " he said .
Safe ?
Really ?
We wanted proof .
" The ideal thing would be to drop a penny off the Empire State Building and catch it , " he said .
" But sadly , no building will let us do this because they 're all worried about the myth ! "
The Test
At our request , Bloomfield concocted another test .
He filled a large weather balloon with helium and attached a penny dispenser to it that spits out pennies one at a time .
He launched the balloon hundreds of feet into the air and then a remote control device released the pennies and he ran around trying to catch them .
He did n't actually catch any of the pennies , but was hit by several of them , one time on the chin .
" It was like getting hit by a bug ... it was noticeable , but nothing more .
I was just disappointed I had n't caught the thing , " he said .
" I did n't catch it because I 'm a bad catcher and it was a windy day , but basically these things are just fluttering down . "
But his balloon only went up a couple hundred feet -- the Empire State Building is over a thousand feet tall !
" Even though we did n't go as high as the Empire State Building , it does n't matter .
The penny will hit full speed after 50 feet or so , and it just coasts , " he replied .
The pennies " reach terminal velocity and no matter how high we put the balloon , they never picked up any more speed . "
Terminal velocity is the maximum speed a falling object reaches and is determined by the object 's weight and air resistance .
Because a penny is lightweight and not aerodynamic , air resistance slows it down so much that its terminal velocity is quite slow .
But not so for many other objects , Bloomfield warns .
" Even if they 're relatively small , if they 're aerodynamically streamlined -- like a ball point pen -- they 'll reach the point at which they 're going a couple hundred miles an hour , and that 's dangerous , " he said .
" Do n't dump your handbag out the top of a building .
Something in that bag is likely to go awfully fast . "
Reports that the bubble had burst for a form of cheap , table - top nuclear fusion may have been premature .
Rusi Taleyarkhan , the physicist at the centre of a furore surrounding so - called bubble fusion , was last week cleared of scientific misconduct .
In 2002 , Taleyarkhan , then at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and now at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , published a paper in Science claiming that bombarding a solvent with neutrons and sound waves produced tiny bubbles that triggered nuclear fusion reactions .
Then in March 2006 , Purdue began investigating allegations of misconduct against Taleyarkhan , amid accusations that the evidence …
At this years NESEA Building Green 07 conference I got the chance to listen to Larry Harmon , from Air Barrier Solutions , and Peter Talmage , from PE Energy and Design .
Both men are very knowledgeable about home energy use and they put on a great talk about easy ways to reduce home energy use .
In this the first of a two part series , I will lay out their no cost ways to reduce energy use in your home , in the second article we will cover ten more expensive ( but still very affordable ) options .
So here in no particular order at the top ten most effective ways to reduce your energy costs without spending a dime .
1 . Set your thermostat lower :
It sounds obvious , and it should be , but the lower you keep your heat the less energy you will use .
Often called the “ sit in the dark and freeze ” method by its detractors , lowering your thermostat even a little will save you energy .
Every degree you lower your thermostat reduces your energy use by 4 % ( on average ) .
In a week of experimenting you can figure out a comfortable temperature , if you have a programmable thermostat you can set it lower in the night while you are sleeping and have it warm up before you get home from work .
With a little planning you can reduce your energy use by 10 - 15 % with almost no effort .
2 . Do n’t heat the whole house :
Who says you have to keep all of your home warm ?
If you have the ability , shut off guest rooms and other side rooms that are not used often .
Heating the whole home and only living in 75 % of it means you are wasting a lot of energy keeping rooms no one lives in warm .
Always heat rooms with water pipes in them .
3 . Wash cloths with the Cold / Cold setting and use full loads :
With the proper detergent washing your cloths on the cold / cold setting will save you a lot of energy and get your cloths very clean .
Much of the energy used while doing laundry comes from heating up the wash water .
Use full loads to get the maximum use out of each batch of water .
4 . Adjust water heaters down to 126 degrees :
Many hot water heaters are set at very high temperatures .
Not only is this a scalding danger , but it wastes a lot of energy keeping water hotter than you will be able to use comfortably .
Setting your water heaters thermostat to 126 will ensure that you have hot water , without having the temp go low enough that there is danger of bacteria ( some common bacteria can survive in up to 125 degree water ) .
Adjusting your water heater is simple and will only take you 5 minutes , but can save you a fair amount of energy .
5. Unplug computers , TV’s , Cable boxes , and other “ energy vampire ” appliances when not in use :
You may not know this but many things in our home continue to use energy even when they are “ off . ”
In fact anything that has a “ wall wart ” one of those tiny boxes attached to the cord continues to use energy as long as it is plugged in .
TV’s and anything else with a remote also use energy even when they are off ( VCR ’s stereos , etc ) .
Unplugging them will make sure they do n’t use energy while you are not using them .
If you do n’t want to constantly be plugging and unplugging things you can place all these energy vampire devices on a power strip and simply turn that power strip off when you are done with them .
Also remember things like cable boxes , cable modems , DSL modems , and routers use energy 24/7 , the question is do you use the Internet 24/7 ?
Using very low cost timers you can turn these devices off during the night while you are sleeping .
6 . Turn off the lights when you leave the room :
Another no -brainer .
Lighting can account for up to 30 % of the homes energy usage .
The simple act of turning the lights off when you leave the room can dramatically reduce the amount of energy used for lighting .
Also use CFL , LED ’s or other efficient light sources .
Try and use natural sunlight whenever you can .
7 . Take shorter showers :
Do you find yourself spacing out in the shower and before you know it you have run through all the hot water ?
That ’s energy and money running down the drain .
Get in , wash , get out .
Turn the water off while you shave or while you wash your hair .
There are also new low water use shower heads that are great .
They fix many of the problems older low flow shower heads had .
Pick one up you will not be sorry .
8 . Trim those bushes on the south side of your home and open the shades :
If you live in the northern hemisphere trim the bushes on the south side of your home so that sunshine can get in and warm up your house .
If you live in the southern hemisphere , trim the north side .
Natural sun shine can help warm your home and it provides nice lighting .
The best part is it does n’t cost anything .
9. Clean Baseboard heaters and refrigerator vents to maximise Performance :
Baseboard heaters and appliances with air intakes like refrigerators and some others with condenser coils need to have clean vents in order to function properly .
Why pay money to have the compressor or heater run harder when you can just wipe the dust off , or vacuum them clean .
10 .
Cook more efficiently :
While cooking use the correct size pot for the burner you are using ( does not work as well with gas stoves ) .
Using a large pot on a small burner will take longer to heat up your food , using more energy .
Cover pots while boiling water .
If you do n’t allow heat to escape your food will cook faster , and water will boil faster .
You can also use the microwave instead of the oven to warm things up .
Microwaves use much less energy than stoves do .
If you ca n’t use the microwave consider a toaster over instead of a large oven .
If you do cook something and its cold out , when you are done crack the oven door and let that heat enter the home it will help keep you warm .
Do not attempt to use your stove to heat your home , this is dangerous .
As you can see these are very simple , and free , ways to save energy .
If you adopted all of them you would see a significant reduction in energy use .
A reduction in energy use means smaller energy bills , and less impact on the global climate .
Little things do matter .
Good luck .
If you have any more tips be sure to leave them in the comments section .
The Russian computers that help keep the International Space Station in orbit were out of commission for the second day , a glitch that could imperil the $ 100 billion orbiting laboratory if it is not corrected .
NASA officials expressed confidence , however , that the problem could be resolved .
“ I fully expect us to be able to do this , ” said Michael T. Suffredini , the manager of the station program .
The station depends on Russian and American computer systems to maintain the attitude of the station as it orbits the earth .
The United States computer system runs the network of gyroscopes that provide stability , and the Russian system controls thrusters that correct the orientation of the station when the gyroscopes alone cannot do the job and shift position for operations like docking and avoiding debris .
The problem first emerged on Tuesday as astronauts were connecting a new 17.2 - ton truss to the station .
The three navigation computers in the Russian section crashed and could not be rebooted .
Thruster control was passed to the shuttle Atlantis , which has enough fuel to provide the attitude adjustment service for several days .
Congressman : Bush administration takes its cues from Lenin Michael Roston
Published : Monday May 21 , 2007 Print This Email
This A top Congressional Democrat who is working to close the detention facility set up for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay told RAW STORY that he feels like he is fighting against ' Leninist ' propaganda from the White House .
" This administration , I 've never seen an organization that learned the lessons of Lenin as clearly as these guys , " said Rep. Jim Moran ( D - VA ) in a Thursday interview .
" These guys must tack up Lenin 's philosophy on their bedstand every night .
Particularly when Lenin suggested if you say something often enough , with enough conviction , everybody will believe it . "
Moran was referring to the tactics being used by the Bush administration to fight moves in Congress to close Guantanamo Bay .
The Congressman , who has served his Virginia district since 1991 , sits on the Defense Appropriations subcommittee , which decides the Pentagon 's annual budgets .
Moran has been tasked by the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) , with devising a plan to shutter Guantanamo Bay .
The congressman spoke to RAW STORY in the Rayburn Room off the floor of the House of Representatives .
He had just successfully advanced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization bill that would require Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to report on how every detainee at Guantanamo Bay could be transferred away from the controversial base .
Passing on a close 220-208 vote , the amendment could be an early indicator of the difficulties that may be faced in the broader effort to close the base for good .
" I think it 's going to be difficult , " Moran acknowledged of his efforts .
" What the Republicans ' tack is going to be is that these are all terrorists , and do you want them all to be released to your backyard ? "
Still , Moran belittled politicians who are trying to use Guantanamo for political purposes .
He took aim at former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , who said in a Republican debate last Thursday that he favored doubling the size of the prison .
" Who 's he going to double it with ? " he asked .
" We 've got about 30,000 prisoners in our American prisons in Iraq , and another 30,000 in Iraqi prisons .
Does he want to take those 60,000 and dump them in Guantanamo , too ?
Is that what would make him happy ? "
The Congressman also slammed President George W. Bush and other administration leaders for saying they wanted to but could not close Guantanamo Bay .
" The President and the Secretary of State , after having acknowledged that it 's wrong , that it should be shut down , have shown that they do n't have the courage or the wherewithal to do the right thing , " he argued .
" I think that makes it worse .
It 's like labeling Darfur a genocide and then not doing anything about it . "
Finally , the Congressman emphasized that US civilian courts were capable of trying accused terrorists who were called ' the worst of the worst . '
As an example of how civilian trials could help the US in the war on terrorism , he pointed to the prosecution of so - called ' 20th 9/11 hijacker ' Zacarias Moussaoui in Alexandria , Virginia , part of his district .
" When some of the families of the victims of 9/11 said he was not directly involved in the deaths of our loved ones , and so we do n't think he should actually be given the death penalty , Moussaoui fell silent .
And I 'm told by his defense lawyer that he sits in his cell with his head between his legs because he does n't know what to believe now , " the congressman explained .
" Going through that trial proved that the US does have principles , values , ideals , that there is a rule of law that applies .
It 's everything he was told was not the case .
We have disproved that propaganda by putting him through a trial . "
A transcript of the interview with Rep. Moran is presented below .
Note : RAW STORY regrets that two very brief portions of its recording of the interview with Moran were inaudible due to sudden changes in background noise in the room where the interview took place .
# RAW STORY : The Pentagon is now trying to say that unlike the Seton Hall study that says a lot of these people are n't that bad are n't true , that these people really are the worst of the worst .
Do you buy it ?
Rep. Jim Moran :
Of course not .
It seems to me that after four and a half years , this administration should have lost its credibility to anybody that 's been paying attention to what they say .
But the 772 people that have been sent to Guantanamo , only four have been charged with crimes .
Now they 've released half of them .
If they thought these were the worst of the worst , the killers , the shooters , would they really have released them ?
86 % of them were picked up by Pakistani or Afghan Northern Alliance forces , and returned for bounties .
So , according to our data , only about 5 % were actually picked up by US forces , and the majority are not even alleged to have been involved in any hostile acts against the United States .
This is a black legal hole , there are people in the administration that are embarrassed about it , and that 's why they 're trying to divide our attention .
One of the things they 've done to divert our attention is send 15 guys , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed down there , but they do n't characterize the people we 've been confining in Guantanamo Bay , these are people that were in secret prisons , and they just got there .
We 're talking about the 772 that were sent there under very dubious circumstances .
This is something that all of America should be embarrassed at , and the rest of the world is disgusted .
RAW STORY : The President and the new Secretary of Defense have said that they really want to close Guantanamo .
Do you think this is sincere , or just a political stunt ?
Rep. Moran :
Well , they 're saying ' I want to do the right thing , but , you know , I just really can't , sorry . '
They 've at least acknowledged what the right thing to do is .
And , Secretary Gates just came on board , so I do n't blame him .
But the President and the Secretary of State , after having acknowledged that it 's wrong , that it should be shut down , have shown that they do n't have the courage or the wherewithal to do the right thing .
I think that makes it worse .
It 's like labeling Darfur a genocide and then not doing anything about it .
RAW STORY : Tuesday night , Romney said that he wants to double the size of Guantanamo .
What 's your reaction to that idea .
Rep. Moran : I do n't know where this guy came from .
I used to watch him when he was Governor of Massachusetts , and what he said and did in order to get elected .
And now I guess he 's going to say and do what he needs to do to get chosen by the right wing nuts of the Republican Party .
So I guess he figures , ' If I 'm as extreme or right wing nut as the people I 'm talking to , then it 's to my benefit . '
This guy , I 'd really rather deal with somebody like a Ron Paul who sticks to his convictions than somebody who is going to say to whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear .
I can't believe that Romney is so out of it that he really believes what he 's been saying lately .
Who 's he going to double it with ?
Mostly they 're people from the Afghan war .
We 've got about 30,000 prisoners in our American prisons in Iraq , and another 30,000 in Iraqi prisons .
Does he want to take those 60,000 and dump them in Guantanamo , too ?
Is that what would make him happy ?
I ought to mention , most of those tens of thousands of prisoners in Iraq , they 're actually shooting up American troops .
Only 5 % of the people at Guantanamo have been actually shooting at American troops .
If we were looking for our own security , I think we'd have to look at some of these people who are suggesting we do things that are so un-American as to be a real threat to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution .
RAW STORY : But Romney is sort of speaking to a particular audience who want to hear that message .
Do you think the Democrats can afford to close Guantanamo ?
Rep. Moran : Yeah , these people watch Fox News , and read the Washington Times and the Weekly Standard and the National Review .
And , everybody 's got a right to insulate themselves in right wing dogma , that 's part of the beauty of the United States .
And that 's the group that he 's apparently trying to appeal to .
I find it very unappealing .
RAW STORY :
Do you think that fear that they 're trying to spread is going to make it difficult for a lot of your colleagues in the Democratic caucus to get behind this push that you and Congressman Murtha are making ?
Rep. Moran : Some of them .
Some of them are concerned because some of them are in districts that are conservative and do n't have very good newspapers , and apparently do n't expose themselves to a lot of balanced information .
So I do n't blame them .
People have some responsibility to represent their constituency .
So I think it 's going to be difficult .
What the Republicans tack is going to be is that these are all terrorists , and do you want them all to be released to your backyard ?
And the last thing they want is for people to realize that only 1 % of them were captured by American forces .
The majority are not even alleged to be involved in any violent act , and only four of them have actually been charged with a crime .
We 're going to have to deal with propaganda .
This administration , I 've never seen an organization that learned the lessons of Lenin as clearly as these guys .
These guys must tack up Lenin 's philosophy on their bedstand every night .
Particularly when Lenin suggested if you say something often enough , with enough conviction , everybody will believe it .
So far , well , it worked for the first four or five years , it was really the Rove strategy .
But I think people are people are beginning to question it .
And that 's the benefit of a free press .
RAW STORY : Your neighbor Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) has proposed a bill that would basically make it so you can't put detainees in from the war on terrorism in certain places , sort of the ' not in my backyard ' approach to dealing with Guantanamo ...
Rep. Moran :
The only place is basically is the black hole in Guantanamo where there 's no legal rights that apply .
Well , there have been governments that I think Eric would have been much more comfortable with .
But we live under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
You know , when I listen to Eric talk , it 's clear that he would have voted against that Bill of Rights if he had that opportunity .
It 's a good thing he was n't serving the Congress 200 years ago , or we would n't have as free a nation as we have today .
RAW STORY :
Are you concerned with the two additional detainees that have been added to Guantanamo in the past year ?
Rep. Moran :
They 're there for strategic purposes , so they can make the American people think that they 're typical of the people who are at Guantanamo .
They 're not typical , the last fifteen are not typical of the people that have been languishing at Guantanamo , so that 's a whole different situation .
RAW STORY :
But do you think we should be bringing more people into Guantanamo even if they 're the worst of the worst who were picked up on the battlefield ?
Rep. Moran :
Well , if they 're the worst of the worst , it seems to me that you can prosecute them , and punish them .
You can't prosecute more than one at a time .
If you were just going to go after people that you can drum up any kind of actual charge against , it would still take a lifetime to prosecute , because there 's only one court at Guantanamo .
[ Inaudible ]
The only prosecution you might get at Guantanamo is not going to be accepted by the rest of the world because it has all the appearances of a monkey trial .
So if you 've got the worst of the worst , it seems like you should try them , so you can punish them .
You know , in Alexandria , Virginia , where I was mayor and I represent , we had the guy that was alleged to be the 20th hijacker , Zacarias Moussaoui was his name .
And he spouted all this kind of propaganda against the United States .
For months , he went on and on and he said the worst stuff about the U.S. [ Inaudible ]
Finally , he went through the trial and he'd sit there , and over time , though , as people came through and he saw the way the system of justice works , he started to quiet down .
And when some of the families of the victims of 9/11 said he was not directly involved in the deaths of our loved ones , and so we do n't think he should actually be given the death penalty , Moussaoui fell silent .
And I 'm told by his defense lawyer that he sits in his cell with his head between his legs because he does n't know what to believe now .
Going through that trial proved that the US does have principles , values , ideals , that there is a rule of law that applies .
It 's everything he was told was not the case .
We have disproved that propaganda by putting him through a trial .
It seems to me it might make some sense to take the worst of the worst , put them in a prison cell , let them sit in a court room , bring them down to the level of a common criminal , which they are , and try them .
That 's a lot better than putting them in a situation where they 're going to be perceived as some kind of martyrs .
RAW STORY :
So you think an arrangement kind of like we 're seeing now with people who are tried in the civilian courts can be applied to people at Guantanamo ?
Rep. Moran : Oh , of course .
If you have no information with which to charge them , than how do we know they are who we say they are .
I think we have sufficient information that these guys should be tried .
And until you try them , you really can't punish them .
I mean , you can torture them indefinitely , but then the more you torture them , the less credible is the information they reveal .
We found that out when we went on any number of wild goose chases by people like Ibn Al - Libbi and so on who just told us things they knew we wanted to hear , and we acted on them when they were n't true .
And then later , he recanted it , saying that '
I said there was a terrorist training camp in Iraq just because I knew that 's what you wanted to hear , and the Egyptians went and tortured me until I told them what the Americans wanted to hear . '
And we acted on information that we should have known was false .
And in this case , I think the people that we feel are real bad and have in fact been directly involved in shooting at , let alone killing Americans , then they should be prosecuted , and as far as I 'm concerned , they should be executed .
But we should do it under the rule of law so it 's a credible process and so we do n't continue to undermine our reputation and credibility throughout the world .
You can't win the war on global terrorism through a military victory .
This is a battle of ideas , and as long as Guantanamo stays open , the idea that we are going to operate outside the law , the idea that we 're going to ignore the Bill of Rights gives credence to the propagandists who argue that we are not the nation that we used to be , that we are a nation that people have a right to attack and to plot against .
It 's just not true .
The problem is some people in the administration are playing into the hands of the propagandists , not deliberately , but because they do n't think about the reputation of what America is and what it stands for and how that 's going to play out against extremists .

HP , Palo Alto , California , says it will support Debian Linux on its ProLiant and HP BladeSystem servers , and what it says is the industry 's first Debian Linux customizable thin client from a major vendor , the new HP t5725 Thin Client server .
HP is supporting Debian because it has been shipping Debian Linux servers to customers in the fields of telecommunications and high - performance technical computing , said Jeffrey Wade , open source and Linux marketing manager at HP 's offices in Houston .
HP 's involvement with the Debian dates back to 1995 , he said .
Support will be provided directly from HP rather than through a third party service provider as part of the warranty coverage for its Debian Linux servers , better support than customers can expect from other original equipment manufacturers , ( OEMs ) said Wade .
If you look for Debian Linux support on the Web sites of other OEMs , " you might see a link to some discussion groups or a download of a research paper on Debian , " he said .
" But HP takes real phone calls from real customers who need to get their problems solved . "
Cost Effective
Some enterprises are turning to Debian to avoid the subscription fees required of major commercial Linux distributions such as Red Hat , Novell SUSE and others , Wade said .
Debian is a free operating system that was created by a group of about 1,000 global volunteers who collaborated via the Internet on its development .
The Debian Project announced July 24 that it 's next major update , Debian GNU / Linux 4.0 , is scheduled for release in December .
Analysis
Although Debian was not widely embraced at first and users experienced interoperability problems with application software , Debian " has matured as Linux has matured , " said Gordon Haff , principal IT advisor at Illuminata Inc. , a research firm in Nashua , New Hampshire .
" This really is something new where there is a tier - one vendor essentially providing a tier - one level of support for Debian , " said Haff .
Although specific market share numbers are hard to come by for noncommercial Linux distributions , " Debian has been quite popular [ and ] the leading noncommercial distribution , " he said , although only in servers , not desktop computers .
HP 's direct support for Debian may give HP a competitive advantage , Haff said , but there are third - party service providers who can support Debian Linux servers from Dell , IBM , or other PC makers .
IBM , of Armonk , N.Y. , said it takes care of its Debian Linux customers .
" IBM works well with Debian in the Linux community and will , and does , support the Debian distribution for our customers , " the company said in a prepared statement .
" It 's not a standard offering , but we do it under special bid . "
HP also announced that unit sales of 1.5 million Linux servers generated revenue of close to $ 6.2 billion for the 12 months ending in May , 50 percent more revenue than its nearest competitor .
The LinuxWorld conference in San Francisco runs through August 17 .

Tadpoles use a proton pump to direct tissue regrowth .
Tadpoles : chop off their tails and they grow back .
NHPA
Tadpoles can achieve something that humans may only dream of : pull off a tadpole 's thick tail or a tiny developing leg , and it'll grow right back — spinal cord , muscles , blood vessels and all .
Now researchers have discovered the key regulator of the electrical signal that convinces Xenopus pollywogs to regenerate amputated tails .
The results , reported this week in Development , give some researchers hope for new approaches to stimulating tissue regeneration in humans1 .
Researchers have known for decades that an electrical current is created at the site of regenerating limbs .
Furthermore , applying an external current speeds up the regeneration process , and drugs that block the current prevent regeneration .
The electrical signals help to tell cells what type to grow into , how fast to grow , and where to position themselves in the new limb .
To investigate , Michael Levin and his colleagues at the Forsyth Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology in Boston , Massachusetts , sorted through libraries of drug compounds to find ones that prevent tail regeneration but do not interfere with wound healing .
One such drug , they found , blocks a molecular pump that transports protons across cell membranes ; this kind of proton flow creates a current .
Levin speculates that the current generated by this proton pump produces a long - range electric field that helps to direct what happens to nerve cells pouring into the site .
" We can use this hydrogen pumping as a top - level master control to initiate the regeneration response , " says Levin .
" We did n't have to specifically say , ' put a little muscle over here , a little muscle over there ' . "
The proton pump could also be used to turn on limb regeneration in older tadpoles that would normally have lost this ability .
When Levin and his colleagues activated the proton pump during this older phase , tadpoles were more than four times more likely to regrow a perfectly formed tail than their normal counterparts .
Chop and change
“ Many children under the age of seven have regrown amputated fingertips . ”
The notion of regenerating complex organs from adult cells has n't always been popular , says David Stocum , director of the Indiana University Center for Regenerative Biology and Medicine in Indianapolis .
" People used to pooh - pooh the idea , " says Stocum , " but now there 's renewed interest in it . "
That interest has been primarily focused on the regenerative power of stem cells .
But there is also some interest in direct regeneration from adult cells at the wound site .
At first glance , dramatic limb and tail regenerations seem to be restricted to ' simpler ' creatures , such as the humble planaria flatworm — chop it up into a hundred pieces and you 'll soon have a hundred little worms on your hands — and salamanders , which can grow back limbs , tails , jaws , intestines and some parts of their eyes and hearts .
But there are impressive examples of tissue regeneration in mammals as well .
Male deer can grow the bone , skin , nerves and blood vessels of their antlers at a millimetre a day .
Humans can regenerate livers , and many children under the age of seven have regrown amputated fingertips .
And then there are the odd medical journal case studies of patients who have lost , say , a kidney , only to find years later that they 've sprouted a new one .
Simple switch
Changes in electrical current have been measured in regenerating fingertips , just as in a tadpole 's regenerating tail .
But converting humans into fully functioning regenerators will probably take more than directing bioelectrical signals .
The formation of scar tissue , for example , could inhibit regeneration in some cases , says David Gardiner , a biologist at the University of California , Irvine .
ADVERTISEMENT
But the complex networks needed to construct a complicated organ or appendage are already genetically encoded in all of our cells — we needed them to develop those organs in the first place .
" The question is : how do you turn them back on ? " Levin says .
" When you know the language that these cells use to tell each other what to do , you 're a short step away from getting them to do that after an injury . "
The simplicity of the regeneration start signal is promising , says Stocum : it is just possible that a properly tuned electric signal is all humans need to jumpstart tissue regeneration .

Everyone had a reaction to the horrific events of the Virginia Tech shootings .
Some of those reactions were rational .
Others were not .
A high school student was suspended for customizing a first - person shooter game with a map of his school .
A contractor was fired from his government job for talking about a gun , and then visited by the FBI when he created a comic about the incident .
A dean at Yale banned realistic stage weapons from the university theaters – a policy that was reversed within a day .
And some teachers terrorized a sixth - grade class by staging a fake gunman attack , without telling them that it was a drill .
These things all happened , even though shootings like this are incredibly rare ; even though – for all the press – less than one percent ( .pdf ) of homicides and suicides of children ages 5 to 19 occur in schools .
In fact , these overreactions occurred , not despite these facts , but because of them .
The Virginia Tech massacre is precisely the sort of event we humans tend to overreact to .
Our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis , especially when it comes to rare occurrences .
We tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange and rare events , and downplay ordinary , familiar and common ones .
There 's a lot of research in the psychological community about how the brain responds to risk – some of it I have already written about – but the gist is this :
Our brains are much better at processing the simple risks we 've had to deal with throughout most of our species ' existence , and much poorer at evaluating the complex risks society forces us face today .
Novelty plus dread equals overreaction .
We can see the effects of this all the time .
We fear being murdered , kidnapped , raped and assaulted by strangers , when it 's far more likely that the perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend .
We worry about airplane crashes and rampaging shooters instead of automobile crashes and domestic violence – both far more common .
In the United States , dogs , snakes , bees and pigs each kill more people per year ( . pdf ) than sharks .
In fact , dogs kill more humans than any animal except for other humans .
Sharks are more dangerous than dogs , yes , but we 're far more likely to encounter dogs than sharks .
Our greatest recent overreaction to a rare event was our response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
I remember then - Attorney General John Ashcroft giving a speech in Minnesota – where I live – in 2003 , and claiming that the fact there were no new terrorist attacks since 9/11 was proof that his policies were working .
I thought : " There were no terrorist attacks in the two years preceding 9/11 , and you did n't have any policies .
What does that prove ? "
What it proves is that terrorist attacks are very rare , and maybe our reaction was n't worth the enormous expense , loss of liberty , attacks on our Constitution and damage to our credibility on the world stage .
Still , overreacting was the natural thing for us to do .
Yes , it 's security theater , but it makes us feel safer .
People tend to base risk analysis more on personal story than on data , despite the old joke that " the plural of anecdote is not data . "
If a friend gets mugged in a foreign country , that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel traveling to that country than abstract crime statistics .
We generally give stories more weight than statistics .
We give storytellers we have a relationship with more credibility than strangers , and stories that are close to us more weight than stories from foreign lands .
In other words , proximity of relationship affects our risk assessment .
And who is everyone 's major storyteller these days ?
Television .
( Nassim Nicholas Taleb 's great book , The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable , discusses this . )
Consider the reaction to another event from last month : professional baseball player Josh Hancock got drunk and died in a car crash .
As a result , several baseball teams are banning alcohol in their clubhouses after games .
Aside from this being a ridiculous reaction to an incredibly rare event ( 2,430 baseball games per season , 35 people per clubhouse , two clubhouses per game .
And how often has this happened ? ) , it makes no sense as a solution .
Hancock did n't get drunk in the clubhouse ; he got drunk at a bar .
But Major League Baseball needs to be seen as doing something , even if that something does n't make sense – even if that something actually increases risk by forcing players to drink at bars instead of at the clubhouse , where there 's more control over the practice .
I tell people that if it's in the news , do n't worry about it .
The very definition of " news " is " something that hardly ever happens . "
It 's when something is n't in the news , when it 's so common that it 's no longer news – car crashes , domestic violence – that you should start worrying .
But that 's not the way we think .
Psychologist Scott Plous said it well in The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making : " In very general terms : ( 1 ) The more available an event is , the more frequent or probable it will seem ; ( 2 ) the more vivid a piece of information is , the more easily recalled and convincing it will be ; and ( 3 ) the more salient something is , the more likely it will be to appear causal . "
So , when faced with a very available and highly vivid event like 9/11 or the Virginia Tech shootings , we overreact .
And when faced with all the salient related events , we assume causality .
We pass the Patriot Act .
We think if we give guns out to students , or maybe make it harder for students to get guns , we 'll have solved the problem .
We do n't let our children go to playgrounds unsupervised .
We stay out of the ocean because we read about a shark attack somewhere .
It 's our brains again .
We need to " do something , " even if that something does n't make sense ; even if it is ineffective .
And we need to do something directly related to the details of the actual event .
So instead of implementing effective , but more general , security measures to reduce the risk of terrorism , we ban box cutters on airplanes .
And we look back on the Virginia Tech massacre with 20 - 20 hindsight and recriminate ourselves about the things we should have done .
In fact , the incident has been used as evidence both for and against gun control .
Lastly , our brains need to find someone or something to blame .
( Jon Stewart has an excellent bit on the Virginia Tech scapegoat search , and media coverage in general . )
But sometimes there is no scapegoat to be found ; sometimes we did everything right , but just got unlucky .
We simply can't prevent a lone nutcase from shooting people at random ; there 's no security measure that would work .
As circular as it sounds , rare events are rare primarily because they do n't occur very often , and not because of any preventive security measures .
And implementing security measures to make these rare events even rarer is like the joke about the guy who stomps around his house to keep the elephants away .
" Elephants ?
There are no elephants in this neighborhood , " says a neighbor .
" See how well it works ! "
If you want to do something that makes security sense , figure out what 's common among a bunch of rare events , and concentrate your countermeasures there .
Focus on the general risk of terrorism , and not the specific threat of airplane bombings using liquid explosives .
Focus on the general risk of troubled young adults , and not the specific threat of a lone gunman wandering around a college campus .
Ignore the movie - plot threats , and concentrate on the real risks .

U.S. Border Patrol agents seeking to secure the nation ’s border in some of the country ’s most pristine national forests are being targeted by illegal aliens , who are using intentionally set fires to burn agents out of observation posts and patrol routes .
The wildfires also have resulted in the destruction of valuable natural and cultural resources in the National Forest System and pose an ongoing threat to visitors , residents and responding firefighters , according to federal law enforcement authorities and others .
In the Coronado National Forest in Arizona , with 60 miles of land along the U.S. - Mexico border , U.S. Forest Service firefighters sent in to battle fires or clear wild land fire areas are required to be escorted by armed law enforcement officers .
Armed smugglers of aliens and drugs have walked through the middle of active firefighting operations , the authorities said .
The Border Patrol ’s Tucson , Ariz. , sector , which encompasses most of the Coronado National Forest , has the highest incidence of cross - border violators in the nation .
Nearly 500,000 illegal aliens were apprehended last year — more than 30,000 a month .
In addition , nearly 100,000 pounds of marijuana , with a street value of $ 200 million , was seized as it was hauled through the Coronado National Forest .
Last month , the Border Patrol — in a single operation targeting illegal aliens causing what Forest Service officials called “ significant damage ” to the Coronado National Forest — apprehended more than 300 illegals along just a three - mile section of Arizona - Mexico border and confiscated 600 pounds of marijuana in a 10 - day period .
At least five fires were set below a Border Patrol observation post during the operation in an effort to burn the agents out , according to a Forest Service report .
The fires were extinguished , and no one was arrested .
Wildfires are being set by alien and drug smugglers , authorities said , to create a diversion in an attempt to gain undetected access across the border .
The fires correspond to a dramatic rise in assaults against Border Patrol agents — up more than 100 percent over last year .
“ Criminal activity by both illegal immigrants and citizens in forests near the border is a threat to members of the public trying to use their public lands and to our employees trying to manage these lands , ” Tina J. Terrell , a Forest Service supervisor told a House subcommittee in May .
She said law enforcement personnel have been assaulted , threatened with weapons and shot at , and their vehicles have been rammed by cross - border violators .
Because of the remoteness of the area , she said , timely assistance from other law enforcement agencies is not always possible and communications limitations and active interference with radio frequencies in Mexico create additional safety risks .
“ Even normal enforcement duties bring our officers in regular contact with cross - border violators , ” she said .
“ Our officers risk their lives every day to enforce the law in these remote federally managed lands . ”
The Coronado National Forest is not the only area along the Arizona - Mexico border being targeted for wildfires .
Other blazes also have been set , including two this month near the San Luis , Ariz . , port of entry as the result of Molotov cocktails — one of which barely missed a Border Patrol agent .
Authorities said agents are being targeted by illegal aliens and their smugglers for rock attacks — including grapefruit - size rocks wrapped in rags , dipped in gasoline and set on fire .
“ As larger areas of the border come under operational control , we can expect violence to increase as smuggling operations can no longer operate with impunity and do not have unfettered access to the border for their criminal activities , ” Border Patrol Chief David V. Aguilar told a Homeland Security subcommittee this year .
“ This explosion of aggression is an indicator how desperate and angry drug and human traffickers are at the increasing disruption of their smuggling routes , ” he said .

Fifteen years ago , the video - game industry was ruled by one player , Nintendo .
The company had machines in a third of American homes , and it was Japan ’s most profitable electronics company .
The title of a 1993 book summed up the situation : “ Game Over : How Nintendo Conquered the World . ”
Then the Sony PlayStation arrived , and everything changed .
Today , Sony is the dominant force , and its chief rival is not Nintendo but Microsoft , which makes the Xbox .
Two weeks ago , the début of Sony ’s PlayStation 3 was greeted by crowds of hysterical consumers anxious to get their hands on the new console , billed as the most powerful gaming machine ever .
When Nintendo ’s new console , the oddly named Wii , appeared , a few days later , there were excellent reviews and expectations of good sales , but no more talk about world conquest .
If Sony and Microsoft are the major - party nominees , Nintendo is more like a cool third - party candidate .
You might expect , then , that Nintendo would be struggling to stay afloat .
After all , the prevailing wisdom is that companies need to be market leaders , or face disaster .
This approach was famously institutionalized by Jack Welch , who , when he took over as C.E.O. of G.E. , laid down a rule that he described as a “ central idea ” of his tenure : the company would quit any business in which it was not No. 1 or No. 2 . The lesson that people took away from this was clear — third place is for losers .
“ First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado , ” Alec Baldwin ’s character says in the film “ Glengarry Glen Ross . ”
“ Second prize is a set of steak knives .
Third prize is you ’re fired . ”
Nintendo , though , has not just survived out of the spotlight ; it has thrived .
It has five billion dollars in the bank from years of solid profits , and this past year , though it spent heavily on the launch of the Wii , it made close to a billion dollars in profit and saw its stock price rise by sixty - five per cent .
Sony ’s game division , by contrast , barely eked out a profit and Microsoft ’s reportedly lost money .
Who knew bringing up the rear could be so lucrative ?
Sony and Microsoft are desperate to be the biggest players in a market that , in their vision , will encompass not just video games but “ interactive entertainment ” generally .
That ’s why the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 are all - in - one machines , which allow users not just to play video games but also to do things like watch high - definition DVDs and stream digital music .
Sony and Microsoft ’s quest to “ control the living room ” has locked them in a classic arms race ; they have invested billions of dollars in an attempt to surpass each other technologically , building ever - bigger , ever - better , and ever - more - expensive machines .
Nintendo has dropped out of this race .
The Wii has few bells and whistles and much less processing power than its “ competitors , ” and it features less impressive graphics .
It ’s really well suited for just one thing : playing games .
But this turns out to be an asset .
The Wii ’s simplicity means that Nintendo can make money selling consoles , while Sony is reportedly losing more than two hundred and forty dollars on each PlayStation 3 it sells — even though they are selling for almost six hundred dollars .
Similarly , because Nintendo is not trying to rule the entire industry , it ’s been able to focus on its core competence , which is making entertaining , innovative games .
For instance , the Wii features a motion sensor that allows you to , say , hit a tennis ball onscreen by swinging the controller like a tennis racquet .
Nintendo ’s handheld device , the DS , became astoundingly popular because of simple but brilliant games like Nintendogs , in which users raise virtual puppies .
And because Nintendo sells many more of its own games than Sony and Microsoft do , its profit margins are higher , too .
Arguably , Nintendo has thrived not despite its fall from the top but because of it .
Nintendo ’s success is not an anomaly , either .
The business landscape of the past couple of decades is replete with companies that have flourished as third wheels , and with companies that have struggled to make money despite being No. 1 in their industries .
( Today , would you rather be Honda or G.M. ? )
And while it ’s true that in many industries there is a correlation between market share and profitability , one does n’t necessarily lead to the other .
A recent survey of the evidence on market share by J. Scott Armstrong and Kesten C. Green found that companies that adopt what they call “ competitor - oriented objectives ” actually end up hurting their own profitability .
In other words , the more a company focusses on beating its competitors , rather than on the bottom line , the worse it is likely to do .
And a study of the performance of twenty major American companies over four decades found that the ones putting more emphasis on market share than on profit ended up with lower returns on investment ; of the six companies that defined their goal exclusively as market share , four eventually went out of business .
The point is that business is not a sporting event .
Victory for one company does n’t mean defeat for everyone else .
Markets today are so big — the global video - game market is now close to thirty billion dollars — that companies can profit even when they ’re not on top , as long as they are n’t desperately trying to get there .
The key is to play to your strengths while recognizing your limitations .
Nintendo knew that it could not compete with Microsoft and Sony in the quest to build the ultimate home - entertainment device .
So it decided , with the Wii , to play a different game entirely .
Some pundits are now speculating , ironically , that the simplicity of the Wii may make it a huge hit .
Nintendo would n’t complain if that happened .
But , in the meantime , third prize is looking a lot better than steak knives .
His story of how he survived Vietnamese " stress positions " .
Yes , he calls them torture .

After more than 11 days without nodding off , Tony Wright crawled into bed yesterday in the happy belief that he had broken the world sleeplessness record by two hours .
But the poor chap is in for a rude awakening .
His 266 - hour feat of endurance will not feature in Guinness World Records because it has stopped acknowledging such attempts for health reasons .
And to make matters worse , someone has already beaten Mr Wright himself by a full ten hours .
Scroll down for more ...
The 43 - year - old gardener finally closed his eyes yesterday for the first time since May 14 .
Monitored by a webcam and CCTV cameras at his local bar in Penzance , Cornwall , he sustained himself with a " Stone Age " diet of raw fruit and vegetables .
He drank tea and , to pass the time , played pool .
Mr Wright believed he was battling to beat a record of 264 hours set by American Randy Gardner in 1964 , as part of a high school science project into sleep patterns .
Since then , Guinness has refused to endorse sleeplessness marathons because scientists say they can result in depression , dizziness , hallucinations , irritability , nausea and loss of memory .
But before the ban was enforced , there was time for Toimi Soini , of Hamina , Finland , to set a new best of 276 hours recorded in the Guinness Book of Records from 1965 until 1990 .
As father - of - three Mr Wright slumbered yesterday , a friend said : " We have never heard of this .
We have not come across it and as far as we knew the only record was the one set by Randy Gardner .
" It is interesting but has not cropped up at all in our research and is not mentioned in any of the books about sleep and sleeplessness . "
Mr Wright prepared for his insomniac bout by taking part in a sleeplessness trial at Manchester Metropolitan University in 1998 , when he stayed awake for five days .
He says the results of that study showed his physical performance , strength , stamina and balance improved or stayed the same .
And before hitting the sack yesterday , he added : " I did this record to show that the accepted theory is wrong and the brain does not become less effective with tiredness .
" I believe there are different sleep requirements for the two different sides of the brain and as the left side becomes fatigued it loses its ability to stay in charge . "
Scroll down for more ...
He said the " Stone Age " diet of raw food helped parts of his brain to stay awake and remain functional for long periods .
" It makes it much easier to switch from one side of the brain which is really tired , to the other .
But both are pretty tired at the moment . "
On the effects of sleep deprivation , he admitted : " I do feel very strange .
" Everything around me has become more intense and after a while colours seem brighter .
" My eyes have become very sensitive .
I had to start wearing sunglasses after 70 hours because looking at a laptop was sending me into a trance . "
He added : " There were a couple of tricky moments where I could feel my body wanting to shut down and I had to act quickly to stimulate it .
" Suddenly I would realise I was relaxing and the urge to sleep was dragging me down - I had to jump up , eat or drink something and occupy myself .
" It was tricky striking a balance between being active but not wearing myself out .
My voice is very hoarse and I 'm sure I look a right state . "
He added : " I might not make it into Guinness but I have set a world record and it is there to be beaten by anyone who wants to try .
This is my life project and I 'm very happy to prove you can stay awake for long periods of time without suffering adverse reactions .
" I feel pretty good .
It 's been a bit of a slog , but I got there .
I am now looking forward to getting under a duvet . "
Guinness World Records said its staying awake category had not been recognised for several years after consultation with the British Association for Counselling and Psycho therapy .
Researchers were informed that attempts to break the record could pose serious risks , both physically and psychologically .
They were also concerned that victims of chronic insomnia could have stayed awake for far longer than anyone claiming to have broken any records .
" We do have records for other feats such as sword swallowing which may appear to be dangerous but they are carried out by professional stunt men under carefully - controlled conditions designed to ensure nobody is put at risk .
" People who attempt records should make sure their research is accurate or they may be very disappointed . "
Every time my history teacher called me " Haystacks " I would blush while trying to flatten my barnet with my palms .
Even today , although people no longer call me names , I notice them trying not to stare at my frizzy bonce .
Recently , I decided to take extreme action , inspired by the two people whose gleaming locks I admire the most .
One is my former boss who has n't washed her hair in 10 years , and the other lives in rural Tanzania and can only wash her hair once a week .
Having braced myself for full - on hair grease - out , I was surprised to find that the first few days passed with no hiccups .
I brushed my hair each night to draw the natural oils away from the roots , and was pleased to see a smoother , sleeker me in the mirror .
I did n't have to make time in my schedule to wash it either , which was a bonus .
By day five , though , my hair was oily , I had dandruff , and a job interview presented a hurdle .
Would my potential boss notice and think me too grubby for the position ?
I survived the occasion with tons of Kirby grips and a distractingly bright orange top .
Thankfully , the dandruff was short - lived but , despite this , I felt increasingly low .
Day seven was the darkest of all .
A dinner in formal attire did n't seem to go with what was now obviously lank hair , so I buckled and applied organic conditioner in an attempt to reduce the lard level .
It felt odd adding grease to grease ( my ex-boss with the glossy mane assures me weekly conditioner is key ) , but my hair looked passable after a blow dry , and I was rewarded with my first hair compliment - ever .
" Very chic , " my friend Neil said .
" A bit like Betty Boo . "
A month has now passed , and I am a dirty - hair convert .
Yes , there have been days such as yesterday when my scalp was itchy and my hair had a slightly fusty smell up really close , but it feels healthier , more controllable and , best of all , looks nothing like a haystack .
The United States is among the least peaceful nations in the world , ranking 96th between Yemen and Iran , according to an index of 121 countries .
According to the Global Peace Index , created by the Economist Intelligence Unit , Norway is the most peaceful nation and Iraq is the least , just after Russia , Israel and Sudan .
The index was compiled based on 24 indicators .
They included the number of wars in which a country was involved , arms sales , violent crimes and relations with neighboring countries .
Fifteen of the top 20 most peaceful nations are in Western Europe , and higher income appeared to lead to higher levels of peace .
Another unmanned vessel has been discovered floating off the coast of Queensland .
The six - metre barnacle - encrusted fibreglass boat , which was yesterday spotted in waters off the Sunshine Coast , is the second mystery vessel to be found in Queensland waters in less than a week .
Fisherman spotted the second boat about 30 km off the coast of Caloundra .

Lisp is great for calculations and analyses of text .
Give these simple applications a try :
Example 1 :
(+ 1 2 ) -> 3 (* 17 ( / 4.0 2 ) ) -> 34.0
Example 2 :
( setq mystring " the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog " ) ( count #\e mystring ) -> 4 ( count # \o mystring ) -> 5 ( count - if ' alphanumericp mystring ) -> 36 ( length mystring ) -> 44
The Dynamic Learning Center and the Franz Examples Section contain a variety of Lisp programming exercises and examples that can be experimented with as well .

This special investigation reveals the deadly epidemic of liver disease among middle - class social tipplers - and why the Government is cynically ignoring it .
Louise is young , yellow and dying .
She shuffles along the ward in Derby City Hospital with a nurse at one arm keeping her steady .
Scroll down for more
The raging jaundice that brought her into hospital ten days earlier is subsiding , leaving her skin the colour of a fading tan .
Louise is tiny but her stomach is terribly swollen with fluid , also a common symptom of alcoholic liver disease .
She 's 28 and the doctors have warned her she 'll be dead in two years if she does n't stop drinking .
" Our youngest death was 22 , " says Dr Jan Freeman , the consultant on the ward .
" Numbers are increasing and the average age is coming down dramatically .
It used to be 60 , now the average age is about 40 . "
Louise is an alcoholic , but many of Dr Freeman 's patients are not .
He says an increasing number are young , middle - class professionals who have no idea of the damage they 're doing to themselves through the kind of everyday , social drinking that most think is perfectly harmless .
" They think they 're having a good time , not doing any harm , and one day wake up with conditions just like Louise . "
A little over a week ago , the Government published its latest report on reducing alcohol misuse , called Safe , Sensible And Social .
Its 100 pages of good intentions , but a five - month investigation I took part in for the Channel 4 Dispatches programme suggests that ministers may have hugely underestimated the scale of the alcohol - related health crisis facing Britain and the monumental battle they 'll have with the drinks industry to make any real changes to our drinking culture .
Liver disease is especially cruel because it builds up silently for many years .
Catch it early and the liver has an extraordinary capacity to regenerate itself .
Leave it too long and your only options may be a liver transplant or an early death .
So the Dispatches team ran a unique experiment - offering free liver tests to the public to see just how widescale the problem actually is .
We set up a mobile clinic and parked it for one day in London and one day in Birmingham .
The process was simple and straightforward .
First there was a blood test , using a special machine that can analyse just a finger - prick drop of blood and tell if the liver is in distress because of too much alcohol .
Then we ran tests using a new ultrasound machine called a Fibroscan , which is widely used in Europe .
It detects changes in the liver tissue , which becomes stiffer and scarred if you drink too much .
The results were analysed by Dr Rajiv Jalan , a liver consultant from London 's University College Hospital , who has been one of the first to evaluate the scanner here .
A reading above five on the machine is deemed abnormal and may indicate the first signs of early liver damage .
Anything over ten could indicate serious problems .
One of the first people to be tested , a young executive in her 20s called Sharon , told Dr Jalan she drinks five or six Jack Daniel 's on a Friday and Saturday nights and used to drink a lot more when she was younger .
When we tested her liver , the reading was 7.1 .
Next up was Peter , a City financier in his early 30s .
His reading was 13.9 .
" I drink only the same as all my mates , " he said , staring at the print - out of his results .
In London , the demand for free tests was almost overwhelming .
Midway through the day , when we were already fully booked and turning people away , a very elegant woman arrived looking extremely anxious .
" Please , I know you 're busy but I 'd really like this test .
I 'll wait as I long as I have to . "
She was a 40 - year - old highflying executive and was so agitated , that we fitted her in .
Her results were sky - high , suggesting she may already have irreversible liver disease .
But she was n't the only one heading for trouble .
By the end of the testing , we 'd seen about 80 people and , astonishingly , just over half of them had abnormal results and several were worryingly high .
These were not the sort of people you might normally call " alcoholics " .
They did not drink whisky with their breakfast , or down a bottle of vodka alone each night .
Nor were they the mindless young bingers who pollute city centres each weekend , hell - bent on drinking themselves into oblivion just for the hell of it .
They were social drinkers - " ordinary people " .
People like Paul .
Paul is 53 , and he 's just been put on the transplant waiting list - a race against time because he 's unlikely to survive more than a couple of years without a new liver .
As a successful accountant , he sometimes entertained clients over lunch , but most of his drinking was done at home .
He and his wife enjoyed good wine .
They both work hard and they always opened a bottle in the evenings - and finished it between them .
Paul knew he was probably drinking too much , he just did n't think it would ever be a problem .
" Very rarely did either of us get steaming drunk , " says Sarah .
" Well , we did n't , " adds Paul .
" You just think it wo n't happen to you .
You sleepwalk into this . "
How many couples in Britain share Paul and Sarah 's habit and open a bottle of wine most evenings ?
Judging by the number of people who gasp or pull faces whenever I mention it - rather a lot .
It 's the biggest change in our drinking habits .
As a nation , we drink less beer and spend less time in the pub .
We 're drinking more wine and consuming it at home .
Many people we spoke to know that the Government recommends women do not regularly drink more than two or three units of alcohol a day - three or four units for a man .
But ask them how much they get through in an evening at home and most either have no idea or wildly underestimate .
That 's because they assume one glass of wine roughly equals one unit .
A guilty check in my kitchen cupboard reveals how wrong that can be .
While a small pub glass holds 125 ml , it turned out that I do n't own any wine glasses that , when full , hold less than 250ml .
So although they do n't look particularly large , they each take a third of a bottle .
Today 's New World reds , often stronger than Old World varieties , can easily contain 10.8 units in a bottle , so each 250 ml glass is 3.6 units - already over the recommended daily allowance for a woman .
One glass !
Regularly drinking two such glasses takes a woman into officially harmful levels , which risk significant health damage .
The other factor which came through really clearly from our testing was how the price of alcohol has changed the nation 's drinking habits .
Quite simply , people can afford to drink more .
Drink costs , in real terms , are half what they were in the 1970s .
And you can't miss all the special offers in the supermarkets , seemingly at end of the every aisle : two - for - one on wine , six bottles for £ 20 , two boxes of Stella Artois lager for £ 20 ( working out at 50 p a bottle despite once being advertised as " Reassuringly expensive " ) .
The alcohol industry and the retailers deny that they encourage people to drink more .
They argue that people who buy six bottles of wine are simply spreading out their drinking and get through the same amount as if they bought one bottle at a time .
However , most people we spoke to laughed at that idea .
" Not in our house ! " was the standard reply .
" If it 's there , we drink it ! "
The Government 's Safe , Sensible And Social report promises what it calls an independent national review next year to examine whether low prices , special promotions and advertising are encouraging problem drinking .
Frankly , health ministers already know the answer because last year the European Commission published a major report which included an in - depth section on the proven link between cheap prices and increased consumption .
The Government must also know that the same report triggered a massive row with the drinks industry , which immediately tried to undermine the findings and succeeded in derailing its main recommendations .
The report was written by a British doctor , Peter Anderson , an expert on public health .
He spent two years evaluating hundreds of scientific papers on how to stop people drinking too much .
He concluded : " The effective policies are those that make alcohol less easily available .
So you need to put the price up , do n't make alcohol available all the time , everywhere , and you have to limit - if not ban completely - the advertising and marketing of alcohol . "
Of course , that 's the opposite of what 's been happening in Britain , where booze is cheaper and more available than ever - not least because of the relaxation of pub hours brought in by New Labour .
Any restriction on the sale of alcohol is heresy to the alcohol industry , which claims it 's unfair to penalise the responsible majority for the sins of the drunken minority .
Of course , it tends not to mention that anything that reduces how much we all drink will cut the industry 's sales and profits .
One Eurocrat insider told us that the powers of the industry lobbying against the Anderson Report were " absolutely unprecedented " .
The fight was led by the Brewers Of Europe organisation , which includes the British Beer And Pub Association ( BBPA ) .
First they commissioned a rival report , written by a group of academics selected by the industry .
It concluded there was no need to reduce the overall consumption of alcohol .
Not content with that , the industry also insisted that the European Commission brought in another group of experts to review its original report .
The BBPA spokesman Mark Hastings sent out an e-mail predicting that the review would find the first report was " fundamentally flawed and lacking in academic rigour or credibility " .
However , the experts actually described the original report as accurate , important and impressive .
But the sheer pressure of lobbying has worked .
The European Commission stopped talking about new laws to regulate the price , availability and marketing of alcohol and , instead , the focus is on a voluntary partnership with the industry , to educate people about how to drink sensibly .
So it will be very interesting to see how the British Government 's proposed review of pricing and marketing works out next year .
Perhaps it will go the way of another recent announcement which the Health Minister , Caroline Flint , called a " landmark agreement " with the alcohol industry - to put labels on the backs of all cans and bottles , showing how many units of alcohol they contain , as well as the recommended daily limits and a health warning .
Dispatches has discovered that when the talks began 18 months ago , a whole series of tough health messages were discussed which would appear on all cans and bottles .
For instance , " Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure " ; " longterm heavy use of alcohol can cause heart failure " and " cirrhosis kills the under - 30s " .
Several of these were suggested by the British Liver Trust , which was delighted to be invited by the Health Ministry to join the consultation process .
But it was less delighted to discover the final decision was being taken by a committee consisting only of government and alcohol industry people .
Even worse , it found out that the only message being proposed was one directed at pregnant women and those trying to conceive .
The Trust 's chief executive , Alison Rogers , calls it a " watered down and limited message which does n't apply to the majority of people " .
Exactly why the other , stronger health warnings aimed at a wider audience were rejected is unclear because the Government refused our Freedom of Information request for the committee 's minutes .
But Jeremy Beadles of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association , a member of the committee , says the messages were too vague and too complicated to fit on the back of a bottle .
Really ?
Finally , we decided to organise one other liver testing clinic - in a room opposite the Houses of Parliament .
We invited about 200 MPs - mostly members of the All Party Beer Group , which supports the pub and brewing trade and is the most popular committee in Westminster - to have their livers tested .
Only three turned up .
Could it be because the alcohol industry contributes £ 30 billion a year to the economy , which gives them enormous political clout ?
To put it bluntly , health campaigners , including the medical profession have been out - resourced and out - lobbied .
Back at University College Hospital , I caught up with our programme consultant , Dr Rajiv Jalan , as he was finishing a surgical procedure to prevent what 's called a " variceal bleed " on a 38 - year - old man who was in serious trouble from liver damage which had caused the blood vessels in his throat to swell and burst .
Dr Jalan explained that the results of our tests had exceeded his worst fears .
" Liver disease in 20 and 30 - year - olds is rife and if we do n't do anything about it we are looking at an epidemic that the Health Service will find impossible to deal with . "
Hospital admissions for alcoholic liver disease have doubled in the past ten years and the results of our investigation suggest it is only going to get worse .
Still fancy a drink tonight ?
IfP ’s Boston Chapter has been exchanging emails with one of their State Reps :
Massachusetts State Representative Denise Provost : by dulles
I have been exchanging e-mails with my Massachusetts Commonwealth Representative Denise Provost ( 27th Middlesex District ) urging her to take the lead on replicating the action that 's been taken in New Mexico , Vermont , and Washington .
You can read the conversation for yourself !
It looks as though her first line of defense was the Cheney threat .
Her second seems to be her own work - load .
At any rate , it does look like she has potential to do the right thing .
Contact Denise Provost at < a href= ' mailto :[ email protected ] '>[ email protected ] < / a> and ask her to assemble a group of co-sponors for this resolution !
You can also call her at ( 617 ) 722 2810 .
Furthermore , you can e-mail your Massachusetts local representative and ask them to support impeachment !

Subject : A plea from a constituent
Date : Mon , 26 Feb 2007 18:10:56 - 0500
Representative Provost
I urge you to introduce into the Massachusetts legislature articles of impeachment against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
According to the federal House rules ( “ Jefferson ’s Manual ” ) , impeachment may be set in motion by the passage of articles of impeachment in any state ’s legislature .
Please help us join New Mexico , Washington , and Vermont .
We must hold our elected officials accountable and prove to our nation that the democracy still functions .
Let us not allow politics to shadow what is truly a constitutional crisis .

Dear Mr. Dulles - Coelho
Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your opinion regarding the introduction of legislation to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
The possibility of impeaching President Bush is an alluring and intriguing concept .
However , as a practical matter , I fear the following outcome : a successful impeachment of President Bush and his replacement by Vice President Cheney .
Would this be an improvement over the current situation ?
Instead of immediately introducing impeachment legislation that could lead to this undesirable result , I suggest that we wait to see if Vice President Cheney retains his position after the trial of Mr. Libby has run its course .
In the interim , if you have not already done so , I would encourage you to read a book that I recently read : “ The Impeachment of George W. Bush ” by former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman .
The case for impeachment of the President is indeed strong , but I believe that a President Cheney would be a frightening replacement .
Thank you again for taking the time to let me know what is important to you .
I encourage you to contact my office with any other concerns or questions that you may have , on this or any other issue .
Warm Regards ,
Denise Provost

Representative Provost ,
I thank you very deeply for taking the time to give much a well written response – many who claim to “ represent ” me have not done so .
I might suggest to you that as a practical matter , Mr. Cheney can easily be included in the articles of impeachment .
New Mexico ’s legislation includes Mr. Cheney [ 1 ] , as does Washington ’s [ 2 ] .
Unfortunately Vermont ’s resolution [ 3 ] does not .

I might suggest to you that any serious investigation would implicate both Mssrs. Bush and Cheney .
My only concern , which is distant , is that Cheney might first resign , Bush could appoint a puppet successor , and then following Bush ’s removed , that puppet could come into office .
The opportunity for that particular action is real but , I think , improbable .
Cheney is as culpable as anyone else .
I think the realistic outcome is Nancy Pelosi as president .
At any rate , any success to the office of president would be dealt an immensely difficult hand whereby they would be all but forced to make their administration ’s decisions transparent and thoughtful .
I therefore continue to urge you to consider such legislation as would restore a sense of dignity to the White House .
Will you introduce such legislation as might bring some justice to bear upon the administration that has directly and negatively impact your district ?
Yours ,

Dear Mr. Dulles - Coelho :
Thank you for writing .
The bill filing deadline was January 10 .
We can file what are aptly called “ late file bills , ” but this spring , I will be busy with the bills I already filed , the budget process , and committee hearings .
Are you familiar with the book I mentioned ?
What do you think are the strongest arguments for impeachment ?
Also , it would be helpful if you could provide me with copies of the legislation filed in other states .
Warm regards ,

Representative Provost ,
It looks like you ’re getting a quick response this time — your message just came in as I was making some notes on my blog about local efforts to start impeachment in the Mass legislature .
I am not familiar with that particular book .
My personal investigation into this administration has included most popular media , the Daily Kos blog , After Downing Street.org , Impeach for Peace.org , Fiasco by Thomas Ricks , and a collection of essays called “ Impeach the President ” , edited by Thomas Loo .
However when time permits — which is to say , when I finish with the last - mentioned book — I will be looking for that one next .
If you will re-read my previous e-mail you will see links to the resolutions introduced in New Mexico , Washington , and Vermont .
Here they are again for your notes : New Mexico [ 1 ] , Washington [ 2 ] , and Vermont [ 3 ] .

As for arguments for impeachment , I think these have been better articulated by some people much brighter than I am .
However here ’s a brisk attempt at outlining my own reasons :
I believe that the Libby verdict ( guilty as of today ) is indicative of deeper misdeeds in the administration .
Statements such as “ Vice President advised defendant that the President specifically had authorized defendant to disclose certain information in the NIE . ” [ 4 ] demand further scrutiny .
There is serious and important evidence showing that Bush intentionally mislead the American public and Congress into the Iraq War [ 5 ] , [ 6 ]
Bush has confessed to violating the Foreign Service Intelligence Act [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and has alleged that a ) his permit to invade Afganistan allowed him to do so ( it did not ) and that the secret FISA courts are too slow ( they can operate retroactively for up to 72 hours ! )

I strongly believe that now , perhaps unlike ever before , we must truly look past party politics and the risks of taking the lead .
We need true leaders to take the lead .
I am asking you to look beyond your concerns and ask yourself the fundamental question :
With regards to the Bush / Cheney administration , am I actively pursuing what I believe is right ?
I cannot but imagine that there is a strong base of supporters who would gladly co-sponsor this resolution with you .

SCAD student Jarratt Moody is in Time - based Typography I here at SCAD ( a course for which I ’m currently the teaching assistant ) , and he recently finished up a really nice piece for the first project in the class .
The basic idea of the project is to take a piece of audio from wherever ( movie , song , poetry reading , answering machine ) and then represent that audio on screen using only typography .
Jarratt chose a famous bit of dialogue from Pulp Fiction as his subject matter .
( Okay , what dialogue from Pulp Fiction is n’t famous ? )
The resulting piece is full of whimsy and style .
Jarratt does some great things with scale and simple but effective camera movements .

What does it all mean ?
This entry is for those people who have ever wondered , " Why the hell is a simple KDE text editor taking up 25 megabytes of memory ? "
Many people are led to believe that many Linux applications , especially KDE or Gnome programs , are " bloated " based solely upon what tools likereport .
While this may or may not be true , depending on the program , it is not generally true -- many programs are much more memory efficient than they seem .
Thetool can output various pieces of information about a process , such as its process id , current running state , and resource utilization .
Two of the possible outputs are VSZ and RSS , which stand for " virtual set size " and " resident set size " , which are commonly used by geeks around the world to see how much memory processes are taking up .
For example , here is the output offor KEdit on my computer : According to , KEdit has a virtual size of about 25 megabytes and a resident size of about 14 megabytes ( both numbers above are reported in kilobytes ) .
It seems that most people like to randomly choose to accept one number or the other as representing the real memory usage of a process .
I 'm not going to explain the difference between VSZ and RSS right now but , needless to say , this is the wrong approach ; neither number is an accurate picture of what the memory cost of running KEdit is .
Depending on how you look at it , is not reporting the real memory usage of processes .
What it is really doing is showing how much real memory each process would take up .
Of course , a typical Linux machine has several dozen processes running at any given time , which means that the VSZ and RSS numbers reported by ps are almost definitely " wrong " .
In order to understand why , it is necessary to learn how Linux handles shared libraries in programs .
Most major programs on Linux use shared libraries to facilitate certain functionality .
For example , a KDE text editing program will use several KDE shared libraries ( to allow for interaction with other KDE components ) , several X libraries ( to allow it to display images and copy and pasting ) , and several general system libraries ( to allow it to perform basic operations ) .
Many of these shared libraries , especially commonly used ones like libc , are used by many of the programs running on a Linux system .
Due to this sharing , Linux is able to use a great trick : it will load a single copy of the shared libraries into memory and use that one copy for every program that references it .
For better or worse , many tools do n't care very much about this very common trick ; they simply report how much memory a process uses , regardless of whether that memory is shared with other processes as well .
Two programs could therefore use a large shared library and yet have its size count towards both of their memory usage totals ; the library is being double - counted , which can be very misleading if you do n't know what is going on .
Unfortunately , a perfect representation of process memory usage is n't easy to obtain .
Not only do you need to understand how the system really works , but you need to decide how you want to deal with some hard questions .
Should a shared library that is only needed for one process be counted in that process 's memory usage ?
If a shared library is used my multiple processes , should its memory usage be evenly distributed among the different processes , or just ignored ?
There is n't a hard and fast rule here ; you might have different answers depending on the situation you 're facing .
It 's easy to see whydoes n't try harder to report " correct " memory usage totals , given the ambiguity .
Enough talk ; let 's see what the situation is with that " huge " KEdit process .
To see what KEdit 's memory looks like , we 'll use theprogram ( with theflag ) : I cut out a lot of the output ; the rest is similar to what is shown .
Even without the complete output , we can see some very interesting things .
One important thing to note about the output is that each shared library is listed twice ; once for its code segment and once for its data segment .
The code segments have a mode of " r- x -- " , while the data is set to " rw --- " .
The Kbytes , Mode , and Mapping columns are the only ones we will care about , as the rest are unimportant to the discussion .
If you go through the output , you will find that the lines with the largest Kbytes number are usually the code segments of the included shared libraries ( the ones that start with " lib " are the shared libraries ) .
What is great about that is that they are the ones that can be shared between processes .
If you factor out all of the parts that are shared between processes , you end up with the " writeable / private " total , which is shown at the bottom of the output .
This is what can be considered the incremental cost of this process , factoring out the shared libraries .
Therefore , the cost to run this instance of KEdit ( assuming that all of the shared libraries were already loaded ) is around 2 megabytes .
That is quite a different story from the 14 or 25 megabytes thatreported .
The moral of this story is that process memory usage on Linux is a complex matter ; you can't just runand know what is going on .
This is especially true when you deal with programs that create a lot of identical children processes , like Apache .
might report that each Apache process uses 10 megabytes of memory , when the reality might be that the marginal cost of each Apache process is 1 megabyte of memory .
This information becomes critial when tuning Apache 's MaxClients setting , which determines how many simultaneous requests your server can handle ( although see one of my past postings for another way of increasing Apache 's performance ) .
It also shows that it pays to stick with one desktop 's software as much as possible .
If you run KDE for your desktop , but mostly use Gnome applications , then you are paying a large price for a lot of redundant ( but different ) shared libraries .
By sticking to just KDE or just Gnome apps as much as possible , you reduce your overall memory usage due to the reduced marginal memory cost of running new KDE or Gnome applications , which allows Linux to use more memory for other interesting things ( like the file cache , which speeds up file accesses immensely ) .

One of the wonderful things about digital photography is the creativity that you can engage in once you ’ve got your image on your computer and in Photoshop .
All kinds of effects can be achieved to make your shots look any number of ways .
But what about in - camera techniques for more creative and artistic shots ?
Here are twelve fun in - camera hacks to experiment with to get more abstract and artistic shots – the results are only limited by your imagination !
1. Move your Camera
Every good photography course drums into it ’s participants the importance of keeping your camera absolutely still while shooting to ensure fantastically sharp images .
Of course sharp is n’t always what you ’re after and one way to add motion into your shots is to experiment with moving your camera while shooting .
Here are a few ways to experiment with :
panning – a technique often used in sports photography .
– a technique often used in sports photography .
rotate – ever whirled a child around you ?
why not do it with your camera and take a shot mid whirl .
– ever whirled a child around you ?
why not do it with your camera and take a shot mid whirl .
camera throwing – not for the faint hearted – this technique involves a long shutter speed , setting the self timer , throwing your camera in the air just before the shutter is released and a safe pair of hands .
It ’s ‘ extreme photography ’ and can result in stunning shots ( like the one to the right which was a camera throw shot in front of a computer screen ) – as well as the need for a new camera .
2. Zooming While Shooting
Another way of getting a sense of movement into your images is to keep the camera still but to zoom in or out with your zoom lens while actually taking the shot .
While panning ( above ) injects a vertical movement into shots – zooming gives your shots a dynamic 3D look and feel .
Combine this with slow sync flash ( see below ) and you can achieve some pretty special results .
Read more about the Zoom Effect .
3. Creative Focusing
One of the most common problems that I see in readers photos is poor focusing with photographers either focusing slightly in front or behind of the part of the image that needs to be sharp .
Why not take your focusing problems and make them worse by some creative focussing where you do n’t just get it slightly wrong – but make your shots obviously out of focus .
This technique is especially effective when you either have a plain background which means nothing in your shot is in focus – or when there ’s a secondary element of the image that you leave in focus with the main focal point out of focus enough for it to be obvious but in focus enough to still know what it is .
4 . Shoot from your Boots
Putting your camera on the ground and taking shots of your subject from that low angle introduces a completely new and often random point of view for your shots .
You ( and the viewers of your images ) will see the world from a new perspective , add interesting foregrounds to shots and even capture a few surprising subjects along the way .
This might mean you need to get down low ( and get a little dirty ) to frame your shots – or you might want to be a little more random than that and introduce luck into the equation and just hold your camera low and see what you get .
5 . Over expose your shots
Experiment with different exposure levels .
Bump up your exposure compensation to the max and you ’ll end up with brightly burnt out images .
This can be particularly effective if you ’re photographing brightly colorful objects as you can end up with them on a background of bright burnt out parts of the scene .
Check out these examples of Overexposure for a little more inspiration .
6. Slow Sync Flash
This is a great technique for lower light shooting conditions where there is ambient light that you want to capture in addition to a subject that you ’d like to light up with a flash .
Experiment with front or rear curtain flash for different impacts .
Learn more about Slow Sync Flash in our previous tutorials – Slow Sync Flash and An Explanation of 2nd Curtain Sync Flash .
Also check out these amazing Slow Sync Flash images .
7. Get Up High – Monopod extenders and Kite Aerial Photography
On the other end of the spectrum to getting down low ( above ) is to get your camera up high and shoot down on situations .
One fun way to do this is to attach your camera to an extended monopod ( or a tripod ) , a long shutter release cable ( or a wireless one if you have one ) and start shooting .
This will help you to both photograph things up high ( street signs for example ) as well as to help you shoot down on scenes that you ’d never have been able to see from above before .
This is particularly fun with a wide angle lens ( a fish eye can be even more fun ) !
Another more extreme technique is one called Kite Aerial Photography where you attach a camera to a kite and take shots from up high .
The beach image to the right was taken with this technique !
8. Multiple Exposures
I used to love experimenting with multiple exposures on the same frame with my old film SLR .
Many digital cameras do n’t have the ability to do it – but if you ’re lucky enough to have one that does you can achieve some fun results .
One way to do it is to take pictures of the same scene at different focal lengths or holding the camera on a slightly different angle .
I find this is particularly effective on shots with a repeating pattern .
If you do n’t have the ability for multiple exposures on your digital camera you can always get similar results in Photoshop using layers .
9. Go Grainy
There ’s something about shots with lots of grain that adds an element of mood into an image .
Override your cameras ISO settings by boosting them right up to the maximum number available .
The higher you go the more noise or grain you ’ll get .
This can be particularly effective in black and white shots – especially when you blow them up for display .
10 . White Balance
Experimenting with different white balance settings on your camera can inject different color casts into your images .
White balance settings are meant to be used to help you compensate for different types of lights ( each type of light gives off different subtle colors ) .
However , if you know what you ’re doing you can really warm up or cool down an image quite a bit and get some lovely and creative images .
11 . Master the Bulb Setting
At the slow end of many digital camera ’s shutter speed settings is one often labeled ‘ B ’ or ‘ Bulb ’ .
The bulb setting allows you to keep your shutter open for as long as you hold down the shutter release .
This opens up all kinds of possibilities for creativity – particularly in low light situations .
The Bulb is great for capturing light trails ( moving traffic at night , a friend drawing out a message with a torch or fireworks ) but to get the most of it you ’ll probably want to secure your camera with a tripod ( unless you want to add camera movement into your shot as well ) .
At the extreme end of bulb settings astro photographers will leave the shutter open for long periods of time ( hours ) to capture star trails .
To do this you ’ll need a small ISO , small aperture and should be aware that on many cameras it ’ll drain your batteries significantly .
12 . Infrared
Infrared photography is an art of it ’s own ( it deserves it ’s own tutorial – as it ’s something I ’ve not done much of I ’d be open to someone writing me one ) and can create some amazing shots ( black skies , white trees , dark eyes etc ) .
Not all cameras can capture infra red light ( although many can ) but check your manual to see if yours is one of them .
If you ’re in luck grab yourself an IR filter which cuts out non IR light and start experimenting .
Because these filters block out a lot of light you ’ll need to use longer shutter speeds , probably will want to use a tripod and should select faster ISO settings .
The start and end of the day is a great time to shoot in IR .

Jim Buckmaster , CEO of craigslist , did a “ fireside chat ” interview with BusinessWeek editor Jessi Hempel , at The Nantucket Conference .
The conference , and especially this session , was thought provoking .
I have interviewed Craig Newmark , founder of craigslist , and written about the craigslist concept several times .
I found Jim Buckmaster to be the perfect match for Craig Newmark , and craigslist .
He is genuine in his beliefs and commitment to the craigslist philosophy … just like Craig .
These guys break all the traditional rules on how to run a company .
I hesitate to call craigslist a company … it is really a community in every sense of the word .
Surely the users are a community , but even the company itself seems to be run more like a community than a traditional company .
Yet , craigslist has been more successful in terms of active users and revenues than probably 99 % of all web based companies .
There are lessons to be learned here .
Lots of companies talk about listening to customers … craigslist really does .
Craigslist could generate hundreds of millions in revenue and be a public company .
Why have n't you done this ?
" You can't serve two masters .
You either have to serve Wall Street or customers .
We chose customers .
Sure , we could generate more revenue , but we have enough to support the things we need to do . "
How is craigslist able to operate with just 24 people ?
" We do n’t have meetings .
Probably 90 % of most business time is spent on increasing revenues .
We do n’t do that , so we do n’t need meetings .
That gives us more time to focus on customer needs . ”
Have you considered advertising as a revenue stream ?
“ Our customers have n’t asked for that ” .
Why not charge for job and real estate listings in other cities ?
Why just San Francisco and New York ?
“ We would if our customers asked for that , but the community seems to be happy with the way it is ” .
What is on your product roadmap ?
“ Multilingual support , better search , better spam and scam detection , less clunky geography browsing . "
Why not just crank up the revenues a little bit to hire a few more people so you could implement some of these features and more customer service now ?
“ Well , every company has resource constraints .
Sure we get frustrated sometimes , but even companies with 1,000 employees have resource constraints .
So growing from our current 24 employees to 35 or 40 employees would n’t change things for the better … it would just make us bigger ’ .
Luxury hires – Jim was asked how he spends his time .
“ Unfortunately we get lots of requests from law enforcement or government agencies .
We need to respond … and this takes a lot of time , finding information , checking facts , and talking with lawyers .
I do n’t like doing it but it usually falls to me .
It would be nice to hire a legal coordinator but that would be a luxury hire .
We do n’t do luxury hires ” .
So , is craigslist hiring ?
“ Yes , we are hiring now and have ads on craigslist .
But we are careful who we choose to hire . ”
The whole interview was fascinating , but two things really jumped out at me and they are applicable to every business of any size .
Luxury hires and resource constraints .
If we really stopped to think about it there are probably quite a few luxury hires that could be avoided in every group .
In big companies there are lots of luxury hires walking around .
The second eye opener was the notion that every company , regardless of size , has resource constraints .
Craigslist has 24 people .
Other companies have 2400 people , or 24,000 people , but no matter the size … they ca n’t do everything .
They get bigger … not better .
This sort of reminds me of The Mythical Man Month .
Software projects are typically broken down into individual features and work estimates are expressed in terms of man months of effort .
Conventional wisdom is that adding more man months gets the job done faster .
The Mythical Man Month theory says that adding people to a project actually slows it down because of all the communication and coordination overhead .
If a project is behind schedule you should take people off the project to reduce overhead and sharpen the focus of the team .
Fascinating ideas .

Political connections and family control are more common in Asian businesses than in the United States .
In addition , says HBS professor D. Quinn Mills , American CEOs tend to use one of five leadership styles : directive , participative , empowering , charismatic , or celebrity .
Which styles have Asian business leaders adopted already , and which styles are likely to be most successful in the future ?
In a talk in Kuala Lumpur on June 15 at the invitation of The Star / BizWeek publication and the Harvard Club of Malaysia , Mills explained the differences and similarities between American and Asian leadership .
Below is the transcript of his talk , " Leadership Styles in the United States : How Different are They from Asia ? "
The rapid economic development of Asia in recent decades is one of the most important events in history .
This development continues today and there is every reason to anticipate that it will continue indefinitely unless derailed by possible but unlikely international conflicts .
At the core of Asian economic development is its business leadership — managers and entrepreneurs who sustain and create Asian companies .
Do they exhibit the same leadership styles as top executives in the West ?
There are important differences .
Are differences attributable to different cultures or to different stages of corporate development ?
But first , what are we talking about ?
Roles in organizations involve more than just leadership .
It is useful , but not yet common in our literature and discussion of business , to distinguish among leadership , management , and administration .
They are in fact very different ; each is valuable and has its place .
Briefly , leadership is about a vision of the future and the ability to energize others to pursue it .
Management is about getting results and doing so efficiently so that a financial profit or surplus is created .
Administration is about rules and procedures and whether or not they are being followed .
These distinctions are very important to clear communications among us about how organizations are run — when they are not made , we become very confused , as is much of the discussion around our topic .
Briefly , running an organization effectively involves :
Leadership :
Vision
Energizing
Vision Energizing Management :
Efficiency
Results
Efficiency Results Administration :
Rules
Procedures
Our focus today is on leadership : how an executive sets direction and energizes his organization to pursue the direction .
This is appropriate because managerial techniques are being spread fast by imitation , adoption , and MBA education .
Administrative techniques were generalized around the world decades ago .
So what is much different now is leadership .
Family And Political Connections
Cultural differences are important , but primarily as a matter of emphasis .
For example , family leadership of business enterprises , including large companies , occurs in very similar ways in both [ regions ] , but is more common in Asia .
Li Ka-shing [ of the Hong Kong - based Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong holding group ] , for example , runs his companies closely and is planning to pass the leadership of his firms to his two sons .
Similarly , the heads of some of America 's largest firms , both publicly held and private , are the scions of the families that founded the firms .
There is less freedom of action for executives and boards in America than in Asia .
But more common in America are firms that are run by professional managers who are replaced by other professional managers , either as a consequence of retirement or of replacement by the board of directors of the firm .
The better companies have sophisticated programs for developing executives within the firm , and ordinarily choose a next chief executive officer from among them .
American CEOs average about thirty years with their firms and own less than 4 percent of its shares .
There is a small number of firms , which get a great deal of publicity and so seem more numerous than they are , that hire CEOs directly from the outside , with no previous experience with the firm .
These CEOs are driven by a need to excel in a competitive environment ( they want to win ) , and they insist that money is less important to them than professional achievement ; but it's hard to credit that given the enormous inflation of top executive compensation packages in America in the last decade .
Many American firms , especially most of the large ones , are more dependent on capital markets for their capital ( equity and debt ) and so pay much more attention to Wall Street than is yet common in Asia .
Wall Street has strong expectations about the behavior and performance of executives and about succession .
There is less freedom of action for executives and boards in America than in Asia .
In Asia , succession usually is passed on to the siblings .
In Li's case , he is handing it to his two sons , while Jack Welch developed a talent machine to groom CEOs for General Electric .
To a significant degree , large American firms are at a later stage of development than many Asian firms — they have passed from founders ' family leadership to professional management and to capital obtained from the capital markets ( rather than obtained from government — directly or indirectly — or from family fortunes ) .
In this transition they have adopted particular styles of leadership responsive to boards ( often led by outside directors ) and to Wall Street .
It is possible , but not certain , that Asian firms will follow this evolutionary path .
The political connections so important for top business leaders in Asia , whether in democracies or one - party states , are not unknown but are much less important in America .
It is a characteristic of Asian top executives that they have such connections that are important to their businesses .
In America , the chief executive officers of very large firms often have virtually no direct connections to top politicians — the government is treated at arm 's length and business is done by business people .
There are , of course , exceptions , and deep political involvement is still a route to business success in America , but it is much less common than in Asia .
Leadership Styles In America
Leadership styles are more varied in America today than in Asia .
In America there are five :
Directive
Participative
Empowering
Charismatic
Celebrity ( superstar )
The first four reflect how an executive deals with subordinates in the company ; the final one is directed at people outside the firm .
Directive leadership is well known in America , but is declining in frequency .
It stresses the direction given by executives to others in the firms .
The leader is very much in charge .
This style is very common in Asia .
Participative leadership , which involves close teamwork with others , is more common in Europe , where it is sometimes required by law ( as in northern Europe , especially Germany ) than in America .
It is also common in a variant colored by national cultural norms , [ as ] in Japan .
Empowering leadership is relatively new , and stresses delegation of responsibility to subordinates .
American companies that operate with largely autonomous divisions employ this style of leadership .
A few younger Asian business leaders now espouse this style ( for example , the CEO of Banyan Tree Resorts ) .
At the core of empowering leadership is the ability to energize the people in a company .
Jack Welch commented , " You may be a great manager , but unless you can energize other people , you are of no value to General Electric as a leader . "
Energizing others is the core of the new leadership in America .
Adaptability is ... less common and less valued in Asia and Europe .
It will be needed everywhere soon enough .
Charismatic leadership is the leader who looks like a leader .
People follow such a leader because of who he is , not because of good management or even business success ; nor because [ the people ] are offered participation , partnership , or empowerment .
Human magnetism is the thing , and it is very different in different national cultures .
What looks like a charismatic leader to Americans may appear to be something very different to people from other societies .
Celebrity leadership is very different .
It looks outside the company to the impact on others — customers and investors .
The CEO becomes a star and is sought after by the media like a screen star .
Ordinarily it requires good looks , a dramatic style , and an ability to deal effectively with the media .
It is in a bit of a slump in the United States right now due to the corporate financial reporting scandals , which have focused attention on CEOs with the ability to get things done right in the company ; but celebrity leadership will make a recovery .
Boards looking for top executives to revitalize a firm look for superstars ; they seek outgoing personalities .
Corporate governance in the West means oversight from regulators , boards of directors , even institutional shareholders .
While Asia now has most of these institutions , they are ordinarily not as well established and not as significant in the minds of top executives .
Asia is bedeviled by official corruption that reaches far into business .
America has less of this , but has in its place considerable financial reporting fraud .
Both are very dangerous to the economic success of the nations involved .
Graft tends to destroy an economy first by undermining the trust that is required for transactions to occur , and by distorting the economic calculus that underlies sensible business decisions .
As it continues , graft destroys the national political entity .
Long - established graft is a way of life that is very hard to root out .
Politicians promise to eliminate it , but are unable or unwilling to do so .
The role models available for business leadership in the different regions of the world are significant .
In America , with its longstanding experience with professional business leadership , the most readily available role model for the head of a company is the corporate CEO .
In China and Chinese - related businesses it is the head of the family .
In France it remains the military general .
In Japan it is the consensus builder .
In Germany today it is the coalition builder .
There are nine key qualities that research shows people seek in a successful leader :
Passion
Decisiveness
Conviction
Integrity
Adaptability
Emotional Toughness
Emotional Resonance
Self - Knowledge
Humility
The emotionalism that goes with passion is more common in America than elsewhere .
Europeans see it as a sort of business evangelicalism and are very suspicious of it .
Decisiveness is common to effective executives in all countries :
In this regard European and Japanese chief executives are the most consensus - oriented , and Chinese and American top executives are more likely to make decisions personally and with their own accountability .
Conviction is common to all .
Integrity is a complex characteristic very much determined by national cultures .
What is honest in one society is not in another , and vice versa .
Adaptability is a pronounced characteristic of American leadership generally .
It is less common and less valued in Asia and Europe .
It will be needed everywhere soon enough .
Emotional toughness is common to all top executives ; Americans spend more time trying not to show it .
Deep political involvement is still a route to business success in America , but it is much less common than in Asia .
Emotional resonance , the ability to grasp what motivates others and appeal effectively to it , is most important in the United States and Europe at this point in time .
It will become more important in Asia as living standards improve , knowledge workers become more important , professional management gets greater demand , and CEOs have to compete for managerial talent .
Self - knowledge is important in avoiding the sort of over - reach so common in America ; it is less common a virtue in America than in Asia , and is a strength of the Asian executive .
Humility is a very uncommon trait in the American CEO .
It is sometimes found in Asia .
It is often a trait of the most effective leaders , as it was in the best - respected of all American political leaders , Abraham Lincoln .
Once , when the Civil War was not going well for the Union side , a high - ranking general suggested that the nation needed to get rid of Lincoln and have a dictatorship instead .
The comment came to Lincoln 's ears .
Lincoln promoted the general to the top command in the army anyway and told him , " I am appointing you to command despite , not because , of what you said .
Bring us victories , and I 'll risk the dictatorship . "
What 's Next For Asia
The " New Asian Leader " ?
There are three prototypes :
1 ) Li Ka-shing of Hutchison Whampoa - Cheung Kong : old Chinese leadership in transition like Li Ka-shing .
Rags - to - riches in one generation ; handing over his business empire to his two sons who are Western - trained .
There are many such examples in Asia .
Li Ka-shing is in different areas of business — telecommunications , security , and high - end IT — and is very interested in becoming a contractor in the emerging homeland security construct in America .
With Li Ka-shing , the threat to success is his reliance on an international concern to be a significant contractor in the establishment of the U.S. homeland security hierarchy .
Li's personal story is an amazing tale of success .
After the death of his father , Li—at age twelve — went to work in a plastics factory .
Within a decade he started his own plastics company , which he later leveraged into a real estate and investment concern .
It then was an early entrant into China 's telecom and IT wave of the early 1990s , and became a market leader .
Li is a man who seeks to establish a positive legacy .
He created a foundation in 1980 to help young Chinese students have the educational and other opportunities he had to make for himself at age twelve .
He also started his own university , Shantou University , in 1981 , with a similar purpose .
2 ) William and Victor Fung of Li & Fung : old traditional Chinese family - owned companies now run by the third generation of the family , Western - and highly - educated , who use Western technology extensively to face globalization and succeed .
Very much Western - centric in approach yet Asian in practice , the Fungs of Li & Fung have mastered techniques of getting maximum efficiency out of the supply chain , taking raw materials and making low - cost , high - demand consumer goods , particularly clothing , much more cheaply than in the United States .
What the Fungs have accomplished is similar to what Japanese automakers accomplished a generation ago .
By strictly adhering to principles of quality control — principles that were espoused by American business consultant Edward Deming — Nissan and Toyota made cheaper , better cars than the Americans did , eventually causing the big three U.S. automakers to follow suit .
William and Victor Fung are interested in being business consultants , teaching others how to do what they 've done .
Both men are Harvard - educated and have a desire to be open and forthcoming about their business model .
As Asian companies seek access to world capital markets , they will move toward professional managers who will employ leadership styles more akin to those now used in the United States .
The main threats with Li & Fung are these : driving down labor costs , and concerns about relying on suppliers who potentially abuse the human rights of workers or pay less than a standard living wage .
Victor and William Fung are the new type of Asian leaders — will they soon be the only type ?
3 ) New Economy business leaders .
Information technology and the Internet are bringing out a high - tech type of leadership that is common in America 's high - tech sector .
Entrepreneurial , innovative , hard - driving , very flexible , ambitious , optimistic , visionary in the technology and business aspects , they will play a good , but not dominant role .
N. R. Narayana Murthy of India 's Infosys and Stan Shih of Acer are good examples .
They have adopted an almost entirely Western style of leadership and are succeeding in Asia .
What is the conclusion ?
Styles of leadership are currently different between Asia and America .
Culture colors the way things are done , but less so what is done .
The differences in styles most markedly reflect the stage of development of the economies and companies of Asia .
As Asian companies seek access to world capital markets , they will move toward professional managers who will employ leadership styles more akin to those now used in the United States .
As Asian companies rely more on professional employees of all sorts , and as professional services become more important in Asian economies , the less autocratic and more participative and even empowered style of leadership will emerge .
Asian leadership will come to more resemble that of the West .
But significant cultural differences will remain — economic and geopolitical rivalries within Asia and between Asian countries and the West will continue and perhaps grow .
Economies will retain characteristic national features .
Convergence in a leadership style does not guarantee likeness of results nor even peace .
We will continue to have to work for economic progress and peace ; it will not come automatically .
Purdue researchers demonstrate their method for producing hydrogen by adding water to an alloy of aluminum and gallium .
The hydrogen could then be used to run an internal combustion engine .
The reaction was discovered by Jerry Woodall , center , a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering .
Charles Allen , holding test tube , and Jeffrey Ziebarth , both doctoral students in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering , are working with Woodall to perfect the process .
( Purdue News Service photo / David Umberger )
A Purdue University engineer has developed a method that uses an aluminum alloy to extract hydrogen from water for running fuel cells or internal combustion engines , and the technique could be used to replace gasoline .
The method makes it unnecessary to store or transport hydrogen - two major challenges in creating a hydrogen economy , said Jerry Woodall , a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue who invented the process .
" The hydrogen is generated on demand , so you only produce as much as you need when you need it , " said Woodall , who presented research findings detailing how the system works during a recent energy symposium at Purdue .
The technology could be used to drive small internal combustion engines in various applications , including portable emergency generators , lawn mowers and chain saws .
The process could , in theory , also be used to replace gasoline for cars and trucks , he said .
Hydrogen is generated spontaneously when water is added to pellets of the alloy , which is made of aluminum and a metal called gallium .
The researchers have shown how hydrogen is produced when water is added to a small tank containing the pellets .
Hydrogen produced in such a system could be fed directly to an engine , such as those on lawn mowers .
" When water is added to the pellets , the aluminum in the solid alloy reacts because it has a strong attraction to the oxygen in the water , " Woodall said .
This reaction splits the oxygen and hydrogen contained in water , releasing hydrogen in the process .
The gallium is critical to the process because it hinders the formation of a skin normally created on aluminum 's surface after oxidation .
This skin usually prevents oxygen from reacting with aluminum , acting as a barrier .
Preventing the skin 's formation allows the reaction to continue until all of the aluminum is used .
The Purdue Research Foundation holds title to the primary patent , which has been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and is pending .
An Indiana startup company , AlGalCo LLC . , has received a license for the exclusive right to commercialize the process .
The research has been supported by the Energy Center at Purdue 's Discovery Park , the university 's hub for interdisciplinary research .
" This is exactly the kind of project that suits Discovery Park .
It 's exciting science that has great potential to be commercialized , " said Jay Gore , associate dean of engineering for research , the Energy Center 's interim director and the Vincent P. Reilly Professor of Mechanical Engineering .
The research team is made up of electrical , mechanical , chemical and aeronautical engineers , including doctoral students .
Woodall discovered that liquid alloys of aluminum and gallium spontaneously produce hydrogen if mixed with water while he was working as a researcher in the semiconductor industry in 1967 .
The research , which focused on developing new semiconductors for computers and electronics , led to advances in optical - fiber communications and light - emitting diodes , making them practical for everything from DVD players to automotive dashboard displays .
That work also led to development of advanced transistors for cell phones and components in solar cells powering space modules like those used on the Mars rover , earning Woodall the 2001 National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush .
" I was cleaning a crucible containing liquid alloys of gallium and aluminum , " Woodall said .
" When I added water to this alloy - talk about a discovery - there was a violent poof .
I went to my office and worked out the reaction in a couple of hours to figure out what had happened .
When aluminum atoms in the liquid alloy come into contact with water , they react , splitting the water and producing hydrogen and aluminum oxide .
" Gallium is critical because it melts at low temperature and readily dissolves aluminum , and it renders the aluminum in the solid pellets reactive with water .
This was a totally surprising discovery , since it is well known that pure solid aluminum does not readily react with water . "
The waste products are gallium and aluminum oxide , also called alumina .
Combusting hydrogen in an engine produces only water as waste .
" No toxic fumes are produced , " Woodall said .
" It 's important to note that the gallium does n't react , so it does n't get used up and can be recycled over and over again .
The reason this is so important is because gallium is currently a lot more expensive than aluminum .
Hopefully , if this process is widely adopted , the gallium industry will respond by producing large quantities of the low - grade gallium required for our process .
Currently , nearly all gallium is of high purity and used almost exclusively by the semiconductor industry . "
Woodall said that because the technology makes it possible to use hydrogen instead of gasoline to run internal combustion engines it could be used for cars and trucks .
In order for the technology to be economically competitive with gasoline , however , the cost of recycling aluminum oxide must be reduced , he said .
" Right now it costs more than $ 1 a pound to buy aluminum , and , at that price , you can't deliver a product at the equivalent of $ 3 per gallon of gasoline , " Woodall said .
However , the cost of aluminum could be reduced by recycling it from the alumina using a process called fused salt electrolysis .
The aluminum could be produced at competitive prices if the recycling process were carried out with electricity generated by a nuclear power plant or windmills .
Because the electricity would not need to be distributed on the power grid , it would be less costly than power produced by plants connected to the grid , and the generators could be located in remote locations , which would be particularly important for a nuclear reactor to ease political and social concerns , Woodall said .
" The cost of making on - site electricity is much lower if you do n't have to distribute it , " Woodall said .
The approach could enable the United States to replace gasoline for transportation purposes , reducing pollution and the nation 's dependence on foreign oil .
If hydrogen fuel cells are perfected for cars and trucks in the future , the same hydrogen - producing method could be used to power them , he said .
" We call this the aluminum - enabling hydrogen economy , " Woodall said .
" It 's a simple matter to convert ordinary internal combustion engines to run on hydrogen .
All you have to do is replace the gasoline fuel injector with a hydrogen injector . "
Even at the current cost of aluminum , however , the method would be economically competitive with gasoline if the hydrogen were used to run future fuel cells .
" Using pure hydrogen , fuel cell systems run at an overall efficiency of 75 percent , compared to 40 percent using hydrogen extracted from fossil fuels and with 25 percent for internal combustion engines , " Woodall said .
" Therefore , when and if fuel cells become economically viable , our method would compete with gasoline at $ 3 per gallon even if aluminum costs more than a dollar per pound . "
The hydrogen - generating technology paired with advanced fuel cells also represents a potential future method for replacing lead - acid batteries in applications such as golf carts , electric wheel chairs and hybrid cars , he said .
The technology underscores aluminum 's value for energy production .
" Most people do n't realize how energy intensive aluminum is , " Woodall said .
" For every pound of aluminum you get more than two kilowatt hours of energy in the form of hydrogen combustion and more than two kilowatt hours of heat from the reaction of aluminum with water .
A midsize car with a full tank of aluminum - gallium pellets , which amounts to about 350 pounds of aluminum , could take a 350 - mile trip and it would cost $ 60 , assuming the alumina is converted back to aluminum on - site at a nuclear power plant .
" How does this compare with conventional technology ?
Well , if I put gasoline in a tank , I get six kilowatt hours per pound , or about two and a half times the energy than I get for a pound of aluminum .
So I need about two and a half times the weight of aluminum to get the same energy output , but I eliminate gasoline entirely , and I am using a resource that is cheap and abundant in the United States .
If only the energy of the generated hydrogen is used , then the aluminum - gallium alloy would require about the same space as a tank of gasoline , so no extra room would be needed , and the added weight would be the equivalent of an extra passenger , albeit a pretty large extra passenger . "
The concept could eliminate major hurdles related to developing a hydrogen economy .
Replacing gasoline with hydrogen for transportation purposes would require the production of huge quantities of hydrogen , and the hydrogen gas would then have to be transported to filling stations .
Transporting hydrogen is expensive because it is a " non-ideal gas , " meaning storage tanks contain less hydrogen than other gases .
" If I can economically make hydrogen on demand , however , I do n't have to store and transport it , which solves a significant problem , " Woodall said .

The herpes family of viruses can have a surprising upside -- it can protect against the bubonic plague and other bacterial contagions , at least in mice .
Research into whether a similar mechanism applies to humans and other mammalian hosts should be conducted , said viral immunologist Skip Virgin at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
" There may be symbiotic advantages to chronic infections with these viruses . "
These new results do not mean people should go out and get infected with herpes , Virgin stressed .
They probably already are .
Nearly all humans become infected with multiple herpes virus family members during childhood .
These germs not only include the herpes simplex viruses , which lead to cold sores and possibly genital herpes , but also the diseases responsible for chickenpox and " mono , " as well as several less well - known ailments .
Herpes infections have bedeviled animals for more than 100 million years .
After the initial period of infection , these viruses enter a dormant state known as latency .
Many lurk for the lifetime of their hosts " as permanent passengers " without causing overt symptoms , Virgin said .
Virgin and his colleagues experimented with viruses highly similar genetically to ones that cause mono and other diseases in humans .
These germs normally cause fatigue and ruffled fur in mice , although the researchers used dose levels too low to cause symptoms .
The scientists discovered latent infections with these viruses could protect mice from bacterial infections , including Yersinia pestis , which causes bubonic plague , and Listeria monocytogenes , which causes one kind of food poisoning , findings detailed in the May 17 issue of the journal Nature .
The herpes viruses spur the immune system to boost levels of a protein hormone called interferon gamma " that in effect puts some immune system soldiers on yellow alert , causing them to patrol for invaders with their eyes wide open and defense weapons ready , " Virgin said .
As a result , the bacteria grew more slowly and were less likely to kill the mice .
Future research can investigate whether these latent infections protect against other viruses .
Still , while people might benefit from symbiotic relationships with the herpes family of viruses , they can also have serious consequences , such as deafness , blindness , encephalitis and cancer .
" The presence of these viruses seems to be a two - edged sword , " Virgin told LiveScience .
" I am quite concerned that we be sensitive to these true human tragedies while recognizing the potential of a new way to view these infections . "
Uncovering any potential benefits of these viruses in humans will prove hard , Virgin cautioned , " since nearly all humans are infected with these viruses at a young age , so it will be hard to find people without them for comparison . "
Lately I have been trying to avoid talking about Microsoft .
I figured the whole Zune thing had been covered to death and so my input was n’t really needed .
I continued to think this until I read about Microsoft ’s “ Zune Marketplace ” .
This iTMS competitor was so badly designed I just had to write something about it .
Even though by now I expect Microsoft to be incompetent , this was taking ineptitude and elevating it to an art form .
But let me lay out the facts for you lest we get ahead of ourselves .
As we all know , purchasing songs , videos or games from the iTMS only requires a customer to create an account and have a valid credit card .
Thus , like most other business transactions , you purchase a good and the price of that good is billed to your credit card .
It works the same way at the grocery store , at the gas station or in a restaurant .
And for the most part it seems like a pretty good system .
Plenty of people have credit cards and they understand the concept of purchasing items with them .
So , how , you ask , could Microsoft screw this up ?
No , first you might ask , what is there to screw up ?
I mean , the system already works .
All you need your customer to do is show up with a credit card ?
Right ?
Wrong !
I suppose Microsoft saw this as a chance to “ innovate ” .
And we all know what happens when they innovate ( in the 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time MS has many entries )
This was one of those times when Microsoft should have just stolen the iTMS concept lock , stock and barrel .
It would have been unimaginative , but at least it would work .
Instead , they decided to go with the following scheme :
The 5 Step Plan To Fill Your Zune With Legal Music
1. Create a free Zune account
2. Register a valid credit card
3. Buy “ points ” from MS
4. Scratch your head as you try to figure out why you need to buy “ points ” to buy songs .
Why ca n’t you just use standard American currency ?
Does n’t Microsoft accept the Dollar anymore ?
5. Say “ screw it ” and go buy an iPod
Adding a completely unnecessary layer of confusion is , in and of itself , a bad thing .
But it would n’t be Microsoft if they did n’t go that extra mile to rape their customers .
You see , when you buy these “ points ” you ca n’t buy them as you need them , you have to purchase them in Microsoft defined denominations .
In other words , Microsoft just invented a currency and they require you to invest in this currency before they can sell you any music .
And just if you were wondering , here are the denominations :
$ 5 = 400 points
$ 15 = 1200 points
$ 25 = 2000 points
$ 50 = 4000 points
But wait , it gets BETTER !
There is n’t a 1 to 1 correspondence between the value of a “ point ” and the value of a penny .
Let me break out some math for you :
If
$ 5 = 400 points
then
$ 1 = 80 points
therefore
100 cents = 80 points
meaning
1 cent = .8 points
or
1 point = 1.25 cents
So , let me explain why this is important .
If Microsoft prices a song at 79 “ Zune Points ” is it cheaper than a 99 cent song from Apple ?
I do n’t know , lets do the math .
79 points * ( 1.25 cents / 1 point ) = 98.75 cents ( or approximately 99 cents )
So the answer is “ no , the MS song is n’t cheaper , it is the same price as Apple ’s ” .
So , that means , to find the actual price of anything on the Zune store you have to multiply it in your head by a ZP ( Zune Point ) factor of 1.25 , and since the general populace is n’t to keen on doing math in their head I can only conclude that this will cause no small bit of confusion .
But wait , it gets better .
If you recall $ 5 is the lowest denomination you can purchase .
So if you want to buy one song from the Zune Marketplace you have pay Microsoft $ 5 up front and let them keep your remaining 321 points ( or $ 4.01 , this is beginning to get confusing ) .
Now , the expectation is that you will be back purchasing more songs ( and more points ) and so you wo n’t care about your balance .
But , what you are in fact doing is giving an interest free loan to Microsoft ( because they , of all companies , need the money ) .
Of course , you could just spend all of your points each time you buy music , but would require you to purchase songs in multiples of 31,600 points ( that being the LCM of 79 & 400 ) .
That works out to 400 songs for $ 395 .
A better plan would be to buy 5 songs for 395 points ( or $ 4.94 ) and just save your 5 remaining points for some future purchase .
In effect , Microsoft has created a store that only accepts gift cards as the valid method of payments .
And if you do n’t think thats insane then you obviously already have pre-ordered your Zune .
I know what you ’re thinking .
Why would Microsoft do this ?
Perhaps to screw customers out of their money by creating a complex , uselessly confusing layer designed to hide the real price of their products ?
No , of course not .
Why , according to Zune . net the reason is :
The Points that you purchase can be easily managed in a special account that you can use on Zune Marketplace and Xbox Live Marketplace .
Well there you go .
It is n’t targeted at average consumers it is targeted at these special Marketplace users .
So how many of theses users are there ?
To figure that out we need to know how many Xbox Live users are there .
Well , there have been 24 million Xboxes sold and almost 6 million Xbox 360s sold ( as of Sept. of this year ) .
So , if every Xbox owner also buys a Zune , and they also decide to use both Marketplace services ( or else what ’s the point ? ) then this service will be useful to , at most , 30 million people .
That assumes that all of those people who bought Xboxes outside the USA fly over here and buy a Zune ( because the Zune is US only baby ! ) and then use that Zune in America to load up on their music .
( presumably they can then fly home and enjoy their music , assuming of course , that they can both read English and enjoy American music , but whatever )
A more realistic figure is Microsoft sells around 2 million Zunes and maybe half of those users also use the Xbox Live Marketplace .
So , this horrible system has been put in place ( according to Microsoft ’s logic ) to make life easier for less than 1 million people .
“ Welcome to the Social ” , b***h !
Google Street View , Circa 1935
Google ’s new Street View feature has caused a predictable sort of hubbub .
Privacy advocates are upset ; one woman freaked out when she could see her cat through the window of her house ; one man was caught peeing by the side of the road .
( We interviewed Google ’s project manager on our site ; his answers , hardly earth - shaking , were still interesting . )
I understand all these concerns .
But I ’d like to suggest a slightly different way of thinking about Street View .
Several years ago , I was doing research for my first book , Turbulent Souls ( republished recently as Choosing My Religion ) .
I knew very little about my parents ’ and grandparents ’ lives in the old days , so I did as much document research as I could , a little bit in Poland and Israel but mostly in New York City .
I learned that the city ’s Dept. of Records and Information Services maintained an archive of photos taken of every building in the city , for taxation purposes .
I knew the street addresses in Brooklyn where my mother and father had both lived as kids , so I was able to track down the pictures .
Here is the photo of the building in Brownsville where , some years earlier , my father ’s family lived and ran a kosher restaurant .
( If you can make out the sign on the window , you ’ll see that the storefront now belongs to Weiss Monumental Works , which sold cemetery headstones . )
As thrilled as I was to find that photo , it could n’t compare to the next one I found — of the house where my mother lived as a teenager , at 175 Crown Heights :
Can you see the open door of the house ?
And then look , just to the left of the door — that woman ?
That ’s my grandmother , Esther Bernstein Greenglass .
I ca n’t quite make out what she ’s doing — watering some plants ?
Chatting with the neighbor ?
Shaking out a dish towel ?
But it did n’t matter .
How lucky I was , to have found this relic of my family ’s life , no matter how small .
My grandmother died when I was about six , and I barely knew her ; all my other grandparents died earlier .
I have always been the kind of writer who likes to have pictures around when I write , so to me this random tax photo from the 1930 ’s ( I think ) was a pretty great find .
I realize there is a big difference between a photograph like this one , which must be hunted down in a dusty municipal archive , and Google Street View , which creates pictures that are available to anyone , anytime , anywhere in the world with the click of a mouse .
( Alas , 175 Crown Street lies just out of Google Street View ’s view , so far at least . )
But I think it ’s worth considering that what may strike you today as a harsh invasion of your privacy , unforgivable and unwanted , may turn out to be a boon one day to your grandchildren .
Paul LaFontaine left Bertelsmann Music Group in March 1997 to advise other businesspeople about radical honesty .
He has lots of work to do .
“ There are as many lies in business as there are people in business , ” he says .
Here are his nominees for the five most common lies :
Lie : “ People are our most important asset . ”
Truth : “ People are our most worrisome and unpredictable asset .
Our most important assets are really our financial assets . ”
B.S. Detector :
This may be the leading lie of our times .
“ When management starts talking about how important people are , ” LaFontaine says , “ you can bet there is going to be an unpopular human resources decision coming soon . ”
Lie : “ This was a rational decision . ”
Truth : “ I wanted to do this . ”
B.S. Detector : People “ want what they want just because they want it , ” says LaFontaine .
Lie : “ We judge people by their performance . ”
Truth : “ I judge your performance based on how much I like you . ”
B.S. Detector : “ Why do most people who keep their jobs keep them ? ” LaFontaine asks .
“ Because the people they work for like them .
And you get fired when the people you work for do n’t like you anymore .
A Florida appeals court has upheld a lower court decision that denies requests for an independent source code audit of voting machines used by Florida 's 13th district , which suffered election irregularities in a highly controversial congressional race .
The appeals court has chosen to support a lower court decision which asserts that forcing voting machine maker Election Systems and Software ( ES&S ) to provide source code access to independent security auditors would amount to " gutting the protections afforded those who own trade secrets . "
It all started when candidate Christine Jennings lost to Rep. Vern Buchanan by only 368 votes in a House race last year , the slimmest margin of any congressional race in the country .
Irregularities in the election , particularly high undervote rates , caused Jennings to express doubts about the validity of the outcome .
During the election , approximately 15 percent ( or 18,000 ) of the total ballots cast in the district did not include a vote in the disputed race .
By comparison , the absentee ballots in the same district and regular paper ballots used in neighboring districts only exhibit a 2 percent undervote rate for congressional races .
The high undervote rates have been attributed to the ES&S iVotronic machines used in the 13th district .
Although efforts to get the state to force ES&S to submit to additional independent code audits have failed , a bipartisan congressional task force working closely with the Government Accountability Office is actively scrutinizing the circumstances surrounding election irregularities in Florida 's 13th district , and may decide to subpoena ES&S .
The congressional task force plans to issue a progress report late next month , but the entire investigation is expected to last until September .
Could the iVotronic systems be responsible for the voting irregularities ?
A growing body of evidence indicates that electronic voting machines , particularly those that use touch - screens , lead to higher undervote rates .
Touch - screen voting machines made by major vendors also frequently exhibit serious technical flaws and poor reliability .
In response to widespread voting machine problems , Florida governor Charlie Crist is encouraging the state legislature to pass a law that would prevent districts from buying most kinds of touch - screen voting machines .
A bill that was approved by the House Committee on Administration last month includes source code disclosure requirements which stipulate that voting machine makers would be required to disclose their code to independent third - party auditors who may be required to sign nondisclosure agreements .
As Tim Lee pointed out in his article on the subject last month , independent code audit requirements are important for election transparency , but nondisclosure agreements would prevent broad public analysis of source code and could potentially be used to intimidate security analysts .
Considering the high level of vulnerability exhibited by mainstream electronic voting technology , Congress needs to do all that it can to help the states protect themselves from faulty products .
What Went Wrong ?
As an attempt to create a balanced and self - sustaining replica of Earths ecosystems , Biosphere II was a miserable ( and expensive ) failure .
Numerous problems plagued the crew almost from the very beginning .
Of these , a mysterious loss of oxygen and widespread extinction were the most notable .
Catching Their Breath
Starting when the crew members were first sealed in , Biosphere II experienced a constant and puzzling decline in the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere .
It was initially hoped that the system was merely stabilizing itself , but as time passed it became increasingly clear the something was amiss .
Not quite 18 months into the experiment , when oxygen levels dropped to the point where the crew could barely function , the outside managers decided to pump oxygen into the system so they could complete the full two years as planned .
Obviously , Biosphere II was not self - sustaining if outside oxygen had to be added in order for the crew to survive .
The reasons behind this flaw in the project were not fully understood until some time later .
As it turned out , the problem had more to do with carbon dioxide than with oxygen .
Biosphere II s soil , especially in the rain forest and savanna areas , is unusually rich in organic material .
Microbes were metabolizing this material at an abnormally high rate , in the process of which they used up a lot of oxygen and produced a lot of carbon dioxide .
The plants in Biosphere II should have been able to use this excess carbon dioxide to replace the oxygen through photosynthesis , except that another chemical reaction was also taking place .
A vast majority of Biosphere II was built out of concrete , which contains calcium hydroxide .
Instead of being consumed by the plants to produce more oxygen , the excess carbon dioxide was reacting with calcium hydroxide in the concrete walls to form calcium carbonate and water .
Ca(OH ) 2 + CO2 --> CaCO3 + H2O
This hypothesis was confirmed when scientists tested the walls and found that they contained about ten times the amount of calcium carbonate on the inner surfaces as they did on the outer surfaces .
All of the walls in Biosphere II are now coated with a protective layer , but oxygen levels continue to be somewhat problematic .
Walking a Tightrope
The designers of Biosphere II included a carefully chosen variety of plant , animal , and insect species .
They anticipated that some species would not survive , but the eventual extinction rate was much higher than expected .
Of the 25 small vertebrates with which the project began , only 6 did not die out by the mission 's end .
Almost all of the insect species went extinct , including those which had been included for the purpose of pollinating plants .
This caused its own problems , since the plants could no longer propagate themselves .
At the same time , some species absolutely thrived in this man-made environment .
Crazy ants , cockroaches , and katydids ran rampant , while certain vines ( like morning glories ) threatened to choke out every other kind of plant .
The crew members were forced to put vast amounts of energy into simply maintaining their food crops .
Biosphere II could not sustain a balanced ecosystem , and therefore failed to fulfill its goals .
Other Problems
Biosphere II 's water systems became polluted with too many nutrients .
The crew had to clean their water by running it over mats of algae , which they later dried and stored .
Also , as a symptom of further atmospheric imbalances , the level of dinitrogen oxide became dangerously high .
At these levels , there was a risk of brain damage due to a reduction in the synthesis of vitamin B12 .
