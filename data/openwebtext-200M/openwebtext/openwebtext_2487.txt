Advertisement Matt Smith has been named as the actor who will take over from David Tennant in Doctor Who - making him the youngest actor to take on the role .
At 26 , Smith is three years younger than Peter Davison when he signed up to play the fifth Doctor in 1981 .
Smith will first appear on TV screens as the 11th Doctor in 2010 .
He was cast over Christmas and will begin filming for the fifth series of Doctor Who in the summer .
Tennant is filming four specials in 2009 .
Smith was named as Tennant 's replacement in Saturday 's edition of Doctor Who Confidential on BBC One .
The programme was watched by an audience of 6.9 million people at its peak , according to official overnight figures .
The actor said : " I feel proud and honoured to have been given this opportunity to join a team of people that has worked so tirelessly to make the show so thrilling .
" David Tennant has made the role his own , brilliantly , with grace , talent and persistent dedication .
I hope to learn from the standards set by him .
" The challenge for me is to do justice to the show 's illustrious past , my predecessors , and most importantly , to those who watch it .
I really cannot wait . "
Piers Wenger , head of drama at BBC Wales , said that as soon as he had seen Smith 's audition he " knew he was the one " .
The 11 Doctors 1 . William Hartnell ( 1963 - 1966 )
2 . Patrick Troughton ( 1966 - 1969 ) 3 . Jon Pertwee ( 1970 - 1974 ) 4 . Tom Baker ( 1974 -1981 )
5 . Peter Davison - pictured ( 1982 -1984 ) 6 . Colin Baker ( 1984 -1986 )
7 . Sylvester McCoy ( 1987 -1996 )
8 . Paul McGann ( 1996 ) 9 . Christopher Eccleston ( 2005 ) 10 .
David Tennant ( 2005 - 2010 ) 11 . Matt Smith ( 2010 - ? )
" It was abundantly clear that he had that ' Doctor - ness ' about him , " he said .
" You are either the Doctor or you are not .
It 's just the beginning of the journey for Matt .
" With Steven Moffat 's scripts and the expertise of the production team in Cardiff behind him , there is no one more perfect to be taking the Tardis to exciting new futures when the series returns in 2010 . "
Wenger said a broad range of people had been auditioned , but they had not set out to cast the youngest Doctor .
Smith 's TV debut was in the 2006 adaptation of Philip Pullman 's The Ruby in the Smoke , which starred former Doctor Who companion Billie Piper as Sally Lockhart .
He has also acted opposite Piper in the follow - up , The Shadow in the North , and in ITV2's Secret Diary of a Call Girl .
In 2007 , he had a leading role in BBC Two 's political drama Party Animals , in which he played a parliamentary researcher .
Smith 's stage work has included stints with theatre companies such as the Royal Court and National Theatre .
His West End debut was in Swimming With Sharks opposite Christian Slater .
He was born in Northampton in 1982 and studied drama and creative writing at the University of East Anglia .
Creative team Tennant said in October that he would stand down from the show after filming four special episodes in 2009 .
Tennant is recovering from back surgery ahead of filming in 2009
The star is due to begin shooting the first special this month , just weeks after surgery on his back forced him to pull out of a London run of Hamlet .
The last of these special episodes is expected to run in early 2010 .
With a new creative team in place for the 2010 series led by executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger , the casting of the Doctor was the first job to be completed before scripts could be finalised .
Doctor
Who began in 1963 , and seven actors played the Doctor before the show was dropped in 1989 .
After a TV movie in 1996 - starring Paul McGann - the TV series returned in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role .
Tennant took over the same year .

Les Kurdes attaqués dans le nord de la Syrie
There was no water at my grandfather ’s
when I was a kid and would go for it
with two zinc buckets .
Down the path ,
past the cow by the foundation where
the fine people ’s house was before
they arranged to have it burned down .
To the neighbor ’s cool well .
Would
come back with pails too heavy ,
so my mouth pulled out of shape .
I see myself , but from the outside .
I keep trying to feel who I was ,
and cannot .
Hear clearly the sound
the bucket made hitting the sides
of the stone well going down ,
but never the sound of me .
Big males outperform smaller ones in head - to - head mating contests but diminutive males make ten times better lovers because they 're quicker to mature and faster on their feet , a new study of redback spiders reveals .
Published in the current online issue of Journal of Evolutionary Biology , the study shows the importance of maturation in defining mating and paternity success .
In field enclosures , researchers simulated two competitive contexts favouring the development of differently sized male redbacks ( Latrodectus hasselti ) .
The larger males were more successful at mating with and impregnating females when they competed directly with smaller males .
However , when faster maturing smaller males were given a one - day head start , reflecting their earlier maturation in nature , they had a ten - times higher paternity rate than larger males .
Courtship between redbacks lasts an average of 50 minutes when males are competing and 4.5 hours for single , non-competing males .
Copulation lasts from 6 to 31 minutes , and males are usually injured or killed during the process .
" The results reveal that big males do n't get it all their own way , " says lead author , UNSW postdoctoral fellow , Dr Michael Kasumovic , who co-authored the paper with Maydianne Andrade of the University of Toronto .
" Nature favours larger and smaller males under different circumstances .
Larger males experienced a longer maturation process so they are unable to search for and mate with females and produce offspring at the same rate as smaller redback spiders .
" Large size and weaponry are strong predictors of a male 's competitive strengths because those traits help them dominate smaller males when they compete for food and mating rights .
However , evidence from studies of midges , dung flies and seed beetles reveals that smaller males develop sooner than larger males and often mate before larger competing males arrive on the scene .
Size is n't the only ruler by which we can measure a male 's quality .
Many other factors , including maturation time , are critical in that definition . "

The current buzz suggests , however , that policy makers are n’t willing to take either of these approaches .
Instead , they ’re reportedly gravitating toward a compromise approach : moving toxic waste from private banks ’ balance sheets to a publicly owned “ bad bank ” or “ aggregator bank ” that would resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation , but without seizing the banks first .
Sheila Bair , the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , recently tried to describe how this would work : “ The aggregator bank would buy the assets at fair value . ”
But what does “ fair value ” mean ?
In my example , Gothamgroup is insolvent because the alleged $ 400 billion of toxic waste on its books is actually worth only $ 200 billion .
The only way a government purchase of that toxic waste can make Gotham solvent again is if the government pays much more than private buyers are willing to offer .
Now , maybe private buyers are n’t willing to pay what toxic waste is really worth : “ We do n’t have really any rational pricing right now for some of these asset categories , ” Ms. Bair says .
But should the government be in the business of declaring that it knows better than the market what assets are worth ?
And is it really likely that paying “ fair value , ” whatever that means , would be enough to make Gotham solvent again ?
What I suspect is that policy makers  possibly without realizing it  are gearing up to attempt a bait - and - switch : a policy that looks like the cleanup of the savings and loans , but in practice amounts to making huge gifts to bank shareholders at taxpayer expense , disguised as “ fair value ” purchases of toxic assets .
Why go through these contortions ?
The answer seems to be that Washington remains deathly afraid of the N - word  nationalization .
The truth is that Gothamgroup and its sister institutions are already wards of the state , utterly dependent on taxpayer support ; but nobody wants to recognize that fact and implement the obvious solution : an explicit , though temporary , government takeover .
Hence the popularity of the new voodoo , which claims , as I said , that elaborate financial rituals can reanimate dead banks .
Unfortunately , the price of this retreat into superstition may be high .
I hope I ’m wrong , but I suspect that taxpayers are about to get another raw deal  and that we ’re about to get another financial rescue plan that fails to do the job .
What Are the Advantages of Python Over Other Languages ?
If you ’re considering learning a programming language for the first time , you might be struggling to figure out which one is the best one to commit to .
With programming knowledge now being an essential prerequisite for entry into broad swathes of the job market , making the right choice is crucial .
Fortunately , there is a pretty strong consensus that Python is the best language to learn .
The advantages of Python are numerous and can be applied to all types of learners .
Read this guide to learn Python ’s strengths over other types of programming languages .
1. It ’s Very Widespread Across Industries
One of the major benefits of Python programming is that it ’s arguably the most widespread language among major companies .
Disney , NASA , Spotify , Instagram , Apple , Google , and Dropbox are just a few of the major companies that now operate in a Python environment .
If you ’re learning programming to advance your career , Python will open the most doors .
2 . It ’s Open - Source and Free to Learn
Rather than seeking to extract as much profit from the language as possible , the creator of Python , Guido van Rossum , committed to ensuring that it would be open - source forever .
This means that it is free to access and free to learn for anyone who wishes to pick it up .
Would - be Python masters can also benefit from totally free resources , like Be A Python Developer , to go from rookie to pro in no time .
3 . It ’s the Simplest Language
Compared to more code - dense , convoluted programming languages like C++ and Java , Python is one of the most simple coding languages in existence .
One of the major advantages of Python programming language learning is that you can learn how to execute essential functions with much less code .
For example , a command that might take 7 or 8 lines of code to complete in C++ will almost always require just two or three lines of code in Python .
4 . It ’s Ideal for Productivity and Speed
One of the Python benefits for career coders is that it ’s incredibly object - oriented .
This means that it ’s designed to allow for perfectly functional code to be created in no time at all .
It has high readability , utilizes fewer resources than other languages , and has a huge number of built - in functions that enhance its potential .
This is why so many of the world ’s biggest tech companies prefer Python .
5. Its Long - Term Growth is Assured
If you ’re going to commit to learning an entire programming language from scratch , you probably want to know that it will remain useful long into the future .
With Python , you can rest easy .
It has been widely predicted that Python will soon become the number one most widely - used programming language in the world , a position that will grow stronger in the years and decades ahead .
With those Python benefits in mind , you ’d be foolish not to learn it .

If you have a kitten around , you know you can crumple a sheet of paper into a ball , toss it on the floor , and the kitten will go nuts — pouncing on the ball , batting it around , chasing it , tossing it up in the air .
Even older cats exhibit similar behavior unless they 've grown too fat and lazy and jaded .
The kitten 's actions seem like play , but we all know that it 's pure instinct .
Something about the crumpled sheet of paper triggers the mouse - catching reflexes in the cat 's brain .
Cats have been eating small rodents for millennia .
Their skill at catching mice has been honed through the process of natural selection , and to some degree , artificial selection , as cats have been domesticated by humans to eliminate mice around the home and farm .
The instinct for catching mice is part of the neural raw material passed on from cat to kitten through the generations .
Although we humans recognize instinct when we see it in animals , often we 're reluctant to see it in ourselves .
We prefer to rest assured that we are above all that .
We are not slaves to primitive impulses .
Our free - willed choices are the result of careful rational deliberation .
Yet , the human race has been subjected to the same evolutionary pressures as other animals , so the lack of instinct in humans would truly be odd .
It is much more likely that the process of evolution — in both natural selection and sexual selection as described by Charles Darwin — has molded our brains with particular strengths , weakness , and proclivities .
Let 's call these traits " human nature . "
The attempt to analyze the effect of evolution on human nature is known as evolutionary psychology , a field of study sometimes maligned ( and even sometimes rightfully so ) for the construction of " just so " stories that explain facets of human nature without any real proof .
Yet , the existence of universal and cross-cultural patterns in human behavior is just too pervasive to ignore .
Rather than providing scientific standards of proof , evolutionary psychology seems more useful as a tool for offering us hints and possibilities that help us understand ourselves .
Let 's look at art , for instance , and by art let 's include not only painting and sculpture , but spoken and written literature , staged narrative , music , dance , and more modern manifestations such as film , and let 's include other cultures of all sorts whenever they create artifacts or performances that are imbued with an open - ended imagination that goes beyond craft or engineering .
To some biologists with a particular interest in evolution — the late Stephen Jay Gould , for example , — art is inconsequential to human survival and procreation , and hence cannot be explained by evolution .
Art is one of the inexplicable byproducts of the large human brain , a spandrel of evolution , as Gould called them .
Denis Dutton — founder of the journal Philosophy and Literature , founder of the web site Arts & Letters Daily , and professor of the philosophy of art at the University of Canterbury ( New Zealand ) — thinks differently .
His ambitious book The Art Instinct : Beauty , Pleasure , and Human Evolution ( Bloomsbury Press , 2009 ) is a wonderful introduction to the field of Darwinian aesthetics , and if the title is reminiscent of Steven Pinker 's The Language Instinct ( 1994 ) , that is very deliberate .
Too often , Dutton says , modern philosophers and critics begin developing a theory of art that must encompass the really hard cases , such as the " ready - mades " of Marcel Duchamp and John Cage 's 4'33 " .
The inclusion of these works in their theory tends to lead them far astray , for they arrive at a conclusion that art is socially constructed and culture specific .
In constrast to this approach , Dutton begins with much easier examples .
What is the type of painting preferred by most people around the globe ?
It is , of course , the landscape , and a very particular landscape — one with water , food sources , trees , hiding places , and a path to perhaps another source of food or comfort .
It is , in short , the savanna , the home of our Pleistocene ancestors during the period in which we became recognizably human .
Our preference for this environment is wired into our brains for " savannas contain more protein per square mile than any other landscape type " ( p. 19 - 20 ) as well as offering protection from predators ( quick — up the tree ) .
But most of Dutton 's argument does n't focus on painting .
Using Steven Pinker 's work as a springboard , Dutton is much more interested in how art evolved from language .
To humans , the language ability is innate , even if the particular language a child first learns is cultural .
Seemingly equally innate is the ability of children for make - believe , to construct worlds that mix fantasy ( invisible teapot and teacups ) with the real ( tea always pours down , not up ) , and to keep the rules of these worlds separate and distinct .
Also innate to most children ( beginning at the age of 2 or so ) is theory of mind — the ability to recognize that other people have internal lives similar to our own , but at the same times uniquely theirs .
Consequently , perhaps the oldest art form is storytelling :
What began undoubtedly with stories told around the campfire led eventually to more elaborate spoken narratives of legends , written narratives ( the Iliad and Odyssey ) , plays , novels , film , and ( much more recently ) narrative - based videogames .
What 's crucial is that these narratives ( either historical , or partly historical , or purely fictional ) help us survive .
Stories give our brains an opportunity to work out contingencies of response to possible future events .
( If a kitten jumps at everything that moves , it is better able to pounce on a real mouse when one shows up . )
If we come upon a situation similar to one we once heard about in a story , we are much more likely to deal successfully with that situation and survive to pass on the " storytelling genes . "
Stories also provide examples of many kinds of people and how their minds work , and hence help us deal with others in social situations .
Imaginative storytelling is one of the survival instincts that is packaged into human intelligence .
Yet , real - life human languages are much more elaborate than what 's needed for these stories or day - to - day communication .
People can get by with fewer than a thousand words , so why do human vocabularies commonly encompass tens of thousands of words ?
Our languages have so many words that we need special books to tell us what they mean , and other books that list words that mean roughly the same .
All these words seem as wasteful of natural resources as — well , as wasteful as the colorful tail feathers on a peacock 's tail .
And certainly that comparison gives us a clue :
The extravagance of language , Dutton contends , is a manifestation of the other half of Darwin 's analysis of evolution : sexual selection .
Humans choose mates partially based on physical appearance ( which is a rough indication of health ) but also intelligence , and a good indication of intelligence is a facility with language .
Darwin realized in The Descent of Man that the human mind is a sexual ornament , and language is how that mind shows off its colorful feathers .
Vocabulary is but one aspect of language that gives us a view into another human mind : grammar , syntax , word choice , appropriateness , coherence , relevance , speed of response , wit , rhythm , ability to toy with words , and originality all play a part .
Taken together , these skills and qualities of mind constitute eloquence , and the admiration of eloquence is solidly on the list of human universals .
This shows itself in a cross-cultural approval of the capacity to speak well publicly , but it is also critical tin the most intimate context of courtship .
( p. 148 )
That poetry and song arose out of courtship is obvious , for the subject of love remains to the present day easily the # 1 topic of poems and songs .
The result has been " survival not just of the physically strongest but of the cleverest , wittiest , and wisest . " ( p. 163 )
Throughout The Art Instinct , Dutton is careful .
He has a very good understanding of Darwinian evolution and well knows the pitfalls of evolutionary psychology .
Pinker is justified in his doubts about trying to validate the arts , to make them seem even more deep or important , by inventing adaptive stories about them .
However , no validation in either direction is required : what evolutionary aesthetics asks for is to reverse - engineer our present tastes — beginning with those that appear to be spontaneous and universal — in order to understand where they came from .
It is as legitimate to do this with the arts as we experience them today as it is with sex or food .
( p. 101 )
Only late in the book does Dutton return to tackle the hard cases in the chapter " Intention , Forgery , Dada : Three Aesthetic Problems " and even applies his definition of art ( expressed as a set of cluster criteria in Chapter 3 ) to Marcel Duchamp 's notorious sculpture Fountain ( 1917 ) .
He concludes that Fountain is , indeed , a work of art , although he certainly does n't extrapolate that conclusion into more recent dadaesque works .
To me , however , Dutton 's whole argument is crowned with his discussion of the anger we feel upon learning that we 've been taken in by art forgeries , whether they be the fake Vermeers of Han van Meegeren , or the doctored recordings of other pianists repackaged as the performances of Joyce Hatto .
In a sense , it should n't make a difference who created a work and who is credited with it .
Yet ....
Creative arts inexhaustibly give us ways of looking into human souls and thus expand our own outlook and understanding ....
Authenticity , which in the arts means at the most profound communion with another human soul , is something we are destined by evolution to want from literature , music , painting , and the other arts .
This sense of communion exhilarates and elevates the spirit ....
I believe that this intense interest in art as emotional expression derives from wanting to see through art into another human personality : it springs from a desire for knowledge of another person .
( p. 192-3 , 235 )
Inauthenticity in art thus becomes an extremely serious transgression to those who were fooled , but amusing to those who were not .
The Art Instinct is well - structured , well - written , and quite persuasive in presenting " one long argument " that art is an inevitably intrinsic part of human nature , human intelligence , and ( no one should be surprised ) human sexuality .
Campbell 's Soup Company 's ad featuring lesbian couple , son
Despite being pressured by traditional family advocates to stop , Campbell 's Soup Company , maker of Swanson 's brand broth , has vowed to continue spending its advertising dollars in pro-homosexual publications .
As WND reported earlier , the American Family Association objected to a Swanson 's broth magazine ad that depicts a lesbian couple and their son .
The ad was placed in the December 2008 and January 2009 issues of The Advocate , a magazine that touts itself with the line , " For 40 years , setting the standard in LGBT journalism . "
Campbell 's Soup , however , has brushed off the AFA 's complaint .
MediaDailyNews quoted a company spokesperson explaining , " Inclusion and diversity play an important role in our business , and that fact is reflected in our marketing plan . "

According to a Campbell 's representative , " Our plans for the Swanson brand include additional placements in The Advocate . "
The AFA , however , objects to the ad , particularly the frame that depicts the lesbian couple and their son with the words , " This holiday season , serve a special meal no matter the size and structure of your family . "
" Not only did the ads cost Campbell 's a chunk of money , " writes AFA Chairman Donald Wildmon in an email alert , " but they also sent a message that homosexual parents constitute a family and are worthy of support . "
Wildmon is seeking people who will contact the soup company and ask Campbell 's to " stop supporting the gay agenda . "
A spokesperson for Campbell 's , however , explained that the advertisements are simply an attempt to reach a wide audience .
" Campbell 's has been in business since 1869 , " spokesperson Anthony Sanzio told WND .
" For more than century people from all walks of life have enjoyed our products .
We will continue to try to appeal to all people in ways that are meaningful and relevant to them . "
Last year , WND reported on a list of 259 U.S. businesses recognized for maintaining policies beneficial to homosexuals by the Human Rights Campaign , a group that described itself as " America 's largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality . "
Campbell 's Soup Company made the list of businesses .
RELATED : ' Gays ' fume over image used to push same - sex marriage ban
WND also reported recently on soft drink giant , PepsiCo , who not only made the HRC list , but also maintains a highly visible presence at various " gay " pride parades , has produced a handful of commercials toying with homosexuality , boasted beating rival Diet Coke to be first in marketing to the " gay " market and contributed $ 500,000 to the Straight for Equality program run by Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays , or PFLAG .
The AFA , as it has with Campbell 's Soup , has requested supporters contact PepsiCo and ask the company to cease advocating homosexuality .
" PepsiCo has refused a request by AFA to remain neutral in the culture war , " writes Wildmon in an e-mail alert .
" The company indicated that it will continue major financial support of homosexual organizations . "
The long - feared Viacom pre-post holiday layoffs are here , and they 're not pretty .
We heard earlier that as many as 300 layoffs might be coming at MTV today , but the total , Viacom - wide numbers are even worse : 850 people are being cut , about 7 % of the company 's global staff .
And top management is " suspending salary increases " next year , if it makes you peons feel any better .
The full internal memo that went out this morning is after the jump ; if you know more about the specific breakdown of the layoffs , email us .
UPDATES : additional memos from MTV and Paramount added below :
Dear Colleagues :
With less than a month until the close of 2008 , our entire organization continues to do everything possible to anticipate and adapt to the unprecedented changes affecting all our businesses .
We know it has n't been easy and we could n't be more proud or more appreciative of how you have risen to the challenge .
Even in these tough economic times , Viacom has a strong hand to play .
We have a broad stable of outstanding brands , diverse revenue streams and an impressive global footprint , backed up by exceptional financial strength .
Added to that we have talented employees , extremely able leaders and a creative ingenuity that runs deep .
Unfortunately , our advantages and best efforts can't completely protect Viacom from the very serious and broad - based challenges of this economic recession .
Viacom 's long - term health will depend on our shared commitment to adapt , to innovate and to make difficult choices .
To compete and thrive , we need to create an organization and a cost structure that are in step with the evolving economic environment .
Today , we are announcing a company - wide restructuring plan that includes staffing reductions in all divisions .
This will result in a reduction of our worldwide workforce of approximately 7 percent , or about 850 positions .
We are also suspending salary increases for the Company 's senior level management in 2009 .
In addition , after a comprehensive review of our operations , we will write down certain programming and other assets .
These three actions will bring us significant cost savings and other efficiencies .
Top managers at every part of the company worked thoughtfully , carefully and compassionately to create a leaner , more focused organization .
It was not an easy task , but it was an essential step that will keep Viacom at the competitive forefront today and tomorrow .
Department heads and supervisors will provide you with more information about the changes that will be taking place in your division .
Saying goodbye to friends and colleagues is always difficult , particularly when we have shared so much .
Those of you who will be leaving should be proud of your contributions , which we will always respect and appreciate .
We thank you and we wish you the best .
The true measure of an organization is how it deals with change and overcomes challenges .
We know that you are up to the task and that together we will push through the difficulties ahead and go on to even greater achievements .
We truly appreciate your continued commitment and hard work and we thank you for everything you do each day .
Sincerely , Philippe and Tom
From MTV's Judy McGrath to employees :
I 'm sure you 've read Philippe and Tom 's note , and I want to talk to
you about what it means for MTV Networks – today and in the context of
our overall mission and strategy going forward .
We all know there 's a fundamental restructuring of our entire economy
going on , and it extends beyond our borders .
This is not just about
MTVN , Viacom or even sister media companies – it's happening in every
industry , all over the world .
This does n't make it easier to say
goodbye to people we love and respect , but it is the hard truth .
In
these tough times , we are responsible for sustaining and reinventing
our company as thoughtfully as we can .
The changes we 're making today
are necessary , difficult , and the responsible way for us to move
forward .
Here in the U.S. , we 're consolidating some groups , centralizing
functions and outsourcing others , and aligning our resources across
brands and platforms .
Specific details of the changes and how they
affect you and your group will be communicated by your department
heads today .
Our International organization continues to implement a
new approach to structure and operations , which has been underway
throughout the year .
Further moves will be outlined by the leadership
of each MTVNI region .
Change like this is so tough , to say the least .
But we must accept
that we operate today in a state of constant evolution , constant
change .
We believe the next chapter for each of us will be all about new
possibilities , creativity and invention .
This is where our
opportunity lies .
We can use this moment of global transformation to
reassert our capacity to innovate , to inspire through creative and
business excellence , to connect with our audience as powerfully as
ever .
We will be a leaner organization , but we will always be
champions of new ideas , champions of all of our customers and brands ,
and leaders in new ways of doing business .
Everyone here contributes to MTVN and Viacom every single day and
night without exception .
We hate to see dedicated friends and
co-workers leave us , and we say goodbye with care , gratitude , support
and respect .
Thank you all for your continued commitment to MTV Networks .

We Improved Our On Site Search
Because our store is pretty small and our hierarchy of products do not go very deep , I never really devoted many cycles towards our internal on - site search engine .
Once someone found us via Google , Yahoo etc… , I did n’t think that customers actually used the ‘ search ’ feature on our website much at all .
But once I started paying attention to our on - site web analytics , the data indicated otherwise .
It turns out that about a third of our visitors use our product search bar at some point during their visit .
And the huge stat that stood out to me was that almost 70 % of visitors leave immediately after executing a single search query .
In fact , our search results page was one of the top exit pages on our shop !
While this exit percentage initially seemed a bit high , I never really thought much of it .
Why ?
Because we get a ton of random search visitors from the web , I assumed that most of them were simply looking for products that we did n’t carry .
In any case , I had some free time one day so I decided to investigate this a little bit further .
And by manually typing in the same exact customer queries I was seeing on the site , I discovered that most of these searches returned 0 results when they should have returned relevant products !
Was our search busted all of this time ?
I tried other searches to make sure but strangely enough , the searches that I entered were always successful .
Why were the customer searches busted and not mine ?
The answer turned out to be very simple .
A long time ago when our server was under powered , I limited the scope of our search in order to reduce CPU usage .
Essentially , I nerfed our search so that it only searched the product titles and not the descriptions .
Therefore , searches for “ Mother of the Bride ” or “ Father of the Bride ” returned no matches .
As soon as I switched the search to include all of the product descriptions , the exit rate for all of our searches went way down .
Anyway , once I went down the search rabbit hole , I decided to do a major overhaul of our entire onsite search engine .
While the details of my improvements are beyond the scope of this article , you can see exactly what I did by checking out my post on On Site Search Mistakes That Are Killing 30 % Of Your Sales ( And How To Fix Them )

We Made Mobile Checkout Easier
If your online store website is anything like mine , chances are that your mobile traffic is probably increasing exponentially every year while your desktop traffic remains flat .
More and more customers are making transactions on their tiny little mobile phones but the main hurdle to generating mobile sales is that it ’s a pain in the butt to checkout .
Not only does a customer have to enter in their name and address on a tiny little on screen keyboard , but then they have to dig deep into their wallets for a credit card and type in the numbers .
What a pain !
The single most important conversion tweak that you can make to your site is to allow checkout with the least amount of typing possible .
For example , we recently implemented Paypal One Touch which was a major contributor to our increase in mobile conversions this past year .
Note :
You can read more about it in my post on How An Easy Tweak Boosted Mobile And Tablet Conversion Rates By 31 %
Going forward , I see services like Apple Pay and Android Pay becoming more and more essential because they already have all of your information stored in the cloud and you do n’t have to type in anything .
Going forward , you should expect Facebook to make major strides in ecommerce as well .
Bottom line , if you are not reducing checkout friction on your mobile site , you MUST do so as soon as you can .
Here are other posts that I ’ve written on the topic .
We Implemented The Turner Technique
Email continues to be a huge contributor to sales for both my online store and my blog .
And as I mentioned in my last income report , email brought in over 21 % of my sales for my ecommerce store last year .
For MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , email continues to bring in over 90 % of my revenues .
In fact , I can tell you exactly how much every email subscriber is worth !
Because email is so important , I spend a lot of time trying to tweak my email opt - in rates .
Now I ’ve tried many things over the years from popups to slideins to static forms , but the Turner Technique has been by far the most effective tweak that I ’ve ever made to an email signup form ever .
What exactly is the Turner Technique ?
It is a strategy that my friend Brandon Turner taught me that doubled my signups almost immediately .

We Removed Guest Checkout
For some strange reason , every single shopping cart that I ’ve ever seen provides the ability for a visitor to create an account during checkout .
Some carts ask a customer to decide whether they want to create an account up front on the first screen while others like Shopify are much more subtle and ask for a password during checkout .
In theory , creating an account is a good thing .
It allows a customer to avoid having to type in their information on a subsequent visit to streamline the checkout process .
But in reality , it causes nothing but headaches and confusion .
First off , very few people want to “ create an account ” .
Creating an account implies that you are saving their information ( which you are ) for future marketing opportunities and most people are reluctant to do so .
Second of all , people who actually want to create an account often forget their passwords which creates extra friction during the checkout process .
Before we eliminated “ accounts ” , we were getting several phone calls a week from customers who forgot their passwords , could n’t figure out how to reset them and wanted to checkout over the phone as a result .
Now if we ’re getting 3 - 4 phone calls a week about this , I ’m betting that there are 10X more people out there who do n’t call in and bail as a result .
Once we eliminated accounts , all of these phone calls stopped .
Here ’s the thing .
Outside of our wedding planner and hotel clients who buy from us regularly , very few of our customers actually need an account .
The advantage of account creation is further mitigated by services like Paypal One Touch that already store a customers ’ address and payment info .
For our B2B clients who actually need accounts , we manually create them and send them an easy to remember password .
Anyway
If you have n’t done so already , you may want to consider removing account creation from your shop entirely as it will reduce your support load .
We Added A Pull In Item
I actually got this tip from a sales book that I read so I take no credit for this idea .
In a nutshell , the basic concept is to include a popular product in your lineup at a very attractive price .
Customers will be drawn in by this one item and then you can cross sell them additional items on their way to checkout .
In all of our major product categories , we started inserting one item at rock bottom prices .
We found that while some customers just purchased the cheap items and then left , the majority of them ended up buying other products at higher margins .
Sure , we do n’t make much profit on these draw in items but we found that our overall order size increased significantly .
I think this tactic works because psychologically the customers feel as though he / she can buy more because they are getting such a good deal on something else .
We Added A Flexible Return Policy
When my wife and I first considered adding a flexible return policy , I thought to myself , “ Why would I ever want to deal with people wanting to make returns ? ”
But just as an experiment , we decided to give it shot .
Who would ’ve guessed that adding a return policy would actually make customers want to buy more ?
The increase in order size was the most evident when taking customer orders over the phone .
Customer :
We need to get some cocktail napkins for our engagement party but we are n’t exactly sure how many people are coming .
I do n’t want to buy too many or too little .
Me : Do n’t worry about it .
Just buy as many napkins as you need assuming everyone comes and then return what ever you do n’t use !
Customer :
That ’s a great idea !
90 % of the time , the returns are never sent back to us .
I think that customers just want the security of being able to return something but rarely do they actually act on it .
Especially if you sell quality products , you have nothing to fear in accepting returns .
We Added Shipping Incentives
The final thing we did was add shipping incentives for large orders .
For all orders over 100 dollars , we started offering free ground shipping anywhere !
Early on , I was skeptical of this tactic , but sure enough we started getting orders for just over 100 dollars .
When I observed the shopping patterns of random customers , I would sometimes find them hunting around the site for just one more item to put them over the edge .
The simplest way to increase your sales is by placing the free shipping threshold 15 - 20 % above your average order size .
Find Out What Works Best For You
The key to finding the right tweaks to make to your business is to experiment and analyze the effect on your top line .
But this can only be done if you instrument your website so that accurate statistics can be recorded .
Not every sales strategy will work for everyone , and sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to get things right .
The above 4 tweaks took very little time to implement and made a drastic impact on our sales .

Rather than make a prediction , I would like to address the rampant moral confusion regarding the Israel - Hamas war .
Here is something from an email sent out by Isaac Luria of J Street , a left - wing Jewish group that claims to be pro-Israel , but also reflects a lot of thinking by journalists and well - meaning people :
The equation of the actions of Hamas and Israel is disgusting .
But take Jews and Israel out of it .
Imagine terrorist group A attacking country B , where A is trying to maximize civilian casualties on both sides and B is trying to minimize civilian casualties on both sides .
What sort of moral judgment would have trouble distinguishing between the two ?
The Palestinian victims of this war know better .
Watch this video , broadcast on Palestinian TV , no less , of a girl whose 4 - year - old sister died next to her in their home .
She says , " Hamas is the cause , in the first place , of all wars . "
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said he pleaded with Hamas " do n't stop the ceasefire , the ceasefire must continue and not stop , in order to avoid what has happened , and if only we had avoided it . "
Hamas openly justifies using women and children as human shields , and is likely at this moment hiding and shooting at Israelis from hospitals and mosques .
By taking on Hamas , Israelis deserve the gratitude of decent people everywhere .
More than that , by sending in troops to fight them on the ground , Israel is risking its precious soldiers to minimize Palestinian casualties .
These soldiers risk becoming martyrs to human rights and the Geneva Convention because they are fighting in places where other countries , including the U.S. , might have called in an artillery or air strike and been done with it .
We should be proud of them and least have the decency to honor their sacrifice .
Finally , these soldiers are doing a service for humanity , not just for the Israelis .
A defeat of Hamas is a defeat of it sponsor , Iran .
It is no substitute for using economic , diplomatic , and - only if necessary - military means to prevent Iran , the world 's primary terrorist regime , from going nuclear .
But it should help concentrate minds regarding the necessity of doing so .
The Israeli wars with Hamas and Hezbullah are only holding actions .
The only way to give peace in the region real hope is to defeat the main source of war and terrorism , and that is the regime in Tehran .
Every Friday we post some awesome free fonts on our Friday Free Fonts , but what if we can get a new serif font on a Tuesday ?
For today 's post I want to share a really cool font created by Florian Klauer , an art director from Bielefeld , Germany .
I asked a bunch of designers what they thought needed to change in CSS .
Wolfgang Bartelme
I ’d love to see cross - browser support for gradients , shadows , opacity masks and rounded corners .
I guess that would not just dramatically reduce bandwidth , but also speed up production and customization .
Jon Hicks

I would love a different box model !
I find it bizarre that padding and border add the width of an object , and would love to be able to give something like a textarea 100 % width and 3px padding without worrying what it ’s going to do the layout .
Perhaps something like padding - inside as a new selector ?
In that vain I also wish I could specify a 100 % width for an element , minus a set fixed width .
Again , very useful when creating fluid designs with form elements !

Most of the stuff I want is in CSS3 , so what I actually want is the core modules finished and implemented fully by at least two browser vendors .
David Walsh
I think that the lack of font abilities that we ’ve been living with is a sin .
Our other options for using non-standard web fonts , sIFR and utilizing images , are painful and have really held the creativity of the web back .
I also believe that standard corner - rounding properties must be added — we ’re all tired of creating rounded - corner images and browser - specific hacks to achieve our goals .
Lastly , I wish CSS would be implemented in browsers faster .
We ’ve had little advancement in the past few years .

The biggest problem I have with my CSS is that with large sites it gets very unwieldy .
On a site like FlashDen the CSS goes on for miles , and then I have a second set of sheets to apply to change all the styles for people visiting alternate versions of the site ( ThemeForest or AudioJungle ) .
Even with the best intentions , it ’s pretty messy .
I wish that I could have an inheritance concept in CSS like you have in object oriented programming .
So you could go : . button { /* some styles */ } .button >> .sidebar_button { /* inherits all of .button and adds new styles */ } I know that currently I could just define it like this : .button , .sidebar_button { /* some styles */ } .sidebar_button { /* inherits all of .button and adds new styles */ }
But somehow that does n’t seem like an elegant way to do things .
And if the first and second definitions happen to be separated by a large block of other CSS code , when you come back to read your CSS later , there is no way for you to know that .sidebar_button has some more styles attached to it .
Whereas the inheritance version above , you can read that it ’s a derivative of .button .
Keith Robinson
I wish CSS could handle embedded fonts in the manner we use sIFR now ,
Shaun Inman
Here ’s the thing , one more half - baked , tacked - on stopgap is n’t going to improve CSS in any meaningful way–it would only compound a fundamental flaw in its design .
CSS feels like a style sheet implementation you ’d find in a late 90 ’s desktop publishing app .
It ’s still very text - centric .
Style sheets just were n’t designed for creating complex layouts .
CSS ’s layout features are tacked on–and 10 years later it definitely shows .
I ’d love to see the CSS Text Module rewritten by experienced typographers and typesetters and the CSS Layout Module rewritten by experienced publication designers , both traditional and newfangled .
And sometime before 2022 if at all possible .
Jeffrey Jordan Way
I wish we could assign variables in our stylesheets .
For example , it would be nice if , rather than having to scroll to the top of my document every time I needed to grab the hex value for my chosen “ blue ” , I could simply assign that value to a variable called “ myBlue ” .
var myBlue = # 191955 ; # someElement{ color : myBlue ; }
This is a topic that has been debated to death , and truthfully , it might prove to be a bad idea .
I ’m still not sure .
I could swing either way in such a discussion .
Once you open that door , you sort of lose the whole concept of CSS .
But , I think if done responsibly , variable assigning could potentially save us a great deal of time when designing .
Steven Vandelay
One of the great things about working with CSS is that there ’s usually different ways to approach something that you ’re trying to accomplish , but in some ways I would like to see more standardization when it comes to layouts .
Andy Clarke
Well , aside from the obvious ( making sure that Obama gets elected , making me very rich and making me a cup of nice tea ) what I would like most from CSS are better layout tools to allow me to create rich , intricate designs without the need to add presentational elements into my markup .
The CSS Working Group ( of which I am a former member ) have been working hard on these layout tools .
I hope that before too long we will see the browser makers implementing these proposals ( using - browser - extensions ) so that designers and developers can experiment with them .

Multiple Backgrounds , Rounded Corners , Border Images and Opacity are my first thoughts when asked what I wish CSS could do , then I remember – these are all in the pipeline for CSS3 !
In this case , my dreams are coming true in terms of CSS , which makes the question ;
Is there anything you wish Browsers could do ?!
One CSS technique I wish there was a shorter technique for would be to easily make a two or three column layout with equal height sidebars without the use of the faux column method .

I ’d like to see conditionals natively supported in CSS without the need for workarounds such as ( the excellent ) Conditional - CSS .
Many people argue that browser detection is essentially something that should be handled outside of a stylesheet , but all of the HTML - based conditional comments I use to handle IE - specific code is entirely to call in ‘ hack ’ CSS files .
The implementation of code along the lines of what we use to target Gecko- or WebKit - based browsers would be a hugely welcome addition for me .
Nick La
I wish CSS could do layer styles like Photoshop where you can add : inner shadow , outer glow , bevel effects , etc .
It would be even better if we could have layer blending mode .
Jesse Bennett - Chamberlain Designer at 31 Three
The only thing that comes to mind would be variables .
I do n’t get my hands too dirty with code very much any more , but variables would be quite handy for when I do .
Ask me what I would like Photoshop to do and I could give you a much longer answer :)
Volkan Görgülü
I wish instead of writing # sample h1 , # sample h2 , # sample h3 —> ( long and ugly ) something like this #sample [ h1 , h2 , h3 ] —> ( short and clean ) would do the job :)
Another example can be #sample a : link , # sample a : visited # sample a [ link , visited ]
Veerle Pieters
I wish CSS had support for gradient borders and easier usage for transparency , like in InDesign or Quark for example .
Applicable on every possible object , text etc .
Easier and more logical way of floating elements .
Lastly that we do n’t have to wait on CSS 3 for another 5 years .
I also wish that CSS would get mad and punish if some browsers do n’t behave :)
Jonathan Snook
I ’d love to see consistent implementations across all major browsers for CSS3 features like multiple backgrounds , border - radius , and border - image .
CSS Transforms would be handy , too .
They might seem gimmicky but there are plenty of practical reasons for it like long headers names for narrow columns in a data table .
Being able to rotate elements would improve the design while maintaining accessibility ( and avoiding have to resort to images ) .
The landscape in 5 years will , I believe , offer us plenty of functionality we do n’t enjoy now .

Strong grid - based layout .
We still do n’t have it , and it ’s needed .
At this point I honestly do n’t care if it ’s accomplished through CSS or some other new language .
Cameron Moll
First and foremost , I ’d like CSS to answer my email .
Second , I ’d like CSS to convince browser developers to cooperatively and incrementally include “ future ” CSS features and proposals today , rather than waiting for a full spec to be “ officially ” released .
Wishful thinking ?
Perhaps , though I anticipate the first may happen before the second .
Dan Rubin
User Experience Director at Sidebar Creative , Home
I ’d love to see the W3C bring in a proper typographer and book designer to help craft the type and layout parts of the specification .
Someone like Robert Bringhurst would be ideal , as both an expert typographer and book designer , so the specification would be created with designers ’ needs in mind , rather than by programmers .
In a feature - specific way , I would hope this results in much better typographic control , and a web equivalent to “ master pages ” , which are an old standard in print design software .

Outside the holy grail of creating equal height columns without using a faux method ( while still supporting browsers like IE6 and IE7 ) , I ’d love to see a way to set background positioning from the bottom or right side of an element .
No , I do n’t mean setting them all the way to the bottom or right , of course we can do that now .
I mean setting a background image that ’s not quite at the bottom or right and remains a specific value away from it .
It ’s not possible to accurately determine the height of elements containing text , so setting the background image 350 px from the top will give wildly variable results in relation to the bottom of the element .
Having a reliable way to set a background image 20 px from the bottom without adding a non-semantic wrapper , could in some circumstances be very helpful .
Some great ideas from the comments :
Oil pressed from oregano leaves that contain the active ingredient carvacrol may be an effective treatment against sometimes drug - resistant bacterial infection .
Georgetown University researchers have found that oil of oregano appears to reduce infection “ as effectively as traditional antibiotics . ”
Oil of oregano at relatively low doses was found to be efficacious against Staphylococcus bacteria and was comparable in its germ - killing properties to antibiotic drugs such as streptomycin , pencillin and vancomycin .
[ Science Daily 10/11/2001 ]
The findings were presented by Harry G. Preuss , MD , professor of physicology and biophysics , Georgetown University , at the American College of Nutrition ’a annual meeting in Orlando , Florida .
The oregano oil was obtained from North American Herb and Spice Company , a Waukeegan , Illinois company that sponsored the study and markets their non-prescription products in retail stores un the trade names Oregamax and Oregacyn .
Earlier this year researchers at the Department of Food Science at the University of Tennessee reported that , among various plant oils , oil of oregano exhibited the greatest antibacterial action against common pathogenic germs such as Staph , E. coli and Listeria .
[ Journal Food Protection , Volume 64 , July 2001 ]
Last year British researchers reported oregano oil had antibacterial activity against 25 different bacteria .
[ Journal Applied Microbiology , Volume 88 , February 2000 ]
A clinical study in Italy has shown that oil of oregano can be used to treat intestinal parasites .
[ Phytotherapy Research , Volume 14 , May 2000 ]
The body of positive evidence for oregano oil as a major antibiotic is growing .
Among 52 plant oils tested , oregano was considered to have “ pharmacologic ” action against common bugs such as Candida albicans ( yeast ) , E. coli , Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
[ Journal Applied Microbiology , volume 86 , June 1999 ]
Pseudomonas is a type of germ that is getting more difficult to treat as it has developed strains that are resistant against antibiotic drugs .
Of recent interest are reports showing that carvacrol from oil of oregano kills spores , such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis ( anthrax ) .
[ Archives Microbiology , Volume 174 , October 2000 ; Quarterly Review Biology , Volume 73 , March 1998 ]
Bacillus cereus is considered to be from the same species as Bacillus anthracis ( anthrax ) .
[ Applied Environmental Microbiology , Volume 66 , June 2000 ]
In tests of antibiotics and antiseptics , Bacillus cereus is often used in studies in lieu of the anthrax strain .
[ University of Michigan News & Information Service , Sept. 23 , 1998 ]
Oil of oregano is not to be confused with common oregano in the kitchen spice cupboard , which is usually marjoram ( Origanum majorana or O. vulgare ) rather than true oregano ( Origanum vulgare ) .
The growing problem of antibiotic resistance has health authorities concerned .
Already various germs are showing resistance to vancomycin , particularly to intestinal bacteria ( Enterococcal species ) among hospitalized patients .
[ Southern Medical Journal , Volume 94 , August 2001 ]
Vancomycin is considered to be the most potent antibiotic available and is withheld from use as a drug of last resort .
Vancomycin costs about $ 16 per pill versus about $ 1 for the purest - strength oregano oil .
Drug resistance does not develop against naturally - occuring antibiotics such as garlic and oil of oregano .

MELBOURNE , Australia --
The Wimbledon final rematch the tennis world has anticipated is now set for Sunday .
But Fernando Verdasco nearly spoiled the party with his own landmark performance .
Top - ranked Rafael Nadal outlasted fellow Spaniard Verdasco 6 - 7 ( 4 ) , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 ( 2 ) , 6 - 7 ( 1 ) , 6 - 4 Friday to reach the Australian Open final after the longest match in the tournament 's history .
Nadal will attempt to keep second - ranked Roger Federer from tying Pete Sampras ' record of 14 major titles on Sunday .
The fans were riveted as the left - handed Davis Cup teammates went at each other for 5 hours and 14 minutes .
After all that , having saved two match points , 14th - seeded Verdasco served a double - fault to give Nadal the victory .
It took more than five hours for Rafael Nadal to overcome Fernando Verdasco and reach the Australian Open final .

" Today was one of those matches you 're going to remember a long time , " Nadal said .
" In the last game , at 0 - 40 , I started to cry .
It was too much tension .
Fernando was playing , I think , at his best level .
He deserved this final , too . "
There were no arguments , no gamesmanship , just great shots , with the momentum shifting on a handful of key points .
The previous longest match at Melbourne Park came in 1991 , when Boris Becker needed 5 hours , 11 minutes to beat Italian Omar Camporese , with the fifth set going 14 - 12 .
Federer advanced to his 18th Grand Slam final with a straight sets win Thursday against Andy Roddick .
Nadal said it would be tough to recover for his first Grand Slam final on a hard court .
" Roger has a bit of an advantage over me , " said Nadal , whose previous best showing at the tournament was reaching the semifinals last year .
" He 's resting right now .
It 's tough to sleep after something like this .
" But I want to try my best .
It 's very important for me to be in this final .
Whatever happens on Sunday , I 've started the season my best ever . "
Verdasco was disappointed that he drained so much energy from his friend .
" Really a pity , " Verdasco said .
" I want him to be 100 percent to play that final .
I wish him the best of luck .
I hope that he will win . "
Fernando Verdasco fired 95 winners in taking Rafael Nadal to the brink in the Australian Open semifinals .

With the arena 's namesake , Rod Laver -- a pretty good lefty in his own right -- in the crowd and Spanish flags scattered around , Nadal found his renowned defense tested to the limit as Verdasco ripped 95 winners .
But while he bent , he never broke , committing fewer than 10 unforced errors in every demanding set , including just four in the fifth .
The first set included 75 minutes of long rallies , more associated with a match on clay than hardcourt .
Nadal was serving at 4 - 3 in the tiebreaker when Verdasco ran off the last four points .
The key shot was a backhand that trickled over to give him set point .
A sharp volley set up an easy overhead , and the crowd erupted in cheers .
Cool temperatures had come through during the afternoon to ease Melbourne 's hottest three - day stretch on record -- daytime temperatures topped 113 degrees -- but the constant sprinting from sideline to sideline left both players draping ice packs wrapped in towels around their shoulders during changeovers .
The high quality of the tennis had fans -- silent during play -- rising to standing ovations for both players for outstanding shots .
Another tiebreaker loomed in the second set with Verdasco serving at 4 - 5 , 40 - 15 .
This time it was Nadal , who had been looking a little puzzled and less confident than usual , running off four points in a row .
At deuce , Verdasco hit what appeared to be a volley winner on the 17th shot of a tense rally .
The ball was spinning away from Nadal , but he got to it on the dead run , flicking a forehand winner that dropped in the corner to even the match .
Verdasco managed a smile as he watched the replay on the big - screen TV suspended above the court .
He sent a forehand long on the next point , and Nadal pumped his fist in celebration .
They swapped four service breaks in the third set , and the second tiebreaker quickly went Nadal 's way , with Verdasco looking increasingly drained .
He called for the trainer to massage his left calf for apparent cramps twice during changeovers early in the fourth set and was clearly favoring it .
But he worked through the pain .
The third tiebreaker was all Verdasco as he raced to a 6 - 0 lead while forcing a deciding fifth set .
It was the first time Nadal had ever lost a Grand Slam tiebreaker while winning only one point .
There is no tiebreak in the fifth set at the Australian Open , so the win hinged on the ability of either Nadal or Verdasco to break serve .
Verdasco saved five break points in the fifth set before finally faltering .
Serving at 4 - 5 he fell behind 0 - 40 to set up three match points for Nadal .
He saved two with swinging volley winners , then double - faulted -- only his fourth of the match .
Both players dropped flat on the surface before Nadal got up , jumped over the net and gave his friend a hug .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Health experts are concerned that the current economic downturn could have adverse public health consequences as more people , in the sensible quest to save money , turn to cheaper yet less - healthy eating choices , potentially aggravating the already prevalent obesity problem in this country .
Referred to as “ recession pounds , ” they result from the added weight that comes about from the increased consumption of cheaper junk and fast foods that also happen to be tasty by virtue of the fact that they are often loaded with salt , fat , and highly processed carbs ( i.e. , sugar and high fructose corn syrup ) .
Who does n’t love those ?
It is ironic when you think that in the past , lower socioeconomic standing often resulted in people losing weight due to lack of food .
In the modern era of plenty , however , obesity has now become a symptom of poverty because these highly processed foods are not only promoted vigorously and widely accessible , but they are also cheap .
But can you really put a price on your health or the health of your family ?
When you think about the things we spend our money on , it does n’t always make a lot of sense to cut back so drastically on healthy eating so that you can afford a new cell phone .
Especially when you consider that , at some point , your body will let you know that you should n’t have eaten all that garbage .
Unfortunately , as is often the case , the consequences wo n’t be felt for years , and like smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for 20 years , by then it ’s too late .
So in an effort to keep a tab on our health and our waistlines , here are a few suggestions that might help you avoid putting on unnecessary recession pounds during these rough economic times , keeping in mind that the problem lies not in junk food in and of itself , but rather in the over - consumption of it .
1. Moderation .
If possible , try your best to stop eating before you ’ve eaten every crumb on your plate , and resist the urge to super - size .
I know many of us were raised with the idea that it is good to clean your plate , but times have changes .
Set your goal to be sated rather than stuffed , because you wo n’t feel any better after that second cheeseburger .
2 . Do n’t eat just for the sake of eating .
Sure , that second Big Mac may be tasty , but do n’t eat another when just one will suffice .
3 . Eat junk food .
Just combine it with something healthy .
Let ’s face it , junk food is a fact of our lives , so rather than setting the unrealistic goal of eliminating it , eat it !
Just add in something nutritious , like a piece of fruit , veggies , or whole grains .
4 . Eat the healthy stuff first .
If you wait until after your junk food meal to eat that apple , it probably is n’t going to happen .
So eat it first .
Not only will you get a dose of healthy stuff , but it will probably make you eat less of the junk .
6 . Be inconsistent .
Like losing weight , gaining weight does n’t happen by itself .
In other words , you wo n’t gain weight in your sleep , you have to consume .
So do n’t eat junk food regularly , three times a day , everyday .
Incorporate a healthy meal in there , with something nutritious that is high in fiber .
7 . Do n’t inhale your food .
Try to eat slowly and deliberately , chewing your food completely , and do n’t take another bite until you ’ve swallowed the previous one .
Not only with this help you digest your food , but it will spare other at the table from having to see the chewed up food in your mouth while giving your stomach time to communicate to your brain that it is full .
8. Drink more water .
This takes time to develop and for some of us , may seem impossible , but water is not only cheaper ( in many instances , it ’s free ) , but unlike sweetened beverages , has no calories .
Water will also help temper the feelings of hunger that encourage us to inhale our food .
9 . Do n’t drink ( your water ! ) while you ’re chewing , or vice - versa .
This falls in line with # 7 .
Besides nurturing good manners , it will help slow you down and avoid depositing chewed up food into your beverage .
10 . Talk .
And be social , if you can .
Conversation is a great way to slow a meal down , not to mention enjoy it .
I think of my friends from Europe who have these enormous meals drawn out over several hours , and an important part is good conversation .
11 . Eat with people who either share your dietary goals or have already achieved them .
There is strength numbers , not to mention inspiration by way of guilt .
12 . Turn off the TV .
Nothing is better at shutting off your brain and encouraging mindless eating .
So just turn it off and read , or better yet , talk to your table mates .
13 . Be more assertive .
Even though junk food is cheap , it is also convenient , which is why many of us choose them .
Sure , we ’re tired from our busy lives , but a little effort can go a long way in terms of making a healthier meal .
And even though it ’s a lot easier said than done , it ’s not impossible .
14 . Exercise .
I know , so painfully obvious , but so hard to employ .
Given that junk food is so easy only increases our need to be active .
In the end , it all boils down to a little common sense .
We all know what is healthy ( and for that matter , what is not ) , we just need to use our heads when we make our dietary choices .
And when we have to make compromises , maybe rather than targeting our food for cheaper alternatives , we could consider cutting back on other more frivolous items , like shoes , or the size of our cable package .
The question we have to ask ourselves is how much is enough .
Or in the case of eating unhealthy junk food , how much is too much .
The responsibility lies with us , but employing a little more thought and effort could go a long way to improving your health , your appearance , and even your outlook during difficult times .
JSR 133 ( Java Memory Model ) FAQ
Jeremy Manson and Brian Goetz , February 2004
Table of Contents
What is a memory model , anyway ?
In multiprocessor systems , processors generally have one or more layers of memory cache , which improves performance both by speeding access to data ( because the data is closer to the processor ) and reducing traffic on the shared memory bus ( because many memory operations can be satisfied by local caches . )
Memory caches can improve performance tremendously , but they present a host of new challenges .
What , for example , happens when two processors examine the same memory location at the same time ?
Under what conditions will they see the same value ?
At the processor level , a memory model defines necessary and sufficient conditions for knowing that writes to memory by other processors are visible to the current processor , and writes by the current processor are visible to other processors .
Some processors exhibit a strong memory model , where all processors see exactly the same value for any given memory location at all times .
Other processors exhibit a weaker memory model , where special instructions , called memory barriers , are required to flush or invalidate the local processor cache in order to see writes made by other processors or make writes by this processor visible to others .
These memory barriers are usually performed when lock and unlock actions are taken ; they are invisible to programmers in a high level language .
It can sometimes be easier to write programs for strong memory models , because of the reduced need for memory barriers .
However , even on some of the strongest memory models , memory barriers are often necessary ; quite frequently their placement is counterintuitive .
Recent trends in processor design have encouraged weaker memory models , because the relaxations they make for cache consistency allow for greater scalability across multiple processors and larger amounts of memory .
The issue of when a write becomes visible to another thread is compounded by the compiler 's reordering of code .
For example , the compiler might decide that it is more efficient to move a write operation later in the program ; as long as this code motion does not change the program 's semantics , it is free to do so .
If a compiler defers an operation , another thread will not see it until it is performed ; this mirrors the effect of caching .
Moreover , writes to memory can be moved earlier in a program ; in this case , other threads might see a write before it actually " occurs " in the program .
All of this flexibility is by design -- by giving the compiler , runtime , or hardware the flexibility to execute operations in the optimal order , within the bounds of the memory model , we can achieve higher performance .
A simple example of this can be seen in the following code :
Class Reordering { int x = 0 , y = 0 ; public void writer ( ) { x = 1 ; y = 2 ; } public void reader ( ) { int r1 = y ; int r2 = x ; } }
Let 's say that this code is executed in two threads concurrently , and the read of y sees the value 2 .
Because this write came after the write to x , the programmer might assume that the read of x must see the value 1 .
However , the writes may have been reordered .
If this takes place , then the write to y could happen , the reads of both variables could follow , and then the write to x could take place .
The result would be that r1 has the value 2 , but r2 has the value 0 .
The Java Memory Model describes what behaviors are legal in multithreaded code , and how threads may interact through memory .
It describes the relationship between variables in a program and the low - level details of storing and retrieving them to and from memory or registers in a real computer system .
It does this in a way that can be implemented correctly using a wide variety of hardware and a wide variety of compiler optimizations .
Java includes several language constructs , including volatile , final , and synchronized , which are intended to help the programmer describe a program 's concurrency requirements to the compiler .
The Java Memory Model defines the behavior of volatile and synchronized , and , more importantly , ensures that a correctly synchronized Java program runs correctly on all processor architectures .
Do other languages , like C++ , have a memory model ?
Most other programming languages , such as C and C++ , were not designed with direct support for multithreading .
The protections that these languages offer against the kinds of reorderings that take place in compilers and architectures are heavily dependent on the guarantees provided by the threading libraries used ( such as pthreads ) , the compiler used , and the platform on which the code is run .
What is JSR 133 about ?
Since 1997 , several serious flaws have been discovered in the Java Memory Model as defined in Chapter 17 of the Java Language Specification .
These flaws allowed for confusing behaviors ( such as final fields being observed to change their value ) and undermined the compiler 's ability to perform common optimizations .
The Java Memory Model was an ambitious undertaking ; it was the first time that a programming language specification attempted to incorporate a memory model which could provide consistent semantics for concurrency across a variety of architectures .
Unfortunately , defining a memory model which is both consistent and intuitive proved far more difficult than expected .
JSR 133 defines a new memory model for the Java language which fixes the flaws of the earlier memory model .
In order to do this , the semantics of final and volatile needed to change .
The full semantics are available at http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/pugh/java/memoryModel , but the formal semantics are not for the timid .
It is surprising , and sobering , to discover how complicated seemingly simple concepts like synchronization really are .
Fortunately , you need not understand the details of the formal semantics -- the goal of JSR 133 was to create a set of formal semantics that provides an intuitive framework for how volatile , synchronized , and final work .
The goals of JSR 133 include :
Preserving existing safety guarantees , like type - safety , and strengthening others .
For example , variable values may not be created " out of thin air " : each value for a variable observed by some thread must be a value that can reasonably be placed there by some thread .
The semantics of correctly synchronized programs should be as simple and intuitive as possible .
The semantics of incompletely or incorrectly synchronized programs should be defined so that potential security hazards are minimized .
Programmers should be able to reason confidently about how multithreaded programs interact with memory .
It should be possible to design correct , high performance JVM implementations across a wide range of popular hardware architectures .
A new guarantee of initialization safety should be provided .
If an object is properly constructed ( which means that references to it do not escape during construction ) , then all threads which see a reference to that object will also see the values for its final fields that were set in the constructor , without the need for synchronization .
should be provided .
If an object is properly constructed ( which means that references to it do not escape during construction ) , then all threads which see a reference to that object will also see the values for its final fields that were set in the constructor , without the need for synchronization .
There should be minimal impact on existing code .
What is meant by reordering ?
There are a number of cases in which accesses to program variables ( object instance fields , class static fields , and array elements ) may appear to execute in a different order than was specified by the program .
The compiler is free to take liberties with the ordering of instructions in the name of optimization .
Processors may execute instructions out of order under certain circumstances .
Data may be moved between registers , processor caches , and main memory in different order than specified by the program .
For example , if a thread writes to field a and then to field b , and the value of b does not depend on the value of a , then the compiler is free to reorder these operations , and the cache is free to flush b to main memory before a .
There are a number of potential sources of reordering , such as the compiler , the JIT , and the cache .
The compiler , runtime , and hardware are supposed to conspire to create the illusion of as - if - serial semantics , which means that in a single - threaded program , the program should not be able to observe the effects of reorderings .
However , reorderings can come into play in incorrectly synchronized multithreaded programs , where one thread is able to observe the effects of other threads , and may be able to detect that variable accesses become visible to other threads in a different order than executed or specified in the program .
Most of the time , one thread does n't care what the other is doing .
But when it does , that 's what synchronization is for .
What was wrong with the old memory model ?
There were several serious problems with the old memory model .
It was difficult to understand , and therefore widely violated .
For example , the old model did not , in many cases , allow the kinds of reorderings that took place in every JVM .
This confusion about the implications of the old model was what compelled the formation of JSR - 133 .
One widely held belief , for example , was that if final fields were used , then synchronization between threads was unnecessary to guarantee another thread would see the value of the field .
While this is a reasonable assumption and a sensible behavior , and indeed how we would want things to work , under the old memory model , it was simply not true .
Nothing in the old memory model treated final fields differently from any other field -- meaning synchronization was the only way to ensure that all threads see the value of a final field that was written by the constructor .
As a result , it was possible for a thread to see the default value of the field , and then at some later time see its constructed value .
This means , for example , that immutable objects like String can appear to change their value -- a disturbing prospect indeed .
The old memory model allowed for volatile writes to be reordered with nonvolatile reads and writes , which was not consistent with most developers intuitions about volatile and therefore caused confusion .
Finally , as we shall see , programmers ' intuitions about what can occur when their programs are incorrectly synchronized are often mistaken .
One of the goals of JSR - 133 is to call attention to this fact .
What do you mean by “ incorrectly synchronized ” ?
Incorrectly synchronized code can mean different things to different people .
When we talk about incorrectly synchronized code in the context of the Java Memory Model , we mean any code where
there is a write of a variable by one thread , there is a read of the same variable by another thread and the write and read are not ordered by synchronization
When these rules are violated , we say we have a data race on that variable .
A program with a data race is an incorrectly synchronized program .
What does synchronization do ?
Synchronization has several aspects .
The most well - understood is mutual exclusion -- only one thread can hold a monitor at once , so synchronizing on a monitor means that once one thread enters a synchronized block protected by a monitor , no other thread can enter a block protected by that monitor until the first thread exits the synchronized block .
But there is more to synchronization than mutual exclusion .
Synchronization ensures that memory writes by a thread before or during a synchronized block are made visible in a predictable manner to other threads which synchronize on the same monitor .
After we exit a synchronized block , we release the monitor , which has the effect of flushing the cache to main memory , so that writes made by this thread can be visible to other threads .
Before we can enter a synchronized block , we acquire the monitor , which has the effect of invalidating the local processor cache so that variables will be reloaded from main memory .
We will then be able to see all of the writes made visible by the previous release .
Discussing this in terms of caches , it may sound as if these issues only affect multiprocessor machines .
However , the reordering effects can be easily seen on a single processor .
It is not possible , for example , for the compiler to move your code before an acquire or after a release .
When we say that acquires and releases act on caches , we are using shorthand for a number of possible effects .
The new memory model semantics create a partial ordering on memory operations ( read field , write field , lock , unlock ) and other thread operations ( start and join ) , where some actions are said to happen before other operations .
When one action happens before another , the first is guaranteed to be ordered before and visible to the second .
The rules of this ordering are as follows :
Each action in a thread happens before every action in that thread that comes later in the program 's order .
An unlock on a monitor happens before every subsequent lock on that same monitor .
monitor .
A write to a volatile field happens before every subsequent read of that same volatile .
volatile .
A call to start ( ) on a thread happens before any actions in the started thread .
on a thread happens before any actions in the started thread .
All actions in a thread happen before any other thread successfully returns from a join ( ) on that thread .
This means that any memory operations which were visible to a thread before exiting a synchronized block are visible to any thread after it enters a synchronized block protected by the same monitor , since all the memory operations happen before the release , and the release happens before the acquire .
Another implication is that the following pattern , which some people use to force a memory barrier , does n't work :
synchronized ( new Object ( ) ) {}
This is actually a no - op , and your compiler can remove it entirely , because the compiler knows that no other thread will synchronize on the same monitor .
You have to set up a happens - before relationship for one thread to see the results of another .
Important Note : Note that it is important for both threads to synchronize on the same monitor in order to set up the happens - before relationship properly .
It is not the case that everything visible to thread A when it synchronizes on object X becomes visible to thread B after it synchronizes on object Y .
The release and acquire have to " match " ( i.e. , be performed on the same monitor ) to have the right semantics .
Otherwise , the code has a data race .
How can final fields appear to change their values ?
One of the best examples of how final fields ' values can be seen to change involves one particular implementation of the String class .
A String can be implemented as an object with three fields -- a character array , an offset into that array , and a length .
The rationale for implementing String this way , instead of having only the character array , is that it lets multiple String and StringBuffer objects share the same character array and avoid additional object allocation and copying .
So , for example , the method String.substring ( ) can be implemented by creating a new string which shares the same character array with the original String and merely differs in the length and offset fields .
For a String , these fields are all final fields .
String s1 = " /usr/tmp " ; String s2 = s 1.substring ( 4 ) ;
The string s2 will have an offset of 4 and a length of 4 .
But , under the old model , it was possible for another thread to see the offset as having the default value of 0 , and then later see the correct value of 4 , it will appear as if the string " /usr " changes to " /tmp " .
The original Java Memory Model allowed this behavior ; several JVMs have exhibited this behavior .
The new Java Memory Model makes this illegal .
How do final fields work under the new JMM ?
The values for an object 's final fields are set in its constructor .
Assuming the object is constructed " correctly " , once an object is constructed , the values assigned to the final fields in the constructor will be visible to all other threads without synchronization .
In addition , the visible values for any other object or array referenced by those final fields will be at least as up - to - date as the final fields .
What does it mean for an object to be properly constructed ?
It simply means that no reference to the object being constructed is allowed to " escape " during construction .
( See Safe Construction Techniques for examples . )
In other words , do not place a reference to the object being constructed anywhere where another thread might be able to see it ; do not assign it to a static field , do not register it as a listener with any other object , and so on .
These tasks should be done after the constructor completes , not in the constructor .
class FinalFieldExample { final int x ; int y ; static FinalFieldExample f ; public FinalFieldExample ( ) { x = 3 ; y = 4 ; } static void writer ( ) { f = new FinalFieldExample ( ) ; } static void reader ( ) { if ( f != null ) { int i = f.x ; int j = f.y ; } } }
The class above is an example of how final fields should be used .
A thread executing reader is guaranteed to see the value 3 for f.x , because it is final .
It is not guaranteed to see the value 4 for y , because it is not final .
If FinalFieldExample 's constructor looked like this :
public FinalFieldExample ( ) { // bad! x = 3 ; y = 4 ; // bad construction - allowing this to escape global .obj = this ; }
then threads that read the reference to this from global .obj are not guaranteed to see 3 for x .
The ability to see the correctly constructed value for the field is nice , but if the field itself is a reference , then you also want your code to see the up to date values for the object ( or array ) to which it points .
If your field is a final field , this is also guaranteed .
So , you can have a final pointer to an array and not have to worry about other threads seeing the correct values for the array reference , but incorrect values for the contents of the array .
Again , by " correct " here , we mean " up to date as of the end of the object 's constructor " , not " the latest value available " .
Now , having said all of this , if , after a thread constructs an immutable object ( that is , an object that only contains final fields ) , you want to ensure that it is seen correctly by all of the other thread , you still typically need to use synchronization .
There is no other way to ensure , for example , that the reference to the immutable object will be seen by the second thread .
The guarantees the program gets from final fields should be carefully tempered with a deep and careful understanding of how concurrency is managed in your code .
There is no defined behavior if you want to use JNI to change final fields .
What does volatile do ?
Volatile fields are special fields which are used for communicating state between threads .
Each read of a volatile will see the last write to that volatile by any thread ; in effect , they are designated by the programmer as fields for which it is never acceptable to see a " stale " value as a result of caching or reordering .
The compiler and runtime are prohibited from allocating them in registers .
They must also ensure that after they are written , they are flushed out of the cache to main memory , so they can immediately become visible to other threads .
Similarly , before a volatile field is read , the cache must be invalidated so that the value in main memory , not the local processor cache , is the one seen .
There are also additional restrictions on reordering accesses to volatile variables .
Under the old memory model , accesses to volatile variables could not be reordered with each other , but they could be reordered with nonvolatile variable accesses .
This undermined the usefulness of volatile fields as a means of signaling conditions from one thread to another .
Under the new memory model , it is still true that volatile variables cannot be reordered with each other .
The difference is that it is now no longer so easy to reorder normal field accesses around them .
Writing to a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor release , and reading from a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor acquire .
In effect , because the new memory model places stricter constraints on reordering of volatile field accesses with other field accesses , volatile or not , anything that was visible to thread A when it writes to volatile field f becomes visible to thread B when it reads f .
Here is a simple example of how volatile fields can be used :
class VolatileExample { int x = 0 ; volatile boolean v = false ; public void writer ( ) { x = 42 ; v = true ; } public void reader ( ) { if ( v == true ) { //uses x - guaranteed to see 42 .
} } }
Assume that one thread is calling writer , and another is calling reader .
The write to v in writer releases the write to x to memory , and the read of v acquires that value from memory .
Thus , if the reader sees the value true for v , it is also guaranteed to see the write to 42 that happened before it .
This would not have been true under the old memory model .
If v were not volatile , then the compiler could reorder the writes in writer , and reader 's read of x might see 0 .
Effectively , the semantics of volatile have been strengthened substantially , almost to the level of synchronization .
Each read or write of a volatile field acts like " half " a synchronization , for purposes of visibility .
Important Note : Note that it is important for both threads to access the same volatile variable in order to properly set up the happens - before relationship .
It is not the case that everything visible to thread A when it writes volatile field f becomes visible to thread B after it reads volatile field g .
The release and acquire have to " match " ( i.e. , be performed on the same volatile field ) to have the right semantics .
Does the new memory model fix the " double - checked locking " problem ?
The ( infamous ) double - checked locking idiom ( also called the multithreaded singleton pattern ) is a trick designed to support lazy initialization while avoiding the overhead of synchronization .
In very early JVMs , synchronization was slow , and developers were eager to remove it -- perhaps too eager .
The double - checked locking idiom looks like this :
// double - checked - locking - do n't do this !
private static Something instance = null ; public Something getInstance ( ) { if ( instance == null ) { synchronized ( this ) { if ( instance == null ) instance = new Something ( ) ; } } return instance ; }
This looks awfully clever -- the synchronization is avoided on the common code path .
There 's only one problem with it -- it does n't work .
Why not ?
The most obvious reason is that the writes which initialize instance and the write to the instance field can be reordered by the compiler or the cache , which would have the effect of returning what appears to be a partially constructed Something .
The result would be that we read an uninitialized object .
There are lots of other reasons why this is wrong , and why algorithmic corrections to it are wrong .
There is no way to fix it using the old Java memory model .
More in - depth information can be found at Double - checked locking : Clever , but broken and The " Double Checked Locking is broken " declaration
Many people assumed that the use of the volatile keyword would eliminate the problems that arise when trying to use the double - checked - locking pattern .
In JVMs prior to 1.5 , volatile would not ensure that it worked ( your mileage may vary ) .
Under the new memory model , making the instance field volatile will " fix " the problems with double - checked locking , because then there will be a happens - before relationship between the initialization of the Something by the constructing thread and the return of its value by the thread that reads it .
However , for fans of double - checked locking ( and we really hope there are none left ) , the news is still not good .
The whole point of double - checked locking was to avoid the performance overhead of synchronization .
Not only has brief synchronization gotten a LOT less expensive since the Java 1.0 days , but under the new memory model , the performance cost of using volatile goes up , almost to the level of the cost of synchronization .
So there 's still no good reason to use double - checked - locking .
Redacted -- volatiles are cheap on most platforms .
Instead , use the Initialization On Demand Holder idiom , which is thread - safe and a lot easier to understand :
private static class LazySomethingHolder { public static Something something = new Something ( ) ; } public static Something getInstance ( ) { return LazySomethingHolder.something ; }
What if I 'm writing a VM ?
Why should I care ?
Why should you care ?
Concurrency bugs are very difficult to debug .
They often do n't appear in testing , waiting instead until your program is run under heavy load , and are hard to reproduce and trap .
You are much better off spending the extra effort ahead of time to ensure that your program is properly synchronized ; while this is not easy , it 's a lot easier than trying to debug a badly synchronized application .

Who snuck this into the Free Market Rich People Deserve Everything Mouthpiece ?
Direct payments to the poor still have the biggest bang for the buck , since they go straight into the economic bloodstream , Mr. Zandi says .
One dollar of increased food - stamp assistance produces $ 1.73 in higher economic growth , and the effect would be felt in three to six months .
Using that same dollar as a lump - sum tax rebate for income - tax payers would yield all of one penny in additional growth , by Mr. Zandi ’s calculations .
Only hours into his presidency , Barack Obama has ordered a freeze on all the new and pending federal regulations that the Bush administration pushed through in its final days .
As Monitor reporter Mark Clayton noted two months ago , many of these " midnight rules " seek to relax , or completely do away with , environmental standards .
Among the rules that have been frozen is one that would have made it easier for factories and refineries to expand without applying for new federal pollution permits .
Another would have removed federal protection for gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes .
Another would have opened areas of Oregon to logging .
Another would have opened 2 million acres of public land in Wyoming , Colorado , and Utah for oil - shale drilling .
And another would have helped set in motion the commercialization of meat from genetically modified animals .
It 's common for a president to issue a flurry of last - minute rules before stepping down , particularly when a successor is from a different party .
And as the Washington Post notes : Starting with Ronald Reagan , it has become a tradition for a president on his first day in office to issue a directive that voids the ones that have not yet gone into effect .
The Jan. 20 memo from Rahm Emanuel , President Obama 's chief of staff , said : “ It is important that President Obama ’s appointees and designees have the opportunity to review and approve any new or pending regulations . ”
Therefore , " no proposed or final regulation should be sent to the Office of Federal Register for publication unless and until it has been reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20 , 2009 , or in the case of the Department of Defense , the Secretary of Defense . "
Mr. Emanuel also asked department and agency heads to " consider extending for 60 days the effective date of regulations that have been published in the Federal Register but not yet taken effect . "
The Washington Post has a PDF of the memo .
President Obama 's order successfully blocked several of the Bush administration 's late - term rules , but many went into effect before he took office , meaning that reversing them will probably take years .
The nonprofit investigative journalism shop ProPublica has been tracking new rules from the Bush administration over the past two months .
Of the 65 rules they list , 23 went into effect before Obama 's inaguration ; one - third of those new rules went into force fewer than three days before Obama took office .
Probably the most significant of the environmental rules already in force is a change to the Endangered Species
Act that eases requirements for federal agencies to consult with scientists at the Fish and Wildlife or National Marine Fisheries services about the effects of their actions on threatened species .
Under the new rule , which took effect nine days before Obama ’s inauguration , federal agencies can in many cases simply check with their own personnel to determine if their projects will harm any of the 1,247 animal and 747 plant species listed as endangered or threatened .
Other rules that have already gone into effect include ones that make it easier for mining companies to dump debris from mountaintop removal into waterways , allow drilling for uranium near the Grand Canyon , eliminate requirements that factory farms report on air pollution from animal waste and let them voluntarily determine whether or not they need a permit to discharge animal waste into waterways , relax limits on airborne lead emissions , and allow people to bring loaded guns into some national parks .
ProPublica's Joaquin Sapien notes that Obama has two options for reversing rules that are already in effect .
He could try to replace the rules with new rules , a process that Mr. Sapien calls " enormously difficult " because it resets the rulemaking process and opens it to legal challenges .
Or he could ask Congress to invoke the little - known Congressional Review Act , which allows the legislative body to kill a rule within " 60 legislative days " – about six months – after it goes into effect .
That law , which was passed in 1996 by the GOP - controlled Congress in an attempt to halt what was seen as excessive regulation by President Clinton , has been used only once .

ANN ARBOR , Mich .---
Software deadlocks are the Catch - 22s of the computer world .
These common bugs can freeze the machine when different parts of a program end up in an endless cycle of waiting for one another as they access shared data .
University of Michigan researchers developed a new way around this problem with a controller that can anticipate and prevent situations that might cause deadlock .
Their controller is called Gadara .
It 's a plug - in that operates using feedback techniques similar to those that give us cruise control in cars and thermostats in heating systems .
" This is a totally different approach to what people had done before for deadlock .
Previously , engineers would try to identify potential deadlocks through testing or program analysis and then go back and rewrite the program .
The bug fixes were manual , and not automatic .
Gadara automates the process , " said Stéphane Lafortune , a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a Gadara developer .
Yin Wang , a doctoral student who works with Lafortune in the same department , will present a paper on Gadara Dec. 9 at the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation in San Diego .
" Every time you find a problem today you need the original programmer to solve it .
The goal of Gadara is to allow anyone with our tool to solve the problem , " Wang said .
Deadlock is becoming a more pressing concern as multicore chips grow in complexity and software performs an increasing number of tasks simultaneously .
The bug shows up often in parallel programs that use shared data .
Gadara works by analyzing a program to find potential deadlocks , and then inserting control logic into the program .
The control logic ensures that the program cannot deadlock .
Gadara uses a unique combination of discrete control theory and compiler technology , said Lafortune , whose primary work focuses on discrete control theory .
The control theory provides the logic that allows Gadara to use feedback to prevent software deadlocks .
The compiler technology , which was developed by Scott Mahlke , a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , enables Gadara to operate on real - world applications .
Compilers translate programs written in high - level programming languages in executable code .
###
The paper is titled " Gadara : Dynamic Deadlock Avoidance for Multithreaded Programs . "
Other co-developers of Gadara are Terence Kelly , who received his doctoral degree from U - M and is currently at Hewlett - Packard Laboratories , and Manjunath Kudlur , a recent doctoral graduate from U - M who is now working at NVidia .
Current research on Gadara is funded by the National Science Foundation and by an HP Labs Open Innovation award .

Joining the many who felt shortchanged by 2008 are the nation ’s federal judges .
They were the only federal employees who did not receive a cost - of - living pay increase .
And in December , they lost out when a bill before Congress to significantly raise their salaries was dropped during the debate over the proposed auto - industry bailout .
In his fourth year - end report on the federal judiciary , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he has been repeating himself .
“ I suspect many are tired of hearing it , and I know I am tired of saying it , but I must make this plea again : Congress must provide judicial compensation that keeps pace with inflation , ” he wrote .
“ Judges knew what the pay was when they answered the call of public service .
But they did not know that Congress would steadily erode that pay in real terms by repeatedly failing over the years to provide even cost - of - living increases . ”

A quirk in federal law prevents judges from receiving automatic pay increases , unlike other federal employees .
Six times in the last 15 years , judges did not receive the routine cost - of - living increase for federal employees , according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts .
As the chief justice of the United States , Roberts is the leader of the federal judiciary as well as the Supreme Court .
Midway through 2008 , he was optimistic that Congress would restore the lost cost - of - living increases for judges ; both the House and Senate had approved bills that would have increased judicial salaries by about 28 % .
But when the stock market plunged in September , lawmakers hesitated to pass the pay increase for the judiciary .
The bills died in the final days of the congressional session .
In 2008 , U.S. district judges earned $ 169,300 , and U.S. appeals court judges earned $ 179,500 .
At the Supreme Court , the eight associate justices were paid $ 208,100 , and the chief justice was paid $ 217,400 .

Roberts said the federal judiciary -- the third branch of the U.S. government -- is a relative bargain .
The total appropriation for the federal courts system was $ 6.2 billion in 2008 , he said .
“ That represents a mere two - tenths of 1 % of the United States ’ total $ 3 - trillion budget .
Two - tenths of 1 % , ” Roberts wrote .
He said the judiciary “ is committed to spending its tiny share of the federal budget responsibly .
But courts cannot preserve their vitality simply by following a nonfat regimen .
The judiciary must also continue to attract judges who are the best of the best . ”

Advertisement Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said there is still no firm proof that gunmen who attacked the Indian city of Mumbai came from Pakistan .
US , Indian and British officials all say there is clear evidence suggesting the attacks originated in terrorist training camps inside Pakistan .
But speaking to the BBC , Mr Zardari said there was still no conclusive evidence to substantiate the claim .
However he promised Pakistan would take action if a link was proved .
More than 170 people died in last month 's attacks in Mumbai ( Bombay ) , which India blamed on the Lashka - e - Taiba militant group .
Full investigation Mr Zardari told the BBC's Alan Little in Islamabad that Pakistan was prepared to act if adequate evidence of any Pakistani complicity in the attacks emerged .
LASHKAR-E-TAIBA
Jihadi organisation based in Pakistan Formed towards the end of the Afghan war against the Soviets Blamed for hundreds of attacks in the region since 1990 Listed as a " terrorist group " by the US and UK
Pakistan leader calm amid pressure Profile : Lashkar - e- Taiba
Are attacks a chance for peace ?
" If that stage comes , and when it comes , I assure you that our parliament , our democracy , shall take the action properly deemed in our constitution and in our law , " he said .
He said that Western intelligence agencies had not offered firm evidence to justify claims that the attacks were orchestrated from Pakistani soil and that he would not jump to conclusions until a full investigation had been conducted .
Mr Zardari said claims that the sole surviving attacker had been identified by his own father as coming from Pakistan had not been proven .
The man has been named as Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab and is in Indian police custody .
The Pakistani president also said Hafiz Saeed , the leader of the Jamaat - ud - Dawa charity , would remain under house arrest .
Pakistan says that terrorism is a common enemy " Let me assure you that if there is any investigation to be found pointing towards his involvement in any form of terrorism , he shall be tried for that reason , " the president said .
Jamaat - ud - Dawa is accused of being a front for Lashkar - e - Taiba , a charge it denies .
Mr Zardari said that he had asked India to co-operate in an investigation and he would not leap to judgement while that investigation was continuing .
He said that while he was not in denial about Lashkar - e - Taiba 's continued activities , '' when you ban an organisation they emerge in some other form ' ' .
Our correspondent says the president 's denial will further dismay India , and frustrate Britain and America , which are exerting intense pressure on Pakistan to take action .
' Hiccup ' Meanwhile , Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has expressed regret after his Indian counterpart said peace moves between the countries were on hold because of the Mumbai attacks .
But Mr Qureshi said relations between the two countries - which both have nuclear arms - would recover .
" This unfortunate incident has been a setback ... to the extent that our composite dialogue is at a pause at the moment , " Mr Qureshi said .
" But I am confident that we will overcome this hiccup ... the future of Pakistan demands good neighbourly relations with India , so it 's my responsibility to develop good bilateral relations . "
Mr Qureshi said that the two countries had a " common objective , a common challenge and a common enemy " in relation to " terrorism " .

It appears the McCain ticket 's extra-vicious new attacks on Barack Obama , openly trumpeted by the campaign itself , have worked a little too well .
The idea was probably to get people just riled enough to cheer wildly and vote Republican on election day — not to sound like a frenzied lynch mob that will make swing voters cringe .
At left is a video ( via Talking Points Memo ) in which John McCain asks , " Who is the real Barack Obama ? " and a supporter yells out , " Terrorist ! "
Watch as the Republican presidential nominee visibly grimaces , before quickly making his peace with demagoguery and moving on .
That 's more of a disgusted reaction , at least , than Sarah Palin reportedly gave when one of her audience members seemed to call for the death of her political opponent :
" And , according to the New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ' launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol , ' " [ Palin ] continued .
" Boooo ! " the crowd repeated .
" Kill him ! " proposed one man in the audience .
Obama has long taken lumps for the antics of his most overexuberant supporters , whether it's the video producers who made a creepy video of kids singing an Obama song or an overly deferential press corps that became the butt of a joke on Saturday Night Live .
McCain now has a far more dicey problem on his hands .
He and Palin are putting themselves on camera with downright lunatics , which is not only scary but would , uh , tend to undermine their point that Barack Obama maybe chatted with an ex-lunatic at some board meetings a few years ago .
This is why you launch these sorts of things anonymously , by direct mail and anonymous phone call , a week before the election .
You do n't notify the press a full month in advance and have the candidate deliver the message , personally , on camera .
Unless maybe people are already mailing in their absentee ballots and you 're really desperate and out of ideas .
Hmm .
The concert will be broadcast worldwide on 7 December
Bon Jovi and Pink Floyd 's Roger Waters are among the stars set to headline a Live Earth concert in India next month .
The event 's founder , former US Vice President Al Gore , will also be on hand to talk about climate issues .
Other stars attending include Bollywood 's Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and the Black Eyed Peas ' Will .
I.Am .
The concert takes place on 7 December in Mumbai - the sole venue for the event .
Nine cities hosted the first Live Earth concerts in 2007 .
Stars from around the world took part in concerts in cities including London , Johannesburg and Toyko on 7 July last year to highlight global warming .
Money raised from this year 's concert will be donated to Climate Project India to help fund their educational programs and renewable energy projects .
Money will also go to TERI 's Light a Billion Lives campaign which provides solar lighting to rural homes without electricity .
The original machines and engineering diagrams of Leonardo da Vinci were without doubt a high point of the italian renaissance in relation to technological innovation .
But his work was not produced in isolation .
It seems reasonably certain that da Vinci had access to technical manuscripts produced earlier in the 15th century , written at the beginning of the surge in scientific , artistic and technological pursuits that was destined to spread across Europe .
One of these intellectual ' antecedents ' was Mariano di Iacopo [ Jacopo ] ( aka Mariano Taccola ; and also referred to during his life as the ' Archimedes of Siena ' ) ( 1381 -? 1453 ) .
Taccola was a sculptor by trade and pursued a varied career as public adminstrator and notary .
That Siena lacked any significant water access and was in a semi-perpetual state of war were no doubt great influences upon him .
At the age of 50 Taccola began producing engineering manuscripts - a new type of technical publication that favoured the prominent display of explanatory illustrations - the first of which was completed in ~ 1433 .
These works are said to contain a large array of devices that had not previously been recorded but it's not known for certain how many of these ideas began with Taccola .
His output is essentially collected in 2 manuscripts ' De Ingeneis ' and ' De Machinis ' which , despite any speculation about the originator , document the technical proficiency of the Tuscany engineering community at the beginining of the renaissance .
" At one time or another he has been credited with the invention of the explosive undermining of city walls , the suction pump , underwater breathing apparatus , the box - caisson method for building bridges , water mains and sluice gates , and vertically axled windmills and watermills .
Taccola 's importance was encyclopedic account of contemporary machine practice .
Two ideas of great importance first appeared in Taccola 's manuscripts : the chain transmission system and the compound crank with connecting rod .
By the latter , rotary motion could be converted to reciprocal motion , a technical concept that has been considered crucial for the postmedieval development of Western technology . "
And if you believe some of the speculative entries around the internet ( I do n't ) then Taccola was also responsible for inventing the catapult and the trebuchet .
Unless you have at least JSTOR journal access online { eg. } , then the internet is not particularly brimming with vast quantities of credible sources about Taccola from my searches .
Outgoing Federal Communications Commission chair Kevin Martin got his last licks in on the cable industry on Monday , proposing a slew of fines against companies that the agency says migrate analog channels to digital tiers , forcing consumers to buy digital set top boxes or more expensive packages .
The Commission wants to fine Comcast , Bright House , Cox , Cablevision and others for not fully responding to Letters of Inquiry asking for details on the practice , or for doing the analog to digital channel switcheroo without giving consumers proper notice .
" The Commission has received nearly 600 complaints from cable subscribers around the country who one day were watching their favorite channel and then the next day were unable to access it , " Martin wrote in a letter to Senators Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Kay Bailey Hutchinson ( R - TX ) announcing the proposed penalties .
" In short , cable customers have been receiving less from the cable companies but paying the same price or , in some cases , more . "
Prominent among those six hundred gripes was an October 29 letter from the Consumers Union sent to Rockefeller 's Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation , which got the ball rolling on this move .
The complaint summarized a survey conducted by CR in October of the cable - only television market .
A big chunk of those queried said they 're losing channels , the group reported .
" We fear large cable companies , like Comcast , have been adding to their bottom - line by inappropriately reaching into the pockets of their subscribers , " CR 's letter charged .
" With the DTV transition quickly approaching , consumer confusion in the television programming marketplace is at its peak . "
The FCC launched its probe of the cable providers the next day .
The Commission 's LOIs asked for documentation on channel transfers , consumer complaints , notices to consumers on the changes , and other data .
Gone fishing ?
Not surprisingly , the cable industry has been none too pleased about any of this .
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association quickly cried foul , complaining on November 12 that the FCC asked for an enormous amount of information in very little time ( 14 days ) .
The trade group 's statement warned that the letters violated the Paperwork Reduction Act and should really be understood as a Notice of Inquiry — essentially a proceeding requiring authorization of the full Commission .
" A broad fishing expedition involving substantially an entire industry is not a legitimate investigation but an information collection that is masquerading as an investigation , " the NCTA statement concluded .
That protest clearly has n't fazed Kevin Scourge - of - Cable Martin , who is gone from the agency as of January 20 .
Bright House 's Notice of Apparent Liability proposes whacking the company to the tune of $ 25,000 , charging that many of its responses to agency questions were " nonresponsive or incomplete . "
The same sum is being proposed for Cablevision , as well as separate fines to various regional Cablevision systems for converting analog channels to digital without giving consumers proper notice .
In the case of Cablevision 's Darien , Connecticut service , a consumer complained that the changes effectively cut off access to one - fifth of the programming he or she received from the firm 's Family Basic cable tv package .
Goodbye and good luck
Martin's letter to Rockefeller and Hutchinson also summarizes his perspective on the cable industry .
The price for every other service that the FCC regulates has gone down , Martin charges .
Wireless down 85 percent , long distance calling by 50 percent , and international calling by almost 90 percent .
But not cable , whose prices the FCC's now ex-chair says have doubled since 1992 .
" And now , when cable operators migrate analog channels to a digital tier , consumers are forced to pay more if they wish to continue watching the same channels , " or pay the same sum for less , Martin writes .
" This is not the type of consumer choice that the Communications Act envisions .
The Commission has taken this issue seriously , and I hope that Congress will as well . "
Ars checked in with the NCTA about the FCC 's latest move .
The group has no comment .
Seagate has added two new products to its range of enterprise level hard drives , the Cheetah 15K.7 and NS.2 , with both drives offering up to 600 GB of storage and second - generation PowerTrim technology to dramatically optimize power consumption at all levels of activity .
They also come in the more conventional 3.5 - inch form factor , despite an ongoing industry shift toward 2.5 - inch sizes .
The main differences between the two drives are their spindle speeds and seek time .
The 15K.7 is claimed to be the fastest 3.5 - inch enterprise drive at 15,000rpm , rated at 15,000rpm with a seek time of 3.4 ms , while the NS.2 spins at 10,000rpm and has seek time of 3.8 ms .
Other than that , both drives will be available in capacities of 300GB , 450GB and 600GB and will support data transfer rates of either 6 G bit /s on a SAS - 2.0 interface or 4 G bit /s on Fibre Channel .
The Cheetah NS.2 is reportedly available now and the 15K.7 drive is currently undergoing OEM qualifications and will start shipping to channel partners next quarter .
However , pricing details are yet to be announced .

George Bush appeared in a jovial and defiant mood in his final press conference as president .
You can watch the full press conference online in the YouTube videos below :
Part 1
Part 2
Part 3
Part 4
Part 5
Part 6
Part 7
Here are the main points from the conference :
Bush “ Mis-Underestimated ” by Press
Bush stated that the press had often “ Mis-Underestimated ” him joking about the media ’s obsession with ‘ Bush - isms ’ .
He also stated he never spent much time worrying about the " loud voices " of critics and went on to say that President - elect Obama would also face " harsh " criticism as any president would .
Stimulus Plan & Bank Bailout
Bush said he supported the U.S treasury ’s injection of billions of dollars into the economy to unfreeze the financial markets stating it was important to act to avert another Great Depression .
" Credit spreads are beginning to shrink , lending is just beginning to pick up , " he said .
America ’s Moral Standing
Bush was questioned over Obama ’s aim to improve America ’s moral standing .
He disagreed and stated that on the whole America had a good moral standing in most of the world .
" I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged , " Bush said .
" It may be damaged amongst some of the elite , but people still understand America stands for freedom , that America as a country provides such great hope … " " … You go to Africa .
You ask Africans about American ’s generosity and compassion .
Go to India and ask about , you know , America ’s — their view of America .
Go to China and ask . ”
“ Mission Accomplished ” Banner a Mistake
When asked about his biggest mistakes as president Bush discussed the “ Mission Accomplished ” banner that was placed on a U.S. aircraft carrier that the president landed on in 2003 .
“ Clearly , putting a " mission accomplished " on a ( sic ) aircraft carrier was a mistake .
It sent the wrong message .
We were trying to say something differently , but , nevertheless , it conveyed a different message .
Obviously , some of my rhetoric has been a mistake , ” answered Bush .
America ’s Enemy
The topic of America ’s enemy being out there and America ’s fight for freedom was a theme regularly returned to as the president answered questions .
" It ’s not a throwaway line , the stakes are high , there is an enemy that ’s still out there .
I ’m telling you , there is an enemy that would like to attack America and Americans again .
That ’s the reality of the world , " he said .
Weapons of Mass Destruction
George Bush has admitted being " disappointed " by the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq during his final press conference as US President .
He said that " not finding weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment . "
Iraq Troop Surge
He pointed out that the troop " surge " in Iraq had been a success .
" I decided to do something about it , and to send 30,000 troops in as opposed to withdrawing . "
North Korea & Iran
When asked about threats to the U.S Bush warned that North Korea and Iran were both still " dangerous ” .
“ North Korea ’s still a problem .
There is a debate in the intel community about how big a problem they are . ”
“ One of my concerns is that there might be a — a highly enriched uranium program .
And therefore it is really important that out of the six - party talks comes a — a strong verification regime … ”
“ … So they ’re still dangerous and Iran is still dangerous . ”
Wishes Obama the Best
" I genuinely mean what I say , I wish him all the very best , " President Bush said .
" I consider myself fortunate to have a front row seat for what is going to be a historic moment for the country .
President - elect Obama ’s election speaks volumes about how far this country has come . "
Started in a Recession & Ended in a Recession
When questioned over his handling of the economy he said he started in a recession and ended in a recession .
“ In terms of the economy – look , I inherited a recession , I ’m ending on a recession .
In the meantime , there were 52 months of uninterrupted job growth . ”
Tax Cuts Policy
He further defended his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as smart economic policy .
“ And I defended tax cuts when I campaigned , I helped implement tax cuts when I was president , and I will defend them after my presidency as the right course of action . ”

Times they have changed : a quarter of a century ago , reporter Michael J. Miller was on the West Coast bureau of Popular Computing .
( Now he blogs for PC mag . )
A few choice extracts about his trip down to Cupertino to see the first Mac :
“ I met with Steve Jobs , who was then Apple Chairman and heading up the Mac project , along with key designers including Burrell Smith , the original hardware designer and software designers Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson . ”
“ Most of the time I was meeting with other members on the team , but I remember Jobs coming in — he was very charismatic : intense , proud of the work and a bit prickly about any criticism .
He and his folks were quick to put down the IBM PC and its clones for not pushing the envelope and settling for “ mediocrity . ”
“ Jobs and the team were rightly proud of the new machine , which was very different from the IBM PC that then dominated the industry .
Maybe it was the famous “ Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field , ” but even then I was entranced by the new machine and the possibilities it offered – particularly the graphical user interface . ”
Miller ’s trip down memory lane — complete with anecdotes about the Mac II , Apple ’s first laser printer and the role of industrial design at Apple — is well worth a read .
Stan Lee has been embroiled in a number of legal cases in recent years
Spider - Man creator Stan Lee is facing legal action from shareholders of a company over film and book profits they claim amount to $ 750 m ( £ 528 m ) .
Marvel , the force behind The Incredible Hulk and The X - Men , is also accused of violating copyright , which the company says was transferred to it in 1998 .
Marvel has said the legal papers , which were filed in New York , are filled with " ridiculous claims " .
In 2005 , Lee won a case with Marvel over profits earned on his creations .
The company whose shareholders are taking legal action against Lee is Stan Lee Media Inc , which he founded in the 1990s , but went bankrupt in 2001 .
Blockbusting movies
The organisation re-emerged in 2006 , and a year later Lee , now 86 , sued it on a number of grounds , including cybersquatting and copyright infringement .
The firm went on to take action against Marvel in a claim over ownership rights to a string of comic book superheroes , which it said Lee had signed away .
The company 's laywer , Martin Garbus , said he suspects that Lee entered into an agreement that prevented them from gaining profits from films and merchandise .
" That money should have gone to the corporation , " he said .
Lee 's legal representative , Mark Williams , said : " We look forward to a positive resolution for Stan Lee and his family . "
In recent years , Marvel characters have spawned a number of blockbusting movies , including The X - Men series .
Spider - Man's three cinematic outings , starring Tobey Maguire , made in excess of $ 1bn ( £ 702 m ) .
Gofer ( “ GOod For Equational Reasoning ” ) was an early implementation of a Haskell 1.x - ish language by Mark Jones , originally released in 1991 ( and written as a secret side project by Mark ) .
It was famously used to develop type classes , do - notation and useful libraries involving them .
It supported numerous interesting extensions ( constructor classes , m*n+k patterns … ) .
By 1994 , it was rewritten to match the Haskell standard at the time , resulting in Hugs .
Gofer was the first Haskell system I used ( I used MacGofer , on a 68 k Macintosh , to implement my comp1A assignments , including a CGI maze solving game with AI ) .
Gofer also supported easy addition of custom preludes , and comes with a number of interesting ones .
I ’ve started packaging up these prelude experiments with Cabal , and you can now get the gofer standard prelude from Hackage .
The minimal prelude , constructor classes prelude , nofloat prelude , and the simplified preludes are still to come .
Looking at the Gofer 2.30 (~ Haskell 1.2 ) ( . ps.gz ) prelude , there are some interesting differences from the Haskell Prelude of today .
No monads !
One major difference is the entire absence of monads of any kind .
Instead , to remain referentially transparent in IO , the gofer standard prelude used continuation - based IO ( the successor to the very early stream - based IO model of Miranda ) .
Programs are represented as functions of the type :
type Dialogue = [ Response ] -> [ Request ]
where Responses are values from the operating system , that are returned when the program makes requests of the kernel .
The different kinds of requests we can make using the Gofer standard prelude :
data Request = -- file system requests ReadFile String | WriteFile String String | AppendFile String String -- channel system requests | ReadChan String | AppendChan String String -- environment requests | Echo Bool | GetArgs | GetProgName | GetEnv String
and that ’s it .
Responses are similarly represented as :
data Response = Success | Str String | Failure IOError | StrList [ String ]
Each request / response pair is captured in a continuation passing manner , letting us build up transactions between the OS and the system .
The standard continuations were :
type SuccCont = Dialogue type StrCont = String -> Dialogue type StrListCont = [ String ] -> Dialogue type FailCont = IOError ->
Dialogue
and with that we can write , say , read File ,
readFile :: String -> FailCont -> StrCont ->
Dialogue
which takes a filename to open , and can either fail or succeed with a string , so we plug in the two continuations to use in either case .
read
File name fail succ resps = ReadFile name : case resp of Str val -> succ val resps Failure msg -> fail msg resps
So add the ReadFile request into the stream , and associate with it a response to either succeed or fail , calling the appropriate continuations to take action .
No seq
There was no `seq` or ( $ ! ) to guide evaluation , but there was something close to it :
primitive strict " primStrict " :: ( a -> b ) -> a -> b
which takes a function from a -> b , an a , and forces the result .
We can port this to Haskell 98 or later , by rewriting it in terms of `seq` .
For example , in Gofer , foldl ’ was written as :
foldl ' :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a foldl ' f a [ ] = a foldl ' f a ( x : xs ) = strict ( foldl ' f ) ( f a x ) xs
rather than the current definition of :
foldl ' f z0 xs0 = lgo z0 xs0 where lgo z [ ] = z lgo z ( x : xs ) = let z ' = f z x in z ' `seq` lgo z ' xs
or the version used for stream fusion using bang patterns , and slightly modified strictness ( which optimises slightly better ) :
foldl ' :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a foldl ' f z0 xs0 = go z0 xs0 where go !z [ ] = z go !z ( x :xs ) = go ( f z x ) xs
Note that the definition used these days has had the static argument transformation applied manually , yielding a non-recursive top level function , which will be easier to inline .
Strict folds and scans
Gofer also had a number of strict list functions that are either missing , or used differently now .
scanl ' :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> [ a ] scanl ' f q xs = q : ( case xs of [ ] -> [ ] x:xs -> strict ( scanl ' f ) ( f q x ) xs )
which does n’t exist anymore .
sum , product :: Num a = > [ a ] -> a sum = foldl ' (+ ) ( fromInteger 0 ) product = foldl ' ( *) ( fromInteger 1 )
are defined to be strict , tail recursive loops .
( These days we use the lazy foldl , and rely on rewrite rules to transform strict Num types into foldl’ – not an entirely satisfactory situation ) .
These would be better definitions .
Some functions on triples also are not part of the standard :
fst3 :: ( a , b , c ) -> a fst3 ( x , _ , _ ) = x snd3 :: ( a , b , c ) -> b snd3 ( _ , x , _ ) = x thd3 :: ( a , b , c ) -> c thd3 ( _ , _ , x ) = x
Funky undefined
One of the cutest things is the definition of bottom , aka undefined : the computation that represents many kinds of failure ( non-termination , error , etc ) :
undefined :: a undefined | False = undefined
Hell yeah .
Missing list functions
Some other useful functions that no longer exist :
copy :: Int -> a -> [ a ] -- make list of n copies of x copy n x = take n xs where xs = x:xs sums , products :: Num a = > [ a ] -> [ a ] sums = scanl (+ ) ( fromInteger 0 ) products = scanl ( *) ( fromInteger 1 ) -- takeUntil p xs returns the list of elements upto and including the -- first element of xs which satisfies p takeUntil :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] takeUntil p [ ] = [ ] takeUntil p ( x : xs ) | p x = [ x ] | otherwise = x : takeUntil p xs
All which seem fairly reasonable .
On using a custom Prelude with GHC

Interestingly , Gofer exported very few data types , with only Int and Float available by default ( no Integer ) .
The port of the gofer prelude to GHC reuses GHC ’s implementations of these data types , and other primitives on them , as well as reimplementing strict and error in terms of GHC ’s seq and error .
In addition , to write a new Prelude in GHC , you have to disable the old one , with - XNoImplicitPrelude which turns off all the Prelude types , and makes the syntax for enumerations , list comprehensions , do - notation , arrows and numeric literals rebindable .
These syntactic features desugar to various functions ( fromRational , fromInteger , fail , ( > > ) , ( >>= ) ) , so we have to ensure the Gofer versions of these functions are in scope instead .
Enjoy your flashback to Haskell of 15 years ago !
First Commercial Hydrokinetic Turbine Installed in US
December 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The United States ’ first hydrokinetic turbine was recently installed in the Mississippi River .
The turbine , which harnesses power from moving water , is downstream from a hydroelectric - plant dam .
With a production capacity of only 35 KW , Minnesota ’s turbine is n’t exactly a heavy hitter , but it will increase the dam ’s capacity by over 5 percent .
It also signals the beginning of a new energy trend .
Hydro Green , the company behind the project , plans on installing two six - foot hydrokinetic turbines in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers that can produce 1,600 MW combined .
A competing company called Free Flow Power Corp. also has its sights set on turbine production in the Mississipi River .
Expect even more projects in the near future —
Congress passed a bill this year extending tax incentives for hydrokinetic turbines through 2016 .

Palin : ' God ' will show me the way Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Defeated Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Monday she hopes
God will " show her the way " before she decides on any future bid for the White House .
The Alaska governor declined to say whether she was planning to run for the US presidency in four years , stating in an exclusive interview with the Fox News Channel that 2012 remained too far off .
" I can't predict what 's going to happen a day from now , much less four years from now , " Palin said , according to excerpts of the interview released by Fox News before its broadcast here at 10:00 pm ( 0300 GMT Tuesday ) .
However the devoutly religious 44 - year - old mother - of - five said that if God wanted her to run for the highest office , she hoped to be shown the way .
" You know , I have -- faith is a very big part of my life .
And putting my life in my creator 's hands -- this is what I always do , " Palin said .
" I 'm like , OK , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I 'm like , do n't let me miss the open door .
Show me where the open door is , " she added .
" Even if it 's cracked up a little bit , maybe I 'll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it , but do n't let me miss an open door .
" And if there is an open door in ' 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I 'll plow through that door . "
Palin's faith was scrutinized during the election campaign after an Internet video surfaced showing her being blessed by a Kenyan witch - hunter in a 2005 service at a Pentecostal church in Alaska .
A second video surfaced showing Palin telling students at a church in Alaska that United States forces in Iraq had been sent on a " task that is from God . "
In Monday 's wide - ranging interview with Fox News , Palin also appeared to admit for the first time allegations made by anonymous aides to running mate John McCain that she had " gone rogue " during the election campaign .
In the final weeks of the election , reports of tensions between Palin and McCain 's advisers emerged , with unidentified sources alleging she had routinely disregarded their advice and made unscripted remarks .
" But being quite independent , just like John McCain is also , yes , maybe there is some characterizing of me going rogue when once in a while I would say something that -- hey , I said it from the heart , " Palin said .
" I believed in going off script once in a while in some of the rallies in order to really reiterate , perhaps , something that I believed about John McCain . "
" Maybe it was n't written in the script , but so what ?
Geez , if this is all going to be so scripted and kind of like a movie screen and we have to follow verbatim everything that somebody writes for you , I do n't want any part of that .
That 's not who I am and that 's not who John McCain is either . "
Palin denied however that any of her comments had hurt McCain 's campaign .
" If I went off script once in a while , I can't for the life of me remember any one time where it would have harmed him , or the ticket , " she said .
Meanwhile Palin also dismissed reports following last week 's election suggesting she was unaware Africa was a continent , not a country , insisting the question had never arisen during discussions about the region .
" We discussed what was going on in Africa .
And never , ever did I talk about , well , gee , is it a country or is it a continent , " Palin said .
" I just do n't know about this issue .
So I do n't know how they took our one discussion on Africa and turned that into what they turned it into . "
Formal Proofs for Assignments
Recently I had a question assigned to me in “ The Theory of Sets ” class I am taking .
I responded to this task by generating a computer - verified formal proof .
Though I got full marks for the informal proof section , other exercises that consisted of only formal proof were given a 0 by this TA .
This event raises some interesting questions .
What is the purpose of assigning proofs as exercises in math courses ?
Does submitting a computer - verified formal proof satisfy these purposes ?
The TA in this case gave many comments on the subject , which I will address here .
In this document I take formal proof to mean a computer - verified formal proof of some kind .
In this document I am not arguing that students should be required to submit formal proofs .
It seems clear that proof editing environments are not yet well enough developed to make such a requirement reasonable .
I do argue that , in general , submitting a formal proof for an assigned question should be acceptable .
Formal Proof Systems are Trustworthy
One common complain about computer - verified proofs is that the system is would contain bugs , so the results are not trustworthy .
The TA wrote the following .
You mean we should convert the clear statements [...] into an enormous jumble of nonsense and plug that into a device of gargantuan complexity that we have no hope of ever understanding in complete detail ?
The first thing I note is that to the rest of the world what mathematicians do all day is work with an enormous jumble of nonsense .
The TA of all people should appreciate the meaning that such a jumble can contain .
The point about the device of gargantuan complexity is just plain false .
Though an entire proof system might of gargantuan complexity , the output is simple .
The proof object ( usually some form of lambda expression ) is type checked .
There are three components being relied on .
Type Checking
This is what most people think needs to be trusted .
It is a fairly simple program .
The algorithm is simple enough that asking for an implementation would be a reasonable assignment in an undergraduate computer science course .
Smart people write and inspect popular implementations and test them throughly .
I think the scrutiny given to the code is at least as much as to any given informal English proof , and certainly more than a single TA gives to a given assignment .
Compiler
The complier turns the type - checker into machine code .
Every day thousands of people trust their compiler .
If one is paranoid , one can turn off all optimizations .
Even in this sorry state , the type - checker can run quickly ( because it is such a simple algorithm ) .
Different compilers can be used and different programs run for added security .
Hardware
Big companies put in lots of effort to ensure the hardware runs correctly .
Far more than is put into hand checking informal English proofs .
Millions of people use the same hardware all the time without problems .
So in reality verification of formal proofs is a simple process .
Although lots of structure is in place to make generating proofs easier , none of this extra structure is relevant to believing a computer when it verifies a proof .
The gargantuan complexity of a proof editing environment may be buggy .
It is possible that the environment will produce erroneous proofs ; however , these erroneous proofs will be caught by the proof - verification process , and the bug in the program revealed .
It is impossible to have a computer claim that a unprovable theorem is provable given a correct implementation of the type - checking algorithm .
Purpose of Assignments
The above aside , the main concern is that I did not fulfill the purpose of the assignment .
Upon reflection it is unclear to me what the purpose of assignments are .
I am sure this can be hotly debated .
The TA expressed four purposes that should be met .
I address these now .
To Develop Understanding of the Subject
To develop your intuition regarding the universe of sets
I feel that this is the most important reason for doing assignments .
Writing a formal proof definitely fulfills this purpose .
Even when a student understands a subject , writing a formal proof is a difficult process .
If the student does not understand a subject , writing a formal proof would be all but impossible .
One cannot try to bullshit one ’s way through the formal verification .
In my case , one might object if I were using a library of proofs in set theory .
In this case I am not .
I did employ the Tauto tactic which infers propositional tautologies .
Since this is a course on set theory not propositional logic , I feel using such automation is reasonable .
Also I did not automatically search to find a proof .
Such a procedure is extremely intractable ( undecidable ) , and in general any assignment calling for a proof that could be found this way would be an insult to the student .
To Convince the University that You Understand the Subject
To convince the relevant people that you are working on this class and studying etc …
The TA concedes that writing a formal proof fulfills this purpose as he states it .
Whether a student submitting a formal proof convinces the relevant people that the student understand the subject requires some commentary .
One thing that formal proofs are bad at is explaining the subject .
However presumably the professor and TA already know the subject .
The goal of the assignment is to determine if the student knows the subject .
Submitting a formal proof that a student writes theirself provides evidence to the university that the student understands the subject .
If the student did not understand the material , then they could not have made such a submission without cheating .
Detecting cheating with formal proofs is about as hard as detecting cheating with programming assignments in computer science .
Since submitting programs is acceptable in computer science courses , fears of cheating should not make submitting formal proofs in mathematics unacceptable .
To Practice Being a Mathematician
To give you practice in ‘ formal ’ proofs in set theory
I am not sure what the TA meant by ‘ formal ’ proofs .
I would guess a ‘ formal ’ proof is a proof written is sufficient detail to enable a peer mathematician to construct a fully detailed formal proof if wanted .
Clearly given an actual formal proof satisfies this .
The hypothetical peer mathematician need not do any work .
To develop the skills in you to enable you to read research - level papers and to do independent research on you own , proving novel theorems , etc .
I do not see how assignments requiring proofs helps a student read research - level papers and to do independent research on their own .
Reading research papers can help the student understand the material better , enabling them to write formal proofs , but this is not guaranteed to happen by such an assignment .
The ability to prove novel theorems comes from gaining an understanding of the subject .
As I have remarked already , understanding of the subject is required to create formal proofs , so the ability to write formal proofs will help a student prove novel theorems .
Future Mathematicians
I am certain that creating formal proofs will someday be common place in the world of the working mathematician , and we will realise far more is gained than lost by such a practice .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Some of the security officials at this weekend 's Super Bowl will be scrutinizing the body language and demeanor of fans as part of the effort to spot suspicious and possibly dangerous people in the crowd .
Fans take in the sights Thursday at the NFL Experience at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa , Florida .
The Transportation Security Administration says it will have several teams of behavior - detection officers working with local police in Tampa , Florida , as an added security measure for the high - profile game .
TSA spokesman Christopher
White said that the officers are being sent at the request of the local police and the FBI , and that it 's the first time such officers are assisting with a major sports event .
" Unlike technology , the human detection officers can be anywhere , " White said .
" They can be completely unobtrusive . "
The TSA officers will be wearing their uniforms and working in teams with police along the stadium 's security perimeter but wo n't work inside the stadium as fans watch the game .
They 'll also be around key hotels associated with the Super Bowl , the airport and other transportation centers in Tampa .
Watch what goes on at Super Bowl media day »
According to White , if a TSA officer observes someone displaying unusual behavior , a local police officer will follow up by questioning the person .
This month , the TSA also held a four - hour training session on behavior detection for about 100 Tampa - area police .
The TSA officers themselves undergo an initial seven days of training before being paired with experienced officers and having follow - up training .
Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union said such behavior screening is a bad idea .
" There is no scientific evidence behavior profiling works to pick out terrorists or criminals , " Steinhardt said .
The TSA uses behavior screening daily at airports .
White said officers also have helped out at such high - profile events as last week 's presidential inauguration and the Republican and Democratic national conventions .

All the news this morning seems focused on that miraculous plane landing yesterday on the Hudson , and it really is pretty impressive what that pilot pulled off .
I will leave it to the oddsmakers to figure out what the chances are of something like that happening with no fatalities , but I would bet they are pretty long odds .
The crew deserves a hand , too , as it appears they had those people out of there in an orderly fashion in no time .
All of this has been said before , and probably better , so let me move to the things that I find interesting .
1. ) The NTSB is sending 20 people to investigate the wreck .
I am not sure what it is , but I am fascinated by these guys ( and talk about them every chance I get ) .
My question - what do they do all year when there are not big crashes like this ?
Are they folks who have other jobs and are on call ?
Or are there enough wrecks of minor note that they are kept busy that way until the big one ?
2. ) The plane apparently had something called a ditch switch , which the pilot his in situations just like this one and the entire underbelly of the plane is then sealed .
That is why the plane was especially buoyant .
Are these on most planes ?
The last time I flew , I remembered thinking to myself that the airlines must have spent billions of dollars on design and engineering on all the little safety things that , in the life of a plane , will probably never ever get used , but sure do make a difference when you need it .
This seems to be one of them .
At any rate , about that ditch switch - never heard of it before .
Any pilots out there who can elaborate ?
3. ) I can not believe more folks have not had to be treated for hypothermia .
The bitter cold and the water yesterday seems like a classic case of the Siberian dilemma .
More than 7,600 dinosaur bones have been found in China , a discovery that could help establish why they died out .
The find at Zhucheng , in Shandong province , has become known as " Dinosaur City " as a result of bones uncovered there since the 1960s .
It is thought to be the biggest in the world and includes the remains of the predator Tyrannosaurus rex and what is thought to be the largest " duck - billed " dinosaur .
Chinese state media reported that researchers from the Academy of Sciences had unearthed the bones during a dig that began in March .
Many of the finds have been dated to the late Cretaceous period when most dinosaurs died out and it is hoped they could shed new light on one of the abiding questions of evolutionary science .
Professor Zhao Xijin , the palaeontologist in charge of the excavations , said : " This group of fossilised dinosaurs is currently the largest ever discovered in the world ... in terms of area .
The discoveries are expected to contribute to research on the mystery of dinosaur extinction . "

The fossil field was found during exploratory mining work .
A single pit several hundred metres in length yielded about 3,000 bones .
Paul Barrett , from the Natural History Museum in London , said the claim that the discovery was the " world 's largest " was credible .
It is thought the presence of so many bones in a relatively small area could be significant and help scientists work out what caused their sudden disappearance worldwide .
More bones are expected to be uncovered and a paper is expected to be published in a scientific journal this year .
Meanwhile , officials in Shandong will work on creating a fossil park that will be open for visitors .

A Canadian woman who went missing during a blizzard last week has been found alive , buried in 23in ( 58 cm ) of snow , police say .
Rescuers were shocked to find Donna Molnar , of Ancaster , west of Toronto , still conscious after she spent three days outside in freezing temperatures .
Ms Molnar , 55 , vanished on Friday after her car became stuck in a snowy field , and is now being treated in hospital .
Police dog Ace and his handler Ray Lau have been credited with the find .
" When I came up to her she was covered in snow , just her face and her neckline were exposed , " rescuer Ray Lau said .
" I was surprised she was alive . "
Mr Lau found Ms Molnar on Monday , just a few hundred yards away from her four wheel drive car , wearing little more than a winter jacket and suffering from hypothermia .
Police credited the insulating effect of the snow with keeping her alive .
Staff Sgt Mark
Cox said she was suffering from frostbite and could lose some of her extremities , although she was expected to survive .
" That 's the miracle .
That 's a Christmas miracle .
Sometimes the good do n't die young , " said Mark Mackesy , a family friend who spent the weekend comforting Ms Molnar 's husband and son .
" Donna Molnar is an exceptional person , " he added .
Canada and much of the US have been hit by extreme winter weather in recent days , with vast amounts of snow falling from coast to coast .
Transport has been disrupted and thousands of homes have been left without power .
Conservation group WWF says that more than 1,000 species new to science have been recorded in South - East Asia 's Greater Mekong region over the past decade .
These include 22 snake species , including this green pitviper ( Trimeresurus gumprechti ) .
The " dragon millipede " ( Desmoxytes purpurosea ) was first described in 2007 by scientists in Thailand .
Researchers suggest the bright colouring acts as a warning to would - be predators , as the millipede has glands that produce cyanide as a defence mechanism .
The Laotian rock rat ( Laonastes aenigmamus ) was first recorded by scientists at a food market in Laos .
Remarkably , researchers say this species is the sole survivor of an ancient group of rodents understood to have died out 11 million years ago .
The large and aggressive Heteropoda dagmarae was found in forests of northern and central Laos .
The nocturnal spider skillfully ambushes its prey from shrubs , trees , or bamboo between two and four metres from the ground .
Tree frog Chiromantis samkosensis , found in Cambodia , has a number of unique characteristics that distinguishes it from other Asian Chiromantis species , including green blood and turquoise bones .
Scientists say finding so many species , such as the Gekko scientiadventura , suggests that many more creatures are still to be described in the region , which covers Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Thailand , Vietnam and China 's Yunnan province .

I ’ve been getting back into Haskell lately because I ’ve been using the XMonad window manager , which is written and configured in Haskell .
Haskell has always held a special place in my heart ; I taught myself Haskell by plowing through the ironically - named “ Gentle Introduction to Haskell ” several years ago , and it taught me more about clean side - effect free functional programming than any amount of Lisp .
A programming language must be considered in the context of its community , and Haskell has an exemplary one .
#xmonad is without a doubt one of the friendliest and most helpful channels on IRC , without any of the elite condescension one usually finds on channels devoted to hardcore geek tools like Emacs .
I have come to believe , however , that this polite exterior conceals a deep and consuming madness .
I refer to the Haskell community ’s addiction to defining operators .
Haskell permits virtually any string of nonword characters to be defined as a new operator .
This in itself is not a problem , but Haskell programmers seem not to have absorbed the lesson that just because you can , does n’t mean you should .
To make my point , I call upon Mark Twain , somewhat paraphrased :
In my note - book I find this entry : July 1 . —
In the hospital yesterday , an operator of thirteen characters was successfully removed from a patient — a web developer from near Baltimore ; but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place , under the impression that he contained a stack trace , he died .
The sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community .
That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject — the length and obscurity of Haskell operators .
Some Haskell operators are so long that they have a perspective .
Observe these examples : -->
< &&>
| || These things are not operators , they are symbolic processions .
And they are not rare ; one can open an xmonad.hs at any time and see them marching majestically across the screen — and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music , too .
They impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject .
I take a great interest in these curiosities .
Whenever I come across a good one , I stuff it and put it in my museum .
In this way I have made quite a valuable collection .
When I get duplicates , I exchange with other collectors , and thus increase the variety of my stock .
Here are some specimens which I lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric - a - brac hunter : .|.

Of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the LCD screen , it adorns and ennobles that coding landscape — but at the same time it is a great distress to the new student , for it blocks up his way ; he cannot crawl under it , or climb over it , or tunnel through it .

MURRAYVILLE , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A few weeks before 13 - year - old Jonathan King killed himself , he told his parents that his teachers had put him in " time - out . "
The room where Jonathan King hanged himself is shown after his death .
It is no longer used , a school official said .
" We thought that meant go sit in the corner and be quiet for a few minutes , " Tina King said , tears washing her face as she remembered the child she called " our baby ... a good kid . "
But time - out in the boy 's north Georgia special education school was spent in something akin to a prison cell -- a concrete room latched from the outside , its tiny window obscured by a piece of paper .
Called a seclusion room , it 's where in November 2004 , Jonathan hanged himself with a cord a teacher gave him to hold up his pants .
Watch Jonathan 's parents on their son's death »
An attorney representing the school has denied any wrongdoing .
Seclusion rooms , sometimes called time - out rooms , are used across the nation , generally for special needs children .
Critics say that along with the death of Jonathan , many mentally disabled and autistic children have been injured or traumatized .
Few states have laws on using seclusion rooms , though 24 states have written guidelines , according to a 2007 study conducted by a Clemson University researcher .
Texas , which was included in that study , has stopped using seclusion and restraint .
Georgia has just begun to draft guidelines , four years after Jonathan 's death .
Based on conversations with officials in 22 states with written guidelines , seclusion is intended as a last resort when other attempts to calm a child have failed or when a student is hurting himself or others .
Michigan requires that a child held in seclusion have constant supervision from an instructor trained specifically in special education , and that confinement not exceed 15 minutes .
Connecticut education spokesman Tom Murphy said " time - out rooms " were used sparingly and were " usually small rooms with padding on the walls . "
Only Vermont tracks how many children are kept in seclusion from year to year , though two other states , Minnesota and New Mexico , say they have been using the rooms less frequently in recent years .
Dr. Veronica Garcia , New Mexico 's education secretary , said her state had found more sophisticated and better ways to solve behavior problems .
Garcia , whose brother is autistic , said , " The idea of confining a child in a room repeatedly and as punishment , that 's an ethics violation I would never tolerate . "
But researchers say that the rooms , in some cases , are being misused and that children are suffering .
Public schools in the United States are now educating more than half a million more students with disabilities than they did a decade ago , according to the National Education Association .
" Teachers are n't trained to handle that , " said Dr. Roger Pierangelo , executive director of the National Association of Special Education Teachers .
" When you have an out - of - control student threatening your class -- it 's not right and it can be very damaging -- but seclusion is used as a ' quick fix ' in many cases . "
Former Rhode Island special education superintendent Leslie Ryan told CNN that she thought she was helping a disabled fifth - grader by keeping him in a " chill room " in the basement of a public elementary school that was later deemed a fire hazard .
" All I know is I tried to help this boy , and I had very few options , " Ryan said .
After the public learned of the room , she resigned from her post with the department but remains with the school .
School records do not indicate why Jonathan King was repeatedly confined to the concrete room or what , if any , positive outcome was expected .
His parents say they do n't recognize the boy described in records as one who liked to kick and punch his classmates .
They have launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the school -- the Alpine Program in Gainesville -- which has denied any wrongdoing .
A Georgia judge is expected to rule soon on whether the case can be brought before a jury .
Jonathan 's parents say the boy had been diagnosed since kindergarten with severe depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
But his father remembers him as a boy who was happy when he sang in the church choir .
" He was a hugger , liked to go fishing with me and run after me saying , ' Daddy , when are we going to the lake ? ' " Don King said .
King said that he wanted to know if there were similar situations in other schools and that critics of seclusion rooms fear there could be .
" Jonathan 's case is the worst of the worst , but it should be a warning .
It 's reasonable to think that it could happen in all the other schools that use seclusion on disabled children -- largely because the use of seclusion goes so unchecked , " said Jane Hudson , an attorney with the National Disability Rights Network .
" This is one of those most unregulated , unresearched areas I 've come across , " said Joseph Ryan , a Clemson University special education researcher who has worked in schools for disabled kids and co-authored a study on the use of seclusion .
" You have very little oversight in schools of these rooms -- first because the general public does n't really even know they exist , " he said .
There is no national database tracking seclusion incidents in schools , though many have been described in media reports , lawsuits , disability advocacy groups ' investigations and on blogs catering to parents who say their child had been held in seclusion .
Disability Rights California , a federally funded watchdog group , found that teachers dragged children into seclusion rooms they could not leave .
In one case , they found a retarded 8 - year - old had been locked alone in a seclusion room in a northeast California elementary school for at least 31 days in a year .
" What we found outrageous was that we went to the schools and asked to see the rooms and were denied , " said Leslie Morrison , a psychiatric nurse and attorney who led the 2007 investigation that substantiated at least six cases of abuse involving seclusion in public schools .
" It took a lot of fighting to eventually get in to see where these children were held . "
CNN asked every school official interviewed if a reporter could visit a seclusion room and was denied every time .
In other instances of alleged abuse :
• A Tennessee mother alleged in a federal suit against the Learn Center in Clinton that her 51 - pound 9 - year - old autistic son was bruised when school instructors used their body weight on his legs and torso to hold him down before putting him in a " quiet room " for four hours .
Principal Gary Houck of the Learn Center , which serves disabled children , said lawyers have advised him not to discuss the case .
• Eight - year - old Isabel Loeffler , who has autism , was held down by her teachers and confined in a storage closet where she pulled out her hair and wet her pants at her Dallas County , Iowa , elementary school .
Last year , a judge found that the school had violated the girl 's rights .
" What we 're talking about is trauma , " said her father , Doug Loeffler .
" She spent hours in wet clothes , crying to be let out . "
Waukee school district attorney Matt Novak told CNN that the school has denied any wrongdoing .
• A mentally retarded 14 - year - old in Killeen , Texas , died from his teachers pressing on his chest in an effort to restrain him in 2001 .
Texas passed a law to limit both restraint and seclusion in schools because the two methods are often used together .
Federal law requires that schools develop behavioral plans for students with disabilities .
These plans are supposed to explicitly explain behavior problems and methods the teacher is allowed to use to stop it , including using music to calm a child or allowing a student to take a break from schoolwork .
A behavioral plan for Jonathan King , provided to CNN by the Kings ' attorney , shows that Jonathan was confined in the seclusion room on 15 separate days for infractions ranging from cursing and threatening other students to physically striking classmates .
Howard " Sandy " Addis , the director of the Pioneer education agency which oversees Alpine , said that the room where Jonathan died is no longer in use .
Citing the ongoing litigation , he declined to answer questions about the King case but defended the use of seclusion for " an emergency safety situation . "
The Alpine Program 's attorney , Phil Hartley , said Jonathan 's actions leading up to his suicide did not suggest the boy was " serious " about killing himself .
Jonathan 's actions were an " effort to get attention , " Hartley said .
" This is a program designed for students with severe emotional disabilities and problems , " he said .
" It is a program which frequently deals with students who use various methods of getting attention , avoiding work . "
A substitute employee placed in charge of watching the room on the day Jonathan died said in an affidavit that he had no training in the use of seclusion , and did n't know Jonathan had threatened suicide weeks earlier .
The Kings say they would have removed their son from the school if they knew he was being held in seclusion , or that he had expressed a desire to hurt himself .
" We would have home schooled him or taken him to another psychologist , " said Don King .
" If we would have known , our boy would have never been in that room .
He would still be alive . "

Freddie Mac on Friday plans to announce a first - of - a - kind plan that lets homeowners and tenants temporarily stay in homes in foreclosure by renting them back , an effort to stop many of the sudden evictions that have come along with the housing crisis .
The program will let thousands of qualified former homeowners , as well as families renting from landlords , enter into a monthly lease on their homes after they have been acquired by Freddie Mac through foreclosure .
Freddie Mac officials expect the program to help about 8,600 families in 2009 .
The program gives homeowners and renters more time to find a new place to live and also keeps homes occupied .
That 's a plus for neighborhoods where numerous foreclosures have led to empty , unmaintained , vandalized properties .
" For tenants , it 's a big difference , " says Mark Zandi , an economist with Moody 's Economy.com .
" If this acts as a benchmark for other mortgage servicers , it would be a very positive development .
It 's a win-win . " Details of the program : • Leases will be on a month - to - month basis .
• Tenants and homeowners will only have to pay market - value or existing lease rents , not the mortgage payments .
Freddie Mac will hire a property management company to determine that amount .
• Tenants and homeowners must be able to show proof that they have enough income to pay the monthly rental amount .
• Freddie Mac will also explore loan - modification options that might be available for some borrowers .
The Freddie Mac initiative comes as the government is stepping up efforts to stem a wave of foreclosures that caught more than 2.3 million homeowners last year , up 81 % from 2007 .
The Obama administration has pledged to spend up to $ 100 billion to help people avoid losing their homes .
In mid-December , Fannie Mae also rolled out a policy that allows renters in a property that is being foreclosed on to rent that home rather than be evicted .
It does not include homeowners .
Up to 10,000 families are expected to be helped by Fannie 's rental policy ; Freddie expects about a 30 % acceptance rate .
The Federal Reserve this week announced a policy to help some distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure .
The Fed said it would work with companies servicing mortgages now owned by the Fed to modify qualifying mortgages of homeowners that are 60 days or more delinquent on payments .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
The Zimbabwean government has declared a national emergency in the face of a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 560 people , the state - owned newspaper The Herald said Thursday .
A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe .
Harare also appealed for help for its hospitals , which Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said " are literally not functioning . "
" Our staff is demotivated and we need your support to ensure that they start coming to work and our health system is revived , " he said at a meeting of donors including United Nations agencies , embassies and non-governmental institutions , The Herald reported .
Cholera cases are on the increase in nine of Zimbabwe 's 10 provinces , the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) warned Wednesday .
It blamed " poor water and sanitation supply , a collapsed health system and limited government capacity to respond to the emergency . "
OCHA said the water - borne outbreak had killed at least 565 people and sickened more than 11,000 .

In Harare province , more than one in four people to contract the disease had died and there were nearly 7,000 new cases , OCHA said .
The health crisis is taking place against a background of increased security in the face of expected runs on banks .
Armored cars patrolled the streets of Zimbabwe 's capital and residents flocked to banks Thursday after limits on cash withdrawals were lifted in the inflation - ravaged African nation .
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars -- about 25 U.S. cents , and about a quarter of the price of a loaf of bread .
But faced with mounting chaos in a country already in economic free fall , the bank decided last week to raise that limit to 100 million dollars ( $ 50 U.S. ) per week .
Soldiers were deployed to all banks in anticipation of throngs of people lining up to withdraw money Thursday , when the increase took effect .
Wednesday , police chased depositors away and arrested union leaders who planned to protest the limits .
Zimbabwe 's inflation rate of 231 million percent is the world 's highest .
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said 69 people were arrested across the country during Wednesday 's demonstrations .
Amnesty International has demanded to know the whereabouts of human rights activist Jestina Mukoko .
The group said Mukoko was abducted at dawn Wednesday by armed men in plainclothes posing as police .
And angry , unpaid soldiers clashed with foreign currency exchangers and some civilians Monday , three days after troops who had failed to get cash from their banks looted shops they suspected to be illegally dealing in foreign currency .

Economic Distress and Fear
This was the Quotation of the Day from January 12 :
Part of the debtor mentality is a constant , frantically suppressed undercurrent of terror .
We have one of the highest debt - to - income ratios in the world , and apparently most of us are two paychecks from the street .
Those in power — governments , employers — exploit this , to great effect .
Frightened people are obedient — not just physically , but intellectually and emotionally .
If your employer tells you to work overtime , and you know that refusing could jeopardize everything you have , then not only do you work the overtime , but you convince yourself that you ’re doing it voluntarily , out of loyalty to the company ; because the alternative is to acknowledge that you are living in terror .
Before you know it , you ’ve persuaded yourself that you have a profound emotional attachment to some vast multinational corporation : you ’ve indentured not just your working hours , but your entire thought process .
The only people who are capable of either unfettered action or unfettered thought are those who — either because they ’re heroically brave , or because they ’re insane , or because they know themselves to be safe — are free from fear .
Quote is from The Likeness , a novel set in Ireland , by Tana French .

( CNN ) -- Authorities in Kansas are looking for a boy who disappeared about a decade ago , but was not reported missing until a few weeks ago .
Adam Herrman has not been seen since 1999 , when he was 11 or 12 .
" We do n't know what happened to Adam Herrman past ' 99 , when he was last seen , " Butler County Sheriff Craig Murphy said at a news conference in El Dorado .
" Is he alive , is he dead ?
That one I can't answer because we do n't know , " he added .
Adam was 11 or 12 when he was last seen , Murphy said .
At the time , he was living in a mobile home park in Towanda , a small town in southern Kansas , with his adoptive parents , Doug and Valerie Herrman .
The couple did not report him missing , Murphy said .
A few weeks ago , a person notified Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Children 's Unit of a " concern " regarding Adam , Murphy said .
The agency did not immediately return CNN 's phone call seeking additional information .
Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise , who is representing Adam 's adoptive parents , said the couple " really rue the fact that they did n't " report the boy missing .
" They feel very guilty " about not doing that , he said in a telephone interview .
The couple told him the boy had run away frequently , he said , and they believed him to be either with his biological parents or homeless .
Although the Herrmans did not report him missing , " they were very worried about him , " he said .
Authorities have searched the Pine Ridge Mobile Home Park , where the family had lived , and discovered an " answer " to one of their questions , Murphy said , without explaining .
" We did find one of the answers we were looking for , but I am holding that one very tightly , " he said .
Eisenbise said authorities also executed a search warrant on December 15 at the Herrmans ' home in Derby , a town just outside of Wichita .
They took the couple 's computer , he said .
Murphy said the couple is cooperating and had not been charged with anything .
Citing a relative , the Wichita Eagle reported the Herrmans had taken Adam into foster care and later adopted him .
Michelle Ponce of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services , which oversees adoption and foster care , said she could not release any details regard Adam 's case , and could confirm only that he had been in foster care at some point , but was no longer in foster care in 1999 .
Adam had been placed in the Herrmans ' care when he was about 2 , Murphy said in a phone interview .
He had been named Irvin Groeninger III when he was born on June 8 , 1987 , Murphy said , and it was not clear when his name was changed .
His biological parents relinquished their rights as parents about two decades ago , and Adam and his siblings were put in different foster homes , CNN affiliate KWCH reported .
" I thought what I was doing for them was in the best interest of the children and evidently it was n't , " Irvin Groeninger told KWCH .
" If he was still in my custody this would have never happened . "
Adam 's sister , Tiffany Broadfoot , 22 , said she last saw her brother about 14 years ago at a birthday party .
A year or two later , he sent her a Christmas card , she said .
" And that was the end of my contact with him , " she told KWCH .
" He had the cutest little round face , little bitty freckles right up here on the tip of his cheek , " she remembered .
" I 'm just awestruck as how something like that could actually happen , and how he could be missing as long as he 's been and nobody say anything , " she said .
Murphy said Adam 's name appears on a legal document later than 1999 .
" We know that he was listed in a legal action as if he was still living at home , and I 'm not certain of the date , but it was beyond 1999 , " he told CNN .

Brown pushes D.A. to act swiftly in BART case State attorney general sending high - level aide to prosecutor 's office to observe proceedings
Attorney General Jerry Brown talks to reporters in Sacramento , Calif. , Tuesday , Sept. 16 , 2008 .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger remains silent about whether he will sign or veto the state budget lawmakers approved early Tuesday , raising the possibility of a rare override veto in the legislature .
The last time lawmakers mounted a successful override was 1979 , when Brown was governor .

Attorney General Jerry Brown , concerned about the pace of the investigation into a BART police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed man early New Year 's Day , said Saturday that he is sending an observer to the Alameda County district attorney 's office to encourage prompt action .
" The wheels of justice cannot grind so slowly that it appears that justice is not being served , " Brown said at a news conference in his Oakland office after meeting with leaders of the NAACP , who called for criminal charges .
While declining to criticize District Attorney Tom Orloff , Brown said he 's not sure why Orloff needs two weeks to decide whether to prosecute the officer .
Also on Saturday , the union that represents the Bay Area Rapid Transit system 's 296 police officers and other personnel said it supports the current investigations by BART and the prosecutor 's office into police conduct in the death of Oscar Grant at BART 's Fruitvale Station in Oakland .
" We have been working with the Alameda County district attorney 's office , BART management and the Oakland Police Department to ensure that all of the facts are revealed in an expeditious and transparent manner , " Jesse Sekhon , president of the BART Police Officers Association , said in a statement .
He offered condolences to Grant 's family and friends .
Grant , 22 , of Hayward , was shot in the back while lying facedown on the Fruitvale Station platform at about 2:15 a.m. on Jan .
1 . He was one of a group of young men taken into custody by BART police at the station after a fight on a train from San Francisco .
Johannes Mehserle , 27 , the officer who fired the shot , quit his job Wednesday , the day he was scheduled to be questioned by BART investigators , who could have ordered him to answer or face disciplinary action .
Exercising his right to remain silent , he has declined to speak to Orloff 's office , which is looking into possible criminal charges .
Neither Mehserle nor his lawyers have issued any public statements .
Investigators are reportedly looking into the possibility that Mehserle thought he was firing his Taser stun gun - a belief that would make the killing accidental and probably not subject to a murder prosecution .
Orloff said Thursday he would decide in about two weeks whether to file charges .
Brown told reporters Saturday he has spoken with Orloff and is confident that " he is carrying this investigation out in the manner he should . "
But the attorney general , whose office oversees county district attorneys , added that " I 'd like to understand why it would take that long " to decide whether to prosecute .
Brown said he will send a high - ranking deputy , whom he did not identify , to Orloff 's office to meet with the prosecutor 's staff , observe the investigation and report back to him .
" I want to make sure that we 're pushing this along , " Brown said .
Orloff told the Associated Press on Saturday that he agreed with the arrangement .
" The more people that look at this the better , " he said .
Alice Huffman , state president of the NAACP , said the participation of Brown 's office should reduce suspicions that arise in the community when " law enforcement is investigating itself . "
She also said videos of the events , taken by witnesses ' cell phone cameras and widely viewed on television and the Internet , should leave little room for doubt that the shooting was criminal .
" It looked like murder to me , " Huffman said .
" We would not be happy if there were no criminal charges . "
If Orloff does n't prosecute , she added , the NAACP will ask the U.S. attorney 's office to file federal civil rights charges against Mehserle .
Brown - who , as governor from 1975 to 1983 , appointed Huffman director of the state Office of Economic Opportunity and chief deputy director of parks and recreation - said he had seen one of the videos and found it " horrifying ... extremely disturbing . "
But as a lawyer , he said , he is suspending judgment until all the facts are in .
He declined to say whether he thinks Mehserle should be prosecuted .
A lawyer for Grant 's mother and his 4 - year - old daughter has filed a $ 25 million claim against the BART system , the first step toward a possible lawsuit .
The shooting , and transit system officials ' virtual silence for a week afterward , have also fueled angry demonstrations at several BART stations .
The largest protest , a rally at the Fruitvale Station on Wednesday , was peaceful , but some of the participants later marched to downtown Oakland and smashed windows , set cars and trash bins on fire and damaged more than 300 businesses .
Police arrested more than 100 people .
Asked about the melee , Brown - Oakland 's mayor from 1998 to 2006 - said , " Jumping on a police car has nothing to do with bringing this case to a close . "
The rioters , he said , were " declaring war on downtown Oakland . "
He and other participants at the news conference agreed , however , that large segments of the community are unhappy with authorities ' response to the shooting .
Assemblyman Sandré Swanson , D - Alameda , said the legislative Black Caucus , which he chairs , is concerned at " the pace of the investigation " and " the lack of public confidence . "
Swanson , whose district includes the scene of the shooting , said he will work with Brown 's office to see if legislation is needed to improve BART police training .
Two other Bay Area legislators , Assemblyman Tom Ammiano and state Sen.
Leland Yee , both San Francisco Democrats , have introduced bills to establish a civilian review board for the transit system 's police .
“ People who created the problem are now in charge ”

Monday , Jan 19th , 2009
A prominent PhD economist has slammed the latest round of bank bailouts and argued that they will not work because the financial crisis was caused and prolonged by such activity in the first place .
Marc Faber , founder and managing director of Hong Kong - based Marc Faber Ltd. , has argued that propping up weak companies with taxpayer money is foolhardy .
“ The financial crisis has occurred because of government interventions , ” Faber told CNBC ’s “ Squawk Box Europe . ”
“ Specifically central banks , or specifically the US Fed , by keeping interest rates artificially low for too long , they created a huge leverage in the system .
So the people who created the problem now are in charge to bail out the system and that ’s why I am very skeptical that it would work , ” Faber explained .
“ The contractions actually serve to build for the future growth , because the weak competitors are eliminated .
If you support the weak competitors you essentially penalize the strong competitors and therefore I am very much against these bailout packages . ” he added .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Faber , who accurately predicted both the financial crash of 1987 and the current crisis , also warned that U.S. government bonds may be “ the shoe to drop some time in 2009 or maybe next year , ” warning that they will lose value as foreign investors lose confidence .
He cited gold and other commodities as sound investments and described the U.S. dollar as “ a disastrous currency ” , but pointed out that other paper currencies are even worse .

Faber , editor & publisher of the Gloom , Boom and Doom Report , has previously said that he believes that there will be a bear rally for a couple of months , and then a further crash .
He also believes that the current crisis could be far worse than the great depression , precisely because of government interventions , and that eventually the U.S. will go bankrupt .
The UK government has announced that it will allow banks to insure against steep losses and will guarantee their debt at a cost of up to £ 200 billion .
Meanwhile U.S. President Elect Barack Obama is reportedly considering the creation of a government run bank to acquire bad assets .

From the official inauguration website :
" The Swearing - in ceremony takes place on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol with the president - elect being sworn - in by 12 noon on January 20 .
Amendment XX to the U.S. Constitution states that the term of the President expires at noon on January 20 . "

I 'm not sure how old you are , but if you 're starting to take an interest in politics ( good on you ! ) , you 'll quickly realize that there are many bitter , sad people who refuse to be happy for other people and their accomplishments .

I pity them .
The student with shaggy hair hanging low over his eyes , his head pulled turtle - like into a leather jacket , was plainly embarrassed by his ignorance .
Not until three months ago , when he got back the results of his blood test , had the 22 - year - old art student at a Beijing university heard the term “ HIV . ”
None of his friends knew how to use condoms or had any idea why they should .
“ By the time they realized , it was too late , ” said the student , who asked not to be named .
Belatedly , China is trying to get out the word about the AIDS virus and officials are doing it in the typically oversize way that befits the world ’s most populous nation , deploying an army of volunteers .

To mark World AIDS Day on Dec. 1 , a banner of a giant red ribbon was draped from the huge National Stadium , known as the Bird ’s Nest , used in the Summer Olympics .
President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao were widely photographed with their arms around HIV - positive people .
The state media have been filled with photographs and editorials about combating the discrimination and isolation felt by AIDS victims .
“ Time to recognize that AIDS is a disease , not a shame , ” extolled the official New China News Agency recently .
The publicity blitz is surprising for an authoritarian government that has resorted to cover - up and denial when it came to HIV and AIDS .
Over the years , activists have been arrested and harassed for sharing information about acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
One of the best known , Hu Jia , has been in prison for almost a year on charges of “ subverting state power . ”
The extent of ignorance about sexually transmitted diseases is staggering .
A recent poll of 6,000 Chinese that included students , migrant workers and blue - and white - collar workers found that 48 % thought the AIDS virus was transmitted by mosquitoes .

Yet it is clear that AIDS awareness has come out of the closet here , with increasing resources devoted to the 700,000 or more Chinese who are HIV - positive .
Although China does not have the world ’s largest HIV / AIDS problem -- the HIV infection rate is estimated at less than 0.1 % -- the virus has been spreading fast enough among some populations that the government became alarmed .
Migrant workers are particularly susceptible because they come from rural areas with little sexual education and often patronize prostitutes during years of separation from their families .
Last month the Chinese government released a short educational film starring actor Wang Baoqiang and a migrant worker who is HIV - positive .
HIV is also spreading fast among intravenous drug users in western China , particularly Yunnan province bordering Myanmar , and in the Xinjiang region .
“ It is very difficult to stop AIDS among drug users .
The local governments do n’t want us working with this population because they consider them criminals , ” said Ju He , a Beijing - based AIDS activist .

At times when Ju’s group has tried to distribute clean needles to prevent drug users from spreading the virus among themselves , local police have stationed themselves across the street to arrest anyone who shows up .
During a conference Dec. 8 -10 in Beijing of nongovernmental organizations , activists described the Chinese government ’s handling of AIDS as “ schizophrenic . ”
When AIDS emerged in the 1980s , Chinese Communist propaganda stigmatized it as a disease of capitalists and foreigners .
Tens of thousands of people were infected in rural China in the mid-1990s through reckless blood donation schemes in which people were given transfusions of contaminated blood .
Surviving victims and their children , many of them HIV - positive , are still agitating for compensation , and their efforts have often gotten them in legal trouble in a country where public protests are not permitted .

“ In China , the problem is not so much with the central government or the provincial government , ” said Li Dan , a Beijing AIDS expert .
“ At the local level , there are officials who treat anybody involved with AIDS as a criminal or a troublemaker . ”
The situation is better in Beijing than elsewhere in the country .
Volunteer groups give out condoms at bars and bathhouses .
On World AIDS Day , the Chaoyang administrative district ’s high school students heard special lectures and recited pledges to combat the disease .
“ The Chinese government made some terrible mistakes in the past , but there has been a great , great deal of change , ” said Xiao Dong , who runs a volunteer group in Beijing .
“ From my point of view , the Chinese government is now facing the historical problem of AIDS . ”

A tiny asteroid discovered just hours ago at an Arizona observatory will enter Earth 's atmosphere harmlessly at approximately 10:46 p.m.
Eastern time tonight ( 2:46 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time ) .
There is no danger to people or property since the asteroid will not reach the ground .
It is between 3 and 15 feet ( 1 - 5 m ) in diameter and will burn up in the upper atmosphere , well above aircraft heights .
A brilliant fireball will be visible as a result .
" We want to stress that this object is not a threat , " said Dr. Timothy Spahr , director of the International Astronomical Union 's Minor Planet Center .
" We 're excited since this is the first time we have issued a prediction that an object will enter Earth 's atmosphere , " Spahr added .
Odds are between 99.8 and 100 percent that the object will encounter Earth , according to calculations provided by Andrea Milani of the University of Pisa .
When a meteoroid ( small asteroid ) enters the atmosphere , it compresses the air in front of it .
That compression heats the air , which in turn heats the object , causing it to glow and vaporize .
Once it starts to glow , the object is called a meteor .
" A typical meteor comes from an object the size of a grain of sand , " explained Gareth Williams of the Minor Planet Center .
" This meteor will be a real humdinger in comparison ! "
The meteor is expected to be visible from eastern Africa as an extremely bright fireball traveling rapidly across the sky from west to east . *
The object is expected to enter the atmosphere over northern Sudan at a shallow angle .
" We 're eager for observations from astronomers near the asteroid 's approach path .
We really hope that someone will manage to photograph it , " said Williams .
The Minor Planet Center , which is located at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , serves as the worldwide clearinghouse for asteroid and comet observations .
It collects , checks and disseminates observations and calculates orbits .
* The original text of this release was in error , stating that the asteroid would track northeast to southwest .
On his first full day as president , almost everything Barack Obama does qualifies as unprecedented .
But one of the more notable firsts on Wednesday was a series of calls President Obama made this morning to four Middle Eastern leaders commenting about the Gaza crisis and offering support for a fragile cease - fire .
He is now the one president we have
While Mr. Obama was deeply engaged in dealing with the nation ’s economic crisis as president - elect , he was reticent in commenting on the Gaza conflict and often cited the truism that “ we have only one president at a time . ”
But on the day he first occupied the Oval Office , Obama called President Mubarak of Egypt , Prime Minister Olmert of Israel , King Abdullah of Jordan , and President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority .
In a statement , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs described the calls as “ warm , ” adding that “ the president appreciated the spirit of partnership . ”
In the final days of the Bush administration an Israeli offensive ravaged Gaza and killed at least 1,300 Palestinians , many of them civilians .
Israel said it acted to stop rocket attacks launched from Gaza and to stop arms smuggling that endangered its population .
Promising to be engaged
Obama used the calls to “ communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab - Israeli peace from the beginning of his term , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
The presidential spokesman said Obama “ emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the cease - fire by establishing an effective antismuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming , and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza . ”
Meeting on Iraq in ' The Woodshed '
International issues will also play a major role in Obama ’s afternoon .
At 4:15 p.m. he is slated to hold a meeting on Iraq in the Situation Room located in the basement of the West Wing .
Sometimes called “ The Woodshed , ” the secure facility was renovated in 2006 and 2007 , cutting back on the wood paneling behind its nickname .
Those who will join the president for a discussion of his Iraq policy are Vice President Joseph Biden , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , National Security Advisor James Jones , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen , and Gen. David Petraeus , commander in chief of US Central Command .
In his inaugural address on Tuesday , Obama said his goal was to “ responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard - earned peace in Afghanistan . ”
Pastafarian Damon has put us all to shame with this stunning FSM Holiday light display .
Behold :
I think we could all learn something from Damon .
Well done , sir .
The trailer for Imagine That .
In Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies ' family comedy Imagine That , Eddie Murphy stars as a successful financial executive who has more time for his blackberry than his seven - year - old daughter ( Yara Shahidi ) .
When he has a crisis of confidence and his career starts going down the drain , however , he finds the solution to all his problems in his daughter 's imaginary world .
Eddie Murphy was nominated for two Razzie Awards which “ Celebrates ” the worst in film .
He was nominated for worst actor for Imagine That and for worst actor of the decade .
This was also the first Nickelodeon production to receive a Razzie nomination .
Imagine
That had a reported budget of $ 55 million but only managed to muster up just over $ 16 million in the United States .
This was just one of the many box office disappointments for Eddie Murphy in recent years .
Although the film was released in June of 2009 , it was filmed almost two years prior in the fall of 2007 .
Eddie Murphy ’s film choices have been hit or miss for the last two decades but he does seem to gravitate toward the family - friendly films like Imagine That .
The trailer for Imagine That starts out like a lot of others that include a parent who works too much .
Murphy is too busy to play pretend with his young daughter .
All she wants is her father to spend time with her but his job takes up way too much of his time and energy .
When the little girl goes to work with him one day , she somehow uses her imagination to help him with business decisions .
He uses this ability his daughter has to further his career since that is his primary interest .
It is not completely clear how she uses her imagination to predict business changes and outcomes or even the interworkings of other company secrets but that is probably not as important as the moral of the story .
Imagine
That is aimed at children and families and with that , it succeeds surprisingly well .
A father and daughter spending time together and realizing the importance of those precious moments is always a bit tear - jerking .
Eddie Murphy can still be a likable actor .
He has transformed from the smart aleck motor mouth from Beverly Hills Cop to more of the smart aleck motor mouth dad in Dr. Doolittle and The Haunted Mansion .
The trailer for Imagine That is endearing , sweet , amusing , and plenty of fun for children , parents , and the young at heart .

President Lincoln - 1862
Copyright Albert Kaplan 1983
( click on image for the
full daguerreotype plate )
In 1977 Albert Kaplan purchased the daguerreotype receipted as " Portrait of a Young Man " from an art gallery in New York .
" When I first saw it I thought that there were similarities between the handsome , aristocratic , and tastefully groomed young man of the daguerreotype , and my mental image of President Lincoln . "
Over the years Kaplan researched and assembled materials which cast light on the physical man , Lincoln .
Kaplan believed that the best qualified people to analyze the image , and the assembled materials , to consider whether the daguerreotype is of Abraham Lincoln , would be plastic and reconstructive surgeons who work with the human face .
In 1987 Kaplan , then living in Paris , sought out Dr. Claude N. Frechette , a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the American Hospital in Paris , whose report " A New Lincoln Image " is here included .
A second report , " Artifact Description of Kaplan Daguerreotype " , is by Grant B. Romer , Conservator of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film in Rochester , New York .
The only other known , and hitherto earliest , daguerreotype of Lincoln , Meserve # 1 , in the possession of the Library of Congress , was a gift of Robert Todd Lincoln to Frederick Hill Meserve .
Meserve reported that " Lincoln believed it was made in Washington in 1848 " .
In 1965 , the New York Academy of Sciences published " Abraham Lincoln 's Philosophy Of Common Sense - An Analytical Biography of a Great Mind " , by Edward J. Kempf , M.D. , a neurologist and psychiatrist whose interest in Lincoln began when he first saw the Volk life mask , from which he inferred that Lincoln must have suffered a serious cranial injury in childhood .
After investigating further , Dr. Kempf found Lincoln 's own account of having been kicked in the forehead by a horse at age 10 years and " thought dead for awhile . "
The nature of the cerebral damage , and how it might have influenced the development of Lincoln 's personality and mind became a question of absorbing interest to the author .
The resulting analytical biography was the product of the author 's 12 subsequent years of research .
Because the trauma - induced deformations of Lincoln 's face , distinctly described by Dr. Kempf , are seen unmistakably in the Kaplan daguerreotype , providing in themselves compelling evidence in support of the daguerreotype's authenticity , we reprint the Kempf analysis ( from the title page to the end of Chapter I of Volume I ) .
An earlier Kempf study of Lincoln 's cranial injury appeared in the April 1952 American Medical Association ( AMA ) Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry , Volume 67 , Number 4 , entitled , " Abraham Lincoln 's Organic and Emotional Neurosis " .
US authorities were investigating a potential threat , of uncertain credibility , in connection with the inauguration of president - elect Barack Obama , the US Homeland Security Department said today .
The threat concerned an unspecified incident involving the Somali Islamist insurgent group al Shabaab , authorities said .
Obama was due to be sworn in as president just before noon EST ( 1700 GMT ) and huge crowds gathered in central Washington for the event .
Security was unprecedented , with tens of thousands of US troops and police .

" The FBI , the Department of Homeland Security ... and the intelligence community are coordinating with other law enforcement authorities to investigate and analyze recently received information about a potential threat on inauguration day , " department spokesman Russ Knocke said .
" This information is of limited specificity and uncertain credibility , " he said .
The FBI and Homeland Security Department notified law enforcement around the United States of the potential threat on Monday , authorities said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The bulletin was part of regular efforts to keep local officials aware of security developments .
There was no change to the overall threat level , the department said .
A law enforcement official said the United States had been tracking the al Shabaab - related threat for several days .
The Somali group is on the US list of terrorist groups .
It has primarily acted in the violence - wracked Muslim East African country , but US intelligence officials have recently expressed concern about young Somalis living in the United States who have gone to train with al Shabaab .
Obama 's transition team had been briefed on the threat warning , Knocke said .
He said the public should continue with their plans to attend the inaugural , but be vigilant .
" Inauguration events could present an attractive target due to the large public gatherings and participation of many dignitaries , " Knocke said .
" Authorities are constantly reviewing security measures in light of this threat information . "
MOSCOW  Russia is considering buying an unspecified number of remotely piloted reconnaissance aircraft from Israel , the head of the Russian military said Tuesday , in what may be an attempt by the Kremlin to strengthen its intelligence - gathering capacity after the August war with Georgia .
A Russian purchase of such aircraft from Israel would be a significant expansion of military business between the countries .
“ We are working on this issue , ” Gen. Nikolai Makarov , the chief of the Russian General Staff , told the Interfax news agency .
“ We are talking about a test batch of Israeli drone planes . "
In recent months , the Russian Defense Ministry has unveiled changes aimed at streamlining the armed forces .
The changes include thinning the officer corps , improving training and living standards for troops , and buying modern weapons systems .
An early goal from midfielder Claudio Marchisio was enough for Juventus to beat Fiorentina and move level with Inter on top of the Serie A standings , but there will be controversy as the Viola saw an Alberto Gilardino goal incorrectly ruled out for offside .
Juventus 1 - 0 Fiorentina
Juventus looked to pile up the pressure on Inter as they hosted Fiorentina hoping to reach the top spot in the table with a victory .
Meanwhile , Fiorentina needed a result to keep the race for a Champions League spot going .
Gianluigi Buffon made his long - awaited return in goal for the Bianconeri , who as usual had captain Alex Del Piero and Amauri in attack in a 4 - 4 - 2 system , while the Viola played with a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 formation with Mario Santana behind Alberto Gilardino and Stevan Jovetic up front .
First Half
The start of the match was a cagey affair , as both teams seemed to respect each other too much .
However , after a while Juve started taking control of the match and creating chances .
In the eighth minute , Del Piero played a nice ball to Marco Marchionni , who cut inside from the right , dribbling past Manuel Pasqual , and fired a shot from outside the area that went well wide of the target .
A minute after that , Del Piero himself came close to opening the score , as he tried to lob the ball into the net with a delicate chip after some nice play with Marchionni and Cristiano Zanetti , but he sent it just wide .
In the 10th minute , Fiorentina claimed a penalty as Zdenek Grygera appeared to bring down Jovetic , but the referee was n’t having any of it .
The home side opened the score in the 20th minute , when Del Piero found midfielder Claudio Marchisio inside the area with an inspired through ball , and the youngster coolly placed the ball past Sebastien Frey from a difficult angle .
It was the first Serie A goal for the 23 - year - old .
Juve nearly doubled their lead a minute later , as again Del Piero found Nedved on the left side of the area , but the Czech star ’s dangerous cross into the area did n’t find any black and white shirts and went just wide of the post .
Buffon was called into action for the first time in the 25th minute , when he had to race off his line to rob the ball from Gilardino , who was found unmarked in the area by Felipe Melo .
Around the half hour mark , Fiorentina started to create some serious danger , and in the 32nd minute Gilardino ’s header on a cross by Pasqual struck the crossbar .
The ball was then picked up by Montolivo , who struck a shot from the edge of the area which Buffon could only parry onto Gilardino , who then poked the ball into the net , but the goal was incorrectly called off for offside , as Grygera kept the Italian striker onside .
After this scare , which should have cost them the equalizer , Juve responded with a free kick from about 30 meters by Nedved in the 35th minute , which went just wide of the target .
Just before half time , there were a couple of big chances for both sides .
In the 45th minute , Del Piero played a magnificent long pass for Marchionni , who dribbled past Per Kroldrup and found himself alone in front of Frey , but the goalkeeper came up with a brilliant double save to deny him .
At the other end , Montolivo sent in a cross from the right that Kroldrup could have pushed into the net , but team mate Alessandro Gamberini was in his way .
A highly entertaining first half came to an end on a 1 - 0 scoreline for the home side which was harsh on the Viola , especially considering Gilardino saw a goal incorrectly ruled out for offside .
Second Half
The only change during half time was made by Fiorentina coach Cesare Prandelli , who replaced midfielder Massimo Gobbi with Zdravko Kuzmanovic , also a midfielder .
The visitors took the initiative at the start of the second half , and in the 56th minute Pasqual fired a surprise shot on goal from a difficult position on the left , which Buffon punched away , allowing the ball to fall to Jovetic , who tried to poke the ball in first time but he was in a difficult position and could only send it wide .
After some sustained pressure from Fiorentina , Juve forced Frey into action again in the 61st minute , when Del Piero again found Marchionni with a great long pass , and the midfielder played it to the onrushing Grygera , whose shot was tipped away for a corner by the French goalkeeper .
The next chance was also for the home side , in the 69th minute , when Marchionni made a run into the area from the right and played the ball to Del Piero , whose shot from inside the area sailed well over the crossbar .
A big chance wasted by the Juve captain .
The Viola responded quickly and two minutes later there was another chance for Gilardino , who touched the ball with the tip of his foot from close range on a cross from the left by Santana , but Buffon showed all his class as he managed to tip the ball away for a corner .
As Fiorentina poured pressure on Juventus as they searched for an equalizer , they exposed themselves more and more to Juve ’s counterattacks .
This nearly proved fatal when , in the 83rd minute , Sebastian Giovinco , who had just replaced Del Piero , was found in space and made a run toward goal , but he failed to beat Frey in a one - on - one as the keeper got a hand to his shot .
The final chance of the match came in injury time , when a powerful shot by Jovetic was punched away by Buffon .
For all their pressure , Fiorentina failed to really test Juve 's defense in the last stages of the match .
After three minutes of injury time , the Bianconeri could celebrate a crucial victory that brings them top of the table along with Inter , who host Sampdoria tomorrow evening as the Scudetto race heats up .
Meanwhile , Fiorentina might see the fourth place slip further away after tomorrow ’s games .

One night in mid-October , as the movie executive Tim Palen looked on with panoramic vigilance , a roar from jostling photographers seemed to freeze Josh Brolin ’s grin in place .
Brolin plays George W. Bush in Oliver Stone ’s “ W. , ” a Lionsgate film that was having its première , and he was making such halting progress down the red carpet outside Manhattan ’s Ziegfeld Theatre that he seemed to be still in character .
Palen , who is Lionsgate ’s co-president of theatrical marketing — the studio ’s resident promotional genius — had been working for months to make people care about “ W. , ” a film that did n’t have an obvious audience ; indeed , the film ’s subject , in the intense focus on the Presidential election and the economic crash , had all but disappeared .
This evening would be a kind of sardonic resurrection : a few yards away on the red carpet , James Cromwell ( who plays George H. W. Bush ) was slyly telling an interviewer , “ I play Dennis Kucinich , ” and Richard Dreyfuss ( Dick Cheney ) was posing in a green velvet jacket that made clear he was no Republican .
Tim Palen wants his core audience to feel that a film is theirs , one marketer says : “ He gives them content that feels bloggy and street . ” Illustration by John Ritter
When Brolin spotted Palen , his fixed grin became a real smile .
He mimed opening a magazine with an expression of amazement , then rushed over and gave the marketer a hug .
Brolin and Oliver Stone had taped an appearance on “ Charlie Rose ” earlier that day , and Rose had surprised the actor with a photograph that showed him yawning , flamboyantly , across a full page of the latest Newsweek .
Palen , an accomplished photographer , had taken the picture in a session that also produced the film ’s posters .
Newsweek ran a lengthy essay about “ W. , ” which concluded that the film was , “ surprisingly , more or less fair . ”
This had been Oliver Stone ’s goal — and was now Tim Palen ’s problem .
His job was not to encapsulate the film ’s artistry but , rather , to insist to a busy , jaded , and suspicious audience that “ W. ” would really stir them up .
As Tom Ortenberg , Lionsgate ’s president of theatrical films , told me , he had said at a marketing meeting , “ Who wants to see an evenhanded editorial think piece from Oliver Stone ? ”
Publicity is selling what you have : the film ’s stars and sometimes its director .
Marketing , very often , is selling what you do n’t have ; it ’s the art of the tease .
A première lets the marketing and publicity teams join in a final effort to “ eventize ” a film , to move it to the top of the nation ’s long to - do list .
Many premières feel slack and dutiful , but this one had the fizz of a genuine event .
Lionsgate , which , together with “ W. ” ’s other investors , spent about three hundred thousand dollars on the début — three times its usual outlay — later reckoned that coverage on “ Entertainment Tonight ” and “ Access Hollywood ” and in dozens of other outlets was worth more than a million dollars in advertising .
Palen , in silence , watched the parade of stars until Thandie Newton , the British actress who plays Condoleezza Rice , came by and he reached out to clasp her hand .
“ I ’m such a groupie , ” Palen sheepishly acknowledged after Newton glided on .
“ I ’m a fourteen - year - old girl .
But having a girl ’s viewing habits ” — he is devoted to “ The Hills ” and “ Project Runway ” — “ actually comes in very handy . ”
Palen , who is forty - seven , has a shaved head , a graying beard , and the bulging , tattooed arms of a steamfitter .
Usually he wears jeans and a hoodie , but this evening he was in a black Prada suit , a black Prada shirt , and black Prada shoes : his première outfit .
His uncommon mixture of traits — he is warm , incisive , competitive , loyal , and catty — makes him fun to be around , even at premières , where he often feels anxious and out of place .
When Michael Pitt , an actor who was in “ Hedwig and the Angry Inch , ” ambled past in a ratty military jacket , Palen said , “ I see he got dressed up .
Headache and the Angry Itch . ”
You have to have some of that spitballer ’s attitude to do Palen ’s job ; you have to love a ruckus .
Even as movie attendance has dropped nineteen per cent from its peak of 1.6 billion theatregoers , in 2002 , the number of films released each year since then has increased by thirty per cent .
A dozen new films — three of them big studio releases — now vie for attention on any given weekend .
To cut through the ambient noise , major studios spend an average of thirty - six million dollars to market one of their films .
“ Most of a movie ’s opening gross is about marketing , ” Clint Culpepper , the president of Sony Screen Gems , says .
“ You can have the most terrific movie in the world , and if you ca n’t convey that fact in fifteen - and thirty - second TV ads it ’s like having bad speakers on a great stereo . ”
At Sony , executives ask , “ Can we make this seem ‘ babysitter - worthy ’ ?
Will it get them out of the house ? ”
Lionsgate , smaller , scrappier , and stingier than the six major studios , has released such distinguished films as “ Crash , ” “ Monster ’s Ball , ” and “ Away from Her , ” but it has made its reputation with edgy , low - budget action and horror movies , particularly the five “ Saw ” films .
In August , the company opened a new production division to make a broader range of films , including romantic comedies .
The studio has also declared itself willing to make an occasional big - budget “ tent pole ” ; it has cautiously begun to take on the big studios .
These changes will place a greater burden on Palen , not so much of additional work — the line in Lionsgate ’s marketing division is that every job already includes “ D.F.E. , ” or “ Do Fucking Everything ” — as of adapting his sensibility to new audiences , and of curbing his instinct , usually couched behind a restless politeness , that he knows best .
Many Hollywood marketers construct their campaigns in slow - motion groupthink ;
Palen strikes so quickly that one of his regular poster venders calls him “ the Cobra . ”
He believes that if you express a strong opinion , fast , others will fall in line .
But he also has a pitiless eye .
At another Lionsgate première , for “ Saw V , ” in Las Vegas , he glanced at the romantic - kiss photo on the Paris Hotel ’s marquee and remarked , “ I do n’t like that fingernail . ”
It became impossible to look at the marquee and see anything but the woman ’s lurid white - tipped nail against the man ’s neck , glowing like the evidence of a murder .
Palen ’s campaigns , which have won many of the movie industry ’s Key Art and Golden Trailer awards , are witty and pugnacious , particularly the ones that are borderline pornographic .
For the gory 2006 hit “ Hostel , ” Palen created a poster from his own photo of a giant chainsaw springing out of a nearly naked man ’s lap .
For his “ Rambo ” poster , last year , Palen chose a dripping stencil of Sylvester Stallone ’s face which called to mind the famous Che Guevara image .
“ A lot of people would n’t have had the nerve to do a piece of street art that subliminally sampled the Che poster , ” Stallone told me .
“ Studios usually crowd everything in , hoping to reach you with something — I ’ve had posters with nine overlapping images .
But Tim ’s was a piece of art . ”
Paul Haggis , the writer - director of the 2005 film “ Crash , ” says , “ I came in thinking Tim was doing everything wrong .
He made the poster Michael Peña screaming over his daughter , rather than selling Brendan Fraser or Matt Dillon or Sandra Bullock .
I worried that the trailer , a mood piece about how people have to crash into each other to feel alive , was going to seem like overly significant claptrap .
Then Tim and Sarah ” — Sarah Greenberg , Palen ’s co-president , who handles publicity — “ came to me and said , ‘ We ’re going to go for an Academy campaign . ’
I really , really thought they were crazy : this was a little six - million - dollar film . ”
For the cost of three full - page ads in the Times , about two hundred thousand dollars , Lionsgate sent more than a hundred thousand DVDs of the film to every member of the Screen Actors Guild — pioneering a now common saturation technique .
In a huge upset , “ Crash ” beat “ Brokeback Mountain ” and “ Munich ” to win Best Picture .
“ W. , ” an earnest drama that punctuates George Bush ’s struggle to emerge from his father ’s shadow with satiric sequences set in the Situation Room , was rejected by several of the larger studios before Lionsgate agreed to make it .
“ We took ‘ W. ’ because of Oliver Stone , pedigree , and built - in controversy — controversy leads to marketing , ” Michael Burns , Lionsgate ’s vice - chairman , told me .
Palen said , “ I do n’t know if everyone here loved the concept of ‘ W. , ’ but we felt we could kick some ass on it . ”
Stone , in an early meeting to discuss the film ’s marketing , told Palen , “ I know you ’re good with ‘ Saw , ’ but this is n’t ‘ Saw . ’ ”
Palen replied , “ It ’s also not ‘ Crash , ’ and it ’s not ‘ 3:10 to Yuma ’ ” — two of the studio ’s hits .
“ It ’s its own movie , and we ’ll treat it as such . ”
Marketers and filmmakers are often quietly at war .
“ The most common comment you hear from filmmakers after we ’ve done our work is ‘ This is not my movie , ’ ” Terry Press , a consultant who used to run marketing at Dreamworks SKG , says .
“ I ’d always say , ‘ You ’re right — this is the movie America wants to see . ’ ”
To reëngage moviegoers with a dormant President , Palen spent twenty - three million dollars trying to tie the film to the long - awaited end of Bush ’s term and to tap the same appetite for political ridicule that feasted on Tina Fey ’s impersonations of Sarah Palin .
Most of the movie ’s trailers and TV spots were in the rollicking spirit of Michael Moore ’s “ Fahrenheit 9/11 , ” which the studio also distributed : they featured Bush driving drunk , mouthing malapropisms , and looking confounded .
At the close , Palen wanted to run a new banner ad on Internet ticketing sites and political blogs : “ Sitting President , ” a photo that he ’d taken of Brolin as Bush on the toilet , posed like Rodin ’s “ The Thinker . ”
Stone vetoed it : he was concerned that Palen ’s materials made his film seem giddy and trifling .
“ Josh on the toilet , that one I did n’t go for , ” the director told me .
“ I sympathize , ” Palen told me .
“ Oliver Stone has the President taking a shit — how disrespectful .
But from the marketing perspective we needed some teeth .
Moritz Borman ” — one of the film ’s producers — “ told me , ‘ I do n’t want to know about “ Sitting President , ” and if Oliver finds out and yells , I ’m going to yell at you , too .
But you have to do it . ’ ” So Palen did .
And Stone did n’t find out .
( Borman says that he did n’t authorize the ad . )
Yet a number of Hollywood observers believed that no amount of marketing could save “ W. ” from being a “ feathered fish ” — a film whose target audience thinks it ’s for someone else .
“ They made the movie look like ‘ Animal House , ’ a Judd Apatow film , and that audience wo n’t be going because they know it ’s about Bush and politics , ” one film - marketing consultant told me .
“ When the reviews reveal that it ’s shockingly fair , the ‘ Fahrenheit 9/11 ’ crowd will stay away .
And the people who like Bush are out once they hear it ’s Oliver Stone .
I think the film opens at five million ” — disaster .
When Palen saw Stone on the red carpet , the men smiled and tapped each other on the wrists .
Then Stone mischievously stuck out his tongue .
“ These are the duties , ” Palen murmured as he watched the filmmaker move on .
“ We say ‘ Hey ! ’ ” In effect , Palen had now passed the baton back .
His work in selling what the studio did n’t quite have — a brisk , playful romp — would now begin to give way to what the movie really was .
But not before the verdict on Palen ’s marketing became clear , three days later , when the film opened .
One afternoon in June of 2001 , Andrew Fogelson , a longtime Hollywood executive who had run marketing divisions at Columbia and Warner Bros. , was driving down Olympic Boulevard in Santa Monica when he saw a billboard advertising “ The Fast and the Furious , ” a forthcoming film about street racers .
The billboard showed only a streaking yellow sports car .
Recognizing it as a Universal Pictures film , Fogelson picked up his cell phone and called his son , Adam , then Universal ’s senior vice - president of creative marketing , at his office .
“ Adam , ” he said , “ what the fuck is this car movie , and why would anyone go see a movie about hubcaps ? ”
“ That ’s why I ’m here , and you ’re on Olympic Boulevard , ” Adam Fogelson replied .
“ What are you hoping for ? ” his father asked .
“ Twenty million . ”
“ Lifetime ? ”
“ No , opening . ”
“ I brought some work home with me . ”

“ If that opens at twenty million , ” Andrew Fogelson said , “ I ’ll eat it . ”
The picture opened at forty million .
“ My father saw a car , and not a particularly special car , at an angle on a billboard , ” Adam Fogelson , who now runs Universal ’s marketing department , says .
“ And he thought , How would that motivate ?
For us , that image was simply a graphic , readable reminder — an exclamation point — on a very expensive campaign of trailers and TV ads that had already got our target audience excited .
If you ’re my dad and you say , ‘ What the hell is that ? , ’ it was n’t for you in the first place . ”
“ In 1970 , when I started , ” Andrew Fogelson told me , “ marketing was called ‘ advertising and publicity , ’ and it was a totally unrefined art that consisted of making posters that tried to capture the essence of the movie and said ‘ Starts Tomorrow . ’ ”
The business began to change in 1973 , when “ Billy Jack , ” about a rebellious ex-Green Beret , was reissued by its writer and star , Tom Laughlin , after a Warner Bros. release fizzled .
Laughlin ’s company , Taylor - Laughlin Distribution , saturated the airwaves with television spots aimed at twelve different demographics — “ carefully calculated overkill , ” as one Taylor - Laughlin executive put it .
When the film grossed a then enormous seventy - five million dollars , the studios suddenly understood that television ads really work .
And if you ’re going to spend a lot of money on advertising , they realized , you need to be in more theatres to amortize the cost .
“ Jaws ” opened “ wide ” in 1975 , on four hundred and nine screens , at the time a large number ; big studio films now open everywhere on more than four thousand .
And if you ’re in that many theatres you need huge audiences as soon as a film opens — so you need a movie that sells itself .
And then you need to sell the hell out of it .
Editor 's note : Deborah E. Lipstadt , Dorot professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University , is the author of " History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving . "
She was the target of a British libel lawsuit by Irving , a historian she said had become a spokesman for Holocaust denial .
Lipstadt won the case in April 2000 .

Deborah Lipstadt says the Holocaust love story seemed incredible on its face .
( CNN ) -- I do n't know whether to be sad or angry -- or both .
The recent exposé of the fact that Herman Rosenblat 's Holocaust memoir is a hoax was no surprise to me .
From the first time I heard the story of his " miraculous " survival during the Nazi era , I doubted that it could be true .
Rosenblat 's claim that , as an inmate in a Buchenwald sub-camp , he had survived because a young girl had tossed an apple over the fence each day for seven months just did not seem credible to me .
The notion that a concentration camp inmate could approach the fence without the SS shooting him beggared the imagination .
I could not believe that a little girl whose family was supposedly passing as non-Jews would allow their daughter to engage in such an act .
The fairy tale nature of the incident was enhanced by the supposed reunion of the couple on a blind date years later when both had moved to America .
The story was that they discovered each other 's true identity and , after a whirlwind romance , decided to marry .
Survivors who had been in the camp with Rosenblat and had kept in touch with him since the end of the war protested that the story could not be true .
They wondered why Rosenblat had never mentioned the incident until the late 1990s .
A number of other historians shared my doubts , which I posted on my blog .
As one of the first to express skepticism about this , I became the target of attacks from those who thought I was demeaning the Rosenblats .
We doubters could not , however , initially overcome the power of Oprah , on whose show Rosenblat and his wife appeared twice .
Credulous reporters , who should have sought some form of verification , kept writing about this " miraculous " event .
The producer who acquired movie rights tried to intimidate those of us who raised questions .
He wrote to me saying , " I have traveled all over Eastern Europe for several years in preparation for what will be a major feature film .
I may be more of a Holocaust expert than you , even though , I have no title nor university affiliation .
What I do know for sure is before I make any statements I know the facts .
You simply do not know those facts , and that Deborah , is the greatest sin to the memory of all those perished so long ago . "
The publisher refused to let anyone see the book .
Public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people .
Slowly , thanks to the power of the Internet and the work of some intrepid historians , the hoax was exposed .
The publisher pulled the book .
The movie producer cried foul , presenting himself as a victim who had been duped .
This is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated .
Most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors .
In contrast , the Rosenblats were both survivors of the Holocaust .
But that fact has now been lost in the shuffle .
What , then , is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes ?
First of all , they give ammunition to Holocaust deniers .
This is a bonanza for them .
Deniers expend great efforts in trying to implant doubts in young people about the veracity of the Holocaust .
They spend so much energy attacking " Anne Frank : The Diary of a Young Girl " because it is a book that is widely read by young people .
The fact that this " apples over the fence " story has already been published as a widely successful children 's story provides the deniers with a great opportunity to peddle their wares .
However , the danger posed by deniers is not the primary reason why such fabricated stories should be exposed .
The events of the Holocaust are horrible in and of themselves .
They do not need to be aggrandized or exaggerated to be made to sound any worse than they were .
They also do not need to be rendered as joyful love stories that make us feel good about what happened .
Both are insults to the survivors and inimical to the pursuit of historical truth .
The optimum way of teaching about the Holocaust and presenting its history is , to quote Detective Joe Friday from the old TV show , " Dragnet , " " just the facts , just the facts . "
What we need , particularly in relation to something as mind - boggling as the Holocaust , are " just the facts . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Lipstadt .

WITH luck , the destructive two - week battle between Israel and Hamas may soon draw to an end .
But how long before the century - long war between Arabs and Jews in Palestine follows suit ?
It is hard to believe that this will happen any time soon .
Consider : Israel 's current operation , “ Cast Lead ” , marks the fourth time Israel has fought its way into Gaza .
It almost captured Gaza ( behind a pocket containing a young Egyptian army officer called Gamal Abdul Nasser ) in 1948 , in the war Israelis know as their war of independence .
It captured Gaza again in 1956 , as part of a secret plan hatched with Britain and France to topple Nasser as Egypt 's president and restore British control of the Suez Canal .
It invaded a third time during the six - day war of 1967 — and stayed there for 38 years , until withdrawing unilaterally three and a half years ago .
Why they fight
And Gaza , remember , is only one item in a mighty catalogue of misery , whose entries are inscribed in tears .
The Jews and Arabs of Palestine have been fighting off and on for 100 years .
In 1909 the mostly Russian socialist idealists of the Zionist movement set up an armed group , Hashomer , to protect their new farms and villages in Palestine from Arab marauders .
Since then has come the dismal march of wars — 1948 , 1956 , 1967 , 1973 , 1982 , 2006 and now 2009 — each seared by blood and fire into the conflicting myths and memories of the two sides .
The intervals between the wars have not been filled by peace but by bombs , raids , uprisings and atrocities .
Israeli settlers in Hebron today still cite , as if it were yesterday , the massacre of Hebron 's Jews in 1929 .
The Arabs of Palestine still remember their desperate revolt in the 1930s against the British mandate and Jewish immigration from Europe , and the massacres of 1948 .
The slaughter this week in Gaza , in which on one day alone some 40 civilians , many children , were killed in a single salvo of Israeli shells , will pour fresh poison into the brimming well of hate ( see article ) .
But a conflict that has lasted 100 years is not susceptible to easy solutions or glib judgments .
Those who choose to reduce it to the “ terrorism ” of one side or the “ colonialism ” of the other are just stroking their own prejudices .
At heart , this is a struggle of two peoples for the same patch of land .
It is not the sort of dispute in which enemies push back and forth over a line until they grow tired .
It is much less tractable than that , because it is also about the periodic claim of each side that the other is not a people at all — at least not a people deserving sovereign statehood in the Middle East .
That is one reason why this conflict grinds on remorselessly from decade to decade .
During eruptions of violence , the mantra of diplomats and editorialists is the need for a two - state solution .
It sounds so simple : if two peoples cannot share the land , they must divide it .
This seemed obvious to some outsiders even before the Nazi genocide of Europe 's Jews prompted the United Nations in 1947 to call for the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine .
In 1937 a British royal commission concluded that “ an irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country . ”
The answer had to be partition .
The fact that the Arabs rejected the UN 's partition plan of 60 years ago has long given ideological comfort to Israel and its supporters .
Abba Eban , an Israeli foreign minister , quipped that the Palestinians “ never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity ” .
Israel 's story is that the Arabs have muffed at least four chances to have a Palestinian state .
They could have said yes to partition in 1947 .
They could have made peace after the war of 1947 - 48 .
They had another chance after Israel routed its neighbours in 1967 ( “ We are just waiting for a telephone call , ” said Moshe Dayan , Israel 's hero of that war ) .
They had yet another in 2000 when Ehud Barak , now Israel 's defence minister and then its prime minister , offered the Palestinians a state at Bill Clinton 's fateful summit at Camp David .
This story of Israeli acceptance and Arab rejection is not just a yarn convenient to Israel 's supporters .
It is worth remembering that it was not until 1988 , a full 40 years after Israel 's birth , that Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) renounced its goal of liberating the whole of Palestine from the river to the sea .
All the same , the truth is much more shaded than the Israeli account allows .
There have been missed opportunities , and long periods of rejection , on Israel 's part , too .
Look again at those missed opportunities .
At the time of the UN partition resolution , the Jews of Palestine numbered only 600,000 and the Arabs more than twice that number .
Most of the Jews were incomers .
Although partition might have been the wiser choice for the Palestinians , it did not strike them as remotely fair .
In the subsequent war , more than 600,000 of Palestine 's Arabs fled or were put to flight .
Afterwards , disinclined either to take them back or return the extra land it had gained in battle , Israel was relieved that the Arab states , traumatised by the rout , made no serious offer of peace .
Many of the refugees have been stuck ever since in a sad finger of dunes , the Gaza Strip , pointing at the bright lights of Tel Aviv .
When Israel fell in love
After the ignominious defeat of 1967 , the Arab states again rejected the idea of peace with Israel .
That was , indeed , a wasted opportunity .
But even though the Israel of 1967 discussed how much of the West Bank it was ready to trade for peace , the Likud governments of the late 1970s and 1980s wanted it all .
For Israel fell in love with the territories it had occupied .
This was the period of Israeli rejection .
Israeli prime ministers such as Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir asserted a God -given right to a “ greater Israel ” that included the West Bank and Gaza Strip , in which Israeli governments of all stripes continued to plant ( illegal ) settlements .
In some Israeli minds the Palestinians became a non-people , to be fobbed off with self - government under Israeli or perhaps Jordanian supervision .
It took an explosion of Palestinian resistance , in the intifada ( uprising ) of the late 1980s and the far more lethal one of 2001 - 03 , to convince Israel that this was an illusion .

Building up the iron wall
What bearing does all this history have on the foul events unfolding right now in Gaza ?
The point is that there have been precious few moments over the past century during which both sides have embraced the idea of two states at the same time .
The most promising moment of all came at the beginning of this decade , with Mr Clinton 's near - miss at Camp David .
But now , with the rise of Hamas and the war in Gaza , the brief period of relative hope is in danger of flickering out .
If rejection of the other side 's national claims is one of the things that make this conflict so hard to end , the other is religion .
The two are tied together .
Hamas is a religious movement , and its formal creed is to reject the possibility of Jewish statehood not only because of Israel 's alleged sins but also because there is no place for a Jewish state in a Muslim land .
In Israel 's early life Zionism was a mainly secular movement and the dominant force on the other side was a secular Arab nationalism .
Since 1967 , however , religion , nationalism and hunger for Palestinians ' land have fused to create a powerful constituency in Israel dedicated to retaining control of the whole of Jerusalem and Judaism 's holy places on the West Bank .
Israel 's system of proportional voting has given the settlers and zealots a chokehold over politics .
Among Arabs secular nationalism is meanwhile waning in the face of a powerful Islamic revival through the region .
And a central dogma of the Islamists is that Israel is an implant that must be violently resisted and eventually destroyed .
One far - seeing Zionist , Vladimir Jabotinsky , predicted in the 1930s not only that the Arabs would oppose the swamping of Palestine with Jewish immigrants but also that “ if we were Arabs , we would not accept it either ” .
In order to survive , the Jews would have to build an “ iron wall ” of military power until the Arabs accepted their state 's permanence .
And this came to pass .
Only after several costly wars did Egypt and later the PLO conclude that , since Israel could not be vanquished , they had better cut a deal .
In Beirut in 2002 all the Arab states followed suit , offering Israel normal relations in return for its withdrawal from all the occupied territories , an opening which Israel was foolish to neglect .
The depressing thing about the rise of Hamas and the decline of the Fatah wing of the PLO is that it reverses this decades - long trend .
Hamas 's victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006 had many causes , including a reputation for honesty .
Its victory did not prove that Palestinians had been bewitched by Islamist militancy or come to believe again in liberating all of Palestine by force .
But if you take seriously what Hamas says in its charter , Hamas itself does believe this .
So does Hizbullah , Lebanon 's “ Party of God ” ; and so does a rising and soon perhaps nuclear - armed Iran .
Some analysts take heart from Hamas 's offer of a 30 - year truce if Israel returns to its 1967 borders .
But it has never offered permanent recognition .
There is worse .
On top of the return to rejection and the growing role of religion , a third new obstacle to peace is the apparent crumbling of Jabotinsky 's iron wall .
In Lebanon three years ago , and today in Gaza , Hizbullah and Hamas seem to have invented a new military doctrine .
Israel has deterred its enemies mainly by relying on a mighty conventional army to react with much greater force to any provocation .
But non-state actors are harder to deter .
Hizbullah and Hamas , armed by Iran with some modern weapons , can burrow inside the towns and villages of their own people while lobbing rockets at Israel's .
A state that yearns for a semblance of normality between its wars cannot let such attacks become routine .
That is why today , as in the 1950s , Israel responds to pinpricks with punitive raids , each of which had the potential to flare into war .
Israel 's operation in Gaza is designed not only to stop Hamas 's rockets but to shore up a doctrine on which Israel thinks its safety must still be based .
At Camp David in 2000 Israel and the Palestinians discovered that even with goodwill it is hard to agree terms .
How to share Jerusalem ?
What to offer the refugees who will never go home ?
How can Israel trust that the land it vacates is not used , as Gaza has been , as a bridgehead for further struggle ?
But — and this is the fourth thing that keeps the battle alive — the two sides are seldom left alone to tackle these core issues .
For too long the conflict in Palestine was a hostage to the cold war .
America was once neutral : it was Eisenhower who forced Israel out of Gaza ( and Britain out of Egypt ) after Suez .
But America later recruited Israel as an ally , and this suited the Israelis just fine .
It gave them the support of a superpower whilst relieving them of a duty to resolve the quarrel with the Palestinians , even though their own long - term well - being must surely depend on solving that conflict .
It may be no coincidence that some of the most promising peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians took place soon after the cold war ended .
But now a new sort of geopolitical confrontation stalks the region , one that sets America against Iran , and the Islamist movements Iran supports against the Arab regimes in America 's camp .
With Hamas inside Iran 's tent and Fatah in America's , the Palestinians are now facing a paralysing schism .
And so to Gaza
Tzipi Livni , Israel 's foreign minister , has been saying all week that , although Israel 's immediate aim is to stop the rocket fire and not to topple Hamas , there can be no peace , and no free Palestine , while Hamas remains in control .
She is right that with Hamas in power in Gaza the Islamists can continue to wreck any agreement Israel negotiates with Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority on the West Bank .
Mr Abbas , along with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak , may quietly relish Hamas being taken down a peg .
Egypt is furious at Hamas 's recent refusal to renew talks with Fatah about restoring a Palestinian unity government .
There is a limit , however .
Taking Hamas down a peg is one thing .
But even in the event of Israel “ winning ” in Gaza , a hundred years of war suggest that the Palestinians can not be silenced by brute force .
Hamas will survive , and with it that strain in Arab thinking which says that a Jewish state does not belong in the Middle East .
To counter that view , Israel must show not only that it is too strong to be swept away but also that it is willing to give up the land — the West Bank , not just Gaza — where the promised Palestinian state must stand .
Unless it starts doing that convincingly , at a minimum by freezing new settlement , it is Palestine 's zealots who will flourish and its peacemakers who will fall back into silence .
All of Israel 's friends , including Barack Obama , should be telling it this .
350,000 conservatives pledge to block Obama 's ' socialistic ' agenda Muriel Kane
Published : Monday January 19 , 2009
Print This Email
This A conservative group , Grassfire.org , announced on Monday that its online petition pledging " patriotic " opposition to President - elect Barack Obama has gathered 350,000 signatures .
( By presstime , the groups website was claiming a total of 371,453 . )
Grassfire 's founder , Steve Elliot , stated , " This is not a personal attack on Barack Obama .
On the contrary , this is a call to action for conservatives who profess love for our country and respect for our institutions .
Our disagreements with the President are based in ideology and public policy only .
From this firm foundation we are mounting a patriotic , resilient , conservative resistance to Obama 's agenda . "
However , the group 's attempt to present itself as moderate and principled is undercut by its own website , which is much shriller in tone and appears designed to create a sense of alarm among conservatives .
Grassfire warns its readers , " The ' transformational ' figure who will ' change the world ' is now in charge , and hes on a mission .
Emboldened by an overwhelming electoral victory and a near - supermajority in Congress , President - elect Obama and his allies are preparing to implement his liberal , ' post - American ' agenda .
Simply put , what President - elect Obama and the Pelosi - Reid Congress have in store has the potential to rapidly move America to the socialist Left . "
The site then goes on to list such " threats to our liberties " as " socialistic wealth redistribution , " " environmental extremism , " and " silencing conservatives through the Fairness Doctrine . "
Grassfire 's would - be public image of serious - minded conservative opposition is also diminished by its somewhat shadowy nature .
Pittsburgh Tribune - Review columnist Dimitri Vassilaros suggested last spring , " For an organization that claims ' We are grassroots to the core , ' Grassfire.org acts as if it is hiding a lot of AstroTurf . "
Vassilaros explained that when he attempted to review Grassfire 's Steve Elliott by phone , " Mr. Elliott said that he would speak with me only about his petition drive and that any background questions should be handled by spokesman Ron De Jong .
Elliott then hung up .
...
When asked a few times about the organization 's finances , Mr. De Jong first said he did n't know the size of the organization that he speaks for .
He also said he ' could ask around ' about that 990 form .
When I offered to ask the bookkeeper for him , De Jong said , ' She will call , dude .
Relax .
I 'll take care of it for you .
I am a man of my word . '
As of Thursday noon , no one had called this dude . "
Grassfire was founded in 2000 and became known as a consistent supporter of Bush administration policies and diehard opponent of " radical leftist organizations like MoveOn.org . "
During the 2003 - 04 presidential campaign , it was represented by the firm of Shirley & Banister , which at that time was also serving a consultant for the Republican National Committee and handling public relations for the anti-Kerry film Stolen Honor .
Even then , Grassfire was dodgy about its finances , and when the watchdog group Public Citizen asked Shirley & Banister president Craig Shirley for help in getting access to Grassfire 's IRS application for tax exempt status , Shirley responded by cc'ing them on a threatening email to one of his staffers :
" Public Citizen is an ultra-leftist , anti-conservative , anti-Bush organization .
If they bother you one more time , please advise me soonest and I will have the lawyers alert the FBI and the Virginia Attorney General 's office to investigate [ Public Citizen Senior Researcher Taylor ]
Lincoln and Public Citizen for any and all laws they may have broken and to prosecute both Mr. Lincoln and Public Citizen to the fullest extent of the law . "
Grassfire 's relationship with Shirley & Banister apparnelty ended after the 2004 election , and these days it appears to enjoy no such high - level support .
Its current petition asking for " grassroots citizens who will Join The Resistance " originally aimed to garner 500,000 signatures by Inauguration Day but is far short of that goal .
Meanwhile , Grassfire may be losing the support of those who are even further to the right by its insistence that " we will not , like our opponents , reject Barack Obamas Presidency and dismiss it as somehow unjust , immoral or illegitimate .
...
Conservatives are not rebellious  we understand authority . "
A site calling itself Freedom Fighter Radio asks , more passionately than grammatically , " What the hell ?
show respect for Obama ?
Has Grass fire been smoking some grass ?
The level of respect a leader should get should be based upon the level of respect they give our country and Constitution which in Hussain Obamas case is zero .
So now Grassfire.org is asking for donations dont give them a damn dime and encourage all patriots to do the same boycott this group which has become PC the time to be nice is over .
You hear that Steve Elliot anytime anywhere I challenge you to a debate . "
2008 may become known as the year of digital rights management , thanks in no small part to EA 's bringing the issue front and center with Spore and the ensuing backlash .
These days gamers want to know what kind of DRM a game employs before they make a purchase , and for many people the inclusion of SecuROM means a lost sale .
All of the sound and fury surrounding the issue has gotten the attention of the Federal Trade Commission , and the government agency is planning on holding a town hall meeting devoted to the subject of DRM on March 25 .
The official page describes the meeting and its aim .
" Digital rights management ( DRM ) refers to technologies typically used by hardware manufacturers , publishers , and copyright holders to attempt to control how consumers access and use media and entertainment content , " the FTC explains .
" Among other issues , the workshop will address the need to improve disclosures to consumers about DRM limitations . "
The agenda includes demonstrations of DRM - related technology , panel discussions about how these technologies affect consumers , legal issues surrounding DRM , and discussions on the potential need for government involvement to protect consumers .
You can get involved , as well .
" The Commission invites interested parties to submit requests to be panelists and to recommend other topics for discussion .
The requests should be submitted electronically to drmtownhall@ftc.gov by January 30 , 2009 ....
The Commission will select panelists based on their expertise and on the need to represent a range of views . "
If you would simply like to have your voice heard you can submit comments or original research as well .
This is an excellent opportunity to make your voice heard on this matter , and to explain your feelings on the state of DRM in the gaming industry .
Is this a matter that deserves government attention ?
Absolutely .
Having standards for disclosure of what exactly you 're installing with your software , along with easily available tools to remove those programs , would go a long way toward keeping publishers honest about what is shipping with our games .
A recent class - action lawsuit filed against EA is indicative of the problem : " Consumers are given no notices whatsoever that the FREE trial version of [ Spore ] includes Digital Rights Management technology ...
Consumers are given no control , rights , or options over SecuROM , " the suit alleges .
" The program can not be completely uninstalled . "
The suit lists some of the potential side - effects of having the program installed on a system , including disruption of fire walls and " complete operating system failure . "
Too often , customers have no clear picture of what else they may be installing onto their computer when they buy a game , or how those programs could affect the day - to - day use of that computer .
There is no disclosure , no accountability , and very little education going on around the issue of DRM and its related technologies .
It 's likely the discussion will be lively , with both publishers and consumer rights associations weighing in .
The core issue is a simple one , however : consumers deserve to know what they 're installing , and exactly what it does .
It 's looking increasingly likely that consumers may need the FTC's help to make sure what happens during software installations becomes as transparent and open as possible .
The town hall meeting will take place at the University of Washington School of Law , and will be free and open to the public , no registration required .

The use of white phosphorous material is not illegal if used to create smoke screens or for illumination ; but since 1980 the Geneva Convention does prohibit its use as a weapon of war in densely populated civilian areas .
The brightly burning substance can cause massive burns on people caught in its blast radius , incite large ground fires and burns for long periods of time .
According to Marc Garlasco , senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch , " White phosphorous can burn down houses and cause horrific burns when it touches the skin . ”
Its use in the Gaza conflict is the subject of intense criticism from various humanitarian organizations .
The incident that incited the investigation , originally reported by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , pertains to its use by an Israeli parachute brigade in a densely populated region in northern Gaza .
But throughout the conflict allegations of its use came from a number of sources .
On Jan. 15 The Times reported the recovery of a spent white phosphorous shell in the village of Sheikh Ajilin in western Gaza .
The same day as the main UN compound in Gaza fell victim to another strike in which the flammable material is thought to have been used .
On Monday Amnesty International accused Israel of war crimes claiming that a fact finding team found " indisputable evidence of the widespread use of white phosphorus " within the region .
" Yesterday , we saw streets and alleyways littered with evidence of the use of white phosphorus , including still burning wedges and the remnants of the shells and canisters fired by the Israeli army , " said Christopher Cobb - Smith , a weapons expert who is in Gaza as part of the four - person Amnesty International team .
Israel indicated as recently as last week that all weapons used during its Gaza offensive comply with internationally mandated law .

Yet another zero - day vulnerability has been identified in a popular Microsoft product , this time in its SQL Server database .
The revelation comes as miscreants are stepping up attacks on a particularly nasty bug in the latest version of Internet Explorer .
The SQL Server bug could allow the remote execution of malicious code , according to researchers at Austria - based SEC Consult .
The company said attackers exploiting the flaw would have to be authenticated users on the system , a requirement that a Microsoft spokesman also said minimizes the risk .
But an SEC Consult advisory warned it 's still possible for outsiders to target the vulnerability remotely on websites that link search boxes , customer data bases or other web apps to SQL Server .
" The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with a direct database connection , or via SQL injection in a vulnerable web application , " the advisory said .
" The vulnerability has been successfully used to execute arbitrary code on a lab machine . "
SEC Consult has confirmed the flaw in the 2000 and 2005 versions of SQL Server .
It has not yet tested version 2008 .
It triggers the rewriting of a computer 's memory by supplying several uninitialized variables to the sp_replwritetovarbin stored procedure .
Microsoft was alerted to the bug in April , according to SEC Consult .
There are no reports of the bug being attacked in the wild , a Microsoft spokesman said .
It 's shaping up as quite a week for security professionals .
Combined with bugs in IE 7 and the WordPad text converter for Word 97 , the world now has three Microsoft zero - day vulnerabilities on its hands .
And they come on the heels of Tuesday 's release of fixes for 28 vulnerabilities , the biggest patch batch in five years .
" We 're running at full speed right just to keep up with all that , " said Rick Howard , intelligence director for iDefense , a security lab owned by VeriSign .
" Twenty - eight is a lot , so while everybody is working to patch those things , a zero - day is sort of floating out there and not getting all the attention it would have gotten if it came out out of cycle . "
So far , reports indicate that relatively few attacks are targeting the IE flaw , but now that attack code has been publicly released , Howard expects that to change .
Mary Landesman , a researcher at ScanSafe , a company that provides malware scanning services for large companies , seconds that prediction and said she 's already seeing an increase .
In just the past few days , she said , ScanSafe has observed four times as many attacks targeting the IE 7 flaw than attacks resulting from the widely reported Koobface worm .
What 's more , the IE vulnerability is particularly pernicious .
It has the ability to completely hijack a machine simply by visiting the wrong site .
According to Howard , attackers are catching victims off - guard by compromising legitimate websites and then inserting an iframe that causes those using IE 7 to be hit .
The best way to protect yourself against the IE attack is to stop using the browser until it 's been patched .
For those who simply must use it , Microsoft has a list of recommendations that can be accessed by going here and expanding the workarounds section . ®
Her mum would have loved her so much : Tearful words of man whose baby was born TWO DAYS after wife died
Two days after Jayne Soliman was declared brain - dead , her grieving husband saw her life - support machine turned off .
In a moment of unbelievable poignancy , he was then given their baby daughter to hold for the first time .
Doctors had kept 41 - year - old Mrs Soliman 's heart beating after she suffered a brain haemorrhage .
For 48 hours they pumped large doses of steroids into her body to help the baby 's lungs develop .
Her mother had been declared brain dead two days before she was born .
Now baby Aya Jayne , weighing little over 2lb , is in intensive care
Then they delivered baby Aya Jayne by caesarean section .
At 26 weeks , she weighed just 2lb 11/2oz .
The tiny infant was placed on her mother 's shoulder for a moment before being handed to her father , Mahmoud Soliman .
Aya - her name is a word from the Koran meaning miracle - is now doing well in hospital while 29 - year - old Mr Soliman struggles to cope with the misery of suddenly losing his wife and the joy of becoming a father .
Mahmoud Soliman with his wife Jayne who suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage before the birth of her daughter
' It was Jayne 's one true wish to be a mum - and she would have been a great mum , ' he said at the couple 's home in Bracknell , Berkshire .
Mrs Soliman , formerly Jayne Campbell , was British Free Skating champion in 1989 , the same year she was rated seventh in the world .
She went on to become a figure - skating teacher and had a spell in Abu Dhabi , where she met her Egyptian - born husband - to - be .
Law graduate Mr Soliman said that when they met it was ' love at first sight ' despite her worries over their age difference .
She converted to Islam before their wedding .
Upon their arrival in Britain Mr Soliman began studying for a business masters degree .
Mrs Soliman had been healthy throughout her pregnancy , and continued working as a coach at Bracknell Skating Club .
She was on the ice last Wednesday before she suddenly collapsed in her bedroom after complaining of a headache .
My little girl : Mahmoud Soliman kisses Aya as she is held by nurses
Clinging on ... now Aya has been released from intensive care
She was flown by air ambulance to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford but hours later , in the early evening , was declared brain dead .
Doctors told devastated Mr Soliman that an aggressive tumour had rapidly developed in her brain in just a few weeks - and had suddenly ruptured a major blood vessel .
But although she had suffered brain death , her heart could still be kept pumping on a life - support machine , and the doctors were hopeful her daughter could be born .
A mother 's body remains the best incubator for a baby , even if she is brain - dead , but it is still wise for birth to be carried out as soon as the foetus is considered viable because infections can develop and spread to the baby .
' Love at first sight ' : Mahmoud Soliman and Jayne Campbell married in 2007
Mr Soliman said that since their marriage in May 2007 his wife had been devastated to suffer a miscarriage but was delighted when she became pregnant again .
' I can remember the first scan , ' he said .
' We just hugged each other and kept crying when we saw the heartbeat .
It was this tiny speck beating .
' We were so looking forward to the baby coming . '
He wept as he recalled his wife 's final hours .
' The doctors told me there was nothing they could do for Jayne but they needed her to stay strong for 48 hours to help our unborn child .
' Her heart kept beating strongly for 48 hours and her body never gave up . '

The couple had chosen names for the baby - Ali for a boy or Maggie for a girl .
But Mr Soliman decided it had to be Aya Jayne after the traumatic events of last week .
His wife 's funeral was held in Reading on Saturday , with 300 mourners including many from the skating world .
He was initially told his daughter might have to remain in the intensive care unit at John Radcliffe for more than two weeks , but she was doing so well that she was transferred to hospital in Reading on the day of her mother 's funeral .
Mr Soliman is still too distraught to plan ahead , but knows what he will be telling his daughter as soon as she is old enough to understand .
Jayne in action during her champion ice - skating days in the 1980s
He said : ' I will tell her what a lovely , lovely mum she had who would have loved her so much .
' I was the one who always used to tell Jayney , " If I die , do this " .
She used to say , " Do n't die and leave me " - but last week she did leave me .
She is my angel in paradise . '
The couple 's friends David Phillips , 48 , and his wife Lucine , both keen ice skaters , were at the hospital for the last moments of Mrs Soliman and the arrival of her daughter .
Mrs Phillips said : ' Aya was born kicking and wriggling .
It 's hard to describe the emotions I was going through when I saw her - it was a mixture of tragedy , elation and relief .
' It was so sad to think that Jayne was never going to see her beautiful baby .
A midwife picked Aya up and put her little face up to Jayne's .
If Jayne had been awake she would have had eye contact with her daughter .

' We then had to say goodbye to Jayne .
Mahmoud said goodbye on his own because he wanted to be the last person to see her .
' He sat with her for a while and then he was told he could go and see his daughter .
' He said , " That 's my Jayney " - Aya , after all , is a little piece of Jayne .
He was allowed to touch Aya , and seeing her tiny fingers close in on his was just indescribable .
' And when he was finally allowed to hold her , the look on his face was just full of emotion . '
Mr Phillips added : ' To Jayne , becoming a mother was the best thing in the world that could have happened to her .
She was so happy , she had always wanted to be a mum more than anything else .
She lived to have a baby girl - that was the one thing she wanted in her life .
' Aya Jayne is absolutely tiny - her eyes are the size of lemon pips and her hands are about as big as my wedding ring - but she 's doing brilliantly .
Her dad has had the best and the worst day of his life within such a short space of time .
' It 's just something you can't imagine - turning off your wife 's life - support machine and then going to see your new - born daughter . '
How they give baby the best chance of life
Doctors have on rare occasions kept pregnant women artificially alive to save their babies .
Providing the infant is unharmed , doctors can help it survive in its own incubator - the womb .
Even if the mother is certified brain - dead , speedy arrival at hospital makes possible to keep her on life support for days or even weeks during which the baby 's progress is closely monitored .
Jayne Soliman was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after collapsing at home but was declared brain - dead hours later .
Doctors managed to keep her heart beating until her daughter was safely delivered
Doctors use a ventilator to maintain breathing while the circulation is managed using IV tubes to provide fluids , drugs and blood transfusions .
Babies born at 25 weeks have a 67 per cent prospect of survival , according to statistics from the newborn charity Bliss .
This is the usual point at which doctors decide to deliver , giving the baby a good chance of life while minimising the time during which the mother 's condition could go downhill .
They administer steroids in the hours beforehand to help premature babies with immature lungs breathe more easily after birth .
The baby is delivered by caesarean section .
The life - support system for the mother is then switched off .
Three years ago a brain - dead American woman , Susan Torres , was maintained on life support for nearly three months after a massive stroke .
It was triggered by an undiagnosed form of aggressive cancer and after she slipped into a coma her husband was told her brain functions had stopped .
He wanted her to be kept on an incubator and artificially respirated and hydrated to give their baby daughter a chance of survival .
The 26 - year - old mother was only 17 weeks pregnant when she died .
The case was believed to be the first in the world involving brain - stem death , although there were previous cases where women gave birth in a coma .
Mrs Torres 's baby , also called Susan , survived five weeks but then died after surgery for a perforated intestine .

The Army on Monday will unveil an unprecedented doctrine that declares nation - building missions will probably become more important than conventional warfare and defines “ fragile states ” that breed crime , terrorism and religious and ethnic strife as the greatest threat to U.S. national security .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The doctrine , which has generated intense debate in the U.S. military establishment and government , holds that in coming years , American troops are not likely to engage in major ground combat against hostile states as they did in Iraq and Afghanistan , but instead will frequently be called upon to operate in lawless areas to safeguard populations and rebuild countries .
Such “ stability operations ” will last longer and ultimately contribute more to the military ’s success than “ traditional combat operations , ” according to the Army ’s new Stability Operations Field Manual , a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post .

Nadler : If Rove wo n't testify , he 's ' presumably ' jail - bound David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009
Print This Email This According to Congressman Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , should Karl Rove continue refusing to give testimony , the House of Representatives will " presumably " hold him in contempt , landing Rove in jail .
When House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) issued a Monday subpoena against former Bush Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove regarding his alleged involved in the political prosecution of an Alabama governor , and the firings of nine US Attorneys , he likely expected a fight .
And when Rove went on Bill O'Reilly 's Fox News Factor Wednesday , the right - wing editorialist even jokingly expected a flight , and offered the embattled politico a " place to hide out . "
" We have all kinds of tunnels and places we can put you ... " began O'Reilly .
" I do n't need to hide , " exclaimed Rove .
" I do n't need to hide . "
But if Rep. Nadler is correct , and Rove does n't appear before the Judiciary Committee , he 'll likely need to pack .
Rove 's Washington , D.C. lawyer , Robert Luskin , said in a Tuesday statement , " It 's generally agreed that former presidents retain executive privilege as to matters occurring during their term .
We 'll solicit the views of the new White House counsel and , if there is a disagreement , assume that the matter will be resolved among the courts , the president and the former president . "
Joining MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann Thursday night , Rep. Nadler , who sits on the House Judiciary Committee , shot down Rove 's legal wrangling on the issue of executive privilege , and stated rather bluntly the process to follow .
" If he refuses to show up , we 're going to have to vote a contempt citation , " which would require the ballots of the House at large , he said .
The Democratic - led Hosue would " presumably " carry the measure .
The contempt citation is then given to a US Attorney with the Department of Justice , said Nadler quoting the law , " whose duty it shall be to deliver it to the grand jury .
" In other words , he must enforce and prosecute the subpoena .
Now , President Bush , as in so many other things , simply ignored the law and instructed the US Attorney not to obey the law , and not to enforce the subpoena .
I imagine President Obama will not do the same . "
The subpoena , approved by an earlier vote of the House , was issued pursuant to " authority granted in H.R. 5 ( 111th Congress ) , and calls for Mr. Rove to appear at deposition on Monday , February 2 , 2009 . "
Specifically , it enjoins Rove " to testify regarding his role in the Bush Administrations politicization of the Department of Justice , including the US Attorney firings and the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman . "
Siegelman , who was convicted of corruption charges in 2006 , was released on bail last April pending appeal after media reports -- including those of Raw Story -- revealed myriad irregularities surrounding his prosecution .
Among the revelations : the husband of the US Attorney who prosecuted Siegelman was a close associate of former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and worked as campaign manager for one of Siegelman 's gubernatorial opponents .
An Alabama Republican whistleblower said that Siegelman was deliberately targeted and fingered Rove , asserting that he'd said he'd push the Justice Department to end Siegelman 's political career .
" Chairman Conyers and the House Judiciary Committee 's subpoena of Karl Rove
gives hope to those who want to know the extent of Karl Rove 's abuse of
power and his misuse of the Department of Justice as a way to win elections , " Siegelman told Raw Story on Monday evening .
" Chairman Conyers ' action gives meaning to the change that has been ushered in by the election of President Obama . "
Asked if he had communicated with the Obama administration on the matter , Nadler said that is " premature , " then backtracked to correct Olbermann 's understanding of what follows a contempt vote .
" Normal contempt is , you simply arrest him , " he said .
" The grand jury indicts him , you arrest him for contempt and you put him in jail until he is prepared to testify , to obey the subpoena . "
Nadler added that there is no precedent in US history -- save for President Bush 's one - time Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers and former Bush White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten -- where a presidential adviser has been granted executive privilege when Congress wished to speak with them .
He also took the opportunity to call out Miers and Bolten as facing similar contempt citations .
" Mr. Rove has previously refused to appear in response to a Judiciary Committee subpoena , claiming that even former presidential advisers cannot be compelled to testify before Congress , " Conyers ' office wrote in a release .
" That ' absolute immunity ' position was supported by then - President Bush , but it has been rejected by U.S. District Judge John Bates and President Obama has previously dismissed the claim as ' completely misguided . ' "
Ultimately , explained Nadler , the outcome of the process will be Karl Rove going to court and being sentenced to jail until he decides to testify .
" There is simply no ability to thumb your nose at Congress and say I 'm not gonna show up , " he said .

I found this quote from GM Sales & Marketing chief to be astounding :
“ ’Six hundred twenty is not a subprime score , ’ GM ’s sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve told Automotive News .
‘ That ’s a very creditworthy buyer .
Hopefully , we ’ll have access to more of the market that is out there . ’” – Automotive News ( 12/30/08 )
Bill Ryan of Portales Partners adds the following :
“ We would like to sputter in shock and disbelief .
General Motors Acceptance Corp. ( GMAC ) lost $ 5B in the 9 months ending September 2008 ( on an operating basis ) .
It has $ 100B in subprime and nonconforming mortgages through its ResCap subsidiary , and the government just lent them $ 5 B at an 8 % interest rate .
In addition , General Motors ( GM ) just announced a 0 % financing option to car buyers .
So it turns out that we are now subsidizing a globally uncompetitive carmaker that does not understand what qualifies as a subprime FICO score and is offering 0 % loans financed by a government ( taxpayer ) investment that costs 8 % .
We guess they are hoping to make it up on volume . ”
Laughing at Charlie Chaplin can be a serious business .
Chortling at a funny film may seem to be an activity with few consequences for health , but research shows that it does more than exercise the 20 or so face muscles involved in laughing .
When researchers showed a group of mothers with babies diagnosed with eczema , Chaplin 's Hard Times or a weather documentary , those who laughed at the funny film had higher levels of melatonin in their breast milk .
And when their babies were fed the melatonin - rich milk , they had fewer allergic reactions .
" Our results show that laughter of mothers may be helpful in the treatment of infants with eczema , " say the doctors at the Moriguchi - Keijinkai Hospital in Japan , who carried out the study .
The study is among the latest research to show that laughter , humour and happiness play a key role in good health and longevity , and can positively affect diseases and conditions as diverse as high blood pressure , flu , heart disease , arthritis and diabetes .
As NHS nurses start attending laughter workshops to encourage them to lighten up and make hospital stays a more pleasant experience for patients , research is increasingly showing the value of laughter and humour .

The concept that laughter is good for you is also being used in therapy to improve quality of life , provide some pain relief , encourage relaxation , and reduce stress .
Some centres now provide some kind of humour therapy – one in five National Cancer Institute treatment centres in the US offer it – and it can involve watching films , listening to tapes , reading books or attending humour workshops .
It can also be combined with exercises , such as yoga .
But can it do more than ease stress and act as a distraction ?
Can laughter actually affects the progression of illness , boost the immune system , and reduce symptoms of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ?
It has long been accepted that low mood , including depression , can have a negative effect on physical health .
Patients who are depressed at the time of heart bypass surgery , for example , are more than twice as likely to die during the following five years .
Stress chemicals triggered by being made redundant or getting divorced can also double the likelihood of death from heart disease or stroke .
Now research is showing that laughter and humour can have a positive effect on health and longevity .
Just how is not clear , but studies are throwing up some clues .
Happiness and laughter have been shown to increase natural killer cell activity in blood and free radical - scavenging capacity in saliva , as well as lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol .
It is also thought that laughter causes the release of special neurotransmitter substances in the brain , endorphins , that help control pain .
And there are more direct physical effects of laughter , including increased breathing , more oxygen use , and higher heart rate .
Some research suggests that laughter can boost the immune system .
When researchers at Japan 's Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine showed a 75 - minute funny film to a group of men and women , they found that that blood levels of natural killer cells activity increased by 26.5 per cent .
Happiness also boosts the immune system .
A study at Birmingham University found a link between higher levels of antibodies to flu and being in a happy marriage .
Those with the highest marital satisfaction had the higher antibody responses to a flu vaccine after four weeks .
A second study the University of North Carolina shows happiness in a marriage was linked to lower blood pressure , and fewer stress hormones .
A study from the Foundation for Advancement of International Science , also in Japan , showed that laughter seems to lower levels of a protein involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy , a kidney disease that occurs as a result of diabetes and which is the leading cause of kidney failure .
Levels dropped substantially and immediately after watching a comedy show .
" The beneficial effects of laughter on preventing the exacerbation of diabetic nephropathy are strongly suggested , " say the researchers .
But one of the most important findings on the effects of laughter is its impact on inflammation , which plays a key role in a wide range of diseases , from arthritis to cancer , and which is a component of many age - related chronic diseases that often cause disability .
Research reported in the Oxford University Press medical journal , Rheumatology , showed that blood levels of key inflammatory compounds dropped considerably after patients with rheumatoid arthritis watched a humorous film .
The researchers recorded amounts of what they call " mirthful laughter " and found that levels of interleukin 6 , a cytokine that plays a central role in inflammation , dropped significantly in the arthritis patients , but not in a healthy comparison group .
The anti-inflammatory effects have also been shown to last for 12 or more hours after the laughter has subsided .
Pain can be eased by laughter too .
When researchers at the University of California exposed children aged between seven and 16 to a pain experiment , where they put their hands into very cold water , those who watched a funny video and laughed were able to tolerate more pain .
While the mechanisms involved in the effects of laughter on immune and other body systems are poorly understood , some effects have more straightforward explanations .
Laughter is thought to trigger changes in breathing patterns that may have a therapeutic effect for patients with chronic lung disease .
In some of the latest research at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland , doctors have been testing the idea that laughter can reduce hyperinflation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which has been estimated to effect up to 900,000 people in the UK .
Results show that humour therapy reduced hyperinflation in patients who have severe COPD .
Dieters , too , may be unlikely beneficiaries of the direct physical effects of laughter .
Researchers at Meharry Medical College , Nashville , have gone to some lengths to calculate the energy expended in a laugh .
With the help of four funny film clips , a calorimeter , a heart rate monitor , and digitised audio data for counting the number of laughs , they worked out that the energy loss from laughter was the equivalent of from 0.79 - 1.30 kJ/min ( 0.19 - 0.31 kcal / min ) .
" Genuine voiced laughter causes a 10 to 20 per cent increase in energy use and heart rate , " they say .
That means , it 's suggested , that 15 minutes of jollity a day – or half an episode of Only fools and Horses – could be enough to laugh away the effects of a small chocolate bar .
Unless you ’re of a certain age , the name Kate Bush probably wo n’t mean much to your musical sensibilities .
But that wild haired woman singing Babooshka on VH - 1 classics , in a Princess Leia style metal bra ( which predates Luke ’s sister entertaining Jabba , might I add ) is the woman who is to this day still a major force in popular music .
As well as drawing men of all ages into a new found fascination with movement and expressive dance , in the late 1970 ’s and 1980’s , Kate ’s visuals were only half the story in the musical career of a woman who paved the way for female producers and songwriters like Björk and Elizabeth Fraser .
Once upon a time , the pop in pop music stood for popular — and in the mid 1980 ’s Kate Bush ’s experimental sounds , made possible by her love for the Fairlight synthesiser , drew a new audience into electronic music .
Here she is pictured for a Keyboard magazine spread on the incredible synthesiser and the people who used it .

It is not enough to get rid of this or that harmful regulation .
For the benefits to last , there must be system - level reform to the rulemaking process that keeps generating those rules .
Institutions matter .
One of the best of those institution - level reform ideas now has COVID - 19 - focused legislation at the ready : the independent regulatory reduction commission .
December 2008
For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionate to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations .
Those who bet on economies of scale generally won , which meant the largest organizations were the most successful ones .
Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to believe , but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations tended to be the most progressive .
An ambitious kid graduating from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge , gleaming offices of Ford , or General Electric , or NASA .
Small meant small - time .
Small in 1960 did n't mean a cool little startup .
It meant uncle Sid 's shoe store .
When I grew up in the 1970s , the idea of the " corporate ladder " was still very much alive .
The standard plan was to try to get into a good college , from which one would be drafted into some organization and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility .
The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster . [ 1 ]
But in the late twentieth century something changed .
It turned out that economies of scale were not the only force at work .
Particularly in technology , the increase in speed one could get from smaller groups started to trump the advantages of size .
The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting in 1970 .
The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed to materialize .
But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges indicating our specialty and rank .
Instead of being dominated by a few , giant tree - structured organizations , it 's now looking like the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller , independent units .
It 's not so much that large organizations stopped working .
There 's no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today .
But they were competing against opponents who could n't change the rules on the fly by discovering new technology .
Now it turns out the rule " large and disciplined organizations win " needs to have a qualification appended : " at games that change slowly . "
No one knew till change reached a sufficient speed .
Large organizations will start to do worse now , though , because for the first time in history they 're no longer getting the best people .
An ambitious kid graduating from college now does n't want to work for a big company .
They want to work for the hot startup that 's rapidly growing into one .
If they 're really ambitious , they want to start it . [ 2 ]
This does n't mean big companies will disappear .
To say that startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist , because startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired by them . [ 3 ]
But large organizations will probably never again play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the twentieth century .
It 's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever run out .
How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands of years , then switches polarity ?
The millennia - long run of bigger - is - better left us with a lot of traditions that are now obsolete , but extremely deeply rooted .
Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them .
It will be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and which can now be discarded .
The place to look is where the spread of smallness began : in the world of startups .
There have always been occasional cases , particularly in the US , of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of climbing it .
But till recently this was an anomalous route that tended to be followed only by outsiders .
It was no coincidence that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so little formal education .
As huge as their companies eventually became , they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at first .
That was a social step no one with a college education would take if they could avoid it .
Till the rise of technology startups , and in particular , Internet startups , it was very unusual for educated people to start their own businesses .
The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor , the original Silicon Valley startup , were n't even trying to start a company at first .
They were just looking for a company willing to hire them as a group .
Then one of their parents introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find funding for them to start their own , so they did .
But starting a company was an alien idea to them ; it was something they backed into . [ 4 ]
Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea of starting a startup .
East Coast universities are not far behind , and British universities only a little behind them .
This pattern suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly , but a leading indicator .
This is the way the world is going .
Of course , Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world 's economy .
Could a trend based on them be that powerful ?
I think so .
There 's no reason to suppose there 's any limit to the amount of work that could be done in this area .
Like science , wealth seems to expand fractally .
Steam power was a sliver of the British economy when Watt started working on it .
But his work led to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part .
The same thing could happen with the Internet .
If Internet startups offer the best opportunity for ambitious people , then a lot of ambitious people will start them , and this bit of the economy will balloon in the usual fractal way .
Even if Internet - related applications only become a tenth of the world 's economy , this component will set the tone for the rest .
The most dynamic part of the economy always does , in everything from salaries to standards of dress .
Not just because of its prestige , but because the principles underlying the most dynamic part of the economy tend to be ones that work .
For the future , the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small , autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually .
And the societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance .
As with the original industrial revolution , some societies are going to be better at this than others .
Within a generation of its birth in England , the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental Europe and North America .
But it did n't spread everywhere .
This new way of doing things could only take root in places that were prepared for it .
It could only spread to places that already had a vigorous middle class .
There is a similar social component to the transformation that began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s .
Two new kinds of techniques were developed there : techniques for building integrated circuits , and techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast by creating new technology .
The techniques for building integrated circuits spread rapidly to other countries .
But the techniques for building startups did n't .
Fifty years later , startups are ubiquitous in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities , but they 're still an anomaly in most of the world .
Part of the reason — possibly the main reason — that startups have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their social disruptiveness .
Though it brought many social changes , the Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger is better .
Quite the opposite : the two dovetailed beautifully .
The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large organizations like the military and the civil service , and the resulting hybrid worked well .
" Captains of industry " issued orders to " armies of workers , " and everyone knew what they were supposed to do .
Startups seem to go more against the grain , socially .
It 's hard for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability , just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class .
But there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the Industrial Revolution happened .
There do not seem to be that many ready this time .
Notes
[ 1 ] One of the bizarre consequences of this model was that the usual way to make more money was to become a manager .
This is one of the things startups fix .
[ 2 ] There are a lot of reasons American car companies have been doing so much worse than Japanese car companies , but at least one of them is a cause for optimism : American graduates have more options .
[ 3 ]
It 's possible that companies will one day be able to grow big in revenues without growing big in people , but we are not very far along that trend yet .

A dead man was officially named Adam Walsh ’s killer Tuesday , but not because of any new evidence or a deathbed confession .
Police simply took another look at 27 years of tips , psychic revelations , often - botched police work and a serial killer ’s chilling admissions and decided it was time .
Time to ease the suffering of the Walsh family and time to point the finger at the man Hollywood Police Chief Chad Wagner said had been the prime suspect all along : Ottis Toole .
“ This is a process that is long overdue , ” Wagner told an audience that included Adam ’s parents , John and Reve Walsh .
Wagner acknowledged that not much had changed since 1996 , when Toole died in prison while serving a sentence for an unrelated murder .

He had twice confessed to killing Adam and twice recanted .
“ We could have charged him back then , ” Wagner said .
“ I ’ve taken cases much weaker than this to the state attorney ’s office . ”
The announcement was long on drama and compassion for the Walshes , but it offered no new evidence against the drifter from Jacksonville , Fla. , who passed through Hollywood on July 27 , 1981 .
That was the day 6 - year - old Adam disappeared from a Sears at the Hollywood Mall -- across from the police station -- while his mother shopped for lamps .
Adam ’s severed head was found two weeks later in Vero Beach , Fla. , beginning a search that has haunted the Walsh family , Reve Walsh said Tuesday .

She thanked the family ’s three children , Meghan , Callahan and Hayden , who were born after Adam ’s death .
The abduction of a young boy from a busy shopping mall sparked fear among parents nationwide and changed the way police and the media responded to reports of missing children .
Wagner acknowledged that evidence was destroyed or overlooked and apologized to the Walshes for investigative mistakes .
Among the problems : Police lost a bloody carpet from Toole ’s 1971 Cadillac , then lost the car .
They also missed leads , took poor investigative notes and did n’t properly document evidence .
Advertisement
But the case led to improvements that law enforcement officials and children ’s advocates say have saved lives .
On Aug. 19 , four days after Adam ’s funeral , the family established the Adam Walsh Outreach Center for Missing Children .
It has since become a national clearinghouse for families and law enforcement officers dealing with reports of missing children .
The Walshes also lobbied for stronger laws before Congress and at the White House .
John Walsh ’s television show , “ America ’s Most Wanted , ” is credited with helping to solve hundreds of crimes .
“ We can now move forward knowing positively who killed our little boy , ” John Walsh said .
“ I believe wherever Toole is , he ’s paying and being held accountable for his actions . ”

The lack of new evidence and the inability of Toole to defend himself wo n’t quiet critics who said police got it wrong , Wagner said .
“ If you ’re looking for that magic wand , that one piece of evidence , it ’s not there , ” Wagner said .

We once supposed that Ustream 's Shiba Inu Puppy Cam might be the most popular live - streaming video of all time .
Wonder no more .
A Ustream source says Shiba Inu Puppy Cam has been viewed 15 million times , for a combined 773 viewer years .
For a little perspective , note that 2008 's most popular Web video -- the Jonas Brothers ' Burnin ' Up -- has over four times as many views .
But that only resulted in 326.3 viewer years .
In fact , as soon as Puppy Cam passes 794 viewers years , it will pass Avril Lavigne 's " Girlfriend " as the most watched Web video ever .
That should happen sometime Friday .
Also , we 're willing to bet that Puppy Cam costs were far less than 25 % of the production costs involved in prettying up the Jonas Brothers .
As the puppies grow up and their owners sell them , the puppy cam population continues to dwindle .
But not Ustream 's traffic , says cofounder Brad Hunstable .
“ All around , we ’ve seen tremendous growth , ” Ustream cofounder Brad Hunstable told the New York Times .
“ We ’ve seen a spike of about 25 percent growth in new shows , a massive spike in our unique visitors , and gotten e-mails from interested investors . ”
More importantly , there 's already a new puppy cam up and running .

Rockefeller : NSA may have spied on me David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday January 22 , 2009
Print This Email This Alleged NSA spying targeted journalists , raising new questions
Update : Ex-NSA analyst believes program is last remnant of ' Total Information Awareness '
Wiretapping whistleblower Russell Tice has been heard .
Loud and clear .
Following Wednesday 's allegation by the former National Security Agency analyst that President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program had spied on everyone , contrary to what the administration had claimed , Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) told MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Thursday that he was " quite prepared to believe " the allegations .
" I think they went after anyone they could get -- including me , " Tice added .
Tice , during an appearance on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann the prior evening , proclaimed , " The National Security Agency had access to all Americans ' communications -- faxes , phone calls , and their computer communications .
It did n't matter whether you were in Kansas , in the middle of the country , and you never made foreign communications at all .
They monitored all communications . "
" In one of the operations that I was in , we looked at organizations , just supposedly so that we would not target them , " Tice told Olbermann .
" What I was finding out , though , is that the collection on those organizations was 24/7 and 365 days a year -- and it made no sense .
... I started to investigate that .
That 's about the time when they came after me to fire me . "
President Bush shaking hands with Sen. Rockefeller in July 2008 , shortly after the passage of the FISA Amendments Act. ( Reuters )
When Olbermann pressed him for specifics ,
Tice offered , " An organization that was collected on were US news organizations and reporters and journalists . "
The allegation essentially changes America 's debate about domestic spying by the government , from one of listening to terrorists , as the Bush administration had framed it , to that of an intelligence operation beyond President Nixon 's greatest aspirations , if it 's true .
It should also raise new questions about a 2004 revelation in the New York Times that the paper had withheld a story for over a year , at the administration 's request , which described scant few , albeit now - known false details of the program .
" While many details about the program remain secret , officials familiar with it said the N.S.A. eavesdropped without warrants on up to 500 people in the United States at any given time , " the Times wrote , shortly after the 2004 election .
" The list changes as some names are added and others dropped , so the number monitored in this country may have reached into the thousands over the past three years , several officials said .
Overseas , about 5,000 to 7,000 people suspected of terrorist ties are monitored at one time , according to those officials . "
The paper also notes that additional information was omitted , again at the request of the Bush administration .
The allegations at hand would seem to quickly dovetail into , ' Why ? '
Make that , Senators too ?
On July 9 , 2008 , the US Senate passed a bill expanding legal authority for electronic wiretaps by spy agencies , handing victory to President George W. Bush after a standoff over anti-terror strategy .
Then - Senator Obama , along with newly appointed Secretary of State Clinton , said they would support Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn ) in filibustering the GOP effort , specifically when it came to immunity for the private telecom companies which allowed the NSA to conduct warrantless spying .
Obama ultimately " compromised , " saying : " The President 's illegal program of warrantless surveillance will be over .
It restores FISA and existing criminal wiretap statutes as the exclusive means to conduct surveillance  making it clear that the President cannot circumvent the law and disregard the civil liberties of the American people . "
Clinton maintained her position , voting against the majority .
" I 've never seen contempt for the rule of law such as this , " said Sen. Dodd in Dec. 2007 .
With this latest round of revelations , perhaps another new question should be , ' Has Obama ? '
Tice reappeared on Countdown the following night , bearing new allegations against the NSA .

Whistleblower : NSA spied on everyone , targeted journalists
The disparity was even more marked among 500 uncommitted voters polled after watching the debate on CBS : Mr Obama won 53 per cent of the vote compared with 22 per cent who came out for Mr McCain .
A total of 14 per cent of these unaligned voters said the debate had made up their mind to vote for Mr McCain , while 28 per cent said they would now be voting for Mr Obama and 58 per cent still were n't sure .

Maybe you want to buy some pornography or maybe you 'd like to purchase some condoms , lube , lingerie , toys , games or whatever other merchandise we carry .
That 's great , and I hope you find what you want in the store , but please , avoid these pitfalls and be a good customer .
1 .
If you are a needy as hell customer who asks me to check movies before you rent or buy them to make sure you will like them , I will secretly hate you .
All of our movies have people fucking in them .
Usually 2 or more people !
This much you should know .
Now do the following : Look at the box cover .
Is it appealing to you ?
No ?
Stop , put the movie away and pick up another and try again .
Yes ?
Good !
Now , turn over the box .
Do you see those other pictures ?
If none of those appeal to you , do n't rent the movie .
If they appeal to you , rent it , take it home , wank to it , be happy .
If it 's not to your liking , shut the fuck up and rent another movie .
I really do n't care if it was n't appropriate wanking material up to your fine and high pornography standards .
This is n't a restaurant where you can send something back if you do n't like it – it's a porn store .
2 .
If you return movies that you rented with unidentified substances on them , you are a nasty motherfucker who should get hit by a bus .
I get paid $ 9.00 / hour , which is not enough to clean up your spunk .
Wash your hands before you take the DVD out of the player , you nasty ass son of a bitch .
After you return that nasty jizz covered movie , I will curse you loudly , put on 2 pairs of latex gloves , use copious amounts of cleaning supplies and then put a nasty note in your account about how you are a nasty asshole who can't return a movie the way we gave it to you - clean and DNA free .
Then , everyone who works in the store knows what a nasty person you are .
So for the love of Christ , wash your nasty hands and have some respect for the people who work here .
3 .
If you and your partner come into my store and you want to buy some lingerie , that is great .
It 's even nice if your husband / boyfriend / John / whatever wants to help you into the lingerie as some of the stuff we sell is hard to get on by yourself .
But seriously , do n't fuck in my dressing room .
That is nasty and gross .
Take your lingerie , try it on , buy it if you like it , take it home and fuck there .
I would n't come into your place of work and fuck on your desk , so do n't have sex here in my store .
Do n't try to be sneaky about it either .
If I notice you 've been in the dressing room for more than a few minutes , I 'm going to come by and knock on the door to see if everything is okay .
And if I hear moaning and grunting , I 'm going to call the police .
4 .
Please treat our merchandise with some respect .
In any other store would you open up boxes , rip off labels , or throw things around ?
I doubt it .
Also , my store is not a club or a party .
I know we are open late , so maybe you really do think this is a club , but I swear it 's not .
It 's a store .
We 're here to sell things and make money .
The things we sell are fun and great , sure , but this is not a place for you and all of your friends to come in and laugh and scream and point ( and destroy merchandise , as mentioned above ) for 2 hours and then leave without purchasing anything .
5 .
Do n't hit on me or any of my coworkers .
That is desperate and gross .
Also , you 're standing at my counter with 2 tranny movies , some desensitizing spray and a pair of panties .
Do you really think this situation lends itself to me agreeing to go out with you ?
Nope , did n't think so .
Also , do n't stare at me or my coworkers like we 're pieces of meat .
Do n't ask us inappropriate questions either .
No , I wo n't demonstrate how the toys are used .
I also wo n't tell you what it is I like in bed .
And seriously , if you ask me to model lingerie one more time , I 'm going to kick you out .
6 .
Additionally , just because I work at an adult store does not make me uneducated , a freak , a stripper , a prostitute or desperate .
I am college educated ( and currently in graduate school ) , well read and a pretty normal person with friends , family , a dog , hobbies , etc .
I took this job for a variety of reasons , none of which I have to explain to you .
7 .
If I ask for your ID , do n't give me grief .
Take it as a compliment – I 'm saying that you look youthful and fresh .
I can get in trouble and lose my job for letting someone under 18 into the store .
Do n't bitch about how you do n't have your ID ( I have to ask you to leave , sorry ) or how you have to go out to your car and walk the terrible 30 feet to get it or ask me how old I think you are .
You look like you could be under 18 .
Show me your ID and I 'll leave you alone .
If all of your friends show me their ID but you “ do n't have yours , ” I 'm going to have to ask you to go outside .
Just because all of your friends are 18 + does not mean you are .
I know it 's a bummer , but it 's the rule .
8 .
And finally , if you are someone who brings your child into the store , you fail at parenting and at life .

Latest updates from Microsoft : the critical remote execution bug which we already talked about affects all IE versions ( included IE8 beta ) on every supported Windows operating system .
The bulletin also corrects some early assumptions about this unpatched vulnerability , which is being actively exploited in the wild from apparently legitimate sites infected through automated SQL injections :
The hole is in data binding , and not in XML processing like many ( me too ) reported initially .
Increasing the security level of the Internet Zone to " High " and disabling active scripting does not suffice to protect you , even if it makes attacker 's life slightly harder .
Not harder than yours , though , since Microsoft 's " Security Zones " have nothing of NoScript 's usability ...
The only work - around suggested by Microsoft is disabling both active scripting and the OLEDB32 library , which is unluckily required by most applications working with databases .
So , do you really want to keep inflicting yourself that blue " e " ?
Or are you ready for a red panda ?

The Federal Reserve is to vote on credit card reforms that may bring some relief to customers who face a variety of ways for being hit with late fees , universal defaults , shorter payment periods and confusing payment allocations for different balances .
Credit card users likely also would see easier - to - read tables in their monthly statements as a result of the changes .
The new rules , which were proposed earlier this year , are expected to total some 1,000 pages .
They need approval of the Federal Reserve , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration , which all are expected to act on Thursday .
Consumer groups say practices of credit card companies blindside consumers and U.S. lawmakers have threatened legislation if regulators did not use their consumer protection powers to reform the industry .
With Democrats strengthening their control of the next Congress that convenes in January and the financial services sector in turmoil , credit card companies that resisted the changes increasingly have accepted them as inevitable .
They have warned that interest rates charged on credit cards will rise for all borrowers and that borrowing limits may be reduce because of the changes .
The industry maintains that credit cards provide a service to consumers with convenience and sometimes free loans .
“ The new rules will be a challenge to the business , ” said Peter Garuccio , director of public relations at the American Bankers Association trade group .
POTENTIAL SWEEPING IMPACT
In 2007 , Americans were using an estimated 694.4 billion credit cards with Visa , MasterCard , American Express and Discover logos , according to the Card Industry Directory .
Banking regulators have been using focus groups to test the impact of changing credit card rules for the past couple of years and on Thursday are expected finalize some changes .
They are expected to prohibit credit card companies from increasing rates at will , with some exceptions such as those that apply to people who fail to pay a bill within 30 days .
So - called universal default , which permits changing card terms if the borrower defaults on another bill such as utilities or a gym membership , also is expected to be banned .
Double - cycle billing , in which card companies reach back to earlier billing cycles to help calculate interest charged in the current cycle , also is expected to be eliminated .
With the U.S. economy in recession , the market that trades in credit card asset - backed securities faces increasing stress as more consumers fall behind on payments .
As delinquencies and charge - offs -- balances written off as uncollectible -- on credit cards rise , investors demand higher yield spreads for credit card - backed securities .
The ABA represents the biggest issuers of Visa and MasterCard .
Citigroup , Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase enjoyed almost 70 percent of the credit card market at the end of 2007 , according to the Card Industry Directory .
About 2,700 Canadian soldiers are in Afghanistan
Canadian military police have charged a Canadian officer with murdering an unarmed Afghan man in Helmand Province last year .
Captain Robert Semrau is accused of shooting and killing a man officials described as a " presumed insurgent " .
Capt Semrau was with a mentoring team helping Afghan soldiers in Helmand at the time of the death " on or about " 19 October of last year .
Taleban insurgents had launched a major offensive in Helmand at the time .
Capt Semrau is being held by military police before being transferred back to Canada to face a military judge , the Canadian defence ministry said .
He was charged " with one count of second - degree murder " and " is accused of shooting , with intent to kill , an unarmed male person " , Canadian military police investigators said in a statement .
Fierce attacks
Military officials launched their investigation into the death of the Afghan man after being informed of the allegations on 27 December .
Canada has about 2,700 soldiers in Afghanistan serving as part of Nato 's International Security Assistance Force .
Since their mission was stepped up in 2006 , 106 have been killed .
Most are based in Kandahar , but in mid-October a group of Canadian mentors was with Afghan troops in neighbouring Helmand , where the Taleban had launched fierce attacks on the key town of Lashkar Gah .
Afghan and Nato officials said at least 100 insurgents had died in the battle .
Following the Grant accepted for Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo and Plans for Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo I can already let you know that the first steps has been made .
Padre is already capable to provide correct albeit slow syntax highlighting for Perl 6 .
Actually it was implemented by Ahmad M. Zawawi , a neighbor of mine , who is also the maintainer of Syntax : : Highlight : : Perl6 .
That 's good news .
I have not been playing with Perl 6 in many months now as some time ago I decided that I 'll start to write Perl 6 again when I can get syntax highlighting in Padre and when I can run my Perl 6 scripts from within Padre .
That time has come so I 've started to write some Perl 6 code but I need the documentation to be handy .
So we are now discussing it on the # padre IRC channel on how to integrate Padre with the existing Perl 6 documentation and how to provide a real - world use case .
I would like to be able to press on F1 and get an explanation of the element where my cursor is currently located .
I 'd like to get the call - tips directly from the Perl 6 documentation .
As the Perl 6 documentation can be linked to the tests implementing the specific elements using the smartlinks in the test files we could open the specific test files for editing right from the documentation .
Updated December 17 at 9:00 a.m. PST with a comment from Lavasoft .
Lavasoft on Monday unveiled a new antivirus application it hopes will do as well as its runaway hit Ad - Aware .
The encore , Lavasoft Anti-Virus Helix , is Lavasoft 's first full - fledged antivirus application .
The problem is , it 's nearly identical to one that already exists : Avira AntiVir .
A Lavasoft vice president told CNET in an e-mail :
Yes , we do have a technology partnership with Avira for the anti-virus engine technology , as our company expertise is in anti-spyware .
We have customers who have been asking us for years to release a stand - alone anti-virus , because they do not want to be forced into using other security applications built into a suite that may not meet the standards they require ... Lavasoft 's contribution to the stand - alone anti-virus is a trusted brand in security software , particularly as we were the first to ever launch a commercial anti-spyware product .
Furthermore , Lavasoft admits to being opaque about their " partnership " except " when asked directly . "
This is disingenuous , especially for a respected company that claims to deliver on a customer promise .
It would be one thing if Lavasoft borrowed Avira 's antivirus engine to complement its own antispyware program .
It is another to thinly veil a recognized , proprietary product under a new color scheme and stamp it your own .
Performance
Lavasoft Anti-Virus Helix shares Avira AntiVir 's interface , down to malware blockers , on - the - fly detection , a scanner , malware removal , and protection from e-mail viruses and Web threats .
It offers full system scanning and , in addition , lets you pick from preset scans or create a profile to scan a smaller portion of your PC , for instance , just your " C " drive .
( Credit : CNET )
Just like Avira AntiVir , Lavasoft 's new antivirus app performed well in our tests .
It beeped when encountering a suspicious file and would n't budge until we ignored , deleted , or quarantined it .
While a good practice , the need to babysit the scan could undo the benefit of any overnight scans you schedule .
Lavasoft Anti-Virus
Helix lets you do any number of things with the data , including print , save , and send reports .
However , it could use an internal browser to look up information online about discovered threats .
Other extras can be found in the app's configuration menu .
When you elect to enter expert mode , you 'll be able to turn on rootkit scanning , scan outgoing e-mail messages , and specify MIME types to block ( simplistically , any area of an e-mail where malware can hitch a ride ) .
We appreciate being able to add suspicious files from the quarantine interface .
The fact that you have to manually discover and add STMP e-mail and specific MIME details points to one of the app 's biggest problems .
Compared to Ad - Aware and others in Lavasoft 's family , the dowdy Anti-Virus Helix is much less user - friendly in visual appeal , navigation , and organization .
In fact , it bucks the trend most publishers embrace to favor icons over text lines in order to configure and start protections .
That 's little concern for intermediate and advanced users who thrive on file trees and wo n't mind consulting the program 's thorough help file when the tool tips are n't quite explanatory enough .
Casual users who prefer to set it and forget it may wonder why Ad- Aware is so simple to schedule and run but Anti-Virus Helix takes more effort .
They may also wonder why this application bundle was marketed under a new name in the first place .
The world has lately come to face an unheard - of surge of violence , such as Georgia 's adventurous sortie in the Caucasus , recent terrorist attacks in India , and an escalation of violence in Gaza Strip .
Although not apparently linked directly , these developments have common features .
I am referring to the existing international organisations ' inability to provide constructive solutions to regional conflicts , or effective proposals for inter-ethnic and inter-state settlement .
Multilateral political mechanisms have proved as ineffective as global financial and economic regulators .
We know that provoking military and political instability , regional and other conflicts is a helpful means of distracting the public from growing social and economic problems .
Such attempts cannot be ruled out , unfortunately .
To prevent this scenario , we need to improve the system of international relations , making it more effective , safe and stable .
There are a lot of important issues on the global agenda in which most countries have shared interests .
These include anti-crisis policies , joint efforts to reform international financial institutions , to improve regulatory mechanisms , ensure energy security and mitigate the global food crisis – which is an extremely pressing issue today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Russia is willing to contribute to dealing with international priority issues .
We expect all our partners in Europe , Asia and America , including the new US administration , to show interest in further constructive cooperation in dealing with all these issues and more .
We wish the new team success .
The international community is facing a host of extremely complicated problems , which might seem overpowering at times .
But a journey of thousand miles begins with a single step , as the proverb goes .
We must seek a foothold relying on the moral values that have ensured the progress of our civilisation .
Integrity and hard work , responsibility and self - confidence will eventually lead us to success .
We should not despair .
This crisis can and must be fought , also by pooling our intellectual , moral and material resources .
Therefore , finding this mutual trust is a key goal that we should concentrate on now .

The pound has been battered by fears of a prolonged recession in the UK
Sterling has slipped again against the US dollar after a massive fall on Monday - the largest in percentage terms since 1992 .
The pound was trading at $ 1.479 , as against $ 1.483 at the previous close .
On Monday it fell 5.2 % against the dollar as yet more bad economic data pointed towards a prolonged recession and further interest rate cuts .
Sterling was almost steady against the euro on Tuesday , at 1.176 , compared to 1.174 euro on the previous day .
POUND STERLING v UNITED STATES DOLLAR : 02 December 2008
* All Times GMT
The pound 's fall on Monday was the largest since the sterling crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) in 1992 .
Sharp falls in the FTSE 100 index - down 5.2 % on Monday - served to undermine the currency .
The poor economic data increases the likelihood that the Bank of England will cut interest rates on Thursday .
HSBC confirmed on Monday it is cutting 500 jobs across the UK , while carmaker Aston Martin announced it will cut 300 full - time and 300 temporary jobs .
Mortgage approvals also fell in October , according to figures released by the Bank of England , suggesting house prices may fall even further .

How much would you pay for access to the emails Sarah Palin has sent and received as governor of Alaska ?
Would you part with $ 10,000 for them ?
That ’s basically what her office is asking .
During the general election , I filed an open records act request for all emails that had gone to and from Palin in her official capacity .
And Alaska citizen watchdog Andrée McLeod , who had long been peppering Palin ’s office with similar requests , did the same .
At a time when Palin was on the hot seat as Senator John McCain ’s vice presidential running mate , her office replied that it would cost over $ 65,000 to round up all of Palin ’s emails and that Mother Jones would have to cover this cost .
The problem : Palin had used at least two nonofficial email accounts ( such as a Yahoo account ) to conduct her state business .
Given that the governor ’s office did not have access to those accounts , its information specialists had concluded that the only way to gather all her emails would be to search the state email accounts for about 70 people who worked within the executive offices of the governor and look for emails to and from Palin ’s nonofficial email accounts .
Palin ’s office estimated it would cost almost a thousand dollars for each search of these 70 or so official accounts .
It seemed absurd and unfair for Palin ’s office to pass the cost of this search on to those who had requested Palin ’s emails .
After all , she should have been using her state email account for state business .
In a letter to her office , I maintained that requesters should not be forced to pay for Palin ’s inappropriate use of nonofficial accounts .
Palin ’s office eventually agreed , deciding it would not charge fees for the extensive search operation that would be necessary to compile Palin ’s emails .
In early October , it informed me that it would begin reviewing Palin ’s official emails and gather the emails related to state business that were sent to and from her nonofficial accounts .
All for no charge .
But there was a rub : this whole process could be expected to take weeks .
That meant that none of her emails ( from either official or nonofficial accounts ) would become public prior to the November 4 election .
Because Palin had used these nonofficial accounts for official business , arguably in violation of Alaska state open records rules , she had managed ( wittingly or not ) to orchestrate the functional equivalent of a cover - up–at least , a temporary one .
On December 5 , Linda Perez , Palin ’s administrative director , sent me a letter noting that Alaska ’s Department of Administration had completed the job of assembling Palin ’s emails into a single account .
“ The account is now available for records production purposes , ” she wrote .
In all , there are approximately 25,700 emails in this account , the letter reported .
But they are not yet ready for release , and now here come the real fees .
Each email , Perez wrote , has to be opened and printed separately in a “ fairly time - consuming ” process .
The cost for doing this : $ 3,955.23 .
The calculations : a staffer paid $ 15.39 an hour could review about 100 emails per hour .
And Perez said that Mother Jones and McLeod would have to pay for this .
The process , though , would not end there .
Once these emails are printed out , the records would then be sent to the state ’s Department of Law ( which is headed by a Palin appointee ) for “ privilege review . ”
That is , individual emails could be withheld on the basis of various exemptions .
( When the Palin administration responded to an earlier email request from McLeod regarding two Palin staffers , it withheld over 1100 emails , relying on questionable exemptions . )
So there ’s no guaranteeing how many of these emails will be released .
And there ’s more .
Once the legal review is finished , the emails deemed appropriate for release will have to be copied , and Palin ’s office will charge a duplication fee .
In earlier correspondences , Palin ’s office indicated the fee could be over 25 cents a page .
If about 25,000 emails ( a page each ) are cleared for release , the copying fee could top $ 6,000 .
Ten thousand dollars to see Palin emails reviewed by Palin ’s legal department ?
Is it worth it ?
Other media outfits have submitted requests for some of Palin ’s emails ( based on subjects ) .
It may be possible to create a consortium of groups to share the costs .
I will be talking to representatives of these other organizations to determine if we can work together .
And there may be other options .
So stay tuned .
Palin has certainly not retreated to Alaska .
She recently campaigned for Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , during the special election Chambliss ended up winning .
“ I ca n’t overstate the impact she had down here , ” he said afterward .
With Palin acting as if she is interested in remaining a political player on the national stage , her emails –if the legal reviewers do not censor them for political purposes –might still make interesting , and perhaps important , reading .

It is true that today much of the world uses the Gregorian calendar with the Anno Domini dating system , and this fact is often brought up by Christians as evidence for Jesus , but this “ evidence ” would hardly even be worth refuting if it were n’t so commonly used .
Most people do n’t know much about the history of our calendar , which is not surprising since it is not often important in our lives , but when it is brought up in this way it becomes necessary to explore it , and it ’s actually more interesting than might be expected .
This is the basic premise :
We use a dating system based on the birth of Jesus .
Therefore Jesus existed .
To examine the truth value of this claim , we must break it down further :
AD , which stands for “ Anno Domini ” meaning “ in the year of our Lord ” did not spring into existence in 1 AD , or even 50 or 100 AD .
The Anno Domini dating system was created in what we now call 525 AD by a monk named Dionysius Exiguus .
This is more than 500 years after the monk believed Jesus to have been born .
To make matters worse , we know that Dionysius made mistakes in his dating .
This is a well established fact , and combined with the irreconcilable conflicts in Biblical accounts which attempt to date the birth of Jesus , it leaves us with little doubt that the Anno Domini dating system is not in fact accurately based on the year that Jesus was born .
About 200 years later , another monk and historian who is now called Saint Bede came up with “ ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus ” ( “ the time before the Lord ’s true incarnation ” ) .
This is what we refer to as “ Before Christ ” or BC .
It should be clear why some monks would wish to create a dating system based on the year they believed their messiah to have been born , and it is not evidence for a historical Jesus , only for monks who believed in one .
Even in Bede ’s day , over 700 years after the time Dionysius set for the birth of Jesus , this dating system was not popular .
It was n’t until later in the 8th century that it began to spread slowly across Europe after its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne .
Despite all of this it took nearly 700 more years to cover even Western Europe , finally reaching Portugal in 1422 , and even today it is not used universally .
If the whole world , or even just people in the vicinity of Judea , had immediately started to date things based on the same BC / AD system we have today , it would be a strong piece of circumstantial evidence for Jesus .
Even if they had started within 50 years , it would have been impressive .
Not only was the Anno Domini dating system not a rapidly spreading phenomenon exploding from Judea to the rest of the world in the first century in response to the birth of Jesus though , it was not invented until more than 500 years later and not popular for several hundred years more .
This is weak evidence for Jesus indeed .
So what did people use before ?
There have been many different dating systems , but most of them have been based on such things as the year an empire was founded , or the year of the reign of a specific ruler .
For example in Rome there were several different ways of giving a year based on such things as the year of the reign of an emperor , who the consuls for the year were , or the number of years from the founding of Rome .
In fact , when Julius Caesar instituted the Julian calendar ( which our modern Gregorian calendar is a modified form of ) in 45 BC , the year to him was still 709 ab urbe condita meaning “ from the founding of the City [ of Rome ] “ .
Even today in Japan there are three different dating systems .
Anno Domini is used now , but there is also an era name based on the current emperor ( Heisei 21 is 2009 ) , and there is even an imperial year ( currently Kōki 2669 ) based on the date Japan was supposedly founded by Emperor Jimmu whose historicity , like Jesus ’s is questionable .
The fact that there is a dating system based on the date he is said to have founded Japan does nothing to prove his existence as an actual person .
So despite its continued frequent use by some Christians as “ evidence for Jesus ” , the Anno Domini dating system is no more evidence of an historical Jesus than the Erisian calendar is evidence of an historical Eris .

10 Unbelievable Female Bodybuilders
Some might say that professional and extreme bodybuilding is all about pushing the body to its limits , in search of that “ perfect image ” that tends to vary from person to person .
Others might claim that it ’s an addiction that ca n’t be helped , a habit that must be continuously fuelled and supported .
But whatever a person ’s reason for pushing the limits , most will agree that steroids , specifically anabolic steroids , tend to do more harm than good , especially when the side - effects are brought to attention .
This piece intends to shine a light on the potentially horrific outcomes when a female bodybuilder decides to take things beyond what most might rationally call “ the norm ” , as in the perceived image of what a feminine form should look like .
This writer understands that this is a topic in which opinion and personal preferences play the largest part in any decision , but merely aims to provoke thought on the matter of what it is that drives people to do this to themselves .
Is it madness or sheer willpower and a desire to achieve something that drives these women ?
Is the resultant figure or body an example of horror , or that of beauty , which is – as they say – in the eye of the beholder ?
Anabolic steroids are a steroid hormone which is directly related to the predominantly male sex hormone , testosterone .
These steroids increase the synthesis of protein within cells , thus resulting in the buildup of tissue , especially in muscles .
The word “ anabolic ” comes from the Greek words “ anabole ” meaning “ to build up ” , as well as the word “ androgenic ” ( as well as meaning the enhancement of masculine characteristics due to the increment in testosterone levels ) from the Greek words “ andros ” and “ genein ” , meaning “ man ” and “ to produce ” , respectively .
The side effects associated with steroid abuse are particularly negative for women , resulting in a whole range of various problems and unwanted effects including – but not limited to – deepening of the voice , increased body hair and clitoromegaly , or an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris .
So take a look at the following professional female body builders and decide for yourself where you think the boundary between beauty / obsession lies and whether or not these people have left that line so far behind that they begin to lose all traces of their femininity .

The Hamas government has placed dozens of Fatah members under house arrest out of fear that they might exploit the current IDF operation to regain control of the Gaza Strip .
The move came amid reports that the Fatah leadership in the West Bank has instructed its followers to be ready to assume power over the Gaza Strip when and if Israel 's military operation results in the removal of Hamas rule .
Fatah officials in Ramallah told The Jerusalem Post that Hamas militiamen had been assaulting many Fatah activists since the beginning of the operation last Saturday .
They said at least 75 activists were shot in the legs while others had their hands broken .
Wisam Abu Jalhoum , a Fatah activist from the Jabalya refugee camp , was shot in the legs by Hamas militiamen for allegedly expressing joy over the IDF air strikes on Hamas targets .
" Hamas is very nervous , because they feel that their end is nearing , " a senior Fatah official said .
" They have been waging a brutal campaign against Fatah members in the Gaza Strip .
" Meanwhile , sources close to Hamas revealed over the weekend that the movement had " executed " more than 35 Palestinians who were suspected of collaborating with Israel and were being held in various Hamas security installations .
The sources quoted Hamas officials as saying that the decision to kill the suspected collaborators was taken out of fear that Israel might try to rescue them during a ground offensive .
The officials claimed that at least half of the victims were killed by relatives of Palestinian militiamen who were killed as a result of information passed on to Israel by the " collaborators . " Justifying the latest crackdown on Fatah , a Hamas official in Gaza City said that his government had received information according to which Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had instructed his loyalists in the Strip to start moving toward undermining Hamas .
"
We will kill them all if they try to help Israel bring down our government , " the official said .
" We will hang Mahmoud Abbas and [ former Fatah security chief ]
Muhammad Dahlan in the public square if they try to enter the Gaza Strip aboard Israeli tanks .
" The Hamas official said that his security forces had launched a massive " preemptive " campaign aimed at thwarting Fatah 's attempts to " spread anarchy and chaos . "
He confirmed that many Fatah operatives had been shot in the legs over the past few days by Hamas " to make sure that they do n't help Israel .
"
Fahmi Za'arir , a Fatah spokesman in the West Bank , accused Hamas of " executing " a number of Fatah detainees .
He said the Fatah leadership knew of at least two Fatah men who were shot dead by Hamas after being released from prison .
He named them as Nasser Muhana and Saher al - Silawi .
Za'arir said that several Fatah members who attended funerals of victims of the IAF strikes were severely beaten by Hamas militiamen who accused them of collaboration with Israel .
It was " shameful " that Hamas was directing its weapons and energies against its own people instead of fighting against Israel , the spokesman said .
The decision to place Fatah operatives under house arrest was issued by the much - feared " Internal Security Apparatus , " which reports to the Hamas - controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza .
The order , which was delivered to the Fatah activists on Thursday , reads : " You are forbidden from leaving your home for 48 hours unless you want to attend Friday prayers .
Anyone who violates the order will be punished . "
Mozilla is struggling to get the third , and probably final , beta of Firefox 3.1 out the door , which means its first quarter release target is looking increasingly doubtful .
" At this time , we do n't have a good estimate for when we 'll be done , " said Mozilla .
“ Many of the bugs are proving to be tricky and complicated to fully resolve . "
The corporation up to now has said it would deliver Firefox 3.1 in Q1 , however , following a series of bugs in the browser including problems with its new JavaScript engine , Mozilla is suddenly being shy about release dates .
Earlier this month the open source outfit pushed back Firefox 3.1 ’s third beta release by a week to allow the firm to fix some bugs in the browser .
It set a new date of 2 February for when the browser would land to allow it time to fix some glitches in the surfing tool .
However , Mozilla has now backed away from announcing any definitive release dates , which is hardly surprising given that it keeps missing Firefox 3.1 internal deadlines for what appears to be an increasingly challenging browser release .
Developers are still trying to patch 18 show - stopping bugs in Firefox 3.1 , said Mozilla , 15 of which are located in its TraceMonkey JavaScript engine .
TraceMonkey is a key selling point component for the corporation because it renders twice as fast as previous JavaScript engines used in older versions of the Firefox browser .
But until those major glitches are nullified , Mozilla ca n’t confidently offer a release date for Firefox 3.1 .
That ’s a fact that could spell bad news for the corporation , especially given that Microsoft ’s upcoming release of Internet Explorer 8 is possiblymaybe imminent . ®

There are several different arguments offered for protectionism .
" Right - wing " protectionists like Pat Buchanan believes it is good for the economy and / or that it " strengthens the bonds of the nation " if people can only trade freely within the country .
Labor unions and business owners in sectors disproportionately competing with imports believes in it because they believe it will benefit them at the expense of the rest of society .
Unions also often oppose it because of the increase in company bargaining power if companies have the option of moving production offshore .
The perhaps most curious and absurd defense of protectionism comes from certain leftists , who argues that imports of goods produced by low income workers should n't be stopped because it supposedly hurts us , but because it hurts the workers producing the goods , who are being " exploited " because of global capitalism .
Some of those advancing that argument do n't actually believe in it , and simply uses it because it sounds nobler than wanting to shield American workers from competition .
Which is why they say they push for " fair labor and environmental standards " , which in practice means that those who do n't live up to those though standards should be prevented from exporting to America ( or whatever country it is that implements these standards )
But there are many leftists that actually believe in this .
Which is why this article by Nicholas Kristof is important .
It points out that while sweatshops may not appear good for us , they are in fact a lot better than the alternative for those that work there .
And it points out that if you want to improve conditions for workers in poor countries , you should buy more of their products , because that will increase demand for workers and so enable workers to demand better pay and / or working conditions .
The rapid wage increases in China in recent years are a good example of this mechanism in practice .
The International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW ) , just released a report showing that in recent decades , the noise created in the ocean by human activities has risen significantly , which poses a major threat to marine mammals.[ social_buttons ]
Commercial shipping noise , seismic exploration , sonar , and off - shore construction and recreational activities are all contributing to an increasingly more disorientating environment for mammals in the ocean .
Under - water sounds for communication , navigation and food locating are key for whales , dolphins , porpoises and other cetaceans .
Man -made noise pollution can cause behavioral changes such as abandoning breeding and feeding areas , and in some cases lead to mass stranding and even death .
“ Protecting marine species from ocean noise is critical to their survival .
Ocean noise can travel over vast distances and affect marine species across many national sea boundaries .
Therefore it is vital that countries work together to build strong agreements to prevent marine species being drowned out by disruptive , man -made noise . ” – Veronica Frank , IFAW Campaign Officer
IFAW ’s report highlights the fact that noise from ships in the Pacific Ocean has doubled every decade over the past 40 years , and the global shipping fleet is expected to double in size by 2025 .
The blue whale ’s communication distance has been cut by an unbelievable 90 per cent as a result of the increased ocean noise .
The report particularly condemns high intensity noise such as seismic surveys and military sonar .
These activities can emit sounds above 200 decibels which can injure marine animals .
Fatal strandings of whales and dolphins have also been linked to high intensity sonar .
Urgent discussions about ocean noise are expected at this week ’s 9th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species ( CMS ) in Rome .

Pat Buchanan was widely vilified by the neocons and the politically correct left when he famously described the Congress of the United States as “ Israeli - occupied territory . ”
Oh , what a conniption the liberals and the Commentary crowd had !
That was during the countdown to the first Gulf War , when almost no one rose to object  and those who did , like Pat , were smeared for their trouble .
Today , such an observation is hardly considered controversial : it is simply a known fact .
There is more discussion in the Knesset over the pros and cons of US intervention in the Middle East on Israel ’s behalf than there is in on Capitol Hill .
There ’s a sense in which this sort of uniformity must be a little embarrassing for the Lobby , in that it underscores their fear that a real debate will suddenly break out .
The regularity with which the American Congress endorses every fresh Israeli atrocity has a certain deadening metronomic quality about it  and , while we ’re on the subject of monotony , the American media , too , plays an identical role as advocate and staunch defender of the Israeli case , as a matter of course .
The “ mainstream ” televised and dead - tree - media has historically been a reliable “ reporter ” of the merits of the Israeli case .
Now , the wannabe “ alternative ” online media is following suit , with an alacrity that is none too surprising .
It is especially unsurprising in the case of the Huffington Post , which founder Arianna Huffington touts as a “ people ’s media ” in which “ truth ” is the highest value .
As she put it to the San Francisco Bay Guardian :
“ Our highest responsibility is to the truth .
The truth is not about splitting the difference between one side and the other .
Sometimes one side is speaking the truth …
The central mission of journalism is the search for the truth . ”
Taking Ms. Huffington at her word , one can only conclude that , when it comes to Israel ’s rape of Gaza , the Huffington Post is siding with the rapist .
Their “ news ” coverage of the ongoing devastation is heavily slanted toward the Israelis , with those journalistically unique paragraph - long lead - story headlines never mentioning Palestinian casualties ( a number would suffice ) .
When a genuinely antiwar voice is allowed on the site , it is prefaced by an apologia , as our own Jeremy Sapienza reports :
“ Huffington Post was so very kind this week to give space to almost frustratingly moderate Palestinian intellectual Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi .
In his well - reasoned article ,  Palestine ’s Guernica and the Myths of Israeli Victimhood , ’ he supplied all the basic facts behind the problems in Palestine .
But what gives with the long disclaimer marring the top of Barghouthi ’s article ?
“ HuffPo runs all kinds of commentary from all over the political spectrum ( or at least its leftish side ) , but only those who dare speak against the sainted Israelis seem to require an editorial explanation that resembles an apology .
“ Shame on Huffington Post for its disgusting lack of integrity . ”
Shame ?
Jeremy is a fine lad , and very smart , but perhaps a bit naïve in believing these people even accept the concept of shame , applied to themselves : indeed , they oppose it as a matter of high principle .
There ’s a ready explanation of why , as the Israelis pound Gaza , the formerly antiwar Huffington Post has become a cheerleader for the IDF : it is due entirely to this .
When Arianna nabbed $ 25 million from Oak Investment Partners , of Palo Alto , California , she was acquired by a financial network that also has significant investments in the Israeli arms industry  an industry , I might add , directly subsidized and controlled by the Israeli government .
For example , Oak Investment has invested in IET / Intelligent Electronics , now morphed into Clickservice Software , an Israeli - based company that makes sophisticated weapons systems and sells them to clients such as “ an unnamed Far Eastern country . ”
Oak Investment partner Fred Harman now sits on the Huffington Post ’s board .
Case closed .
Mystery solved .
Since Arianna is so into “ truth , ” how about a little when it comes to how she ’s financing a $ 25 million media gig that still refuses to pay bloggers !
Not only that , but they were recently forced to apologize to a Chicago media outlet for brazenly stealing content .
Whatever her contributions to the journalistic profession , let alone the pursuit of “ truth , ” Arianna is sure giving tackiness a bad name .
What ’s so galling is that the Huffington Post poses as an “ alternative ” media outlet , the virtual embodiment of the new online populism that gave rise to the blogosphere .
The nerve it takes to pose as an opponent of “ corporate greed , ” and war , while taking a $ 25 million “ investment ” from an exemplar of both is simply breathtaking  but about par for the course for Arianna .
In her odyssey from the Newt Gingrich right to the Obama - ite left , the founder of the Huffington Post personifies the utter vacuity of our age , the emptiness that has nothing at its core but an ideological vacuum waiting to be filled by the dictates of fashion and commerce .
From her days as the high priestess of the “ John Roger ” cult in California  a New Age outfit grouped around a charismatic and controversial leader “ John Roger ”  Ms. Huffington has always been an ideological weathervane , taking on the colors of whatever ideological craze is in season .
As a kind of Greek sibyl interpreting the divine zeitgeist , her style has lately become even more magisterial , now that she ’s getting closer to real power .
“ I only text three people , ” she boasted at a London dinner , “ my two teenage children and Barack Obama . ”
God help us if that woman has the President ’s ear , if only because we ’ll have to endure four long years of relentless name - dropping .
More seriously , though , the Huffington Post ’s disgraceful performance on the Gaza issue is really just a reflection of the laughable uniformity of Western coverage of Middle Eastern issues , and this is especially true when it comes to Israel and its interests in the region .
It ’s a widely - noted irony that the nature and extent of the “ special relationship ” is never discussed as openly in the US as it is in the Israeli media .
How and why this came about is well - documented by professors John Mearshemier and Stephen Walt , in their book , The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy [ short version here ] , but a new riff on their theme is the extent to which the online media have been co-opted by the Lobby  in this case , bought outright .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ‘ve gotten a couple of letters noting that , this very morning , the editors of Antiwar.com have chosen to link to an informative piece by Yale University professor David Bromwich on the Huffington Post that contradicts the above .
Yet that does little to undermine my main point , which is that Ms. Huffington ’s alleged devotion to truth   as expressed in her declaration  the truth is not about splitting the difference between one side and the other because sometimes one side is speaking the truth  is deemed as somehow not applicable to the Gaza massacre .
In any case , please do n’t anyone try to tell me that the presence of a major investor in the rather extensive ( and profitable ) Israeli military - industrial complex does n’t have a major effect on the Huffington Post ’s editorial decisions .
Of course it does , and the Bromwich piece does n’t change this  it is merely splitting the difference between one side and the other ,  as Arianna put it to the Bay Guardian  the difference between truth and lies .
Another point : by running the Bromwich piece  which did n’t have the embarrassing and unnecessary editorial note attached to the Mustafa Barghouthi blog  we at Antiwar.com are hoping to encourage whatever advocates of editorial sanity remain on the Huffington Post staff .

Sorry Liz , but THIS is the real face of Cleopatra
From Elizabeth Taylor to Sophia Loren , there have been many faces of Cleopatra .
But this might be the most realistic of them all .
Egyptologist Sally Ann Ashton believes the compute regenerated 3D image is the best likeness of the legendary beauty famed for her ability to beguile .
Likeness :
The computer - generated 3D image has been pieced together from images on ancient artefacts
Pieced together from images on ancient artefacts , including a ring dating from Cleopatra 's reign 2,000 years ago , it is the culmination of more than a year of painstaking research .
The result is a beautiful young woman of mixed ethnicity - very different to the porcelain - skinned Westernised version portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1961 movie Cleopatra .
Realism :
The result is a strikingly beautiful young woman of mixed ethnicity
Dr Ashton , of Cambridge University , said the images , to be broadcast as part of a Five documentary on Cleopatra , reflect the monarch 's Greek heritage as well as her Egyptian upbringing .
' She probably was n't just completely European .
You 've got to remember that her family had actually lived in Egypt for 300 years by the time she came to power . '
Detail : Image of Cleopatra on the temple walls of Dendera
The picture of the queen contrasts with several other less flattering portrayals .
For instance , a silver coin which went on show at Newcastle University 's Sefton Museum last year showed her as having a shallow forehead , pointed chin , thin lips and hooked nose .
Her lover , the Roman general Mark Antony , fared little better .
The reverse side shows him to have bulging eyes and a thick neck .
The queen 's appearance has long been the subject of debate among academics .
While Shakespeare 's Antony and Cleopatra made reference to her youthful looks and ' infinite - variety ' , many believe she was short and frumpy with bad teeth .
Iconic : Liz Taylor in the 1961 film Cleopatra
A statue of Cleopatra exhibited at the British Museum in 2001 portrayed her as plain , no more than 5ft tall and rather plump .
Born in Alexandra in 69BC , into a Macedonian Greek dynasty which had ruled Egypt for three centuries , Cleopatra acceded to the throne at 17 .
Three years later she seduced Julius Caesar , bearing him a son , Caesarion .
After Caesar was assassinated she courted Mark Antony before committing suicide on his death .
Legend has it that she put an asp , a venomous serpent , to her breast .

What is a Hedge Fund – A Definition
A hedge fund is a largely unregulated private investment fund that uses any available investing strategies to increase returns .
It is common for the fund managers to have leveraged long and short positions in both domestic and foreign markets .
The theory is that the freedom allows hedge funds to have a positive return when the market is up , down or even sideways .
History
The name for hedge funds came about when Alfred W. Jones realized that asset prices are tied to the performance of the overall market .
With this discovery , he attempted to short assets that he expected to fall while buying assets he expected to rise .
This negated the effect of the overall market performance and since this effected hedged his risks , it became known as a hedge fund .
In the modern age however , hedge fund managers ’ primary goal is to maximize returns .
Therefore it is often argued that hedge funds actually carry more risk than other types of funds even though the name has stayed with the industry .
Regulations and Requirements
Hedge funds have much fewer restrictions than mutual funds .
For example , hedge funds do not need to disclose all its investments to investors while mutual funds do .
However , there is one requirement that investors of hedge fund must meet that mutual fund investors do not – that investors need to be considered “ accredited investor ” .
The definition of varies depending on who you ask , but the federal securities law define an accredited investor as an individual with a net worth of at least $ 1 million as well as having $ 200,000 in income for the past two years with the reasonable expectation of the same ( or higher ) income in the current year .
Bluntly speaking , hedge funds are only traditionally available to the rich and the super rich .
Fees
Hedge funds usually charge very high fees .
A common fee jargon is “ 2 and 20 ” , which means that the hedge fund will charge a 2 % management fee ( based on the assets you have invested with them ) and a 20 % performance fee ( based on the returns the fund generates ) .
Even though you might think that this is high , other funds are known to charge as high as a 5 % management fee and 50 % performance fee !
While the fees are extremely high , the lure for investors to these funds are the higher returns that the fund can produce .
The thinking goes something like this .
If someone can make me $ 100 , giving away $ 50 ( leaving me with $ 50 ) is better than someone making me only $ 20 .
Some funds also charge a withdrawal ( or sometimes called redemption ) fee if you take money out of the fund .
The common argument is that it keeps the funds more stable and allow the fund managers to deploy long term strategies .
There are times when hedge funds will even disallow withdrawals ( usually at times when the fund ’s performance is extremely badly ) .
This keeps the funds from needing to liquidate investments when asset prices are usually very low , which further hurts returns .
In reality , the reason to stop withdrawals are that too many redemption in times of fear might wipe out the fund completely .
What Does All This Mean for Us
Only a handful will meet the requirements of investing in a hedge fund , so many can become jealous when good hedge fund performance hit the news .
However , considering that most hedge funds actually under perform the market , many people who qualify actually will be better just buying into an index fund anyway .
In addition , the high fees coupled with the lack of transparency of these funds make it almost impossible to determine which funds have the strategies to beat the market on a consistent basis .
Therefore , I ’m not alone in thinking that there is no need to envy the people who can invest in hedge funds .

* Q4 GDP data shows U.S. economy shrank less than expected
* Indian gold , euro - priced gold hit records
* Silver hits highest level since Oct 1
( Releads , updates prices , adds comment )
By Jan Harvey
LONDON , Jan 30 ( Reuters ) - Gold slipped from a three - month high on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy had contracted by less than expected in the fourth quarter , taking some of the heat out of safe - haven buying .
Spot gold XAU= climbed 2 percent to $ 926.90 an ounce , its highest since Oct 10 .
It was quoted at $ 918.90/920.90 an ounce at 1406 GMT , up from $ 906.75 in New York late on Thursday .
In the immediate wake of the data it slipped to $ 916.60 .
Gold priced in euros XAUEUR=R hit a record high of 720.53 euros .
“ On first glance the ( GDP ) figures are generally good , so they should be negative for gold , ” Calyon analyst Robin Bhar said .
“ Growth is better than expected , but deflation is also stronger , so it is a bit of a double whammy for gold . ”
The U.S. Commerce Department said fourth - quarter gross domestic product fell at a 3.8 percent annual rate , the lowest pace since the first quarter of 1982 .
[ ID :nN29308953 ]
Analysts had forecast GDP contracting 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter .
Gold is still being supported , however , by interest in the precious metal as a haven from risk .
U.S. gold futures for February delivery GCG9 on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange were up $ 15.80 at $ 920.80 an ounce .
Market talk of China taking an interest in gold as an alternative to U.S. Treasuries , and of a European fund buying bullion , also helped support prices .
Gold has risen around 3 percent this week as investors have scrambled for the safety of gold and bullion - backed assets such as exchange - traded funds .
“ The ETFs were up another 15 tonnes yesterday , ” Simon Weeks , director of precious metals at the Bank of Nova Scotia , said , adding safe haven demand was driving the market .
The world 's biggest gold - backed ETF , New York 's SPDR Gold Trust GLD , said its holdings jumped more than 10 tonnes on Thursday to a record 843.59 tonnes .
[ ID : nSP420252 ]
SPDR ’s holdings have risen more than 63 tonnes or 8 percent since Dec 31 .
European equity markets and U.S. stock index futures turned higher after the U.S. GDP data , showing a better appetite for assets such as stocks and shares .
[ ID :nN30347614 ]
The dollar also pared gains against the euro .
A new wave of risk aversion hit the currency markets earlier on Friday , with the yen and dollar edging higher as investors worried about risk .
[ ID :nN30354292 ]
Although gold usually moves in the opposite direction to the dollar , the negative correlation between the two has broken down in recent weeks as both assets gained on risk aversion .
INDIAN GOLD HITS RECORD
Jewellery demand remains hamstrung by high prices .
In India , the world ’s biggest bullion market , gold futures touched an all - time high of 14,448 rupees per 10 grams , deterring buyers .
[ ID : nBOM427993 ]
Scrap sales are booming , however , as consumers cash in on the price rise .
Russia ’s gold output rose by 13.3 percent to 184.49 tonnes last year , chiefly on the back of improving mine output , the Russian Gold Industrialists Union said .
[ ID : nLU746707 ]
Silver prices tracked gold , rising to a peak of $ 12.57 an ounce , their highest since Oct 1 .
It was later quoted at $ 12.44/12.50 an ounce against $ 12.31 .
Silver ETFs have also risen sharply this year , with the largest , the iShares Silver Trust SLV.A , up 660 tonnes or 10 percent in the year to date .
Among other precious metals , platinum and palladium were little changed .
Platinum XPT= was at $ 980/985 an ounce against $ 972.50 , while palladium XPD= was at $ 193/198 an ounce , against $ 191.50 .
The world 's biggest palladium producer , Russia 's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM , said its palladium output was 2.821 million ounces in 2008 .
It previously reported 2007 output at 3.113 million ounces .

Australia construction unions
protest antistrike law
( front page )
The ABCC was put in place by the Liberal Party government of John Howard in 2005 to enforce the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act .
With the aim of driving the unions out of the construction industry , the act made it illegal for workers to strike or take other industrial action without the agreement of their employer .
Even if a worker is killed on site , his workmates must be able to prove they had a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to themselves to legally stop work and assess the safety situation .
The legislation allows the government to deny legal representation to workers and union representatives , and to fine or jail them , as well as authority to secretly record union meetings .
On the eve of the nationwide rallies the commonwealth director of public prosecutions dropped charges against Noel Washington , an official of the Construction , Forestry , Mining and Energy Union ( CFMEU ) .
He had faced six months in jail for refusing to give evidence to the ABCC about what he saw and heard at a meeting of workers in 2007 .
In Brisbane the December 2 action against the ABCC took place the day after 25 - year - old construction worker Tom Takurau died .
A 20 - ton beam fell from an overpass and crushed him while he was working on the Eastern Busway site .
The beam was not bolted into place .
 The bottom line is the ABCC prevents unions from protecting the rights of workers , and safety is one of those rights ,  CFMEU workplace health and safety coordinator Andrew Ramsay told the Courier - Mail .
 Today is not just about Noel Washington , today is the first steps of a campaign to eradicate the ABCC ,  Australian Manufacturing Workers Union state secretary Steve McCartney told the rally in Perth .
 We want to let the ALP [ Australian Labor Party ] know we are not happy and we wont be happy until the ABCC is wiped off the face of the earth . 

Overview Tetration by Escape Tetration by Period
My name is Daniel Geisler , welcome to my web site dedicated to promoting research into the question of what lies beyond exponentiation .
Tetration is defined as iterated exponentiation but while exponentiation is essential to a large body of mathematics , little is known about tetration due to its chaotic properties .
The standard notation for tetration is \( ^ { 1 }a=a , ^{2 }a=a^a , ^{3}a=a^{a^a} , \) and so on .
Mathematicians have been researching tetration since at least the time of Euler but it is only at the end of the twentieth century that the combination of advances in dynamical systems and access to powerful computers is making real progress possible .
The big question in tetration research is how can tetration be extended to complex numbers .
How do you compute numbers like \ ( ^{.5}2\ ) , and \ ( ^{\pi i}e\ ) ?
This web site will show how to compute these and other problems .
See the Tetration page for a one page overview of extending tetration to the complex numbers .
I.N. Galidakis https://ingalidakis.com/ has a new website with significant work on tetration not available elsewhere !

I recently took the time to build a web application on Google App Engine and wanted to share my thoughts on the experience and the pros and cons of Google App Engine as a web development platform .
The app I developed is TuneChimp , a music mashup that was recently named ProgrammableWeb 's Mashup of the Day and a finalist in Mashable 's Y! BOSS Challenge .
TuneChimp makes it easy for you to discover the very best music , videos , photos , and more for an artist by mashing up content from imeem , YouTube , Flickr , Yahoo , Last .
FM , Google News , and more .
TuneChimp takes advantage of the dozens of music - related APIs that are now available on the web to auto - generate an artist profile to quickly discover new artists or play music from your favorites .
The most useful feature is that it takes the top tracks from an artist based on robust Last .
FM audio - scrobbling data and creates a playable playlist using imeem 's on - demand music streaming platform .
The core of the application calls 11 different APIs , appropriately caches the datasets , and cross -links the various dataset to put together a meaningful artist profile .
The APIs are all accessible through REST endpoints in either JSON or XML formats .
The single greatest advantage of Google App Engine is speed to market of an application .
TuneChimp was designed as a small weekend project to let me perform competitive analysis on the most popular music - related APIs ( I manage the imeem Media Platform and wanted to see how we fared against other offerings ) .
The beauty of GAE was that the same day I started coding I had a basic site up that pulled data from several APIs .
Since GAE only supports a narrow web app scenario , it makes it extremely simple to setup , develop , and deploy an app .
No need to install an OS , configure apache , nor optimize mysql .
While some complain the datastore APIs are limiting because you can't perform classic relational join operations , anyone who has been involved in a large web app built on an open source stack knows that those operations do n't scale anyway .
GAE forces you to design for scale from the beginning , but its an easy mental model to learn and super - fast to get up and running .
The dbmodel objects are similar to any web framework , like RoR and others , so its also very easy to pick up .
And the immediate scalability benefit makes it so you do n't have to worry how you are going to handle extra load .
Currently GAE is limited to Python and that has put off a lot of people from trying it .
I decided to bite the bullet and learn Python and I have been so happy that I have .
I see Python as a great compromise between PHP and Ruby on Rails in that python is more explicit like PHP but cleaner in code and still has many of the productivity benefits of RoR with the GAE framework ( or Django framework if you choose ) .
Unfortunately I encountered some serious bugs in GAE during my development .
One bug prevented any web request in production from returning multiple cookies .
Unfortunately many APIs use cookies for authentication and it was impossible to read from certain APIs without implementing hacks .
I filed the bug , complained to my contacts at Google , and it still took months for this issue to be addressed .
GAE is still clearly a work in progress and the bleeding edge developers who are willing to engage with it now will have to continuously invent hacks to get around these kinds of bugs for some time to come .
In addition the restrictive exceeding high CPU quotas and inflexibly short time - outs make it VERY difficult to reliably build on top of third party APIs with varying response times .
I ended up having to build in retry logic and significant caching to try to work around these time - outs .
At the same time , without the ability to run long run processes and cron jobs , a developer is forced to continue to host a server outside of the GAE environment to perform batch processing and more .
Probably the greatest detractor from Google App Engine though is the propriety stack that it is built on and the resulting lock - in .
This creates significant technology risk for a startup to build on top of GAE since its going to be extremely costly to move to a different infrastructure if necessary .
Hopefully some of the projects third parties are working on to port the GAE web framework and datastore will mitigate some of the issues associated with this lock - in .
While Google App Engine has become my web development platform of choice for all my weekend projects , I would not yet take the risk of running a production web business on top of GAE .
The platform though is very promising and I hope to see my concerns addressed over time as well as large web app success stories built on top of this cloud platform .
Mystery as century - old Swiss watch discovered in ancient tomb sealed for 400 years
Archaeologists are stumped after finding a 100 - year - old Swiss watch in an ancient tomb that was sealed more than 400 years ago .
They believed they were the first to visit the Ming dynasty grave in Shangsi , southern China , since its occupant 's funeral .
But inside they uncovered a miniature watch in the shape of a ring marked ' Swiss ' that is thought to be just a century old .
Mystery : Archeologists have uncovered a 100 - year - old watch in a tomb believed to have been undisturbed for 400 years
The mysterious timepiece was encrusted in mud and rock and had stopped at 10:06 am .
Watches were not around at the time of the Ming Dynasty and Switzerland did not even exist as a country , an expert pointed out .
The archaeologists were filming a documentary with two journalists when they made the puzzling discovery .
' When we tried to remove the soil wrapped around the coffin , suddenly a piece of rock dropped off and hit the ground with metallic sound , ' said Jiang Yanyu , former curator of the Guangxi Museum .
' We picked up the object , and found it was a ring .
' After removing the covering soil and examining it further , we were shocked to see it was a watch , ' he added .
The Ming Dynasty - or the Empire of the Great Ming - was the was ruling dynasty in China from 1368 to 1644 .

MY BLOGOSPHERE WHINES FOR 2009 ….
Today is New Year ’s Eve , so here are my top ten whiny , blog - related pet peeves .
They are in no particular order :
Blogs without comment sections .
Or , blogs with comment sections that require you to go through some kind of painful registration process just to leave a one - sentence note .
Bloggers who do n’t put their email addresses somewhere on the blog .
I do n’t mind looking around for it a bit ( keeps the mind sharp , you know ) , but put it somewhere , OK ?
Blogs that provide only partial RSS feeds .
See also point # 5 , which actually bugs me a lot more .
Bloggers who are too damn lazy to check their links after they post something .
Come on , people .
“ Teaser ” blogs that put only the first paragraph or two on the main page and force you to click “ continue ” if you want to read the whole thing .
This is both annoying and pointless .
It only takes a second or two to scroll past a blog post you do n’t want to read , after all .
( Yes , I ’m talking about you , Felix Salmon . )
People who say “ blog ” when they really mean “ blog post . ”
Blogs with lousy ( or nonexistent ) search capability .
Mine , for example .
Top ten lists that are plainly larded with filler because the listmaker could n’t actually think of ten things to write about .
Bloggers who ca n’t count .
I fully expect these problems to be completely resolved starting tomorrow — or , at the very least , on January 20th .
If they are n’t , a blue ribbon commission will be appointed to deal with them .
You have been warned .
Boeing has reported a loss of $ US56 million ( $ 84.3 million ) in the fourth quarter as the aerospace giant announced it would slash its workforce by 10,000 this year .
The loss was largely the result of a machinists ' strike and costs to redesign its 747 freighter aircraft , but Boeing said it must tighten its belt in the face of a difficult global economy .
" The global economy continues to weaken , and it 's affecting air traffic and financing , " CEO Jim McNerney said after the aerospace giant released its quarterly results .
" We must prepare the company , including being more aggressive in terms of productivity . "
He said the 10,000 cuts would be made " through attrition , retirement and layoffs , " and included a figure announced earlier of 4,500 in the commercial aircraft division .
The loss marked a sharp turnaround from a profit of $ US1.03 billion in the same period a year earlier .
Revenues in the quarter fell 27 per cent to $ US12.7 billion .
The operating loss amounted to $ US205 million .
For the full year of 2008 , profits fell 34 per cent to $ US2.7 billion and revenue fell 8 per cent to $ US60.9 billion .
Boeing said its results were hit by the strike , the 747 charge , litigation costs and other charges .
" The progress we made in many areas of Boeing during 2008 was outweighed by the impact of the strike and our performance on some key development programs , " said Mr McNerney in a statement .
" Our imperative going forward is improving execution where it needs to be improved , maintaining strong performance across all our production programs , and preserving our financial strength to grow in these challenging economic times . "
Boeing 's 27,000 machinists , representing 16 per cent of the company 's work force , walked off the job on September 6 in a dispute over new contracts , causing delays in production and deliveries .
The 58 - day strike ended November 2 but cost the firm billions of dollars .
Boeing said the strike lopped off an estimated profit of $ US760 million in the quarter , or $ US1.09 per share , and revenues fell by $ US4.8 billion as the strike pushed airplane deliveries out of the quarter .
In 2008 , Boeing fell behind its longtime European rival Airbus in orders and deliveries .
Airbus took 777 orders and made 483 deliveries while Boeing reported 662 orders and 375 deliveries .
But both firms see troubles ahead amid a deepening global economic slump .

Sunday 04 January 2009 A defense of pornography Share This :
By Martin Green
The debate over pornography is too often dominated by conservatives and liberals ; the former castigate pornography as disgusting and corrupting , the latter defend its publication with ' free speech ' arguments , but are rarely prepared to defend pornography as worthwhile and socially positive .
Far too often voices â€ “ and there are a growing number â€ “ that argue pornography / erotica is a good thing that should be defended and celebrated are not heard .
There is a major paradox here .
Never has the public acceptance of and engagement with erotica been so widespread .
The consumption of pornography in all its forms is massive ; it is a huge industry that could not exist in its present form without millions of people worldwide being avid consumers .
But among official opinion formers , especially politicians , its stock has never been so low .
Many mainstream media commentators treat producers of erotica as they would drug dealers or gangsters .
Pornography is an anathema in polite society , while hundreds of millions use it in private .
This is ' cognitive dissonance ' on a huge scale â€ “ saying one thing and doing another .
Part of the reason the anti-porn charge is so powerful is the de-facto alliance between anti-porn feminism and the religious fundamentalist right .
Any rational discussion of sex is very difficult in the USA and Britain , but especially difficult when taking a pro-porn position is likely to find its advocate decried as a priori perverted or â€ “ even worse â€ “ misogynistic .
Pornography and its advocates face among the most violent and pervasive of taboos .
Millions of pornography fans have their use of it as among their most personal secrets .
Fortunately the most articulate defence of pornography today often comes from women â€ “ in the first place Wendy McElroy , but also Nina Hartley , Susie Bright and Violet Blue .
The liberal position on the ' right of free speech ' is something that the pornography industry will shield behind , but in the end a weak line of defence .
If something is fundamentally anti-social and damaging , then free of speech arguments are n't very strong and will often falter .
Only by sex-positive , pro-pornography views being openly expressed and fought for will the argument , eventually , be won .
The core of the argument â€ “ what is sex for ?

As many as a million American jobs could be lost every month by next spring as businesses struggle to raise capital in financial markets consumed by fear , according to a new analysis .
November was the worst month in the US labour market since the oil crisis of 1974 , as more than 500,000 US workers were laid off , according to official figures released on Friday .
But Graham Turner , of consultancy GFC Economics , says the rising cost of corporate debt is now flashing a red warning signal that far worse is to come over the next few months and job losses are heading for levels last seen in the 1930s Great Depression .
Corporate bond yields have rocketed since the credit crisis began as investors flee risky assets in search of safe havens such as US Treasuries .
That effectively means many firms are being forced to pay eye - watering interest rates to borrow funds .
Turner says when the gap between the yield on high - risk company bonds and US Treasuries widens sharply , unemployment tends to shoot up - and current credit conditions are pointing to a doubling in the pace of layoffs , to more than a million workers a month , by spring .
' The correlation is holding up all too well , ' he said .
' It 's very disconcerting . '
He added that the pace of layoffs already happening in the US ' is indicative of panic ' .
During the 1970s oil crisis the panic was relatively short - lived , he says .
' But the worry now is that this will just roll on and on . '
On Friday alone , embattled car firm General Motors , fund manager Legg Mason , and motor parts supplier Gentex announced plans to shed staff .
November 's jobs figures were so much worse than analysts had expected that the Dow Jones share index actually rallied by 259 points , more than 3 per cent , as investors bet that Washington would have to launch a major new rescue package for the economy even before President - elect Barack Obama takes over the White House in January .
The scale of the layoffs in the US , which pushed unemployment to 6.7 per cent , could also point towards a further deterioration in conditions in the UK : David Blanchflower , an independent member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee and labour market specialist , warned recently : ' What happens in the US tends to be repeated six to nine months later in Britain ' .
David Frost , director - general of the British Chambers of Commerce , believes Britain 's companies are gearing up for large - scale layoffs .
' There will be a huge raft of redundancies .
I am sensing that talking to firms .
The worry is that next year the job losses will be just horrendous .
All sectors are taking the hit .
In the middle of the year it was construction and estate agencies .
Now it is services , the automotive industry , retailers .
Firms are waiting for Christmas and if they can't see any improvement they will cut their payrolls . '
Woolworths administrators made 450 of its office staff redundant on Friday , but the future of the 25,000 staff who work in its stores remains uncertain .
Fafblog Interviews : JOHN MCCAIN FAFBLOG :
First of all I want to say thank you , John McCain , for choosing to give your last major interview before the election right here on our little blog !
JOHN MCCAIN : Thank you , my friends .
The honor is all mine .
FB : Now let 's get right down to it .
Why should you be president ?
MCCAIN : One word , my friends : leadership .
As a Navy pilot I was shot down over Vietnam , as a member of the United States Senate I was beaten by my captors for five and a half years , and as your president I will continue to courageously endure those beatings for America .
FB : Well you make a pretty convincing case , John McCain , but why should n't I vote for a president who has even more experience being tortured , like Congressman Sheikh Mohammed or Senator Jesus or that guy who gets his head exploded at the beginning of Scanners ?
MCCAIN : Because I know the problems Americans are going through right now .
The American people are angry , my friends .
They 're hurt .
They 've been beaten by their captors for five and a half years .
And they need a leader who 's willing to stop federal tax dollars from going to research harbor seal DNA .
FB : We might lose our jobs and we might lose our homes and we might have to sell our youngest , weakest children to black market organ scavengers for a cardboard box and a can of refried beans , but we 'll always be safe in the knowledge that our taxes are n't going to further our understanding of marine biology .
MCCAIN : Oh , and that 's just the tip of the iceberg , my friends .
Do you realize that federal earmarks last year directed literally thousands of your tax dollars to children 's hospitals ?
Think about that now !
Hospitals !
For children !
FB : Now look John McCain , everybody wants to shut down children 's hospitals , but how 're you really gonna do it what with all the Washington gridlock and the Beltway infighting and the fatcat lobbyists from Big Children ?
I mean Ronald Reagan promised us he 'd destroy the government and twenty years later we 're still stuck with a functioning public sewage system .
MCCAIN : Look , my friends , I can do this .
I know how to balance budgets .
I know how to win wars .
I 've been pretending to do it for thirty - five years .
And I know how to work across party lines to get things done .
Has Barack Obama ever had a sweaty late - night three - way with Joe Lieberman and Trent Lott on the floor of the Senate cloakroom ?
Or was he too busy raising taxes for his friends in the radical African terrorist community to reach across the aisle ?
FB : That 's just the kind of mavericky bipartisan maverickness you used to pass sweeping reforms like the Candyland Preservation Act and McCain - Snuffleupagus !
So how much will I personally save once you 've gotten rid of all these earmarks ?
MCCAIN : Literally thousands of thousandths of some fraction of a penny .
But look , my friends : it 's not about the money .
It 's about the principle .
And the principle is that it 's wrong , just wrong , to take money from the American taxpayer and spend it on something , unless that something is a series of massive , ever - expanding foreign wars .
FB : That 's so true .
It just burns me up inside when I think about how every dollar we 're just throwing away on medicine for poor people could be spent on something truly valuable , like a hundred year war in Iraq .
MCCAIN : Now , now I want to be clear on something .
I hate war , my friends .
I hate war almost as much as I hate vigorously masturbating to it .
But this war in Iraq is a necessary war .
An honorable war .
A war that 's been beaten by its captors for five and a half years .
And without it Saddam Hussein would be free even now to fly pretend airplanes into our fictional buildings with weapons of mass imagination .
FB : None of us will ever forget that day - that terrible , hypothetical day .
MCCAIN : And right now in Iraq we have a , a wonderful general there , General Petraeus .
He 's very courageous .
He is very broad - shouldered .
He was beaten by his captors for five and a half years .
And when you get close to him , very close , there is the distinct aroma of fresh - baked pie .
And , and the first thing we have to do is let General Petraeus finish the job of securing Iraq for the Iraqi people , a proud and united people , so that it does n't fall into the hands of their enemies , the Iraqi people .
FB : Well that sounds good , John McCain , but how do we really get the Iraqis to stand up for themselves against the Iraqis ?
MCCAIN : Oh , we already have , by arming the Iraqis to fight back against the Iraqis and make sure they can live in peace without fear of Iraqis .
But if we do n't stay and finish the job Iraq will fall to Iraqi influence , and we cannot allow that , my friends .
FB : See I used to be all confused about all this , but it just makes so much sense when I hear it from you !
Now between half a million and a million Iraqis have been killed since the start of the war , in a country of twenty - nine million Iraqis .
Do you feel kinda glass - half - full about it , like " hey look at all the Iraqis we got left ! "
Or is it kinda glass - half - empty , like " oh man , look at all the Iraqis we got left ! "
MCCAIN : Oh , no , no .
With time I believe we can eliminate the threat of Iraq within Iraq .
The first thing we have to do in order to win is to win , which I believe we can accomplish through means of winning .
And the second thing we have to do is cut taxes and pork - barrel spending .
Let 's not tax these dead Iraqis , my friends .
Let 's kill them again so they do n't have to pay three million dollars for a planetarium in Chicago .
FB : Well I 'm almost sold , John McCain , but Barack Obama says he 's gonna make war cool again in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Why should n't I vote for him ?
MCCAIN : Because I know war , my friends .
I 've lived with war .
Slept with war .
Fondled war .
Has Barack Obama ever made sweet love to the outer casing of an intercontinental ballistic missile ?
Or was he too busy teaching kindergartners how to have sex with federal earmarks to show his support for our troops ?
FB : Now there 's some crazy people who say we should negotiate with other countries like Iran and Venezuela before we bomb them .
Are these crazy people crazy ?
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
We cannot dignify these countries by meeting with them , because if we meet with them we give the world the impression that we are willing to meet with them , and that just makes our country look like the kind of country that meets with other countries .
And where does that lead , my friends ?
FB : Disaster , that 's where !
What if you 're meetin with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , an you go to shake Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's hand , an then he moves his hand up and goes " Up high ! " and so you go to give him a high five but then he kinda swooshes his hand down an goes " Down low ! " an so you go to catch his hand there but he moves his hand outta the way an goes " Too slow ! " an then all the guys on the Security Council think he 's cooler 'n you !
Man , you 'd feel pretty stupid then .
MCCAIN : That 's why talking to people is only justified as the option of last resort , after all killing - based alternatives have been exhausted .
FB : Okay John McCain , now it 's time to play Bomb or Tax Cut !
Get your buzzer ready !
MCCAIN : Okay , heh heh , here we go !
FB : Iran !
MCCAIN : Bomb .
FB : Russia !
MCCAIN : Bomb .
FB : Global warming !
MCCAIN : Bomb .
FB : Guantanamo Bay !
MCCAIN : Tax cut .
FB : Health care !
MCCAIN : Bomb .
No , no , tax cut , tax cut !
FB : Nuclear proliferation !
MCCAIN : Bomb and tax cut !
FB : The increasing irrelevance of the human soul in the face of global capitalism !
MCCAIN : Tax cuts for bombs !
FB : Now , we 've got time for one last question .
Any thoughts about Tuesday night ?
MCCAIN : Bomb , bomb , bomb !
FB : No no , that parts over now !
Different question !
MCCAIN : Oh , heh heh , I 'm not too worried about election night .
The polls are , are , they 're tightening .
FB : I believe some of them certainly could be generously interpreted to that effect , yes !
MCCAIN : And in fact , heh , we 're , we 're going to win .
FB : Oh , ha ha , I 'm sure you will !
Keep thinking positive , John McCain !
MCCAIN : It will be a victorious landslide .
FB : Now that might be just a tad overconfident -
MCCAIN : We will fight this .
Fight this to the gates of hell .
FB : Now rural Pennsylvania is n't the most exciting place in the world , but I do n't know if I 'd call it -
MCCAIN : And I will rescue America and , and take her for my demon bride .
FB : We really gotta go , John McCain .
MCCAIN : We shall reign for ten thousand years .

Labels : fuck you ' 08 , interviews , the end of the world party posted by fafnir at 10:37 AM
Whither the Riot ?
I have been struck by the absence of collective protest over the actions of those in the financial industry .
Free market advocates have been rendered impotent ; why are n’t they up in arms that their belief system has been forever invalidated ?
Leftists watch as our elected leaders hand over the oversight function to the very companies that caused this mess ; why are n’t they taking to the streets ?
Talk shows and blog postings reveal plenty of individual anger , but there has n’t been much collective expression .
Why is this ?
And what forms of protest and outcry would be legitimate ?
At the risk of being accused of inciting mass violence , I ’d like to know whether people would be justified in using the riot at this particular moment in history .
More broadly , under what conditions is the riot a rational ( and / or justifiable ) response to injustice ?
Sociologists love the riot , of course , because it offers an opportunity to test theories regarding mass behavior and individual tolerance for oppressive conditions .
Having observed a few riots , I know that they can also be caused by trivial factors :
For example , I watched looters take over streets on the South Side of Chicago after the Bulls won their second consecutive basketball championship — hardly an “ oppressive ” situation .
But in general , riots are responses to fairly serious issues , like the rising price of commodities , police brutality , assassination of political leaders .
So the federal government is now sending $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to free market scions who , I remind you , spend millions on collective protest ( “ lobbying ” ) against any form of government aid — especially to the middle class , to the poor , and to foreigners .
Scandalous !
Taxpayers of the world unite , I say !
Here is my theory as to why the riot has gone the way of the Sony Walkman — an appendage of an earlier era :
1 ) The iPod :
In public spaces , serendipitous interaction is needed to create the “ mob mentality , ” which by its nature is not rational or formed through petitions .
Most iPod - like devices separate citizens from one another ; you ca n’t join someone in a movement if you ca n’t hear the voices of its participants .
Congrats Mr. Jobs for impeding social change .
2 ) Prescription drugs :
What is the social function of anxiety reduction if not to increase the capacity of individuals to tolerate their social predicaments ?
Q.E.D .
3 ) Debt :
This is a tricky one .
In the short term , debt straps individuals into society and makes them fearful of acting out : failing to pay could land them in jail , in bankruptcy , etc .
But in the long term , they may feel life has become intolerable and there is little to lose — so , why not tear down the walls ?
( This kind of thinking , by the way , is partly at the root of our current mess .
Those who bought second homes walked away from their investments , accepting bankruptcy , when they realized they were never going to make payments in the long term . )
4 ) “ Hey , things could be worse . ” :
Riots require collective recognition that a threshold ( of oppressive rule , inequity , etc. ) has been surpassed and there ’s little hope for improvement .
In matters of social oppression , apart from a political assassination , it is rare that mass audiences will agree that such conditions hold .
Things have to be downright awful , and we have n’t reached that stage yet .
Yet .
5 ) No enemy in sight :
Rioters usually attack symbols of oppression .
For example , in a riot in Chicago in 1992 , protesters tore down streetlights , broke lamps , burned school buildings , and otherwise attacked government property .
In Los Angeles , in the aftermath of the so - called “ Rodney King affair , ” non - black stores were attacked .
What might be the target of mobs violently responding to the financial mess ?
Maybe Midtown Manhattan ?
How about the Milton Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago ?
A general rule is that contemporary rioters do not travel , so they would need to find symbols within their own communities : currency exchanges , banks , the offices of Congressional officials who voted “ yes ” on the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , etc .
It goes without saying that I miss a good old - fashioned riot .
But my malaise hardly compares to others who are suffering in these times .
For example , I often pity the poor souls who took out property insurance with A.I.G. and other insurers .
In the event of a riot , they might be next in line for a government bailout .
Will there be anything left in the $ 700 billion for them ?
Wilkins Coffee Commercials
In 1957 , Jim Henson was approached by a Washington , D.C. coffee company to produce commercials for Wilkins Coffee .
The local stations only had ten seconds for station identification , so the Muppet commercials had to be lightning - fast — essentially , eight seconds for the commercial pitch and a two - second shot of the product .
Contents show ]
From 1957 to 1961 , Henson made 179 commercials for Wilkins Coffee and other Wilkins products , including Community Coffee and Wilkins Tea .
The ads were initially filmed at Rodel Studios in Washington D.C. [ 1 ]
The ads were so successful and well - liked that they sparked a series of remakes for companies in other local markets throughout the 1960s .
The “ Cannon ” spot was one of his most popular and produced for at least 14 clients , such as Kraml Dairy , Red Diamond , Community , Nash 's , and more .
The ads starred the cheerful Wilkins , who liked Wilkins Coffee , and the grumpy Wontkins , who hated it .
Wilkins would often do serious harm to Wontkins in the ads — blowing him up , stabbing him with a knife , and smashing him with a club , among many other violent acts .
Wilkins and Wontkins were generally the only characters in the commercials , though on rare occasions , such critters as a Muppet whale or baby birds would appear .
Company owner Mr. Wilkins was also invoked more than once .
The characters proved so popular that in October 1958 , the company offered vinyl puppets of Wilkins and Wontkins through the mail for $ 1.00 and a coffee can label .
The offer on the can said , " Hey Kids !
I 'm Wilkins — he 's Wontkins — you see us on TV ! "
Obviously , Wilkins Coffee and Henson knew that the Muppet characters had kid appeal , although this does n't seem to have had any effect on the use of violence and terror in the ads .
The only time Wontkins was caught drinking a coffee that was not Wilkins was in the 1958 " Steamroller " ad .
Another series of commercials were produced for the company , notably not featuring Wilkins and Wontkins .
Instead , the commercials star Scoop and Skip ( as Scoop Wilkins and Skip Others , respectively ) for the " Wilkins News Report . "
Scoop headlines from the studio newsdesk , while Skip corresponds from all over the globe , typically referring real - life current events of the time .
Commercials
These are Henson 's official titles for the commercials . [ 2 ]
Wilkins News Reports
Picture Subject Description Abominable Snowman Skip reports from the Himalayan Mountains , attempting to prove the existence of the Abominable Snowman , using the aroma of Wilkins Coffee as bait .
Coffee Break Coffee breaks and their effect on workplace productivity are in the news .
Skip cites one executive in favor of coffee breaks - Mr. Wilkins .
Congo Skip mistakes " the Congo situation " for the " Conga . "
Cuba Skip reports from Havana , having accidentally been drafted into Fidel Castro 's army .
Food for Peace The Wilkins Company is adopting their own " Coffee for Peace " initiative , sending their products to " depressed areas " ( i.e. their consumer markets ) .

Public appeal
The Wilkins Coffee ads stood out from the usual commercial fare .
In a press release issued February 19 , 1959 , Senator John Marshall Butler ( R - MD ) strongly criticized the quality of broadcast television , but praised the Wilkins ads : " The Maryland Senator , an opponent of pay television , called on the networks and individual stations to re-examine their programming and advertising policies at once to provide the public with better television fare .
He said that the Senate Commerce Committee , of which he is a member , will explore the entire situation ...
As to advertising , it insults the intelligence of the viewer .
It is geared at know - nothings .
As far as I am concerned , if I hear ' a thinking - man 's filter and a smoking - man 's taste , ' I promptly switch to another channel .
About the only clever advertising on the air today is ' Wilkins and Wontkins ' .
It pleases rather than irritates television audiences , and I am happy to learn that this series is bringing increased sales to the sponsor . "
The Senator 's approval was echoed in a 1965 article in the Washington , D.C. Evening Star , which reported the findings of a poll in the D.C. area about television commercials : " John H. Wilkins , Jr. , of the Wilkins Coffee Company , can be proud of the overwhelming endorsement of Washington area viewers of his Muppet TV spots .
The Wilkins commercials , which he conceived , are easily the favorite of voters in this area . " [ 3 ]
Franchise
Following the success of the Wilkins Coffee commercials in the Washington , D.C. market , Jim Henson sold the concept to coffee companies in other local markets around the US .
The same ads were reshot , with the only difference being the name of the coffee company .
The other companies included :
Community Coffee :
Thirty - seven 10 - second ads for Community Coffee , a Louisiana - based company , from 1959 to 1969 .
Beginning in 1966 , the commercials were produced in color . [ 4 ]

Awards
The " TV Anti-Violence League " spot from 1960 was recognized by the Clio awards , as runner - up in the category of best television / cinema spot .
Unauthorized reboot
In October 1990 , the company attempted to reboot the characters , without the Henson Company 's approval .
The company offered t- shirts [ 6 ] and from at least December 1990 to February 1991 .
The company also filed a trademark on a design showing the characters , in 1990 ; it was cancelled as " Dead " in 1998 . [ 7 ]
At some point , the Wilkins Coffee Co. sold the film and toy rights to the characters to John T. Brady & Associates , a New York marketing firm .
The company set up a booth in June 1992 at the Licensing Expo in New York City , attempting to sell licensing to the characters .
The booth was decorated with images of Henson and the rest of the Muppets , and the phrase " Original Muppets Created by Jim Henson . "
Jim Henson Production staff viewed the booth on the first day of the show ; Jane Henson viewed it on the third day , and attempted to tear down the display .
Jim Henson Productions filed a lawsuit in federal court , and Brady threatened to countersue .
Brady responded that he did n't " see why we should be prevented from expanding the Muppet culture . " [ 8 ]
( Wilkins had filed trademark applications on the characters in March 1992 , in categories including " marketing and licensing of children 's characters , " toys , clothing , hair products , television programs , printed items ( books , napkins , etc ) , and cough medicines .
These patents had been abandoned by April 1993 . ) [ 9 ]
Wilkins ran the t- shirt promotion at least once more , in 1994 . [ 10 ]

Advertisement A Russian - registered cargo ship has lost 1,500 tonnes of timber in rough seas off the Sussex coast .
It happened in a major English Channel shipping lane 14 miles off Newhaven , East Sussex , at 0815 GMT .
The vessel was escorted to the Solent where it has been anchored , to allow the damage to be assessed and the remaining cargo to be secured .
A spokeswoman said the wood could be heading towards Dungeness in Kent , not the Sussex coast as previously thought .
Aerial surveillance
She said : " We thought at first it was heading towards Brighton and Hastings to arrive there later today , but now it 's looking to go round Dungeness .
" It may actually avoid the coastline entirely and go on up through the Dover Strait . "
The 137 m ( 450 ft ) vessel Sinegorsk , which has a 25 - strong crew , was heading to Alexandria in Egypt from Oskarshamn in Sweden when the sawn timber was lost from the deck .
An aerial surveillance aircraft has been sent to survey the debris and to see whether the wood remains in secure bundles .
Dover Coastguard has alerted other vessels in the area about the risk of seaborne debris .
The vessel was heading to Egypt from Sweden
The spokesperson added : " The receiver of wreck has also been kept informed of the sawn timber and its likely impact on the shoreline . "
Local authorities , police and the Environment Agency met in Brighton earlier to discuss contingencies if the wood was washed ashore .
An East Sussex County Council spokesman said its priority was " public safety and the swift removal of any wood from the coast " .
In January last year more than 2,000 tonnes of timber washed up along the Sussex coast after the Greek - registered Ice Prince sank about 26 miles south of Dorset .
Marine investigation Fred Caygill of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) said the Sinegorsk lost its load as it came in to the south west lane of the Dover straits , approaching Newhaven .
He said the Marine Accident Investigation Branch would be investigating how the ship came to lose the timber but added that the rough seas were likely to have been a factor .
" We can't say that definitely caused it but generally weather has an effect , " he said .
He said the wood was currently " a long way off shore " but added that if it did drift towards land it could lead to a " similar " situation as the Ice Prince .
A stained glass panel to commemorate the Ice Prince incident was being unveiled on Worthing Pier at noon as the start of the week - long Ice Prince Arts Festival .

In the past , Linux was not overly blessed with decent budgeting software , and installing GnuCash was regarded by many as the epitome of a descent into dependency hell .
Thankfully , things have since changed , and anyone using a modern distribution could now have the software ready to go in just a few minutes .
This kind of software is all about the data ; getting it in , getting it out and doing useful things with it .
In terms of getting data into the package , there are three things we need .
We want software that makes it easy to add items to the spending side because you 'll be less likely to update your ledger if doing so proves annoyingly difficult .
We want filters that will import transaction data downloaded from our bank account and allow easy reconciliation between local and remote records .
Finally , we want to be able to set up periodic transactions that can be added to the ledger at certain points each month to deal with things such as mortgage payments .
Remember that , while the price of shares and property can go down as well as up , the cost of most of these packages will always be £0 .
1. GnuCash
GnuCash is the rich great uncle of the other software on test here , having been around almost as long as Linux itself .
In the early days , installing GnuCash was painful , and the final application looked like it was designed for accountants .
Fortunately things have evolved since then and the application now has a user - friendly sheen .
The old friend is still there under the hood , but there have been numerous additions that make running a basic accounting system a more pleasant experience .
One thing about GnuCash that used to put us off was the arcane double - entry system that gave the software much of its power .
This has been augmented with a selection of more basic account types , which are offered on the first run of the software .
However , for the most simple system – based on our downloaded data – we found it easy to begin with a blank slate and then create a single account based on the Bank or Cash option and use this to house our data .
Using this method , we were up and running within a few minutes of installing the software .
Importing the OFX data from the bank worked well , with the automated druid ( a wizard by any other name ) giving us the option of viewing the data before it was imported .
This would be more useful if we could enable or disable individual entries , but this screen is not dynamic .
The Register window itself is very tidy , with a range of icons across the top and transactions arranged chronologically .
You can add new transactions by clicking in the empty space at the bottom of the register .
Today 's date is added automatically , and you can tab between sections , adding detail .
Reconciling downloaded transactions with your own records is equally simple ; just find the transaction in question and hit the reconciliation column entry for it .
As you move to the next transaction , you 'll be prompted to record the change .
This can get a little tedious , so the dialog box has a pair of options to either not display the request again , or just remove it for the current session .
This was a useful addition because it provides a visual cue that you 're changing data ( and is especially important when you realise there 's no Undo option ) .
Volume reconciliation is also available .
This is where , after entering a large number of transactions manually ( ie adding entries over a week ) or using scheduled transactions , you can check them against a downloaded statement for the same period and mark off matching entries .
Bulk reconciliation is a great way to pick up on anomalous transactions .
Automated reconciliation can be useful , but it could mean mistakes or nefarious activity go unnoticed for longer than necessary .

Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
Open source software means the source code is available under license
The secret to a more secure and cost effective government is through open source technologies and products .
The claim comes from one of Silicon Valley 's most respected business leaders Scott McNealy , a co-founder of Sun Microsystems .
He revealed he has been asked to prepare a paper on the subject for the new administration .
" It 's intuitively obvious open source is more cost effective and productive than proprietary software , " he said .
" Open source does not require you to pay a penny to Microsoft or IBM or Oracle or any proprietary vendor any money . "
Improvements Mr McNealy told the BBC he wants to ensure the government does not get " locked in " to one specific vendor or company .
" The government ought to mandate open source products based on open source reference implementations to improve security , get higher quality software , lower costs , higher reliability - all the benefits that come with open software .
Sun Microsystems '
Java programming language is an open source product used in billions of devices such as mobile phones and computers .
Instead of charging for a copyrighted program , by and large any open source product is publicly available , is licensed under royalty free terms for unrestricted use and has an open code for all to see , copy and adapt for free .
The idea behind this is that the thinking of many will improve a product by leaps and bounds and keep it relevant .
A report by global technology research house XMG said companies " were exploring the advantages of open source software " due to the " prohibitive " cost of proprietary products .
" Colossal expense " President Obama has said he is prepared to go through the budget " line by line " to cut wasteful spending , but has so far failed to give any specifics of how that would be done .
The Open Source Initiative , or OSI , is fully supportive of Mr McNealy 's efforts which both believe is one of the main solutions the new President cannot afford to ignore .
Mr McNealy says the benefits of open source products can't be ignored " Scott is absolutely correct about the benefits which have been demonstrated time and again , " said OSI president Michael Tiemann .
" It 's an accident of history that proprietary standards became so entrenched so early and it's been a colossal expense for government . "
Mr Tiemann said while some departments already use open source technologies , overall it has been estimated that the global loss due to proprietary software is " in excess of $ 1 trillion a year . "
He claimed that the conservative cost for the US is from " $ 400 bn ( £ 290 bn ) and upwards . "
" A move to open source will lower costs and increase capability , " said Mr Tiemann who is also the vice - president of Red Hat , the world 's leading open source technology solutions provider .
" This is the kind of change we need if we are ever going to see the government reform its operational capabilities and cost basis .
If they fail to do this , it 's one more stick in the mud .
The capital markets are telling us today we can no longer afford much more status quo , " he stated .
The Open Solutions Alliance has said the present economic downturn " will lead to an increase in adoption of open solutions due to their flexibility , scalability and value . "
Meanwhile research firm Gartner has warned that the benefits of open source might not deliver unless properly managed .
" Do not expect to automatically save money with open source software , or OSS , or any technology without effective financial management , " said analyst Mark Driver .
Microsoft and Oracle have opened up some of their software and protocols to developers .
" Open source President "
So just how receptive will the 44th President will be to the idea of a implementing the workings of a new government around open standards ?
Mr Obama has promised an open and transparent government " The concept of open source is going to become an undercurrent to almost everything this administration does , " declared the OSI 's Michael Tiemann .
" The American concept of democracy is not just of the people and by the people but with the people . "
He said we have already seen a commitment to this open philosophy throughout President Obama 's election campaign .
" I think what we will see now is a maturation in America and around the world of an understanding of the open source model . "
Errol Louis of the New York Daily News seemed to agree .
He described Mr Obama as " our first open source President , a leader willing to let anybody and everybody figure out how , when and where they want to get involved . "
He noted that the strategy popularised by computer software companies in giving away software to get others to improve on it has now been applied to politics .
Indeed the new Change.gov website is said to be a portal for " interactive government " and " open source democracy . "
" Oversight " Mr McNealy said a new cabinet post of chief information officer ( CIO ) was necessary to drive this fundamental root and branch change .
Java , which went open source in 2006 , is on 6 billion devices
He added that the CIO should " have veto power , the right to eliminate any hardware , software or networking product that touches the federal network .
" He or she would have real power , real oversight and employ real consequences for folk that do n't realign with the architecture .
It 's what every business does that the government doesn't , " he concluded .
The OSI 's Mr Tiemann disagreed and said that a CIO post " would be a waste of an executive slot . "
" Knowing what I know about the structure and nature of the federal government , I can't believe there is much value to having a CIO who would have to implement across the departments who find it hard to co-operate regardless of the technical hurdles .
" A CIO would just not be a productive post over the next four years , " stated Mr Tiemann .

BAGHDAD  Calling someone the “ son of a shoe ” is one of the worst insults in Iraq .
But the lowly shoe and the Iraqi who threw both of his at President Bush , with widely admired aim , were embraced around the Arab world on Monday as symbols of rage at a still unpopular war .
In Saudi Arabia , a newspaper reported that a man had offered $ 10 million to buy just one of what has almost certainly become the world ’s most famous pair of black dress shoes .
A daughter of Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi , the Libyan leader , reportedly awarded the shoe thrower , Muntader al - Zaidi , a 29 - year - old journalist , a medal of courage .
In the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City , people calling for an immediate American withdrawal removed their footwear and placed the shoes and sandals at the end of long poles , waving them high in the air .
And in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf , people threw their shoes at a passing American convoy .

It just gets worse for CERN and its attempts to reassure us that the Large Hadron Collider wo n’t make mincemeat of the planet .
It ’s beginning to look as if a massive miscalculation in the safety reckonings means that CERN scientists cannot offer any assurances about the work they ’re doing .
In a truly frightening study , Toby Ord and pals at the University of Oxford say that “ while the arguments for the safety of the LHC are commendable for their thoroughness , they are not infallible . ”
When physicists give a risk assessment , their figure is only correct if their argument is valid .
So an important questions is then : what are the chances that the reasoning is flawed ?
Ord and co say that roughly one in a 1000 scientific papers have to be withdrawn because of errors .
And errors are by no means unknown among particle physicists , even those doing safety calculations
The Oxford team points to a 1999 study of the risk of a “ dangerous event ” at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York state .
This study calculated that the chance of such an event was tiny : 2 x 10 ^ - 9 .
On the strength of this study , the Collider was deemed safe and operated for five years before a serious error was found in the calculations .
( It turned out that the actual risk was closer to 10 ^ - 12 but the important point is that there was an error ) .
The problem is compounded when the chances of a planet - destroying event are deemed to be tiny .
In that case , these chances are dwarfed by the chances of an error in the argument .
“ If the probability estimate given by an argument is dwarfed by the chance that the argument itself is flawed , then the estimate is suspect , ” say Ord and co .
Nobody at CERN has put a figure on the chances of the LHC destroying the planet .
One study simply said : “ there is no risk of any significance whatsoever from such black holes ” .
Which means we are left with the possibility that their argument is wrong which Ord reckons conservatively to be about 10 ^ - 4 , meaning that out of a sample of 10,000 independent arguments of similar apparent merit , one would have a serious error .
Of course , this does n’t mean that the LHC is dangerous , only that there is no reasonable assurance of safety which , as Mark Buchanan writing in New Scientist this week says , is not the same thing at all .
Even still , when it comes to the lives of 6.5 billion people , we need to have better assurances than this .

What does the volatile keyword mean ?
How should you use it ?
Confusingly , there are two common answers , because depending on the language you use volatile supports one or the other of two different programming techniques : lock - free programming , and dealing with ' unusual ' memory .
( See Figure 1 . )
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Adding to the confusion , these two different uses have overlapping requirements and impose overlapping restrictions , which makes them appear more similar than they are .
Let 's define and understand them clearly , and see how to spell them correctly in C , C++ , Java and C# -- and not always as volatile .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Case 1 : Ordered Atomic Variables For Lock - Free Programming
Lock - free programming is all about doing communication and synchronization between threads using lower - level tools than mutex locks .
In the past and even today , however , these tools are all over the map .
In rough historical order , they include explicit fences / barriers ( e.g. , Linux 's mb ( ) ) , order - inducing special API calls ( e.g. , Windows ' InterlockedExchange ) , and various flavors of special atomic types .
Many of these tools are tedious and / or difficult , and their wide variety means that lock - free code ends up being written differently in different environments .
The last few years , however , have seen a major convergence across hardware and software vendors :
The computing industry is coalescing around sequentially consistent ordered atomic variables as the default or only way to write lock - free code using the major languages and OS platforms .
In a nutshell , ordered atomic variables are safe to read and write on multiple threads at the same time without doing any explicit locking because they provide two guarantees : their reads and writes are guaranteed to be executed in the order they appear in your program 's source code ; and each read or write is guaranteed to be atomic , all - or - nothing .
They also have special operations such as compareAndSet that are guaranteed to be executed atomically .
See [ 1 ] for further details about ordered atomic variables and how to use them correctly .
Ordered atomic variables are available in Java , C# and other .NET languages , and the forthcoming ISO C++
Standard , but under different names :
Java provides ordered atomics under the volatile keyword ( e.g. , volatile int ) , and solidified this support in Java 5 ( 2004 ) .
Java additionally provides a few named types in java.util.concurrent.atomic , such as AtomicLongArray , that you can use for the same purpose .
keyword ( e.g. , ) , and solidified this support in Java 5 ( 2004 ) .
Java additionally provides a few named types in , such as , that you can use for the same purpose .
. NET mostly added them in Visual Studio 2005 , also under the volatile keyword ( e.g. , volatile int ) .
These are suitable for nearly all lock - free code uses , except for rare examples similar to Dekker 's algorithm .
. NET is fixing these remaining corner cases in Visual Studio 2010 , which is in early beta as of this writing .
) .

. NET is fixing these remaining corner cases in Visual Studio 2010 , which is in early beta as of this writing .
ISO C++ added them to the C++0 x draft Standard in 2007 , under the templated name atomic < T > ( e.g. , atomic ) .
They started to become available beginning in 2008 in the Boost project and other implementations . [ 2 ] .
The ISO C++ atomics library also provides a C - compatible way to spell those types and their operations ( e.g. , atomic_int ) , and these appear to be likely to be adopted by ISO C in the future .
A Word About Optimization
We 're going to look at how ordered atomics restrict the optimizations that compilers , CPUs , cache effects , and other parts of your execution environment might perform .
So let 's first briefly review some basic rules of optimization .
The most fundamental rule of optimization in pretty much any language is this : Optimizations that rearrange ( ' transform ' ) your code 's execution are always legal if they do n't change the meaning of the program , so that the program can't tell the difference between executing the original code and the transformed code .
In some languages , this is also known as the 'as if ' rule -- which gets its name from the fact that the transformed code has the same observable effects ' as if ' the original source code had been executed as written .
This rule cuts two ways :
First , an optimization must never make it possible to get a result that was n't possible before , or break any guarantees that the original code was allowed to rely on , including language semantics .
If we produce an impossible result , after all , the program and the user certainly can tell the difference , and it's not just ' as if ' we 'd executed the original untransformed code .
Second , optimizations are permitted to reduce the set of possible executions .
For example , an optimization might make some potential ( but not guaranteed ) interleavings never actually happen .
This is okay , because the program could n't rely on them happening anyway .
Ordered Atomics and Optimization
Using ordered atomic variables restricts the kinds of optimizations your compiler and processor and cache system can do . [ 3 ]
There are two kinds of optimizations to consider :
Optimizations on the ordered atomic reads and writes themselves .
Optimizations on nearby ordinary reads and writes .
First , all of the ordered atomic reads and writes on a given thread must execute exactly in source code order , because that 's one of the fundamental guarantees of ordered atomic variables .
However , we can still perform some optimizations , in particular , optimizations that have the same effect as if this thread just always executed so quickly that another thread did n't happen to ever interleave at certain points .
For instance , consider this code , where a is an ordered atomic variable :
a = 1 ; // A a = 2 ; // B
Is it legal for a compiler , processor , cache , or other part of the execution environment to transform the above code into the following , eliminating the redundant write in line A ?
< FONT COLOR = " FF000 " > // A ' : OK : eliminate line A entirely </ FONT >< br > a = 2 ; // B
The answer is , ' Yes . '
This is legal because the program can't tell the difference ; it 's as if this thread always ran so fast that no other thread accessing a concurrently ever got to interleave between lines A and B to see the intermediate value . [ 4 ]
Similarly , if a is an ordered atomic variable and local is an unshared local variable , it is legal to transform
a = 1 ; // C : write to a local = a ; // D : read from a
to
a = 1 ; // C : write to a local =
< FONT COLOR = " FF000 " >1</FONT > ; < FONT COLOR = " FF000 " > // D' : OK , apply " constant propagation </ FONT > "
which eliminates the read from a .
Even if another thread is concurrently trying to write to a , its as if this thread always ran so fast that the other thread never got to interleave between lines C and D to change the value before we can read our own back into local .
Second , nearby ordinary reads and writes can still be reordered around ordered atomic reads and writes , but subject to some restrictions .
In particular , as described in [ 3 ] , ordinary reads and writes can't move upward across ( from after to before ) an ordered atomic read , and can't move downward across ( from before to after ) an ordered atomic write .
In brief , that could move them out of a critical section of code , and you can write programs that can tell the difference .
For more details , see [ 3 ] .
That 's it for lock - free programming and ordered atomics .
What about the other case that some " volatiles " address ?
The investigations into Bernard L. Madoff are expanding into offshore tax havens .
Federal prosecutors are beginning to consider what role offshore fund operations may have played in the $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme that Mr. Madoff is accused of orchestrating .
Of particular interest is whether Mr. Madoff and some of his investors used funds based in offshore tax havens to evade American taxes , according to a person briefed on the investigation .
Also under scrutiny is whether certain charities invested with Mr. Madoff had improperly allowed their donors to shift money offshore , and whether foreign banks had withheld American taxes on Madoff accounts , as required by the Internal Revenue Service , according to this person , who was given anonymity because of the delicate nature of the investigation .
Mr. Madoff was arrested Dec. 11 at his New York apartment and charged with securities fraud .
The authorities have characterized the fraud as a worldwide Ponzi scheme  perhaps the largest ever .

Under the proposed system , ISPs would send offenders warning letters ( something many ISPs have already been doing for years ) , while quietly adopting a three strikes system for repeat offenders .
The RIAA has been hashing this new system out with select ISPs behind closed doors with the supposed help of New York 's Attorney General , who recently made headlines for his largely ineffective war on Usenet child porn ) .
None of the ISPs have publicly admitted to participating in the plan ( though we 've confirmed that Cox is ) .
quote :
There are still plenty of details left to work out , the sources said .
The RIAA has yet to address how it would help ISPs make up for the revenue they would lose by kicking people off their networks or who would pay the costs of sending take - down notices .
The RIAA may disclose participating ISPs as soon as next month , according to a music industry source , adding that AT&T and Comcast are expected to be part of the group .
The irony of course is that for years piracy was broadband 's " killer app , " quietly used by ISPs to lure dial - up subscribers to broadband .
Now that the market is saturated , and carriers like AT&T and Comcast have become network operators and content companies , they 've found it 's in their best financial interest to clamp down on P2P piracy .
Both Comcast and AT&T certainly have the financial resources to put forth a serious anti-piracy effort .
CNET has discovered , not too surprisingly , that both Comcast and AT&T are among the plan 's dozen or so participants , though no carrier wants to admit as much on the record .
Insiders at the two companies say the carriers are " skittish " about the negative press , certainly in part because of fear customers will flock to non-participating ISPs ( like Verizon ) .
Insiders note that so far , the plan still is n't much of one -- and no formal agreements have been signed :

AT&T is not only planning to participate in the RIAA 's three strikes plan , they 're also testing caps , metered billing and piracy filters .
The entertainment industry would love it if all ISPs would follow AT&T 's lead either voluntarily or by force -- but so far they 've had no luck passing laws requiring that ISPs become piracy police .
Without laws , ISPs are still protected by safe harbor provisions under the DMCA , allowing them to say no to their new job as babysitter .
That will let some ISPs sit back and catch the fleeing pirates from participating ISPs as new customers .
Even if the plan were put into law , the system raises Even if the plan were put into law , the system raises far more questions than it answers , including who pays , who tracks offenders across multiple ISPs , what happens to ISPs who do n't cooperate , who'll oversee the fairness of the system , and what the grievance system is for the falsely accused .
That 's going to be expensive , prone to error , and would require a lot of new regulation for carriers who do n't much like regulation .
If piracy 's history is any indication -- it would n't slow piracy 's growth anyway .

Only the thieves should be worried .
When fruit is picked or when the weather signals it to begin ripening , it releases ethylene gas .
This chemical causes the fruit ’s cells to make all the changes involved with ripening : Chlorophyll is broken down , causing color changes ; starches are converted into sugars , making the fruit sweet and less mealy ; acids are broken down , causing it to taste less sour ; and pectin is broken down , making it softer .
Putting the fruit in a loosely closed paper bag traps the ethylene gas inside and accelerates ripening .
Do n’t seal the bag too tightly or use a plastic bag , however — if you trap too much moisture , mold may grow .
If you really want to ripen things in a hurry , put an apple in the bag with your other fruit — they produce a lot of ethylene gas .

At the MOCA2008 “ hacker camp ” in Italy I had the pleasure to meet and speak with John T. Draper .
Draper is better known as Captain Crunch a man whose work and life are deeply intertwined with the history of hacking , phreaking and the personal computer industry .
Here ’s the transcription of the short chat we had , which verged mostly on his interactions with Apple , Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs and also his use of Macs .
Stories of Apple :
What ’s the story behind you doing the Apple II phone board ?
John Draper : Let ’s start talking a bit about how I met Steve Wozniak . [ … ]
He contacted me when I was a DJ at KKUP radio .
He asked whether or not I could come down and see his bluebox .
He wanted me to show him how to use it .
I was very suspicious of him .
It was at a time during which there was a lot of busts going on and I thought this might have been a setup .
So I made my arrangements to go see him without having anything on me and illegal things not being there .
When I saw him he showed me the bluebox : I was not impressed .
The problem with this bluebox was that it had a square wave instead of a sine wave : the tones are not pure , They sound crappy and anybody using one of those Woz ’s blueboxes would often drop a trouble card in the switch because the switch would n’t recognize tones and would n’t accept them .
[ …]
As my relationship with him grew [ … ] he introduced me to Steve Jobs .
Jobs was working on a little 6 bit computer .
And he said “ Whoa , why only 6 bits ? ”
Six bits can only give you a number of the count to only 32 and he said “ just to demonstrate that I can do a computer , that ’s all ” I said “ That ’s cool ” .
Then two or three years later when Woz was developing the Apple I and then of course later on the Apple II he was using a cross- assembler that I wrote because during that time all these microprocessors where coming on the market people needed to build the right assembler language to write their software .
SoA : Which microprocesors ?
JD : We did it for the [ Intel ] 8080 , the Z80 , 6502 , 1802 and the 6800 .
SoA : Were you working alone at the time or did you have any …
JD : I developed the cross-assemblers on a time - sharing system that only ran Basic .
It would take the assembler code , parse into opcode [… ] and it would then output it in binhex so you could take it and dump it into your tape .
SoA : Not a print - out ?
JD : No , you could get tape readers back then for about fifteen bucks : they were surplus .
That was how probably Bill Gates put in Microsoft Word at Microsoft .
Once that got in he then developed more , a more robust development system , called the Crust development system . [… ]
After that Wozniak [… ] was working on the Apple II and he offered me a job and my job was to design and develop a “ charlie board ” .
SoA : as an employee or an outside contractor ?
JD : Yeah , as an outside contractor job .
So I built the board : it had nine chips .
Woz says “ Nine ! Chips ! ”
He said : “ No , shit , too much ! ” and he said “ I ’ve got a better design for you and he gives me a design with five chips so I ’ve tried to build that [ laughter ] but I said “ wait a minute , you are only using a 6 bit deck instead of a 8 bit deck ” and he said “ Yeah , 8 bit decks cost too much : I can build a 6 bit and I can write the software so you do n’t have to buy that chip ”
So I worked on how to get the extra two bits from .
Guess ?
The address line .
The extra two bits I grabbed from the address line . [… ]
I was just peeking and poking the address .
That was my phone board .
SoA : Was it ever sold ?
Did they actually make it available ?
JD : No. AT&T made sure of that .
They were too freaked out .
Because everything was done in software the board could have evil thoughts and you do n’t wanna have a board with evil thoughts . [… ]
There was sofware and with the right tone table you could turn it into a bluebox .
AT&T did not want that . [ … ]
They put pressure on Jobs .
Not Woz , on Jobs to say “ Wow !
AT&T says ‘ you put this out and we ’ll sue you ’ “ .
There were also other problems .
The board , to work , had to directly connect to the phone line .
At the time this came out , which was in 1975 [… ] actually more like 1976 in order for you to connect to a phone line you had to have a PacBell - approved connection interface device [… ] and the cheapest one was 450 bucks .
Therefore in order to use it as a telephone board a person had also to pay that 450 bucks to buy one of those device while it wasn feasible to do all of that work just connecting to the telephone .
Well , the kept a lot of pressure on Jobs [ … ]
“ We ’re gonna sue you ! ” .
They ca n’t let people connect shit to their telephone lines , right ?
SoA : And then …
JD : Then came the modem . [ … ]
The DC Hayes modem .
They came out with a 1200 baud modem .
It connected to their phone line because in a while they relaxed their restrictions so you could connect to the phone line
SoA : And they were approved .
JD : And they were approved .
The basic problem I had was saturation to the transformer .
Phone line said that DC current ran through the transformer .
If pure DC current ran throught the transformer it would saturate [… ] .
When you saturate a transfomer you get distortion .
It ’s like when you have video and you turn video all the way [… ] .
You lose the quality , it ’s very distorted , not good .
SoA : How fast would have been the board ?
JD : Around 300 baud but we used to say “ programmable ” phase shift . [… ]
A programmable phase - locked loop [ which ] allows you to pick up a frequency and lock on that frequency . [… ]
If that frequency starts coming down the line you can then detect it [ … ] by the phase - locked loop : it would turn around to that frequency .
The modem had a switch between two frequencies , I had a phase - locked loop .
Did it all in software .
SoA : Was it very common to use few chips and do it all in software ?
JD : Well , that was sort of Woz ’s philosophy .
Me I did n’t care how many chips I used as long as I got them working .
Wozniak was thinking more in terms of economics .
SoA : Probably behind that there was actually Jobs .
JD : Yeah , exactly .
Exactly .
Jobs was very very much influenced by Woz , by Woz ’s need to have things done cheaply .
It was something that Woz sort of , you know … ’ cause Jobs manipulated Woz . [ … ]
Jobs is a very manipulative person . [… ]
Nowadays if you walk in an elevator and Jobs goes in there , by the time the elevator gets to your floor and you get out you ’re gonna get fired .
He ’s very very ruthless .
SoA : They say he asks “ what are you doing for me ? ”
JD : Exactly .
He says “ what are you doing for me ? ” Exactly .
And if you do n’t give him the right answer you ’re outta work [… ] .
Not good .
Not a good person to work for .
SoA : Did you have any chance to meet Jobs lately .
JD : I ran into Jobs when I was at Apple Computer down at the testing labs testing some of my software .
SoA : How long ago ?
JD : I suppose it was in 2004 , 2005 .
And I was working on a Voip a Voice Over IP [ … ] application for a private company .
SoA : After the board thing fell through you developed the word processor software , right ?
JD : That was later [ … ] actually two years later .
I started in 1979 : I built EasyWriter in 1979 .
Barney Stone was coming out with an application program written in Basic .
I showed him Easy Writer [ … ]
He wrote in Integer Basic .
A word processor .
SoA : Did you also write it in Basic ?
JD : No , I wrote it in Forth .
And all the scrolling I did that in assembly language [ … ] it was very fast .
We adapted it with a VMI , Virtual Machine Interface .
Today , that language would be called a driver , video driver , a virtual machine interface .
We developed it for the VIDEX board .
SoA : What was that ?
JD : Videx was an 80 column board for the Apple II .
Then we did the IBM PC .
All we had to do was adapt to the IBM PC video [… ]
SoA : You then switched over to the IBM PCs which probably were a more profitable market …
JD : Well , you know , when the PCs came out there were n’t that many of them , there were many more Apples .
SoA : So , what have you been doing lately ?
JD : I work for a company called En2go : we are an entertainment company , we do media .
We are a media delivery company .
We deliver video to your desktop .
Media [ … ] movies , entertainment , games , music … whatever , 3D animations . [… ]
I am their CTO ( Chief Technical Officer ) and I ’m in charge of five different teams with each team working on a specific part of the company .
SoA : Is it just software or also hardware ?
JD : It ’s software and also hardware .
Actually mostly software right now [ but ] we have a set - top box , we call it the Flixo .
It ’s a video delivery system to your Macintosh , delivers media to your desktop .
SoA : Only for the Macintosh ?
JD : I believe we ’re working on a PC version but it ’s not as mature [… ] .
[ Note : the Flixo program streams high definition - quality video to home computers , allowing the monitor to function like an HD television . ]
SoA : So , I ’ve seen you using a Mac . [ … ]
Why ?
JD : Because we like the interface and using [ Mac ] OS X .
We ’re developing using Cocoa , the programming environment Xcode .
Cocoa is an Objective C …
SoA : .. and is it easier to write with ?
JD : Yeah , it ’s wired up , man .
Fuckin ’ wired up man . [ … ]
It was borrowed from NeXT .
Jobs owned all the code from NeXT , he brought it in to Apple .
It ’s part of Xcode , part of Cocoa .
SoA : Did you have any prior experience with the NeXT Step system ?
JD : Yeah , of course .
I used it when it came out , I know Cocoa from back then .
You know what NS stands for ? [ … ]
The names of the functions start with NS . [ … ]
For the Windows version we use … how is it called …
Visual C++.
SoA : Do you have any personal projects ?
Working on some hardware , on some board ?
JD : Personal projects … oh yeah , I ’m doing Crunch TV : it ’s a TV program on one of our Flixo channels .
It ’s on CrunchTV . net right now , they have a first episode right now , you can watch it anytime you want .
SoA : Is it going to be a monthly show ?
Or weekly ?
JD : It has n’t been set on yet . [… ]
Eventually we ’re gonna move our studio from Las Vegas to Hollywood . [ … ]
We have got lots and lots of raw video footage : we have n’t got to date a video editing suite that we like .
And I do n’t wanna do it .
I hate video editing , I think somebody else will do that .
Thanks to Metro Olografix for inviting Mr. Draper , to Massimo “ manray ” Politi for the heads up and pictures during the chat and Salty Dog for helping figuring out some ( I hope most ) of the technical terms mentioned .

Last week , the attacks in India and the threat to New York City 's subway system provided another stark reminder of the need for a united front against global terrorism .
Yet instead of figuring out how to combat Islamic extremists , the United Nations is worried about offending them .
On November 24 , 2008 , the U.N. passed a draft resolution against the defamation of religion sponsored by the 57 - member Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , where all U.N. members are being asked to pass domestic legislation against blasphemy .
The resolution was originally introduced in 1999 by the OIC , asserting that " Islam is frequently and wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism . "
In reality , terrorism happens in Islam 's name , or more accurately , in Islamism 's name .
Islamism is a 20th century product arising from the writings of sincere Muslims such as Hasan al - Banna and Syed Qutb .
Frustrated by the fallen status of Muslims vis-à - vis the West , they offered a new version of Islam as a totalitarian socio-political alternative to democracy and Western license .
Disparate followers from Osama bin Laden , Hezbollah and Hamas to the Jihadis that waged war on Mumbai last week are not deranged or crazy .
Rather , they subscribe to a worldview that is antithetical to most Muslims and the West .
The OIC nations charge critics of Islamic extremism with " racism " and " Islamophobia " to deflect attention from the fact that such violence originates at the hand of Muslim clerics born and bred in their lands .
This is because they realize they can't control Islamism , or they tacitly agree with its message .
These Muslim clerics also export this ideology to the West to radicalize Muslim immigrants abroad , and reform - minded Muslims are usually the first victims .
Kadra Noor was beaten up in 2007 for speaking out against " Islamic " female genital mutilation in Norway .
In Sweden , cabinet minister Nyamko Sabuni proposed that honor killings be labeled a separate crime in the Swedish penal code and girls get mandatory gynecological exams to discourage female circumcision .
She also told the Sunday Times that arranged marriages are not a part of Islam .
As a result , she was called an " Islamophobe " and instead of supporting her , 50 Islamic Swedish organizations petitioned against her appointment to the cabinet in an effort to suppress her growing influence in Swedish politics .
Pakistan , spokesman for the OIC , recently promoted a politician to minister of education after he defended the live burial of five girls in Balochistan as " tribal custom . "
It is not a stretch to argue that Pakistan is not an OIC member interested in reform .
The 2005 Danish cartoon controversy kick - started the OIC campaign to pass last month 's resolution when it was cited as another example of increased discrimination against Muslims after 9/11 .
The " cartoon intifada " arose 5 months after the original printing of the images of Muhammad , but only weeks before the UNHCR was due to consider the OIC 's resolution on " Combating Defamation of Religion . "
Such a coincidence caused the National Secular Society to state in its Memorandum to the United Kingdom Parliament that " the Danish cartoon crisis was manufactured …to exploit sensitivities around racial discrimination and to promote ( or even exaggerate ) the notion of ' Islamophobia ' in order to restrict possibilities for open discussion or criticism of Islam … .
[ M]easures calling for legislation banning ' defamation of religion ' …. aim [ ] to remove religion , especially Islam , from public scrutiny and public debate . "
The OIC forgets that Muslims are already protected in the West .
The U.S. , for example , increases sentences on crimes ranging from assault and battery to murder if they are deemed " hate crimes , " which includes crimes against a victim based on his or her religious identity .
So what is this 57 - nation organization really pushing with this " anti-blasphemy " resolution at the U.N. ?
In the Muslim world , anti-blasphemy laws are regularly used to suppress free speech by attacking fellow Muslims and non-Muslims who criticize the government or protest human rights violations .
Such laws are also used as pretext against individuals in personal and business disputes .
The mere allegation puts mobs before the accused before the police can arrive to investigate .
At the U.N. , the OIC has manipulated the language of racism to make its anti-democratic agenda more attractive to " third world " nations recovering from their own genuine post - colonial struggles .
Nations that voted in favor of the resolution or abstained were predominantly from Latin America or developing African nations .
A final version of the resolution is up for a vote this month .
It would be a mistake for these U.N. members to fall for anti-colonial rhetoric once again .
By aligning with Islamists , the U.N. would be supporting the stifling of free speech and the suppression of human rights , and crushing the goal of building tolerant democratic societies .
Cold sore virus could be the clue to the cause of 60 per cent of Alzheimer 's cases
The virus HSV1 could offer hope to up to 60 per cent of Alzheimer 's sufferers
The virus that causes cold sores may be one of the main causes of Alzheimer 's disease , according to research that suggests that existing drugs could be used to treat the most common form of dementia .
Scientists at the University of Manchester have found new evidence that the herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV1 ) could be in up to 60 per cent of Alzheimer 's cases .
The research , which was published in the Journal of Pathology , is in preliminary stages , but should the HSV1 role be confirmed , it could transform the way in which the debilitating disease is understood and treated .
The news is particularly exciting as products to treat the HSV1 virus are already widely available .
Drugs including acyclovir and Zovirax have been on the market for many years , and are available over the counter .
' One thing that is exciting about our research is that we already have drugs that have been used for a relatively long time against HSV1 , which are cheap and well tolerated .
If we are right , there is a good chance we could make progress quite quickly , ' said Professor Ruth Itzhaki , who led the research .
The next step for the scientists would be to test the theory in animal models , after which Itzhaki believes they could establish whether HSV1 is genuinely involved in Alzheimer 's within a year .
Currently the group is struggling to obtain funding for this next stage of research .
The group would then test the antiviral drugs on patients in the early stages of the disease in a three - to five - year clinical trial .
The HSV1 virus affects most adults , causing cold sores in 20 - 40 per cent of people .
The findings do not indicate that many , or even most cold sore sufferers will get Alzheimer's .
Finally , a nettop we can really support .

Israeli tanks have pushed deep into Gaza City , prompting fierce exchanges of gunfire with fighters of the Palestinian militant group Hamas .
The UN 's relief agency , Unrwa , says part of its HQ in Gaza caught fire after being hit by Israeli shells .
UN chief Ban Ki-moon expressed outrage .
Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert apologised but said troops returned fire after coming under attack from the UN 's compound .
The Hamas interior minister , Said Siyam was reported killed in an air strike .
Both Hamas and Israeli officials said Siyam was killed at his brother 's home in Gaza City .
Meanwhile , Hamas and Israeli negotiators were said to be making progress towards a ceasefire agreement as they held separate meetings with Egyptian mediators in Cairo .
Olmert apology
Speaking to reporters on the Israel - Gaza border , Unrwa spokesman Christopher Gunness said three of the agency 's employees were hurt in the attack on its compound in Gaza City .
About 700 people were still sheltering in the compound , he said , and the fire had been burning close to five full fuel tanks .
Mr Gunness added that Unrwa would not be able to distribute food or medical supplies on Thursday as its trucks were unable to leave the compound .
Mr Olmert met Mr Ban and apologised for the attack , but blamed it on Palestinian fighters firing from the UN site .
" It is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place , but the consequences are very sad and we apologise for it , " he said .
" I do n't think it should have happened and I 'm very sorry . "
Escalation
The coastal enclave came under heavy fire from the east in the early morning as soldiers and tanks pushed into Gaza City .
Witnesses said they saw soldiers on foot marching behind bulldozers and tanks .

The advancing troops came under fire from fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian factions positioned on rooftops and balconies , said the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf .
The building where he lives in the Gaza City suburb of Tel al - Hawa was surrounded by Israeli tanks at one point , he said , and several shells hit the lower floors .
Columns of thick smoke rose into the sky over Gaza from fires touched off by the fighting .
About 70 people have been killed in the fighting on Thursday , Gaza 's Ministry of Health said .
Reports said at least 15 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel since the early morning , injuring eight people in Beersheba .
Nearly 1,100 Gazans and 13 Israelis have reportedly died so far in the conflict .
Speaking to the press after meeting Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv , Mr Ban repeated previous calls for an immediate ceasefire , and said the suffering in Gaza was a " dire humanitarian crisis " that had reached an " unbearable point " .
In other developments :
The UK Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch - Brown says the British government " utterly " condemns the attack on the UN headquarters in Gaza .
Fierce criticism also came from the French foreign ministry
Two hospitals in Gaza City are hit by shellfire : the al - Quds hospital in Tel al - Hawa neighbourhood , scene of heavy fighting , and a Red Crescent hospital , the UK Red Cross says
The Shurouq tower block in Gaza City , which houses the offices of the Reuters news agency and several other media organisations , is hit by an explosion , injuring a journalist for the Abu Dhabi television channel
Leaders of the six - member Gulf Cooperation Council are to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss the crisis .
The Saudi monarch , King Abdullah , said the meeting was convened because of what he called Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people
A boat carrying medical supplies to Gaza is surrounded by Israeli warships in international waters off Lebanon 's southern coast and forced to return to Cyprus , according to charity Free Gaza
Palestinian deaths in the Gaza Strip reach 1,083 according to Gaza medical sources .
Nearly a third of the dead are said to be children
' Detailed vision '
Israeli and Hamas envoys have been in Cairo , holding separate meetings with Egyptian negotiators .
Egypt has been leading efforts to broker a ceasefire that could include a peacekeeping force being deployed along its border with Gaza to prevent the smuggling of weapons .
On Wednesday , Hamas official Salah al - Bardawil said his movement had presented Egyptian negotiators with a " detailed vision " of how to bring about a ceasefire .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , has said any ceasefire agreement would have to include a halt to Israeli attacks , the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the opening of border crossings to end the blockade of Gaza .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said there was " momentum " to the talks .
" Ultimately we want to see a long - term sustainable quiet in the south , a quiet that 's going to be based on the total absence of all hostile fire from Gaza into Israel , and an internationally supported mechanism that will prevent Hamas from rearming , " Mr Regev said .
Israel launched its offensive on the Gaza Strip on 27 December and has refused to allow international journalists to enter Gaza without supervision , making it to independently confirm casualty figures .
The offensive has provoked widespread international condemnation at the cost in civilian casualties and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the coastal enclave .

Software Transactional Memory :
Why is it only a Research Toy ?
The promise of STM may likely be undermined by its overheads and workload applicabilities .
Călin Cașcaval , Colin Blundell , Maged Michael , Harold W. Cain , Peng Wu , Stefanie Chiras , and Siddhartha Chatterjee
Transactional memory ( TM ) 13 is a concurrency control paradigm that provides atomic and isolated execution for regions of code .
TM is considered by many researchers to be one of the most promising solutions to address the problem of programming multicore processors .
Its most appealing feature is that most programmers only need to reason locally about shared data accesses , mark the code region to be executed transactionally , and let the underlying system ensure the correct concurrent execution .
This model promises to provide the scalability of finegrained locking while avoiding common pitfalls of lock composition such as deadlock .
In this article , we explore the performance of a highly optimized STM and observe the overall performance of TM is much worse at low levels of parallelism , which is likely to limit the adoption of this programming paradigm .
Different implementations of transactional memory systems make tradeoffs that impact both performance and programmability .
Larus and Rajwar16 present an overview of design trade - offs for implementations of transactional memory systems .
We summarize some of the design choices here :
Software - only ( STM ) 7,10,12,14,18,23,25 is the focus here .
While offering flexibility and no hardware cost , it leads to overhead in excess of most users ' tolerance .
is the focus here .
While offering flexibility and no hardware cost , it leads to overhead in excess of most users ' tolerance .
Hardware - only ( HTM ) 2,4,9,13,19,20,35 suffers from two major impediments : high implementation and verification costs lead to design risks too large to justify on a niche programming model ; hardware capacity constraints lead to significant performance degradation when overflow occurs , and proposals for managing overflows ( for example , signatures 5 ) incur false positives that add complexity to the programming model .
Therefore , from an industrial perspective , HTM designs have to provide more benefits for the cost , on a more diverse set of workloads ( with varying transactional characteristics ) for hardware designers to consider implementation .
Reuse of hardware for other purposes can also justify its inclusion , as the case may be for Sun 's implementation of Scout Threading in the Rock processor .

A special case of the hybrid systems are hardware - accelerated STMs .
In this scenario , the transactional semantics are provided by the STM , and hardware primitives are only used to speed up critical performance bottlenecks in the STM .
Such systems could offer an attractive solution if the cost of hardware primitives is modest and may be further amortized by other uses in the system .
Independent of these implementation decisions , there are transactional semantics issues that break the ideal transactional programming model for which the community had hoped .
TM introduces a variety of programming issues that are not present in lock - based mutual exclusion .
For example , semantics are muddled by :
Interaction with non-transactional codes , including access to shared data from outside of a transaction ( tolerating weak atomicity ) and the use of locks inside a transaction ( breaking isolation to make locking operations visible outside transactions ) ;
Exceptions and serializability : how to handle exceptions and propagate consistent exception information from within a transactional context , and how to guarantee that transactional execution respects a correct ordering of operations ;
Interaction with code that cannot be transactionalized , due to either communication with other threads or a requirement barring speculation ;
Livelock , or the system guarantee that all transactions make progress even in the presence of conflicts .
In addition to the intrinsic semantic issues , there are also implementation - specific optimizations motivated by high transactional overheads , such as programmer annotations for excluding private data .
Furthermore , the non-determinism introduced by aborting transactions complicates debugging transactional code may be executed and aborted on conflicts , which makes it difficult for the programmer to find deterministic paths with repeatable behavior .
Both of these dilute the productivity argument for transactions , especially software - only TM implementations .
Given all these issues , we conclude that TM has not yet matured to the point where it presents a compelling value proposition that will trigger its widespread adoption .
While TM can be a useful tool in the parallel programmer 's portfolio , it is our view that it is not going to solve the parallel programming dilemma by itself .
There is evidence that it helps with building certain concurrent data structures , such as hash tables and binary trees .
In addition , there are anecdotal claims that it helps with workloads ; however , despite several years of active research and publication in the area , we are disappointed to find no mentions in the research literature of large - scale applications that make use of TM .
The STAMP30 and Lonestar17 benchmark suites are promising starts , but have a long way to go to be representative of full applications .
We base these conclusions on our work over the past two years building a state of the art STM runtime system and compiler framework , the freely available IBM STM.31
Here , we describe this experience , starting with a discussion of STM algorithms and design decisions .
We then compare the performance of this STM with two other state of the art implementations ( the Intel STM14 and the Sun TL2 STM7 ) as well as dissect the operations executed by the IBM STM and provide a detailed analysis of the performance hotspots of the STM .
Software Transactional Memory
STM implements all the transactional semantics in software .
That includes conflict detection , guaranteeing the consistency of transactional reads , preservation of atomicity and isolation ( preventing other threads from observing speculative writes before the transaction succeeds ) , and conflict resolution ( transaction arbitration ) .
The pseudocode for the main operations executed by a typical STM is illustrated in Figure 1 .
We show two STM algorithms , one that performs full validation and one that uses a global version number ( the additional statements marked with the gv# comment ) .
The advantage of an STM for system programmers is that it offers flexibility in implementing different mechanisms and policies for these operations .
For end users , the advantage of an STM is that it offers an environment to transactionalize ( that is , porting to TM ) their applications without incurring extra hardware cost or waiting for such hardware to be developed .
Conversely , an STM entails nontrivial drawbacks with respect to performance and programming semantics :
Overheads :
In general , STM results in higher sequential overheads than traditional shared - memory programming or HTM .
This is the result of the software expansion of loads and stores to shared mutable locations inside transactions to tens of additional instructions that constitute the STM implementation ( for example , the STM_READ code in Figure 1c ) .
Depending on the transactional characteristics of a workload , these overheads can become a high hurdle for STM to achieve performance .
The sequential overheads ( that is , conflict - free overheads that are incurred regardless of the actions of other concurrent threads ) must be overcome by the concurrency - enabling characteristics of transactional memory .

Semantics :
In order to avoid incurring high STM overheads , non-transactional accesses ( such as loads and stores occurring outside transactions ) are typically not expanded .
This has the effect of weakening and hence complicating the semantics of transactions , which may require the programmer to be more careful than when strong transactional semantics are supported .
The following are some of the weakened guarantees that are usually associated with such STMs :

Thus , the semantics of atomicity are weakened to allow undetected conflicts with non-transactional accesses ( referred to as weak atomicity 3 ) , or equivalently put the burden on the programmer to guarantee that no such conflicts can possibly take place .

Privatization : Some STM designs prohibit the seamless privatization of memory locations , that is , the transition from being accessed transactionally to being accessed privately or non-transactionally in general , by using locks .
For some STM designs , once a location is accessed transactionally , it must continue to be accessed transactionally .
With some STM designs , the programmer can ease the transition by guaranteeing that the first access to the privatized location such as after the location is no longer accessible by other threads is transactional .

With such STM designs , memory allocation and deallocation for locations accessed transactionally are handled differently from other locations .
Legacy binaries : STM needs to observe all memory activities of the transactional regions to ensure atomicity and isolation .
STMs that achieve this observation by code instrumentation generally cannot support transactions calling legacy codes that are not instrumented ( for example , third - party libraries ) without seriously limiting concurrency , such as by serializing transactions .
Evaluation
Here we use the following set of benchmarks :
b+tree is an implementation of database indexing operations on a b - tree data structure for which the data is stored only on the tree leaves .
This implementation uses coarse - grain transactions for every tree operation .
Each b+ tree operation starts from the tree root and descends down to the leaves .
A leaf update may trigger a structural modification to rebalance the tree .
A rebalancing operation often involves recursive ascent over the child - parent edges .
In the worst case , the rebalancing operation modifies the entire tree .
Our workload inserts 2,048 items in a b+tree of order 20 .
For this code we have only a transactional version that is not manually instrumented , therefore experimental results are presented only in configurations where we can use our compiler to provide instrumentation ;

15 The code produces a guaranteed quality Delaunay mesh .
This is a Delaunay triangulation with the additional constraint that no angle in the mesh be less than 30 degrees .
The benchmark takes as input an unrefined Delaunay triangulation and produces a new triangulation that satisfies this constraint .
In the TM implementation of the algorithm , multiple threads choose their elements from a work - queue and refine the cavities as separate transactions .

genome , kmeans , and vacation are part of the STAMP benchmark suite19 version 0.9.4 .
For a detailed description of these benchmarks see STAMP.30
Baseline Performance .
In Figure 2 we present a performance comparison of three STMs : the IBM , 31,34 Intel , 14 and Sun's TL27 STMs .
The runs are on a quad - core , two - way hyperthreaded Intel Xeon 2.3GHz box running Linux Fedora Core 6 .
In these runs , we used the manually instrumented versions of the codes that aggressively minimize the number of barriers for the IBM and TL2 STMs .
Since we do not have access to low - level APIs for the Intel STM , the curves for the Intel STM are from codes instrumented by its compiler , which incur additional barrier overheads due to compiler instrumentation .
36
The graphs are scalability curves with respect to the serial , non-transactionalized version .
Therefore a value of 1 on the y - axis represents performance equal to the serial version .
The performance of these STMs is mostly on par , with the IBM STM showing better scalability on delaunay and TL2 obtaining better scalability on genome .
However , the overall performance obtained is very low : on kmeans the IBM STM barely attains single thread performance at 4 threads , while on vacation none of the STMs actually overcome the overhead of transactional memory even with 8 threads .
Compiler Instrumentation .
The compiler is a necessary component of an STM - based programming environment that is to be adopted by mass programmers .
Its basic role is to eliminate the need for programmers to manually instrument memory references to STM read - and write - barriers .
While offering convenience , compiler instrumentation does add another layer of overheads to the STM system by introducing redundant barriers , often due to conservativeness of compiler analysis , as also observed in Yoo .36
Figure 3 provides another baseline : the overhead of compiler instrumentation .
The performance is measured on a 16 - way POWER5 running AIX 5.3 .
For the STMXLC curve , we use the un-instrumented versions of the codes and annotate transactional regions and functions using the language extensions provided by the compiler .
31
Compiler over - instrumentation is more pronounced in traditional , unmanaged languages , such as C and C++ , where a compiler instrumentation without interprocedural analysis may end up instrumenting every memory reference in the transactional region ( except for stack accesses ) .
Indeed , our compiler instrumentation more than doubled the number of dynamic read barriers in delaunay , genome , and kmeans .
Interprocedural analysis can help improve the tightness of compiler instrumentation for some cases , but is generally limited by the accuracy of global analysis .
STM Operations Performance .
Given this baseline , we now analyze in detail which operations in the STM cause the overhead .
For this purpose , we use a cycle - accurate simulator of the PowerPC architecture that provides hooks for instrumentation .
The STM operations and suboperations are instrumented with these simulator hooks .
The reason for this environment is that we want to capture the overheads at instruction level and eliminate any other non-determinism introduced by real hardware .
The simulator eliminates all other bookkeeping operations introduced by instrumentation and provides an accurate breakdown of the STM overheads .
We study the performance of two STM algorithms : one that fully validates ( " fv " ) the read set after each transactional read and one that uses a global version number ( " gv# " ) to avoid the full validation , while maintaining the correctness of the operations .
The fv algorithm provides more concurrency at a much higher price .
The gv# is deemed as one of the best trade - offs for STM implementations .
Figure 4 presents the single - threaded overhead of these algorithms over sequential runs , illustrating again the substantial slowdowns that the algorithms induce .
Figure 5 breaks down these overheads into the various STM components .
For both algorithms , the overhead of transactional reads dominates due to the frequency of read operations relative to all other operations .
The effectiveness of the global version number in reducing overheads is shown in the lower read overhead of " gv# . "
Figure 6 gives a fine - grain breakdown of the overheads of the transactional read operation .
As expected , the overhead of validating the read set dominates transactional read time in the " fv " configuration .
For both algorithms , the isync operations ( necessary for ordering the metadata read and data read as well as the data read and validation ) form a substantial component .
In applications that perform writes before reads in the same transaction ( delaunay , kmeans ) , the time spent checking whether a location has been written by prior writes in the same transaction forms a significant component of the total time .
Interestingly , reading the data itself is a negligible amount of the total time , indicating the hurdles that must be overcome for the performance of these algorithms to be compelling .
Figure 7 gives a similar breakdown of the transactional commit operation .
As before , the " fv " configuration suffers from having to validate the read set .
Other dominant overheads for both configurations are that of having to acquire the metadata for the write set ( which involves a sequence of load - linked / store - conditional operations ) and the sync operations that are necessary for ordering the metadata acquires , data writes , and metadata releases .
Once again , the data writes themselves form a small component of the total time .
Overhead Optimizations .
There have been many proposals on reducing STM overheads through compiler or runtime techniques , most of which are complementary to STM hardware acceleration .
Redundant barrier elimination .
One technique is to eliminate barriers to thread - local objects through escape analysis .
Such analysis is typically quite effective identifing thread - local accesses that are close to the object allocation site .
It can eliminate both read - and write - barriers , but is often more effective on write - barriers .
For example , we observe that an intra-procedural escape analysis can eliminate 4050 % of write barriers in vacation , genome , and b+tree .
However , its impact on performance is more limited : from negligible to 12 % .
To target redundant read - barriers , a whole - program analysis called Not -Accessed - In- Transaction analysis 27 eliminates some barriers to read - only objects in transactions ;

Code generation optimizations .
One common technique is to inline the fast path of barriers .
It has the potential benefit of reducing function call overhead , increasing ILP , and exposing reuse of common sub - barrier operations .
In our experiments , compiler inlining achieved less than 2 % overall improvement across our benchmark suite ;

Eliminating unnecessary global version number updates37 improves the overall performance of several micro-benchmarks by up to 14 % .
Such optimizations have a positive impact on STM performance .
However , the results presented here indicate how much further innovation is needed for the performance of STMs to become generally appealing to users .
Related Work
The first STM system was proposed by Shavit and Touitou26 and is based on object ownership .
The protocol is static , which is a significant shortcoming that has been overcome by subsequently proposed STM systems .
7
Conflict detection is simplified significantly by the static nature because conflicts can be ruled out already when ownership records are acquired ( at transaction start ) .
DSTM12 is the first dynamic STM system ; the design follows a per-object runtime organization ( locator object ) .
Variables ( objects ) in the application heap refer to a locator object .
Unlike in a design with ownership records ( for example , Harris and Fraser10 ) , the locator does not store aversion number but refers to the most recently committed version of the object .
A particularity of the DSTM design is that objects must be explicitly ' opened ' ( in read - only or read - write mode ) before transactional access ; also DSTM allows for early release .
The authors argue that both mechanisms facilitate the reduction of conflicts .
The design principles of the RSTM18 system are similar to DSTM in that it associates transactional metadata with objects .
Unlike DSTM however , the system does not require the dynamic allocation of transactional data but co-locates it with the non-transactional data .
This scheme has two benefits : first , it facilitates spatial access locality and hence fosters execution performance and transaction throughput .
Second , the dynamic memory management of transactional data ( usually done through a garbage collector ) is not necessary and hence this scheme is amenable for use in environments where memory management is explicit .
Recent work explored algorithmic optimizations and / or alternative implementations of the basic STM algorithms described here .
Riegel et al. propose the use of real - time clocks to enhance the STM scalability using a global version number .
22 JudoSTM21 and RingSTM29 reduce the number of atomic operations that must be performed when committing a transaction at the cost of serializing commit and / or incurring spurious aborts due to imprecise conflict detection .
Several proposals have been made for STMs that operate via dynamic binary rewriting in order to allow the usage of STM on legacy binaries .
8,21,33
Yoo et. al36 analyze the overhead in the execution of Intel 's STM .
14,23
They identify four major sources of overhead : over - instrumentation , false sharing , amortization costs , and privatization - safety costs .
False sharing , privatization - safety , and over - instrumentation are implementation artifacts that can be eliminated by either using finer granularity bookkeeping , more refined analysis , or user annotations .
Amortization costs are inherent overheads in an STM that , as we demonstrated here , are not likely to be eliminated .
A large amount of research effort has been spent in analyzing the operations in TM systems .
Recent software optimizations have managed to accelerate STM performance by 2%15 % .
We believe such analysis is a good practice that should be extended to every piece of system software , especially open source .
However , the gains are only a minor dent in the overheads we observed , indicating the challenge that lies before the community in making STM performance compelling .
Conclusion
Based on our results , we believe that the road ahead for STM is quite challenging .
Lowering the overheads of STM to a point where it is generally appealing is a difficult task and significantly better results have to be demonstrated .
If we could stress a single direction for further research , it is the elimination of dynamically unnecessary read and write barriers possibly the single most powerful lever toward further reduction of STM overheads .
However , given the difficulty of similar problems explored by the research community such as alias analysis , escape analysis , and so on , this may be an uphill battle .
And because the argument for TM hinges upon its simplicity and productivity benefits , we are deeply skeptical of any proposed solutions to performance problems that require extra work by the programmer .
We observed that the TM programming model itself , whether implemented in hardware or software , introduces complexities that limit the expected productivity gains , thus reducing the current incentive for migration to transactional programming , and the justification at present for anything more than a small amount of hardware support .

Adam Morrison - Scaling Synchronization in Multicore Programs
Designing software for modern multicore processors poses a dilemma .
Traditional software designs , in which threads manipulate shared data , have limited scalability because synchronization of updates to shared data serializes threads and limits parallelism .
Alternative distributed software designs , in which threads do not share mutable data , eliminate synchronization and offer better scalability .
But distributed designs make it challenging to implement features that shared data structures naturally provide , such as dynamic load balancing and strong consistency guarantees , and are simply not a good fit for every program .
Often , however , the performance of shared mutable data structures is limited by the synchronization methods in use today , whether lock - based or lock - free .
Fabien Gaud , Baptiste Lepers , Justin Funston , Mohammad Dashti , Alexandra Fedorova , Vivien Quéma , Renaud Lachaize , Mark Roth - Challenges of Memory Management on Modern NUMA System
Modern server - class systems are typically built as several multicore chips put together in a single system .
Each chip has a local DRAM ( dynamic random - access memory ) module ; together they are referred to as a node .
Nodes are connected via a high - speed interconnect , and the system is fully coherent .
This means that , transparently to the programmer , a core can issue requests to its node ’s local memory as well as to the memories of other nodes .
The key distinction is that remote requests will take longer , because they are subject to longer wire delays and may have to jump several hops as they traverse the interconnect .
Spencer Rathbun - Parallel Processing with Promises
In today ’s world , there are many reasons to write concurrent software .
The desire to improve performance and increase throughput has led to many different asynchronous techniques .
The techniques involved , however , are generally complex and the source of many subtle bugs , especially if they require shared mutable state .
If shared state is not required , then these problems can be solved with a better abstraction called promises .
These allow programmers to hook asynchronous function calls together , waiting for each to return success or failure before running the next appropriate function in the chain .
Davidlohr Bueso - Scalability Techniques for Practical Synchronization Primitives
In an ideal world , applications are expected to scale automatically when executed on increasingly larger systems .
In practice , however , not only does this scaling not occur , but it is common to see performance actually worsen on those larger systems .

We ’ve been able to drop the world of 32 bit for a while now , with 64 bit processors and support for them being prevalent in all popular , modern operating systems .
However , where Mac OS X and Linux seem to make the move to 64bit rather effortlessly , Windows has more problems .
Even though 32 bit applications should run fine on 64bit Windows , some do n’t ; and to make matters worse , drivers need to be 64bit , as there ’s no support for 32 bit drivers in 64bit versions of Windows .
Still , Gizmodo claims that with Windows 7 , the time is right to take the plunge .
But really , is it so ?
And why do Linux and Mac OS X seem to handle the transition so much easier ?
The biggest problem with 64bit Windows is that kernel - mode drivers need to be 64bit as well .
While newer hardware usually has 64bit drivers , hardware that is slightly older usually does not , and this is where the problems start : your favourite piece of hardware simply wo n’t work .
User - mode drivers can be 32 bit , by the way .
Mac OS
X circumvents this issue by running the kernel in 32 bit , allowing 32 bit drivers to run without any problems ( the kernel in Snow Leopard is supposed to be 64 bit ) .
The userland applications run in 64 bit , however , so users still get many of all the benefits .
The Linux situation is different ; here , the advantage of portability and open source come into play : drivers are simply recompiled to support 64 bit .
The second problem is 32 bit applications .
While 64bit Windows is perfectly capable of running 32 bit applications , you might still encounter problems , which can be quite annoying .
Especially if you rely on certain applications , its 64 bit support is something you should take into account .
Mac OS
X has all of its important frameworks in 64bit ( Cocoa , Quartz , OpenGL , X11 ) , and thanks to the concept of fat binaries , you really need n’t worry about what version you download .
In the Linux world the transition to 64 bit once again benefits from the open nature of the operating system and its tools .
While open source may have its downsides , there is no denying that in this case , its strength is pretty obvious .
According to Gizmodo , the time is right to move to 64bit with Windows 7 .
I personally faced this choice with my new computer , but I decided to stick to 32 bit for now when it comes to Windows because I ’m not that much of a performance junkie ( I do n’t think Miranda really benefits from 64 bit ) , and I did n’t want to be bothered with its potential problems .
So my question to you is : have you ever faced this choice ?
What were your arguments to go one way or the other ?
What are your experiences running 64 bit Windows or any other 64bit operating system ?
What major applications or hardware parts failed for you ?

Maven Workforce has been advising clients globally on matters involving Talent Acquisition and Staffing .
The government has revealed plans for a new maths GCSE to become available in 2010 , as well as a pair of twinned maths GCSEs to be introduced in 2015 — over ten years after their recommendation by Adrian Smith in his Making mathematics count report .
The twinned GCSEs are designed to give students a broader grounding in mathematics , with one GCSE , dubbed " formal mathematics " focusing on the rigorous and coherent nature of mathematics , and the other , entitled " contextual mathematics " focusing on the application of mathematics in real life .
Both GCSEs are intended to be qualifications in their own right , which students study for in two separate two - year courses .
The idea is that the majority of students will study for both GCSEs , and that those who obtain both qualifications will be well equipped for further study of maths .
It is hoped that the twin set - up will provide more challenge for able students , while more fairly rewarding those at the lower end of the ability spectrum .
It is also hoped that the new GCSEs will move students away from the parrot approach to learning maths , which focuses on regurgitation rather than understanding .
The Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education ( ACME ) , which helped devise the new GCSEs together with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority ( QCA ) , has welcomed the government 's announcements , but criticised the time scale .
" We are puzzled at the proposed time scales for rolling out the pair , " said Dame Julia Higgins FRS , Chair of ACME , " To wait until 2015 for first teaching , with first awards being nine years from now is simply too protracted .
Efforts must focus on bringing forward the date for rollout of the pair " .
Dame Julia also criticised the introduction of the new single GCSE , expressing fears that it will undermine the double option while not delivering its benefits .
Adrian Smith 's 2004 report delivered a damning verdict on the state of mathematics education in the UK , and predicted that a shortage of maths skills in the work force could have dire consequences for the UK economy .
Commenting on the impact of the GCSE time scale , Dame Julia said : " The UK economy will face the consequences of millions of students over the next nine years sitting a single GCSE which will not deliver the deeper understanding of mathematics and its applications that is desperately required " .
ACME 's concerns , as well as its welcome of the new twin option , were endorsed by the two main mathematics bodies in the UK , the London Mathematical Society and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications .
Mr Miller had suffered a stroke following his heart attack in October A 78 - year - old man from Accrington collapsed and died from a heart attack after being taken to a cash machine by a bailiff to pay a £ 60 speeding fine .
Retired pub landlord Andy Miller had only been released from hospital a fortnight before following an earlier heart attack in October .
Mr Miller 's family said they had told the Lancashire magistrates who ordered the bailiffs about his health problems .
Justice Minister Jack Straw has ordered an inquiry into Mr Miller 's death .
The bailiff called at his house in India Street on 7 January and persuaded him to get into his car and go to Accrington town centre .
The father - of - five collapsed on his way to a cash machine while the bailiff parked and waited for the money .
' Under duress '
The death is not being treated as suspicious .
His son , Mick , 48 , from Lower Darwen , Blackburn , said : " We made countless phone calls and sent numerous letters to the court to tell them about dad 's stay in hospital .
" The bailiff called at his house and said he had to make a payment , otherwise they would bring a delivery van and locksmith .
He said they would get into the property and take goods and there was nothing he could do about it .
Why did n't the court service take into account that Mr Miller was in poor health ?
Greg Pope , Hyndburn MP
" My father then agreed to be driven to get some cash .
I believe he was put under duress .
We just want some answers as to why the bailiffs were called in . "
The pensioner spent 10 days in a coma when he suffered a stroke following his heart attack at the Blackburn Rovers football ground , Ewood Park , on 25 October .
He left hospital just before Christmas to spend time with his family .
Magistrates in Blackpool gave permission for the bailiffs to collect the debt , which included £ 300 costs which arose from the speeding offence committed on the M55 motorway .
Hyndburn MP Greg Pope referred the case to Mr Straw who has ordered an investigation .
' Our condolences ' Mr Pope said : " There are many things about this case which require an answer .
Why did n't the court service take into account that Mr Miller was in poor health ?
" There needs to be some sort of answer to that question and I hope the court service will come forward and do that . "
A spokesman for Her Majesty 's Courts Service said : " We offer our condolences to Mr Miller 's family .
" At the request of the local MP , Greg Pope , we will conduct an investigation into the circumstances around this and will report back to the family and MP . "

I was home one day last week with a cold .
The best course of treatment for me was an empty house and quality couch time with my cat and HGTV .
I noticed several commercials for the new natural zero - calorie sweetener , Truvia , which is derived from the stevia plant .
What caught my attention in one of the spots , though , was the phrase , “ from a miracle of nature , not chemistry . ”
I readily admit that I am not a chemist , but I do know it takes chemistry to get from leaf to crystal .
Now , I realize the ad was likely targeting the artificial sweeteners , such as aspartame , and maybe I ’m a little sensitive to the recent uses of chemistry in ads ( like Burt ’s Bees , HFCS , and soup wars ) , but perhaps the Truvia ad makers should take a lesson from the Splenda folk and call things as they are before trouble comes a steepin ’ .
And , more importantly , chemistry is not a bad thing , people .

Buzz has a whole new meaning now that scientists are giving bees cocaine .
To learn more about the biochemistry of addiction , scientists in Australia dropped liquefied freebase cocaine on bees ’ backs , so it entered the circulatory system and brain .
The scientists found that bees react much like humans do : cocaine alters their judgment , stimulates their behavior and makes them exaggeratedly enthusiastic about things that might not otherwise excite them .
What ’s more , bees exhibit withdrawal symptoms .
When a coked - up bee has to stop cold turkey , its score on a standard test of bee performance ( learning to associate an odor with sugary syrup ) plummets .
“ What we have in the bee is a wonderfully simple system to see how brains react to a drug of abuse , ” said Andrew B. Barron , a senior lecturer at Macquarie University in Australia and a co-leader in the bees - on - cocaine studies .
“ It may be that when we know that , we ’ll be able to stop a brain reacting to a drug of abuse , and then we may be able to discover new ways to prevent abuse in humans . ”
A well - planned sports video game licensing agreement can be a great thing ; such arrangements have given us classics like the Madden football series , NBA Jam , and , to a lesser extent , Bassin 's Black Bass with Hank Parker .
On the other hand , poorly thought - out games just look like embarrassing cash -ins for their celebrity endorsers .
Obviously all video games can't be great , but here are a few notably terrible sports licensing misadventures :
1. Michael Jordan : Chaos in the Windy City
In the mid-1990s , Michael Jordan was the world 's biggest basketball star , an almost universally beloved pitchman who could bask in the glory of multiple NBA titles .
It seemed only natural , then , that he would have his own licensed game for the Super Nintendo .
What seemed far less natural was that the game would n't involve basketball .
Michael Jordan : Chaos in the Windy City is a two - dimensional platform outing like any generic adventure game of the era .
The plot follows Jordan as he tries to rescue his friends so they can play with him in a charity all - star game .
Air Jordan has to navigate levels and collect keys to extricate his buddies while armed with little more than " “ wait for it " “ weapons - grade basketballs !
His Airness is equipped with all manner of balls : ones made of ice , grenade balls , homing balls , and boomerang balls .
It 's worth finding a ROM of this gem just to see how blatant the cash - grab was ; it even made Nintendo Power 's list of the top 10 worst games of all time .
See for yourself :
2. Shaq Fu
To be fair , Jordan was n't the only huge NBA star of the mid-90s to fall prey to the allure of video game immortality .
Shaquille O'Neal also made the jump to 16 - bit systems and handhelds with a game of his own .
Like Jordan 's romp , Shaq eschewed basketball action .
Instead , Shaq made a Mortal Kombat - style fighting game that shared its title with his second rap record , the gold - certified Shaq - Fu : Da Return .
In the game , Shaq is on his way to a charity basketball tournament ( you think he'd have learned his lesson from Jordan 's misadventures playing basketball for free ) when he gets pulled into an alternate dimension .
At this point , Shaq is talked into saving a kidnapped young boy from an evil mummy by fighting off a series of opponents while clad in a generic - looking basketball jersey .
Really .
The gameplay was even worse than the incoherent plot ; the game often did n't give players credit for scoring obvious hits .
Like Jordan 's pixilated adventure , Shaq
Fu frequently shows up on lists of the worst video games of all time .
Sound unfathomable ?

3. Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager
By 1989 , Kenny Dalglish 's legendary soccer career was winding down .
The high - scoring forward was 38 years old , and he was n't as quick as he'd been earlier in his career .
He was , however , showing his stuff as an effective player - manager , a position he'd held with Liverpool since 1985 .
Such a popular figure in British football seemed like a natural licensor for a soccer game for the Atari and Commodore 64 .
And thus , Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager was born .
Young fans across the U.K. doubtless sat down in front of their TVs to square off in some hot pitch action " ¦and learned that there 's no actual soccer in the game .
Players take over a 4th - division team and make roster moves and set the players ' formations , then the computer tells them whether or not their team won a game .
Who needs to take penalty kicks when you can consult with the team physician on an injury ?
Diving headers are no fun compared to viewing scouting reports !
Perhaps something 's just lost on my American sensibility , though , as soccer manager games kept coming out for various systems , including Kevin Keegan 's Player Manager for SNES in 1993 .
4. Bill Laimbeer 's Combat Basketball
When basketball fans think of Bill Laimbeer , they think of one thing : his legendary coaching career that 's seen him win three WNBA titles .
Oh , wait .
They think of his rough - and - tumble antics as a four - time NBA All - Star and two - time NBA champion with the " Bad Boy "  Detroit Pistons .
Since Laimbeer had a reputation as one of the NBA 's premier tough guys , it seemed sensible that he would be the star of a hybrid hoops / combat game .
However , that 's the only remotely plausible element of this setup .
The game is based in the year 2030 , where basketball is the exclusive province of robotic players with one human exception : player - commissioner Bill Laimbeer , who can still play at age 73 thanks to medical advances .
The result is a no-rules brand of basketball where armored players can duke it out just as easily as they can shoot jumpers and bombs occasionally appear on the court .
Critics decried the game 's simplistic gameplay and inane storyline , but this video will let you be the judge :
5. Kurt Warner 's Arena Football Unleashed
You could n't turn on an NFL broadcast during the 1999 season without hearing about the incredible story of Kurt Warner , who had rapidly risen from a former grocery stocker / Arena Football League QB to the NFL's MVP and Super Bowl champion .
As such , it was time for a quick video game cash - in .
The next May , fans got their wish , as the QB licensed his name to a violent arena football game .
Just as some fans think of the Arena Football League as a watered - down version of the NFL , this game proved to be a diminished version of another much more popular franchise , NFL Blitz .
Like in Blitz , players could stomp , kick , and generally maim each other both before and after the whistle , but the game did n't catch on with fans .
With Warner 's resurgence this season , though , we can always cross our fingers for a hastily produced sequel .
Interphone researchers are conducting the largest - ever study investigating if cellphones cause cancer , examining studies from 6,400 tumors in patients from 13 countries .
Final results are expected in early 2009 , but the preliminary ones are badbadbad .

Israeli researchers in the study found that regular cellphones users are a whopping 50 percent more likely than non-users to get brain tumors .
Another Interphone study looking at the UK and Scandinavia found a 40 percent greater tumor risk in people who 've used cellphones for over 10 years , though on the bright side , nothing scary for people who 've used them for less than a decade .
The final results of Interphone 's study are highly anticipated as the first study to provide close to a definitive answer on the cellphone cancer question , since as PopSci notes , most of the other studies " have been statistically useless , " since they did n't survey enough people and looked at too many that had less than 10 years of cellphone use under the belt , which is how long it takes brain cancer to develop " in most cases . "

PopSci's assessment of the gravity of the situation is close to spot - on — definitive proof that cellphones cause cancer would probably be the along the same lines as discovering that tobacco causes cancer , but you know , huger , since almost everyone uses a cellphone , from pre-schoolers to grandmas .
I guess it 's a good thing I rarely use my iPhone for talking .
How would you react if cellphones definitely caused cancer ?

Now here ’s a news item that I ’m pretty sure you have n’t heard about unless you work in or near a laboratory .
We ’re in the middle of an extreme shortage of acetonitrile , a common solvent .
This has been going on since back in the fall , but instead of gradually getting better , it ’s been gradually getting worse : major suppliers are sending out letters like this one ( PDF ) .
What ’s the stuff good for ?
Well , it ’s used on a manufacturing scale in some processes , so they ’re in trouble for sure .
Acetonitrile is a good solvent , since it ’s fairly powerful at dissolving things but still reasonable low - boiling .
( That ’s the nitrile functional group for you ; there ’s nothing else quite like it ) .
It ’s no DMSO , but then again , DMSO ’s boiling point is three times a lot higher , and compared to acetonitrile it pours like pancake syrup .
Nobody does industrial - scale chemistry in DMSO if they can possibly help it .
Those properties mean that acetonitrile / water mixtures are ubiquitous in analytical and prep-sized chromatography systems .
This is surely its most widespread use , and is causing the most widespread consternation as the shortage becomes more acute .
Many people are switching to methanol / water , which usually works , but can be a bit jumpier .
But that ’s not always an option .
Labs working under regulatory - agency controls ( GLP / GMP ) have a very hard time changing analytical methods without triggering a blizzard of paperwork and major delays .
In many companies , it ’s those people who are first in line for what acetonitrile may turn up .
So why are we going dry on the stuff ?
There seem to be several reasons , one of which , interestingly , is the summer Olympics .
The industrial production that the Chinese government shut down to improve Beijing ’s air quality seems to have included a disproportionate amount of the country ’s acetonitrile production ( for example ) .
A US facility on the Gulf Coast was shut down during Hurricane Ike as well .
But on top of these acute reasons , there ’s a secular one : yep , the global economic slowdown .
A lot of acetonitrile comes as a byproduct of acrylonitrile production , which is used in a lot of industrial resins and plastics .
Those go into making car parts , electronic housings , all sorts of things that are piling up in inventory and thus not being turned out at the rates of a year ago .
So taken together , there ’s not much acetonitrile to be had out there .
We ’ve seen some glitches like this in the past , naturally , since chemical production can depend on a limited number of plants and on raw material prices .
When I was an undergraduate , I remember professors complaining aboiut the price of silver reagents during the attempted Hunt brothers corner of that market , for example .
But this one will definitely be near the top of the list , and it could be months before the Great Acetonitrile Drought lifts .
If you ’ve been saving some in your basement , it ’s time to break it out .

The White House has revealed that former Australian prime minister John Howard is one of the reasons US president - elect Barack Obama is living in a Washington hotel before his inauguration .
Mr Obama had asked if his family could move into the presidential guesthouse , called Blair House , early so that his daughters could start school this week .
But the White House told him it was booked for official functions and guests until just days before he is due to be sworn in .
Now a spokeswoman for First Lady Laura Bush has confirmed that Mr Howard will be spending at least one night there .
Mr Howard will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W Bush next week .
Former British prime minister Tony Blair is also getting the medal , but he has declined an invitation to stay at Blair House .
The holidays between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 have n’t been particularly pleasant for RIAA and the music majors : the America most hated organization ( at least as of Internet ) is ( supposedly ) about to change its legal strategy against file sharing by directly engaging providers , but meanwhile one of these ISP raises a monetary issue that does not promise an easy start for the bizarre joint venture between copyright owners and connectivity providers .
Jerry Scroggin , owner of the small ISP Bayou Internet and Communications in Louisiana , has already notified the industry that he has no intention to place his company ’s time and resources at label ’s disposal .
Or at least he does not want to do so without compensation : “ They have the right to protect their songs or music or pictures “ , the entrepreneur says , “ but they do n’t have the right to tell me I have to be the one protecting it .
I do n’t want anyone doing anything illegal on my network , but we do n’t work for free “ .
Bayou provides 12,000 connections , and to each one correspond a customer which pays 40 dollars per month for a total of 1,440 dollars within three years .
According to Scroggin it ’s unreasonable that RIAA pretend his company easily give up to such money for an alleged copyright infringement , and if the association really wants to engage the ISPs then it must be ready to open its wallet and directly contribute to the operation costs .
The provider has already received , in the past , requests of enforcement by the industry , and each time Scroggin has replied in an almost mocking manner asking for a proper contract , in which the technicians ’ work required to verify the alleged infringements would meet a proper amount of money for the inconvenience .
“ Usually “ , Scroggin says , after having sent the request “ I never hear back “ .
Maybe it ’s too early to draw conclusions , and it ’s almost certain that before announcing to the world the historic switch of its legal strategy RIAA have been in talks with ISPs way more notable than the small Bayou .
But there ’s a thing worth highlighting : the States connectivity market is full of local providers that must simultaneously face the ruthless competition from the AT&T of the situation and a pretty thin budget , hence if the majors wo n’t accept the ISP needs on their whole by supporting ( and not only with thin air ) the declared sharer - hunting the American - flavored Sarkozy doctrine will not have a very long life .
The bad news for RIAA are n’t however limited to providers ’ monetary ostracism : the appeal requested by the majors in the Capitol v. Thomas case , the only P2P trial ever held in the USA courts , has been denied by District Judge Michael J. Davis just after Christmas because there is “ no substantial ground for a difference of opinion ” on the opportunity issue raised by RIAA , nor an eventual appeal would “ materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation “ .
The majors will then be obliged to return back to the courtroom after the judge has rejected his own previous judgement , thanks to which RIAA had won and Mrs. Jammie Thomas was sentenced to pay up a fine of 222,000 dollars for 24 ( alleged ) shared tracks .
According to judge Davis the court “ must still address the constitutionality of the damages award ” granted to the plaintiffs , an award already defined as “ wholly disproportionate ” to the alleged damages suffered by the RIAA members .
Thanks to the always accurate work of the lawyer - blogger Ray Beckerman , furthermore , the complete transcription of the Thomas trail records is now available on - line .
It is a 643 pages - long tome divided in three parts , full of extremely interesting details for those who want to inspect the technical procedures followed by the RIAA inquirers , the experts ’ testimonies and anything else related to the trial .
RIAA ’s 2009 is n’t starting well also for the SONY BMG Music v. Tenenbaum case , in which the Harvard professor Charles Nesson has come to university downloader Joel Tenenbaum defense claiming charges of unconstitutionality , fraud and conspiracy towards RIAA .
Nesson has asked the court to make available on - line the trial ’s complete audio- visual report , so exposing to public judgement the alleged “ campaign to educate ” the users carried forward by the majors with the unsuccessful legal crusade leaded until now .
As a partial confirm of the legal crusade dismission , anyway , from The Wall Street Journal comes the news according to which RIAA would have ditched its usual partner for spying investigatory operations against file sharing users , that MediaSentry ( subsidiary of SafeNet Inc ) over and over accused of having done illegal investigations on - line on behalf of the majors .
According to Beckerman the relationship break between RIAA and MediaSentry is a “ victory ” for his clients ( and not only ) against the muddy work of the industry ’s detectives , liable for having been “ invading the privacy of people “ .
With MediaSentry dismissed , the labels ’ organization will turn to Copenaghen - based DtecNet Software company for its forensic needs .

MOSCOW --
With the Kremlin walls and domes of St. Basil 's Cathedral as backdrops , an international squad led by Jaromir Jagr defeated an all - Russian team 7 - 6 in the Continental Hockey League 's All - Star game on a bitterly cold Saturday night in Red Square .
With Moscow 's Red Square landmarks as a backdroup , the KHL played its All - Star Game outside in bitter cold on Saturday night .

Slovakia 's Marcel Hossa scored three goals while goaltender Robert Esche and former Ottawa Senator Ray Emery provided strong play for the winners .
The Russian team featured former NHL star in Alexei Yashin .
Temperatures plunged to 3 degrees , with spectators shivering in the grandstands at the open - air rink in the heart of the Russian capital .
The game was designed as a showcase for the Russian league known as the KHL .
" The [ baseball ]
All - Star game in Yankee Stadium is special , and the Russians want to do something special , too , " Jagr said before the game .
Jagr and Yashin are the most prominent former NHL players who have been lured by KHL teams flush with money from Russia 's eight - year , oil - fueled economic boom .
The game was broadcast on a major television network in the country .
Russian hockey officials hope it will boost league during the global financial crisis , which is hitting companies sponsoring Russian sports teams .
" For now , we are looking to the future with optimism , " KHL managing director Vladimir Shalayev said .
He called the league 's financial situation " quite stable . "
The KHL was rocked in October by the death of 19 - year - old New York Rangers prospect Alexei Cherepanov , Jagr 's teammate at Avangard Omsk .
He collapsed on the bench next to Jagr during a game at an arena outside Moscow .
Jagr , a former NHL MVP , joined the Siberian team Avangard Omsk last year .
The one - time star for the Washington Capitals , Pittsburgh Penguins and Rangers said he was 6 or 7 when he last played outdoors , at home in the Czech Republic .
Yashin thanked the roughly 2,500 spectators who nearly filled the grandstand , roaring for a Russian victory .
" To be on Red Square when it is so cold -- that means they love hockey , " he said .
" It means Russian hockey is alive , and that 's the most important thing . "
Yashin was a top draft pick in 1992 and moved from Ottawa to the New York Islanders in 2001 .
His final four seasons of his 10 - year contract were bought out by the Islanders in 2007 .
He is in his second season in the Russian league , where he plays for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl .
Jagr is a nine - time NHL All - Star who had 646 goals and 1,599 points -- the most by a European - born player -- in 17 seasons .
He had hoped for a high - scoring game Saturday for the sake of the fans -- and he got it .
Hossa , who plays for Latvia 's Dinamo Riga , opened the scoring in the first period , and his second goal gave the international team a 4 - 2 lead with less than five minutes left in the second period .
The Russians came back with two goals before the period was over , including one from CSKA Moscow 's Oleg Saprykin with just more than a second left .
In the third , Saprykin scored again to put the Russians ahead for the first time , but Jagr 's countryman Jan Marek of Metallurg Magnitogorsk made it 5 - 5 on a penalty shot and the teams traded goals again before Hossa beat Russian goalkeeper Konstantin Barulin with just more than a minute left in the game .
Also scoring were Denis Kulyash , Alexander Radulov and Sergei Mozyakin with two goals for the Russians .
For the international team , former Capitals defenseman Ben Clymer , Jaroslav Kudrna and Pavel Brendl added goals .
For anyone who does n’t know , the Wiley publishing company purchased CPAexcel a number of years ago because it was rapidly growing into the most widely used CPA exam review course in the US .
This was a great partnership because Wiley publishing has a long history of creating great CPA and other accounting education materials from study courses to actual college text books .
This merger allowed Wiley to branch out in the certified public accountant study course industry and it gave the CPAexcel company the backing it needed to expand into something every larger .
It ’s pretty obvious what makes these two companies so awesome .
They both produce great products that actually help people achieve what they want to achieve in life .
Passing the CPA exam is a huge deal and a big turning point in most accountants ’ lives .
Both of these companies have gotten together to come up with a partnership that makes sense .
Since Wiley bought out the CPA Excel program they have make a bunch of different changes .
They increased the budget for producing lecture videos and have even hired a new staff to research additional topics to put into their bite - sized learning segments .
Here is a video of what the inside of the new Wiley CPAexcel course looks like .
It ’s a pretty thorough guide that shows you everything aspect of the course including what you will get if you purchase one of their options .
After watching the tour of this review course , it ’s pretty easy to see why candidates are having so much success with a program like this .
Wiley has reinforced the weaknesses of the Wiley CPAexcel platform and turned it into a course that will work for just about anyone .
We highly recommend this course if you are planning to sit for the exam any time soon .

Film director Matt Norman speaks with WSWS
By Ismet Redzovic
20 January 2009
Filmmaker Matt Norman recently spoke with Ismet Redzovic about Salute , his documentary on Peter Norman , an Australian sprinter .
The film will be released this month on DVD .
Peter Norman 's sporting career was cut short after he publicly solidarised himself with medal - winning African American athletes John Carlos and Tommy Smith at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City .
( See " Salute : A moving tribute " ) .
Ismet Redzovic : How and when did the idea to make a movie about your uncle Peter Norman come about ?
Matt Norman : I 've always wanted to do a film about him .
I 'm actually more of a drama director than a documentary filmmaker and it was by accident that it became a documentary .
I started making the film in 2002 but was only really doing it in order get information to write a script .
I like to film my own work and I like to think ahead and to produce a " making of " DVD and so on .
I got the opportunity of having John Carlos , Tommy Smith and Peter in the same place at the same time , during the 2004 Olympic trials for the American team held in San Jose .
We shot interviews with every single person we could grab during a 1968 Olympic Games reunion and so the amount of footage , information and interviews we got was worth putting out as a film on its own .
We used digital cameras and I received no funding or any other help .
I got federal funding afterwards because it would have been too expensive to get digital camera to look good on a cinema screen and so it 's taken six years to get to this stage .
When Peter died in 2006 this gave me more of a want and need to tell his story .
So basically the story came about through research .
IR : You pay a lot of attention to the historical and political context of the 1968 Olympic Games .
Can you tell us why you felt it was important to show in your film that the act — the protest — was n't an accident but rather part of an international process ?
MN : Growing up with Peter and having a great relationship with him meant that I knew the story , but I 'd never heard it from Tommy and John .
I realised that in the US they 'd never heard John 's story , because John and Tommy do n't get along .
I wanted to build the story almost as a diary of what actually happened and see what I could bring to the story without making it Hollywood .
The whole idea of getting them together was because I did n't want the interviews to feel like interviews , but rather a relaxed chat .
I wanted to push the political side of 1968 because this was a horrific year for racism .
Many people have asked me how on earth could you do a film about one single framed photograph and drag it out to 90 minutes .
The truth is I had two - and - a - half hours in my original cut and considered making the film in two parts .
IR : Why do you think the Australian Olympic establishment carried out such a vendetta against Peter Norman and why was so little known about him ?
MN : In Australia we have a tall - poppy syndrome .
The reason for Peter not going to the 1972 Munich Olympic Games was because we lived in a racist country ourselves and it still is a racist country .
We just like to hide behind some ocker sayings [ Australian slang ] and things like that .
The reason why Peter was black - banned was because he stood up for something the Australian Olympic establishment did n't .
The community at large stood by Peter , but officials who ran the place did n't and as far as I 'm concerned they are the people who did n't invite him to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games in any official capacity , even though he was the record holder in 200 metres 40 years on .
I actually approached them to make a comment but no one responded .
IR : What do you think of the fact that in Australia , people like Steve Irwin are promoted in the media as heroes , but principled and courageous people like Peter Norman are not even talked about ?
MN : Peter died at the same time as Peter Brock and Steve Irwin .
Now I absolutely love what Steve Irwin did to conservation and animal rights but the issue with that is that he 's been hailed in highest regard , almost given a knighthood , if you like .
Peter Brock the same , yet he only drove a car around the mountain , albeit very well .
Peter Norman , on the other hand , holds a record that no one has come even close to breaking in 40 years , not only in Australia but in the Commonwealth also .
Yet I had to pay for his funeral .
The way the officials treated Norman was a joke .
The people , however , your average person , supported Peter tremendously .
They loved him .
IR : Unfortunately your uncle did n't live to see the movie , but what was the response of Tommie Smith and John Carlos , if they have seen it yet ?
MN : Tommy Smith and John Carlos still do n't talk to each other and they have n't seen the film yet .
After Peter 's death they went their own way .
It 's strange because I always believed Tommy , John and Peter were inseparable .
IR : How has the movie been received internationally ?
MN : Great !
It won an audience choice award at the Rhode Island Film Festival in Providence , Rhode Island .
We 've won countless audience choice awards .
People love it .
IR : What 's your next project ?
MN : Right now I 'm making a fictional film about 1968 .
I 'm shooting that in Mexico next year .
It 's going to be a dramatised version of Salute .
It 's actually not going to be about the Olympic Games but rather about what happened in 1968 from the perspective of a journalist .
New research strengthens the link between water pollution and rising male fertility problems .
The study , by Brunel University , the Universities of Exeter and Reading and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology , shows for the first time how a group of testosterone - blocking chemicals is finding its way into UK rivers , affecting wildlife and potentially humans .
The research was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and is now published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
The study identified a new group of chemicals that act as ‘ anti-androgens ’ .
This means that they inhibit the function of the male hormone , testosterone , reducing male fertility .
Some of these are contained in medicines , including cancer treatments , pharmaceutical treatments , and pesticides used in agriculture .
The research suggests that when they get into the water system , these chemicals may play a pivotal role in causing feminising effects in male fish .
Earlier research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter has shown how female sex hormones ( estrogens ) , and chemicals that mimic estrogens , are leading to ‘ feminisation ’ of male fish .
Found in some industrial chemicals and the contraceptive pill , they enter rivers via sewage treatment works .
This causes reproductive problems by reducing fish breeding capability and in some cases can lead to male fish changing sex .
Other studies have also suggested that there may be a link between this phenomenon and the increase in human male fertility problems caused by testicular dysgenesis syndrome .
Until now , this link lacked credence because the list of suspects causing effects in fish was limited to estrogenic chemicals whilst testicular dysgenesis is known to be caused by exposure to a range of anti-androgens .
Lead author on the research paper , Dr Susan Jobling at Brunel University ’s Institute for the Environment , said : “ We have been working intensively in this field for over ten years .
The new research findings illustrate the complexities in unravelling chemical causation of adverse health effects in wildlife populations and re-open the possibility of a human – wildlife connection in which effects seen in wild fish and in humans are caused by similar combinations of chemicals .
We have identified a new group of chemicals in our study on fish , but do not know where they are coming from .
A principal aim of our work is now to identify the source of these pollutants and work with regulators and relevant industry to test the effects of a mixture of these chemicals and the already known environmental estrogens and help protect environmental health . ”
Senior author Professor Charles Tyler of the University of Exeter said : ” Our research shows that a much wider range of chemicals than we previously thought is leading to hormone disruption in fish .
This means that the pollutants causing these problems are likely to be coming from a wide variety of sources .
Our findings also strengthen the argument for the cocktail of chemicals in our water leading to hormone disruption in fish , and contributing to the rise in male reproductive problems .
There are likely to be many reasons behind the rise in male fertility problems in humans , but these findings could reveal one , previously unknown , factor . ”
Bob Burn , Principal Statistician in the Statistical Services Centre at the University of Reading , said : ” State - of - the- art statistical hierarchical modelling has allowed us to explore the complex associations between the exposure and potential effects seen in over 1000 fish sampled from 30 rivers in various parts of England . ”
The research took more than three years to complete and was conducted by the University of Exeter , Brunel University , University of Reading and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology .
Statistical modelling was supported by Beyond the Basics Ltd .
The research team is now focusing on identifying the source of anti-androgenic chemicals , as well as continuing to study their impact on reproductive health in wildlife and humans .

Dear Cecil : I 'm afraid for my life .
All these years I 've been eating the seeds of fruit , such as apples , oranges , apricots , peaches , plums , etc .
I started when I began living with my grandfather , a dentist , about 10 years ago .
He said they were good for the teeth because of the minerals they contained .
Over the years I 've cultivated a taste for them , and was extremely delighted when I found I could buy them in quantities of a pound or more at health food stores .
Recently , however , a friend told me that all fruit seeds contained cyanide , and that he had read an item in a newspaper once about someone who had died from eating apple seeds !
I am especially concerned about apricot kernels , my favorite .
What 's a lethal dose ?
Can any be eaten safely ?
If so , about how many ?
I really like them and would be loath to give them up , but on the other hand I really do n't want to be slowly poisoning myself and my guests and roommates .
John T. , Phoenix
Cecil replies :
You ’ve got good reason to be afraid , pal .
Fruits of the rose family –including cherries , apples , plums , almonds , peaches , apricots , and crabapples –contain in their seeds substances known as cyanogenetic glycosides , which on ingestion release hydrogen cyanide gas through an enzymatic reaction .
They can most certainly do you in .
Since 1957 , Turkey–a big apricot country –has reported nine cases of lethal poisoning from apricot seeds .
Unfortunately , victims of such poisonings have a habit of kicking the bucket before doctors have a chance to ask them how many seeds they ’ve eaten ; in addition , the amount of amygdalin–the most important cyanogenetic glycoside–varies from species to species , and since the poisoning does not involve a direct transfer of cyanide from one place to another , “ lethal dosages ” of these various seeds are hard to pin down .
Use the following as guidelines : ( 1 ) bitter almonds contain by far the greatest amount of amygdalin , and it takes 50 - 70 of them to kill an adult , 7 - 10 to kill a child .
( 2 ) Ingestion of about a cupful of any of the above seeds is pushing things a bit .
If you ’ve been munching on seeds for years and have never felt any ill effects , you can safely continue to eat them in similar quantities without worrying .
Keep in mind , however , that one gluttonous binge will put you away forever .
Sub -lethal doses of cyanide gas are detoxified and passed out of the body rapidly , so it ’s impossible to slowly poison yourself over a period of time .
Symptoms of cyanide poisoning are excitement , convulsions , respiratory distress , and spasms .
Another warning sign is death , which can occur without any of the other symptoms .
All of this , by the way , applies only to fresh seeds .
Roasting the seeds will destroy the enzymes needed to produce the lethal reaction without appreciably affecting the mineral content of your munchies .
Note to shocked almond freaks : regular old almonds contain far less amygdalin than the bitter variety .

So far the G1 has only been available in the US and UK , but it looks like T - Mo 's about to take Android international -- we 're told the HTC - made handset will hit the Netherlands , Austria , and the Czech Republic on January 30 , Germany on February 2 , and Poland a bit later .
No detailed pricing information , but it 's confirmed that Germans will be able to score a G1 for just € 1 ( $ 1.33 ) with a two - year contract .
Hopefully we 'll see that pricing make its way Stateside soon -- although the G1 is currently doing quite well at $ 179 , $ 1 sounds even better . [ Via TalkAndroid

Because it just ai n't a world war without zombies
Some may recall this lovely footage released from Call of Duty : World at War ( WaW ) about Halloween time :
Upon beating the main campaign , this ' Nazi zombie mode ' is unlocked , featuring four player co-op whereby each wave of zombies are more difficult than the last .
For those wondering what the heck Nazi zombies were doing in their World War II game , the game 's publisher , Activision , has let loose on the what and why .
Executive producer Daniel Suarez , commenting :
“ It was one of the pet projects of one of the designers .
The seed of the idea came out of casual [ tower ] defense games online .
It was something that they [ developer Treyarch ] had been working on for a while and went back to when they had time . ”
“ Nazi Zombies was sort of this rumor , and everybody would be like , ‘ Nazi zombies ?
What Nazi zombies ?’
The designers would sort of chuckle in the back corner and be like , ‘ I do n’t know what that is . ’
And then one day it all of a sudden appeared in a build and it got so much traction internally . ”
“ All of the QA guys , the marketing guys , even the PR guys became big fans .
So we decided to save it and announce it [ the week of Halloween on GameTrailers ] .
It was a project of love that a lot of guys had a hand in . ”
Nothing against shooting Nazi zombies or anything , but it does make the game 's sensitive footage and serious approach harder to accept on those grounds .
I 'd never be one to say it should be removed or anything like that , but what do you think ?
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The man who , dressed as Santa Claus , killed nine people at a Christmas Eve party planned to flee to Canada the next day , but California police believe he decided to kill himself instead because of severe burn injuries .
Pardo rigged his rental car so that if someone tried to remove the Santa suit , the car would explode .

During a news conference on Friday , Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said Bruce Jeffrey Pardo had purchased a ticket for an early Christmas Day flight from Los Angeles to Canada .
Raney said that while police do not know why Pardo , 45 , decided against his plan to flee , they speculate it may have been due to the burn injuries Pardo received after setting fire to the home where the slayings occurred .
Pardo 's body was covered in third - degree burns , Raney said , and part of the Santa suit the gunman wore to the massacre burned and melted into his legs .
Police believe Pardo 's injuries came after he set fire to the home using a homemade device used to spread fuel .
Raney also said Pardo came to his former in - laws ' home with $ 17,000 strapped to his legs and inside a girdle , indicating he may have wanted quick access to his money as he fled the country .
Watch police talk about what was found on the gunman 's body »
Police said that after leaving the home , Pardo changed out of the Santa suit and into regular clothes .
Raney also spoke about a pipe bomb that exploded in Pardo 's rental car Thursday night .
He said Pardo had rigged the rental car so that if someone tried to remove the Santa suit , the car would explode .
The car was packed with ammunition and black powder , he said .
Police said that inside Pardo 's home in Montrose , California , they also found five empty boxes for semiautomatic handguns , two high - powered shotguns and " racing fuel , " which they believe was used to help set fire to the home .
Police also said they found Pardo 's resume , which said he had a bachelor 's and master 's degree in electrical engineering , but they could not verify if it was accurate .
The resume also indicated Pardo had worked in the aerospace field .
The news conference Friday came after officials said a ninth body was found in the rubble at the home .
Watch investigators at the burned - out home »
Police said about 25 people attended the holiday party where Pardo , dressed in a full Santa Claus outfit , came in the front door and then moved through the house , firing two semiautomatic handguns .
Covina police Friday released a recording of a chaotic 911 call .
Voices are heard on the recording yelling , " Stay away from the window ! " and pleading , " Please come immediately ... he 's shooting !
He 's shooting ! "
Later a voice gasps , " He 's left the house -- my mom 's house is on fire ! "
A distraught woman cries , " My daughter 's been shot !
She was shot in the face on the side , and she 's bleeding ! "
Police said Pardo brought four handguns to the home .
The first victim was an 8 - year - old girl who ran to the door after hearing a knock , police said .
She was shot in the face but survived .
" She has a very , very severe injury to her face .
It 's not life - threatening , but she 's got a very tough road ahead of her , " Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said at a news conference Thursday .
Watch police describe girl 's injuries »
Raney said Friday that witnesses , who may have caught only glimpses of what was happening because of the chaos , thought Pardo may have targeted some victims .
He said witnesses at the party said Pardo may have stood over some of the victims and executed them .
Raney said people at the party were jumping out of windows on both floors of the house trying to escape the gunfire and flames .
" The information we have so far is that Mr. Pardo was married to the daughter of the resident of the house , " Raney said .
" They 'd been married for possibly one year , had recently divorced and a settlement was reached apparently last week .
It sounds like that might have been a very contentious divorce . "
Investigators have yet to identify the charred bodies recovered from the burned house , which belonged to Pardo 's ex-in - laws .
Watch how the massacre unfolded »
In addition to the nine people killed , police said three people were injured , including the 8 - year - old girl .
A 16 - year - old girl was wounded by gunfire and was hospitalized with non-life - threatening injuries , police said , and a woman who jumped out of a second - floor window suffered a broken leg and was hospitalized .
Police said they have not accounted for three people : Pardo 's ex-mother - in - law , ex - father - in - law and ex-wife .
Pardo 's neighbors talked to KABC on Thursday as they watched police search his home .
" He 's very nice , very sociable , " Cindy Keenan said .
She said Pardo always decorated his home for the holidays .
Patrick Guzman said when he encountered Pardo in his yard about two hours before the attack , " He seemed normal . "
" He said ' Merry Christmas ' to me , " Guzman said .
Ed Winter , assistant chief Los Angeles County coroner , said the bodies recovered were " severely burned and charred " and dental and medical records and X - rays will be necessary to establish identities .
Winter said the intense fire caused the top floor of the two - story house to collapse onto the first floor .
Pardo 's body was discovered about 30 miles from the shooting scene at his brother 's house in the Los Angeles suburb of Sylmar , dead from " a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " police said .
Relatives returning to the house found Pardo 's body , police said .
Buchanan said police received several 911 calls at 8:27 p.m. Wednesday .
When officers arrived at the house three to four minutes after the first call , the dwelling was engulfed in flames .
The fire was so intense that firefighters battled the blaze for an hour and a half before knocking the flames down so that officers " were able to look into the house from the outside , and initially saw three bodies in the front portion of the house , " he said .
As uninjured people were trying to escape , Buchanan said , " that 's when he ( Pardo ) lit the accelerant in some manner -- we do not know how at this point -- and he fled the scene . "
Buchanan said the device that spread accelerant was " nothing that we or the arson - explosives unit has ever seen before .
It appears to be homemade . "
A Christmas Eve party at the house was a family tradition , Raney said , and the party had often featured a visit from a neighbor who was dressed as Santa Claus .
He said that neighbor has moved out of the neighborhood and was not at the party Wednesday night .
Referring to Pardo , Buchanan said , " We do n't know at this point whether he was aware that there was a Santa Claus in years past .
We 're assuming that he did , and that 's the reason for the outfit . "

Sofa , so good !
Trundling along at 30 mph this crazy couple try to get home with TWO sofas strapped to their roof .
Shocked motorists on the A30 in Devon could n't believe their eyes when they saw the Nissan Micra with its load precariously balanced and held on with just rope .
At least they could have a well deserved sit down on their new sofa once they got home .
They 're not the first to prove that there 's no obstacle to carrying more than looks humanly possible ... so long as you pack it together right .
Gravity defying loads of sacks , polystyrene , wicker baskets , bananas and even people can all be shifted with a bit of imagination and know - how .
And what 's the point of two journeys when you can move everything in one ?

Fears of infection by a virus led the US DoD to ban the use of flash drives .
To most people the USB stick is a humble , innocuous device that does nothing more than help them tote around their most important files .
But to the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) , the USB stick has a dark side - one that criminally - minded hackers are only too eager to exploit .
In late November , the US DoD imposed a temporary ban on the use of flash drives and other removable , recordable media such as CDs , DVDs and floppy disks .
The ban applied to users of both the classified and unclassified networks the US military operates .
The order was sent out to help the security staff at the DoD combat the spread of a Windows worm - a self - propagating program .
In this case the malicious program was a variant of the SillyFDC worm known as Agent.btz .
This lurks unseen on USB drives and only springs to life when an infected flash drive is inserted into an uninfected PC .
Once installed , the worm does not sit dormant .
Instead , it downloads code from elsewhere on the net and stays in touch with its creators .
To scupper the chance that criminals could be using its network resources , the DoD slapped a ban on the use of USB sticks .
But , said Tim Ellsmore , chief executive of security firm 3 ami , those restrictions could make it harder for people to get their jobs done .
Companies need to remind employees about safe net use " A USB drive is an important business tool for a lot of people , " he said .
The fact that they were cheap , portable and spacious helped an increasingly mobile workforce cope , he said .
But , he added , flash drives did represent a management headache for many companies .
Mr Ellsmore said 3ami regularly helped organisations that have tens of thousands of users who use many hundreds of flash drives every day .
Rogue devices
Few companies had any idea what was being done with those drives or any other removable media , he said .
Research by Israeli security firm Insightix showed that organisations can have large numbers of " rogue " devices joining their networks every day .
The network auditing firm said that , on average , 20 % of the devices connecting to a large organisation 's network could be classed as " rogue " .
" Not all of the unknown devices will be bad , " said Mr Arkin , " but if someone did plug one of these devices in you may not be aware of it and that could be a problem . "
Unless organisations know who is connecting to their network and what they are using , said Mr Arkin , managing what they are doing is impossible .
" Knowledge is the foundation of good security , " said Mr Arkin .
Chris Boyd , head of forensics at Detica , said the roominess of USB drives made them dangerous devices to leave unwatched .
" The reality is that you can easily buy a very high capacity drive that will hold an awful lot of intellectual property or government secrets , " he said .
People will try to evade poorly thought - out security policies But , he acknowledged , finding the right policy for USB use was tricky .
Get it wrong , he warned , and users could resist .
" If a security protocol is a hindrance rather than a help then users will try to avoid it , " he said .
Despite this , he said , organisations had to get to grips with managing their networks and what people were doing on them - if only to protect themselves from unwarranted leaks .
" On a well - managed network that 's policed properly , it 's very difficult for members of team A to access team B's data , " he said .
At the least , he said , data on USB drives should be encrypted so that if it does go astray there is not much that can be done with it .
For 3 ami's Tim Ellsmore , an active policy of watching what users do on a network is the only answer .
Users , he said , should be reminded of their responsibilities and the efforts companies were making to keep data secure .
" Until you reach the stage where you can see what people in the organisation are doing , you do not have a clue , " he said .
" And if you do not have a clue then how do you go about stopping bad behaviour or promoting good ? "

This computer graphic image shows three craters in the eastern Hellas region of Mars containing concealed glaciers detected by radar .
The image shows how the surface looks today with the ice covered with a layer of Martian soil .
The image was created using image data from the Context Camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) spacecraft combined with results from the SHARAD radar sounder on MRO and HRSC digital elevation map from the Mars Express spacecraft .
The color of the Martian surface and ice was estimated from MRO HiRISE color images of other Martian craters and the polar ice caps .
The buried ice in these craters as measured by SHARAD is ~ 250 meter thick on the upper crater and ~ 300 and 450 meters on the middle and lower levels respectively .
Each image is 20 km ( 12.8 mi. ) across and extends to 50 km ( 32 mi ) in the distance .
Recent measurements from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter SHARAD radar sounder have detected large amounts of water ice in such deposits over widespread areas , arguing for the flow of glacial - like structures on Mars in the relatively recent geologic past .
This suggests that snow and ice accumulated on higher topography , flowed downhill and is now protected from sublimation by a layer of rock debris and dust .
Furrows and ridges on the surface were caused by deforming ice .

The Bush administration has spent the last eight years bulldozing environmental safeguards while boosting the oil and gas , mining , and coal industries .
The federal courts and Congress thwarted many of these assaults , while others are now in place .
Under Bush ’s watch , global warming pollution increased by 6.6 percent , and oil dependence grew by 10 percent .
Bush has a scorched - earth legacy of destruction and neglect .
President Barack Obama committed to jumpstart America ’s progress toward a clean energy economy that will also drive economic stimulus , recovery , and growth .
During the campaign and transition he advocated for many of the policies listed below .
Congress must work with him to adopt these measures that would create jobs , reduce oil dependence , and lower greenhouse gas pollution .

1 . Wish they all could be California cars .
California has a program to reduce motor vehicle greenhouse gas pollution by 30 percent by 2016 .
Sixteen other states plan to adopt it , too .
But the Bush administration blocked California ’s request for a waiver from the Clean Air Act to allow this program .
The new administration should sign the waiver request by California to allow it to adopt greenhouse gas emission reduction standards for motor vehicles .
2. Global warming is a real and present danger .
The Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts vs. EPA that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA the authority to require greenhouse gas reductions from power plants and other sources .
But first , the EPA has to make an “ endangerment finding ” that global warming poses a threat to Americans ’ health and safety .
Despite a recommendation from agency scientists to do so , the Bush administration refused .
President Barack Obama should make the endangerment finding and begin to establish controls on greenhouse gases .
3. Green stimulus and recovery .
As the economy continues to tumble , the need for an economic stimulus and recovery package grows .
This package should include $ 100 billion for clean energy programs , including the Weatherization Assistance Program , transit agencies , and energy efficiency in federal buildings .
For other programs , see the Center for American Progress ’
“ How to Spend $ 350 Billion in the First Year of Stimulus and Recovery . ”

4. Mercury falling .
The National Research Council reported that prenatal and early childhood exposure to mercury can cause developmental delays and permanent brain damage in children .
The EPA acknowledges that “ coal - fired power plants are the largest remaining source of human - generated mercury emissions in the United States . ”
Nonetheless , the Bush administration proposed to delay mercury controls until 2018 and beyond .
The courts struck this rule down .
The New York Times reported that the EPA “ ignored its legal obligation to require the strictest possible controls on the toxic metal . ”
It is imperative that we adopt a program to significantly and promptly reduce mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants to protect the health and safety of our children .
5 . Curb the enthusiasm for greenhouse gases .
The administration should seek to reduce global warming pollution via a cap - and - trade program that achieves a 20 to 35 percent reduction from 1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2020 .
It should also reduce emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
The program should require all emitters to buy pollution allowances in an auction , and it should rebate half of the allowance revenues to middle - and low - income households to help them offset any increase in energy costs .
The other half should be invested in clean energy , health care , and transit .
Representative Ed Markey ’s ( D - MA ) Investing in Climate Action and Protection Act , H.R. 6186 , is one proposal that includes these measures .
6 . The answer is blowing in the wind ( and shining in the sun ) .
Twenty - eight states require utilities to produce a proportion of their electricity from the wind , the sun , the earth ’s core , and other renewable sources .
The new administration should adopt a national renewable electricity standard that requires utilities to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025 .

7. Bridge loans to the 21st century .
The new administration and Congress should ensure that the next round of the bridge loan program for auto companies requires them to speed their efforts to produce fuel - efficient cars .
A bridge loan program should replenish any funds redirected from the Advanced Vehicle Technology Manufacturing Incentive Program .
Loan recipients must agree to cease all efforts to legally or legislatively challenge federal or state clean energy or global warming programs , including the California greenhouse gas standard for autos .
8 . Pick the low - hanging energy fruit .
Energy efficiency is called the “ low - hanging fruit ” of clean energy since there are a myriad of ways to employ technology to reduce energy consumption that save money .
This would also reduce global warming emissions .
A McKinsey & Company analysis determined that , “ Almost 40 percent of abatement could be achieved at ‘ negative ’ marginal costs , meaning that investing in these options would generate positive economic returns over their lifecycle . ”
Efficiency policies should include incentives for states to rewrite state utility regulations to put energy efficiency on equal ground with new power plants .
The new government should establish a federal energy efficiency resource standard that requires utilities to reduce energy consumption , similar to programs in 19 states , and it should fully fund the program to capture and reuse industrial waste heat .

9 . Green the wires .
The participants at the National Clean Energy Summit , sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , the Center for American Progress Action Fund , and the University of Nevada - Las Vegas , concluded that the lack of transmission capacity was the most significant impediment to the broad expansion of renewable energy .
Grid modernization must accompany increasing renewable energy generation , including the ability to incorporate intermittent renewable electricity generation .
The modernized grid must carry this renewable power to urban areas , which will require some long - distance transmission lines .
The grid can be made more efficient with “ smart grid ” technology that more efficiently directs electricity to where it is needed .
There are hurdles to building necessary new transmissions lines , including public opposition to siting new lines , a lengthy permit approval process , and the environmental impact of the lines .
Therefore , it is essential to adopt reforms as soon as possible .
10 . Rise of the new machines .
Research , development , and deployment of new clean energy technologies have been woefully underfunded over the past eight years .
We must significantly increase the investment in clean energy research , including advanced batteries , energy efficient materials , and similar technologies .
In spite of rhetoric to the contrary , government spending on renewable energy and efficiency R&D has consistently suffered under the current administration .

The news is coming in that Kanye West may be bisexual or at least open to being in bisexual porn .
He is quoted as saying : This proves juicy gossip but also important as it once again brings media attention to the subject of bisexual and queer sexuality .
Additionally , it sends a strong message to queer youth of color that even a famous masculine rap artist is n't freaked out by the notion of queer sexuality .
For someone so careful as Lucas , the special was an incomprehensible miscalculation .
It was one of the first times that his golden gut for mass entertainment and his protective instincts toward his Star Wars universe had gone awol .
There is an oft - recycled quote of Lucas ’s saying that if he had the time and a hammer , he would personally “ smash ” every bootlegged copy of the special ; otherwise he has yet to come clean on the matter .
He declined to be interviewed for this article , although in a chance meeting that I had with him prior to that decision , the filmmaker , known for obsessive control of his projects , called the special a “ travesty ” and said he regretted not exercising a tighter grip over its production .
As Gary Kurtz , one of the Lucas organization ’s producers at the time , says today , the experience with the holiday special “ certainly added to the idea that the only way to make sure it turns out the way you wanted is to be in control . ”
It is no small irony that technology — the very tool that Lucas wielded to achieve independence from Hollywood — is the thing that keeps the filmmaker from scraping The Star Wars Holiday Special off his heel .
There were no chat rooms or Web sites in 1978 , but there were VCRs — the VHS format had been introduced two years earlier — and , today , grainy bootleg DVD copies of the special are readily available at comics conventions and on the Web , ensuring that the generation who came of age during Episodes I , II , and III will not be deprived of the moment when not even the Schwartz was with George Lucas .
This was a lackluster TV debut for a franchise that , just a year earlier , had rocked the entertainment world .
But that was not to be the worst of it .
Although Lucas has subsequently had the special disappeared from American television — it has never again been officially aired or released in any video format — Star Wars geeks have not let the world forget that , even more than Jar Jar Binks , this is the one true embarrassment attached to the mostly superlative Star Wars universe .
As one professed fan of the films posted on his Web site , “ This is the great secret of Star Wars , the 3 - eyed cousin who lives in the barn attic , humping sheep and eating spiders .
This is the thing that does n’t get mentioned at American Film Institute dinners . ”
When The Star Wars Holiday Special aired , from 8 to 10 p.m. on November 17 , 1978 , the Friday before Thanksgiving , George Lucas ’s name was nowhere on it .
According to Nielsen Media Research , it was seen by close to 13 million television households , but it finished second to ABC ’s Love Boat from 8 to 9 p.m. , and , in the next hour , to Part 2 of Pearl , a mini-series about the misdeeds of another Empire — Japan ’s bombing of Pearl Harbor — which starred a bed - hopping Angie Dickinson .
Even today , former Jefferson Starship lead guitarist and songwriter Craig Chaquico ca n’t quite get over the result : “ It was such a strange iteration of the original big - screen - movie concept and your regular variety - show , Carol Burnett vibe , ” he says .
“ I was like tripping on it myself , man . ”
In 1978 , however , there were a lot of other people and projects competing for Lucas ’s time — most of them brought on by the sudden , unfathomable success of Star Wars , and all of them seemingly more important than a TV special .
With his attention elsewhere during most of its production , The Star Wars Holiday Special metastasized into a monster .
Two directors and much turmoil later , the finished special did n’t so much resemble its namesake as it did another science - fiction film : The Thing with Two Heads .
Onto the body of Lucas ’s sentimental and irony - free Wookiee plotline , the producers and writers grafted a campy 70s variety show that makes suspension of disbelief impossible .
In between minutes - long stretches of guttural , untranslated Wookiee dialogue that could almost pass for avant - garde cinema , Maude ’s Bea Arthur sings and dances with the aliens from the movie ’s cantina scene ; The Honeymooners ’
Art Carney consoles Chewbacca ’s family with such comedy chestnuts as “ Why all the long , hairy faces ? ” ; Harvey Korman mugs shamelessly as a multi-limbed intergalactic Julia Child cooking “ Bantha Surprise ” ; the Jefferson Starship pops up to play a number about U.F.O. ’s ; and original Star Wars cast members Harrison Ford , Carrie Fisher , and Mark Hamill walk around looking cosmically miserable .
Lucas met these comments with a “ glacial ” look .
“ This was his vision , and he could not be moved , ” Vilanch says .
“ And of course Star Wars was so gigantic that he had been validated a hundred times over .
So he had what a director needs to have , which is this insane belief in their personal vision , and he was somehow going to make it work . ”
“ I said : ‘ You ’ve chosen to build a story around these characters who do n’t speak .
The only sound they make is like fat people having an orgasm , ’ ” the 250 - plus - pound Vilanch recalls .
“ In fact , I told Lucas he could just leave a tape recorder in my bedroom and I ’d be happy to do all the looping and Foley work for him . ”
But when Vilanch heard Lucas ’s storyline at a development meeting at Smith and Hemion ’s L.A. offices , he quickly realized that a “ big challenge ” lay ahead .
Lucas was intent on building The Star Wars Holiday Special , as it would be called , around Wookiees — specifically , the family of Chewbacca , Han Solo ’s shaggy sidekick , as they outwitted Imperial forces to come together on Life Day , the Wookiee equivalent of Christmas .
Suddenly , Vilanch says , the special was in danger of looking like “ one long episode of Lassie . ”
Though Lucas would not be involved in the actual shooting of the special — Smith and Hemion would oversee that — he knew the tales he wanted to tell and planned to work with the show ’s team of seasoned TV writers to develop his ideas into a viable script .
For those who had been summoned , the prospect of collaborating with the father of the Force initially sounded like a sure bet .
“ We were really excited , because , ‘ My God , this is an annuity — Star Wars ! ’ ” says Lenny Ripps , another writer who worked on the special .
“ How could it lose ? ”
A year had passed since the theatrical release of Lucas ’s gee - whiz space epic , and in that time Star Wars had become the highest - grossing movie in history as well as a cultural phenomenon with its very own lexicon and mythology .
With a sequel still two years away from theaters , Lucas had been sold on the idea that a Star Wars holiday television special — to be broadcast on CBS the weekend before Thanksgiving , when Nielsen audiences were plentiful — would sustain interest in the franchise , move more toys off the shelves , and maybe even pick up some new fans who had n’t seen the movie .
In the summer of 1978 , Bruce Vilanch had a bad feeling about the Star Wars television special he ’d been hired to write .
A veteran of the comedy wars who has since written material for 16 Oscar telecasts and starred as the extra-large Edna Turnblad in the Broadway musical adaptation of John Waters ’s Hairspray , Vilanch had just finished working on Bette Midler ’s 1977 TV special , Ol ’ Red Hair Is Back , for producers Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion when they threw him what sounded like a plum assignment : a spot on the writing team that would help George Lucas adapt more of the Star Wars saga for television .
Among sources who worked within the Lucas organization , which was known in 1978 as the Star Wars Corporation , there are conflicting reports as to which person or company actually brought the idea of doing a holiday special to Lucas .
According to Charles Lippincott , who at the time was in charge of marketing and merchandising for the company , CBS initially approached him and later Lucas with a slew of Star Wars ideas .
Foremost on the network ’s agenda , though , was a special .
In the fall of 1977 , with the film still in theaters , segments featuring the Cantina aliens on variety shows hosted by Donny and Marie Osmond and Richard Pryor “ helped revive our box office , ” Lippincott says .
And so , in a world that had yet to see 24 - hour cable channels dedicated to entertainment or even pay - per- view movies , some in the Lucas camp saw a TV special as a way to keep the movie and its characters on the public ’s radar screen while The Empire Strikes Back was being prepared .
Lippincott says the special was always intended to be a variety - type show , but , he explains , “ we wanted something that was going to make us different in variety shows .
We did n’t want the same - old , same - old . ”
That , he adds , is “ why David was brought in . ”
David is David Acomba , the man initially chosen to direct The Star Wars Holiday Special .
A native of Montreal , Acomba had gotten critical notice for Welcome to the Fillmore East , a concert documentary featuring Van Morrison and the Byrds that aired on PBS in 1971 .
Acomba had also directed a movie , Slipstream , that had netted him best - picture and best - director trophies at the Canadian Film Awards .
He ’d even attended U.S.C. film school at the same time that Lucas was there , though the two did not meet then .
Rather , Acomba knew Lippincott , another U.S.C .
Film student and a fraternity brother .
David was “ a guy we could trust , ” Lippincott says , and along with a team of Star Wars technical consultants and Wookiee specialists , Acomba was inserted into the television production team that was being assembled for the network .
Not surprisingly , the group had an impressive track record in the realm of network - television specials .
Executive producers Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion were considered the class act of the field , having produced Elvis in Concert , as well as similarly successful vehicles for Sammy Davis Jr. and Sandy Duncan .
In 1978 , the Star Wars special was one of at least seven that they produced or executive produced , and because of their workload , they brought in three additional producers , the husband - and - wife duo Ken and Mitzie Welch and their friend Joe Layton , to work in the trenches on the Lucas project .
The Welches , parents of singer - songwriter Gillian Welch , were longtime composers for The Carol Burnett Show .
Ian Fraser , a composer who had worked on Doctor Doolittle , was brought in to supplement John Williams ’s orchestral music from the film , and Bob Mackie was hired to design costumes .
In addition to Ripps — who would go on to write for Bosom Buddies and write and produce Full House — and Vilanch , the writing roster included Pat Proft , who is known for his work on Scary Movie 3 , and the original Police Academy , Naked Gun , and Hot Shots movies .
Ripps and Proft were n’t writing partners , but they had worked together on The Shields and Yarnell Show , a variety series that starred a young mime team , which had been a big hit the previous season ; the two say their expertise in nonverbal comedy — just the ticket for a family of nonverbal Wookiees — was one of the reasons they were chosen for the show .
This was a comedy - variety dream team , but that expertise was an odd fit with Star Wars .
“ We should have realized that there was no way that we could fit the characters into this kind of format , ” says Gary Kurtz .
Indeed , not only was the format wrong , it was on its last legs with American TV audiences .
After 11 seasons The Carol Burnett Show had aired its final first - run episode in March of 1978 .
The previous year saw the retirement of variety - show veterans Sonny and Cher .
The network was waning , too : after spending much of the 70s leading a three - network race , CBS , the network of adult comedies such as All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show , was now finishing second to the escapist programming of Fred Silverman over at ABC , home of Charlie ’s Angels and Fantasy Island .
But the deal had been struck , and Lucas and the writers got down to the business of roughing out a script .
“ We would ask him questions [ like ] ‘ Would a Wookiee slap his knee — do they laugh the way humans laugh or is there some other way ? ’
Because , you know , we did n’t want to piss on the Bible , ” Vilanch says .
“ We knew that he had his rules .
And we did n’t know what his rules were .
Mostly , he was just passing judgment .
He had constructed the framework for the show , and we were basically just throwing things onto it and seeing if they stuck . ”
Vilanch says it was Lucas who named Chewbacca ’s father and son , respectively , Itchy and Lumpy ( though Star Wars nerds will note that the names are actually abbreviations of Attichitcuk and Lumpawarrump ) .
The filmmaker had an even more interesting appellation for one of the Cantina aliens .
While flipping through a book of production stills , Vilanch says , the Star Wars creator came across a particularly provocative - looking creature .
“ Lucas , who had been pretty stolid the whole time , turned to me and said : ‘ Oh yes , we call him Cuntface . ’
And that ’s what it looked like , actually .
I noticed in a later movie ” — Return of the Jedi — “ that Lucas had , like , a huge vagina in the desert that sucked things in .
So , I think this is one of his leitmotifs . ”
David Acomba , meanwhile , felt as if he had been sucked into the maw of a creature that he could not comprehend or stop .
In an effort to avoid the same old variety - show tropes , he says , he sought out fresh talent .
For instance , he brought in the Canadian animation company Nelvana Ltd. to produce an animated short of Lucas ’s story introducing the bounty hunter Boba Fett , who was to play a small but important part in The Empire Strikes Back .
Acomba also says that after seeing the relatively unknown Robin Williams perform at an L.A. comedy club and then meeting the comedian backstage , he proposed using Williams for the special , but was told by the producers that Williams was n’t enough of a known quantity .
( The Welches say Acomba never mentioned Williams to them , and Williams — who , in September 1978 , debuted in the series that made him a household name , Mork and Mindy — says he does not recall the meeting . )
Acomba says he increasingly sensed that there was not only a gaping generational divide between him and the producers but also a cultural impasse between the get - it - right Lucas film camp and the I - need - it - yesterday Smith - Hemion TV people .
Acomba was a product of rock ’n ’ roll and the rebellious milieu of 70s filmmaking that had also shaped Lucas .
The producers and , to a lesser extent , the writers , haled from the song , dance , and shtick era of Establishment American TV , which paid heed to advertisers and Standards and Practices .
Acomba was excited about shooting the Jefferson Starship .
The Welches and their musical cohort were writing songs that emulated Kurt Weill and Erik Satie and inviting Diahann Carroll and Bea Arthur to perform them .
“ It was a mix that never mixed , ” says Ripps .
“ And everybody was good . ”
But , he adds , “ I ’m sure there was n’t a bad welder on the Titanic . ”
By the time the cameras rolled , Lucas had moved on , and Acomba realized he was in over his head .
“ For me , there was no center , ” Acomba says .
“ I could n’t seem to grasp it .
I ’m the director .
I ’m supposed to know .
I ’m supposed to draw on something that makes it all work .
And so , in those first days of shooting , everything came home to roost .
And it was hell . ”
Acomba shot only a handful of segments , among them a scene featuring Bea Arthur as the owner of the Cantina bar who must coax her volatile alien clientele to go home when the Empire declares a curfew .
She does this by dancing with an alien or two and singing a song , “ Goodnight But Not Goodbye , ” which was written by the Welches in a style that suggests Kurt Weill was popular not just on Earth but beyond the Outer Rim .
Sources say Acomba seemed overwhelmed by the demands of television production , such as shooting a scene with multiple cameras to cover various angles .
Instead of directing scenes via monitors from a control booth , as most TV directors do , he worked the floor , like a movie director , which greatly annoyed the tight - knit staff of TV veterans .
“ He was a loose cannon , ” says Elle Puritz , a producer ’s assistant on the special .
The length of the Bea Arthur shoot also proved too much for some of the people in the stifling alien suits .
Proft says that that day he ’d brought his son , a Star Wars fan , to Burbank Studios to watch the scene being shot .
“ Some of them were passing out because they did n’t have oxygen , ” he says , while an overwhelmed Acomba rushed from prostrate body to prostrate body .
“ And there ’s my son watching these creatures he loves die in front of him . ”
The last segment Acomba directed was the Jefferson Starship ’s lip - synched performance of its song “ Light the Sky on Fire . ”
Puritz remembers the director throwing his headset and screaming , “ No , no , no ! ” when the special effects did n’t work according to plan .
Acomba does n’t exactly deny this , but he says that by that point he had already informed Smith and Hemion that he was quitting .
( Some connected with the special were under the impression that Acomba was let go . )
“ I sent a telegram — how romantic , ” he says .
“ I did n’t even tell my agent . ”

A lot of people , not just Vilanch , were beginning to have a bad feeling about The Star Wars Holiday Special .
Puritz remembers one of the project ’s associate producers , Rita Scott , who was in charge of the budgets and schedules , “ walking around , wringing her hands , ” and saying , “ Are we getting out of here alive ? ”
Lucas was well aware of what was happening , too , but , Kurtz says , “ I do n’t think he thought much about it , really .
We were working on a lot of other things at the time and there was a lot of effort in preparing Empire , so nobody had any time . ”
Acomba ’s replacement was Steve Binder , a protégé of Steve Allen’s .
Binder had directed both The T.A.M.I . Show , a rock ’n ’ roll movie featuring the Rolling Stones and the Supremes , and Elvis Presley ’s 1968 comeback special , as well as Shields and Yarnell .
( Later , he would produce Pee - Wee ’s Playhouse . )
Were it not for him , The Star Wars Holiday Special might have sunk quietly into the Sarlacc Pit of dead TV shows .
When he was hired , Binder says , Gary Smith told him , “ If you did n’t come in , there ’d have been no show . ”
Binder ’s only contact with the Lucas organization would be a Wookiee bible — “ a backstory brochure of the Chewbacca family ” — that was delivered to the set for him .
His primary job was to bring the production , which was overbudget and behind schedule , to a close .
He also had to shoot the scenes that involved members of the original cast — Hamill , Ford , Fisher , and Peter Mayhew , who played Chewbacca .
Kurtz , whose task it was to convince the actors to make the effort , says begging was involved .
Though film actors cross over into television much more frequently these days , in 1978 , it was considered déclassé .
Ford was especially reluctant to appear , though , as Kurtz points out , the actor was loathe to cooperate with any kind of ancillary Star Wars project .
According to Vilanch , Fisher was willing to appear under the condition that she got to sing .
“ She was going through her Joni Mitchell period , ” he says .
“ And she came into the office and played a couple of very lachrymose ballads on a piano .
She was singing about heartbreak and all the Joni Mitchell things .
She very much wanted to show this side of her talent .
And there was general dismay because this was not what we wanted Princess Leia to be doing . ”
In the end , Fisher did get to sing .
In fact , it ’s the next - to - last scene of The Star Wars Holiday Special .
As Chewbacca , his family , and all the other furry members of the Wookiee planet Kashyyyk gather for Life Day , Fisher , wearing her trademark honey - bun hairdo and a glazed look , sings to the Wookiees .
The Welches say Fisher did not seem happy with the song they wrote for her .
In fact , the actors did not seem to be happy with much of anything that was going on at Burbank Studios .
Though Binder says Hamill , Ford , and Fisher were “ a pleasure ” to direct , Kurtz says there was a moment when the actors confronted him while he was visiting the set .
“ They all came up to me and [ one of them ] said , ‘ How did we get into this mess ? ’ ”
Kurtz says he does n’t remember which actor said it , but then he laughs .
What actually might have been asked , he says , was , “ How did you get us into this mess ? ”
Los Angeles public school teachers protest budget cuts and layoffs
By Rafael Azul

Los Angeles teachers ’ protest on Thursday
Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District public teachers were joined by parents and other workers in a demonstration in central Los Angeles on January 29 .
The demonstration was called to protest the proposed state and local budget cuts .
The protest began at the LAUSD headquarters west of downtown and swelled at Pershing Square , as columns of teachers arrived from across Los Angeles in buses and trains .
Addressing the teachers were officials from the Los Angeles Teachers Union , rank and file teachers , parents and students .
As a consequence of California 's budget crisis , the Los Angeles Unified School District is anticipating a $ 500 million budget reduction .
This will result in the layoff of some 2,300 non-tenured teachers next term .
The LAUSD employs a total of 75,000 teaching and non-teaching employees .
It is the second largest school system in the United States .
In addition to the impending sackings , teachers face the prospect of higher health care premiums and higher deductions on their health care benefits .
The LAUSD also anticipates what LAUSD superintendent Ramon Cortines calls ‘ drastic cuts ' among the districts ' 40,000 non-teaching employees .
The California State legislature is currently considering a mid-year budget cut for primary and secondary public education of $ 10.8 billion .
Los Angeles teachers at the demonstration January 29
One of the speakers was Jennifer Maldonado , a 12th grade student at Wilson High School and member of Inner City Struggle , which she described as " a community - based organization that works with students and parents to fight for educational equity and universal access for all students . "
" I am here to stand in solidarity with the teachers of Los Angeles .
Our teachers understand the conditions of the schools because they face them every day from the wrong side up .
These conditions include overcrowded schools and classes that make it difficult for teachers to teach and students to learn , " declared Maldonado .
Maldonado concluded by calling on students to actively support the teachers ' struggle : " The only way we are truly going to see change is for the students and teachers to come together and organize to build power and demand quality education .
We must unite our voices and see that the change we deserve becomes reality : more opportunities for students to go to college , lower classroom sizes and better pay for teachers and a strong student , parent and teacher voice .
All power to the teachers ! "
A non-tenured teacher , a district intern at Wilshire Hills Elementary School , said , " I 'm thinking right now about one of my students in my class .
Two weeks ago , when I received the news that they 're making some cuts , and we were talking about this in class , we were discussing what was happening .
One of my students — and this is a student that I 've been pushing really hard to get into a science class — raised his hand in class and said , ‘ I do n't want you to go . '
Right now I 'm thinking about that student and my response , and I told him , ‘ I 'm not going anywhere . '
The road ... is long and there 's going to be several battles with what I consider an all - out assault on education , and as a young educator , a new educator , I cannot understand how the richest nation in the world can cut the funds of something so natural to our society , and that means education . "
Maria Escobar
Maria Escobar , a second grade teacher at the Los Angeles Elementary School in the heavily immigrant Pico - Union neighborhood spoke to the World Socialist Web Site :
" I think that this protest is very important because the LAUSD and the State Legislature need to see that teachers are very serious about these cuts and that we are willing to strike over this .
This demonstration shows that we are united and that our struggle is necessary . "
Escobar , a 13 - year veteran with the school district , described some of the conditions that teachers face at her school :
" Right now things are very stressful .
We have tests and quarterly assessments coming up .
Many teachers are worried pending the firing of teachers .
It is hard enough to teach 20 children .
You have barely enough time to get to everyone to help them learn , " said Escobar , " It is going to be much more difficult if the class size increases to 30 kids . "
" I do not expect to be fired , but some of my coworkers will .
Right now they are saying that the firings will not begin until the new school year , but everybody is stressed over this .
As things stand now parents are constantly organizing sales of candies , ice - cream and so on so that we can buy pencils and other supplies and to pay for field trips .
I always have to buy supplies out of my own pocket , such as crayons for the children .
A lot of us spend a lot of money to provide decent supplies for our kids . "
" I think that instead of putting all that money into the war , they should put that money into our children so that they can have a better education and so that there is less violence on the streets . "
Those words contrasted with UTLA President A.J. Duffy 's demagoguery .
Duffy , who has declared that he has no illusions about cuts beginning this spring , called on the LAUSD and on Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to ‘ do their homework ' and preserve teachers ' jobs and benefits by cutting other parts of the LAUSD budget .
He attempted to start a chant of ‘ do your homework , ' which received little response from the attending crowd .
Though the protest took place on the same day that a Superior Court judge granted Governor Schwarzenegger the authority to furlough state workers beginning next month , Duffy made no mention of this .
The furlough , forcing workers to stay home two days a month , amounts to a ten percent pay cut for 235,000 state workers .
The LAUSD so far has made $ 400 million in cuts but has opted to operate at a deficit of $ 400 million this year rather than cut jobs or wages or benefits in the middle of the year , in part because it hopes to encourage 2,000 teachers to opt for early retirement .
The deficit will have to be eliminated within two years .
As part of the cuts , the LAUSD did suspend funding for the Arts Community Partnership Network , a nonprofit organization that oversaw arts education programs across Los Angeles County and provided arts education at the city 's schools .
Among the programs eliminated were theater and music workshops and an instrument repair shop .
These cuts have been particularly unpopular with teachers , some of whom have started an on - line petition to pressure the district into restoring the programs .
In addition to these cuts , the LAUSD is quickly running out of money to pay for the school breakfast and lunch programs for poor students .
Pope Benedict has called for " an ecology of the human being " Pope Benedict XVI has suggested that the need to save mankind from a destructive blurring of gender roles is as important as saving the rainforests .
He explained that defending God 's creation was not limited to saving the environment , but also about protecting man from self - destruction .
The Pope was delivering his end - of - year address to senior Vatican staff .
His words , later released to the media , emphasised his rejection of gender theory .
Speaking on Monday , Pope Benedict XVI warned that gender theory blurred the distinction between male and female and thus could lead to the " self - destruction " of the human race .
The speech has provoked anger from campaigners , who have interpreted the remarks as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals .
Gender theory Gender theory explores sexual orientation , the roles assigned by society to individuals according to their gender , and how people perceive their biological identity .
Rainforests deserve , yes , our protection , but the human being ... does not deserve it less
Pope Benedict Papal address : Key extracts
What Bible says about being gay
Gay and transsexual groups , particularly in the United States , promote it as a key to understanding and tolerance , but the Pope disagreed .
When the Roman Catholic Church defends God 's Creation , " it does not only defend the earth , water and the air ... but ( it ) also protects man from his own destruction , " he said .
" Rainforests deserve , yes , our protection , but the human being ... does not deserve it less , " the pontiff said .
It is not " out - of - date metaphysics " to " speak of human nature as ' man ' or woman ' " , he told scores of prelates gathered in the Vatican 's sumptuous Clementine Hall .
" We need something like human ecology , meant in the right way . "
The Catholic Church opposes gay marriage .
It teaches that while homosexuality is not sinful , homosexual acts are .
Rev Sharon Ferguson , chief executive of Britain 's Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement , described the Pope 's remarks as " totally irresponsible and unacceptable " .
" When you have religious leaders like that making that sort of statement then followers feel they are justified in behaving in an aggressive and violent way , " she said .
' Rock festival '
The pope uses his traditional end - of - year speech to offer his Christmas greetings and say a few words about what he considers the important issues of the day .
This year , Pope Benedict also deplored the tendency to depict the Catholic church 's World Youth Day , which he attended in Sydney earlier this year , as mere spectacle .
He stressed that the event should not be considered a " variant of modern youth culture , as a kind of ecclesiastical rock festival with the Pope as the star , " but as the fruition of a " long exterior and interior path " .
This article has been amended to make it clear the Pope made no direct reference to homosexuals or transsexuals .

American singer , dancer and actress Eartha Kitt has died at the age 81 , her friend and publicist has said .
Kitt died of colon cancer on Thursday , Andrew Freedman said .
She was one of the few artists to be nominated in the Tony , Grammy and Emmy award categories and was a stalwart of the Manhattan cabaret scene .
She famously played Catwoman in the Batman television series in the 1960s and was known for her distinctive , feline drawl .
She also had a number of hit songs , including Old Fashioned Girl , C'est Si Bon and Santa Baby .
Kitt was blacklisted in the US in the late 1960s after speaking out against the Vietnam War at a White House function .
She also caused controversy when she toured apartheid South Africa in 1974 , arguing that she had helped weaken the regime by raising awareness of racism .
However , she returned triumphantly to New York 's Broadway in a 1978 production , Timbuktu ! , and continued to perform regularly in theatre shows and concert halls .
From the 1980s onwards she appeared in numerous films , and her 1984 hit Where Is My Man found her another generation of night club fans .
Big break Kitt rose to the top of the entertainment world from humble origins .
Her mother worked on a cotton plantation in South Carolina and was just 14 when she gave birth .
HAVE YOUR SAY
An actress , a temptress , a dancer and a songbird Joy Pattinson , Switzerland Kitt was then given away at the age of eight and sent to live with an aunt in New York .
Her break came at 16 when she got a job as a dancer with a professional troupe touring Europe .
She later sang in Paris nightclubs and appeared in several films in the 1950s .
Kitt , who had one daughter from a brief marriage in the 1960s , lived in the US state of Connecticut .

Robert James Hargrave has pointed out to Language Log that several regional councils in England are prohibiting their employees from using " elitist " Latinate phrases like " bona fide " or " vice versa " The Daily Telegraph has an article about it .
I quote :
Bournemouth Council , which has the Latin motto Pulchritudo et Salubritas , meaning beauty and health , has listed 19 terms it no longer considers acceptable for use .
This includes bona fide , eg ( exempli gratia ) , prima facie , ad lib or ad libitum , etc or et cetera , ie or id est , inter alia , NB or nota bene , per , per se , pro rata , quid pro quo , vis - a - vis , vice versa and even via .
Its list of more verbose alternatives , includes " for this special purpose " , in place of ad hoc and " existing condition " or " state of things " , instead of status quo .
In instructions to staff , the council said : " Not everyone knows Latin .
Many readers do not have English as their first language so using Latin can be particularly difficult . "
I suppose one must applaud , however limply , the thought of council bureaucrats worrying about the needs of employees who are immigrants from Poland or Lithuania or Nigeria who might be perplexed by odd bits of Latin - derived jargon in memos .
But this really smacks of the sort of P.C. nonsense that brings down ridicule on the heads of honest folk working to reduce prejudice .
The first four things that seem to me pathetic about the above story are :
there is surely nothing elitist about via or vice versa or even ad hoc ;
nobody needs to care about the etymologies since they could just as well have come from other languages ( and vis - a - vis actually did : it's an 18th - century borrowing from French ) ;
helping staff to learn the words and phrases needed for the job seems more appropriate than trying to force other staff to censor their vocabulary ; and
if you do decide to censor and simplify , there is no reason to start with renaissance Latin borrowings rather than Greek compound words like neurophysiology or photosynthesis , or for that matter all words longer than four syllables .
We need not worry too much ; widespread mocking of the councils involved has already begun .
I doubt very much whether the useful preposition via is doomed .

Here are some of the things I wish Christians would understand about me and my beliefs :
1 . Please do n’t try to convert me .
In return , I wo n’t foist my atheism on you .
Your chance of success is about the same as the chance someone will successfully convert you to Hinduism .
2 . If you insist on trying , please do not employ a scripture - based argument .
I do n’t believe in scripture , so your argument simply does n’t make any sense to me .
3 . Do n’t ask me to read the Bible .
I ’ve read it .
It ’s one of the main reasons I do n’t believe in it .
4 . I celebrate Christmas and do not feel like a hypocrite .
There are no reindeer , elves or Santas in the Bible .
5 . I have no problem with prayer in public schools .
You can pray any time , anywhere .
I do have a problem with organized prayers endorsed by public schools .
6 . I think nativity displays are pretty .
But they belong on church property , not public property .
They are essentially advertisements for religion .
7 . The Ten Commandments do not belong in public buildings .
I agree that it ’s bad to kill and steal , but the other commandments violate Constitutional rights to freedom of speech and religion .
Post the Bill of Rights in every courthouse instead .
8 . I consider myself a moral person .
I follow an ethical system based the Golden Rule ( which , by the way , is common to Christianity , Judaism , Islam and Buddhism ) .
I believe morality is an outgrowth of rational self - interest and natural altruism .
9 . I sometimes visit churches .
I love the music and traditions and rituals .
I believe it is psychologically healthy to confess your sins , to pray , and to celebrate communion with god or the universe or the force or whatever .
10 . I am not even slightly worried about going to hell .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
After weeks of talks with President - elect Barack Obama 's top aides , House Democrats on Thursday released an expansive economic recovery plan that calls for $ 550 billion in spending and aid to states and $ 275 billion in tax cuts .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said lawmakers tried to assemble a package of measures that would be most effective in stimulating the U.S. economy , which is now in its 14th month of recession .
" We wanted to get the biggest bang for the buck , " she said at a press conference .
Pelosi expressed confidence that Congress would reach the mid-February deadline for getting a bill to Obama 's desk .
But , she noted , " this [ package ] is just the first step . "
The $ 825 billion bill will now be directed to House committees for review and possible changes and later will be sent to conference with the Senate to resolve any differences the chambers may have .
Obama is scheduled to promote the bill on Friday in Ohio , where he 'll speak with workers at a wind turbine factory .
The package calls for more than $ 50 billion to double production of alternative energy .
" This plan is a significant downpayment on our most urgent challenges , " Obama said in a statement .
" [ I ]t will contain the kind of strict , independent oversight that will allow the American people to hold Washington accountable for how and where their tax dollars are spent . "
The House proposal -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment bill -- is likely the most expensive spending plan Congress has ever proposed .
Obama , who takes office on Tuesday , has called it central to stemming what has become the worst economic crisis in decades .
Creating jobs , helping the vulnerable
Obama 's top economic advisers have estimated that the stimulus plan they laid out , which is largely reflected in the House Democrats ' bill , could create or save between 3 million and 4 million jobs by 2010 across a broad array of industries .
But members of Obama 's team and other economists acknowledge that even that level of job creation would n't be a panacea for the economy .
Rather , it would lead to a lesser rate of unemployment than would otherwise be the case if there was no economic recovery package .
The bill includes roughly $ 90 billion to modernize roads , bridges , mass transit and waterways , and over $ 140 billion , mostly to states and localities , to defray their costs for education and to modernize schools .
The bill also calls for a number of measures to help the economically vulnerable .
Among them : $ 27 billion to continue the current extended unemployment benefits program through Dec. 31 ; and another $ 9 billion to increase the average unemployment check by $ 25 a week on top of the roughly $ 300 a week jobless workers currently receive .
There is also a provision calling for $ 30.3 billion to subsidize for 12 months the cost of Cobra health insurance coverage and extend the time eligible workers may keep it .
Cobra coverage allows newly laid off workers to keep health insurance provided by their former employers .
Workers who would be eligible are those 55 and older and those who have at least 10 years ' tenure with their employer .
The bill put together by House Democrats does n't include everything Obama wanted .
After complaints from Democrats in both chambers , negotiators dropped a $ 3,000 - per-hire tax credit that Obama proposed to provide incentives for employers to create jobs in the United States .
Critics said the measure would n't achieve its aim since it was n't large enough to help employers who can't afford a worker 's total compensation in the first place .
But another tax cut -- one aimed at broadening businesses ' ability to write off their losses , called " net operating loss carryback " -- is still in the package , although it 's unclear if it will remain in the final bill .
Although no specifics were offered in the House 's summary of provisions , the package also includes a " Making Work Pay Credit , " which is something that Obama campaigned on .
The credit as Obama described it would provide low - and middle - income workers with a tax cut equal to $ 500 a year for individuals and $ 1,000 for couples .
The money could be delivered fairly quickly to workers , with companies reducing the tax they withhold from employees ' paychecks .
The credit would also be refundable , meaning eligible workers can get it even if they do n't make enough money to owe income tax .
The bill also includes an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit , which is a refundable credit for low - income workers , and an increase in the child tax credit .
Republicans weigh in
While many Republicans in the House and Senate are on board with having a stimulus package , they have been pushing for a different balance of measures , with a much stronger emphasis on tax cuts for businesses and individuals .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , on Thursday characterized the Democrats ' plan as " disappointing . "
" The plan ... was developed with no Republican input and appears to be grounded in the flawed notion that we can simply borrow and spend our way back to prosperity , " Boehner said in a statement .
" It calls for more than half a trillion dollars in questionable new government spending on programs and projects , while providing less tax relief for middle - class families and small businesses than President - elect Obama has proposed . "
Alternative stimulus bill proposals were put forth by the Republican Study Committee on Wednesday .
The proposals called for far more business tax cuts , such reducing the corporate income tax rate .
Obama has said he 's willing to consider any ideas for stimulus that have proven to work in the past , no matter which party proposes them .
The problem is there is more ideological passion about whether tax cuts or government spending works best to create jobs than there is definitive research to settle the question .
But both government spending and tax cuts can prove very expensive in the long run if they are n't successful .
Keeping a close eye on the money
A big concern for all lawmakers has been how the government will oversee the monies given to states or spent on federal projects .
The House Democrats ' bill calls for several measures to ensure transparency and accountability .
Among them , the creation of a special Web site where lawmakers and the public can track how funds are spent , get contact information for the managers of programs receiving funding and a list of contract or grant recipients .
Plus , there would be links to the contracts themselves .
The bill would also require state or local government agencies that receive grant money for operations to post the intended use of the grant money as well as the numbers of jobs saved or created as a result .
The legislation also offers protection to federal and state whistleblowers and calls for those making the funding decisions ( i.e. , governors , mayors and others ) to personally certify that a project has been vetted and that the money spent is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars .
Lastly , the bill calls for the creation of two boards :
A Recovery Act Accountability Board , members of which will include the president 's chief performance officer and others appointed by the heads of federal agencies .
An independent advisory panel to that board , members of which will not be in the federal government but will have expertise in economics , public finance , contracting , accounting , auditing or other relevant fields .

James Bennett recently wrote an article on Python packaging and installation , and Setuptools .
There ’s a lot of issues , and writing up my thoughts could take a long time , but I thought at least I should correct some errors , specifically category errors .
Figuring out where all the pieces in Setuptools ( and pip and virtualenv ) fit is difficult , so I do n’t blame James for making some mistakes , but in the interest of clarifying the discussion …
I will start with a kind of glossary :
Distribution :
This is something - with - a- setup.py .
A tarball , zip , a checkout , etc. Distributions have names ; this is the name in setup( name= " ... " ) in the setup .py file .
They have some other metadata too ( description , version , etc ) , and Setuptools adds to that metadata some .
Distutils does n’t make it very easy to add to the metadata — it ’ll whine a little about things it does n’t know , but wo n’t do anything with that extra data .
Fixing this problem in Distutils is an important aspect of Setuptools , and part of what Distutils itself unsuitable as a basis for good library management .
package / module :
This is something you import .
It is not the same as a distribution , though usually a distribution will have the same name as a package .
In my own libraries I try to name the distribution with mixed case ( like Paste ) and the package with lower case ( like paste ) .
Keeping the terminology straight here is very difficult ; and usually it does n’t matter , but sometimes it does .
Setuptools The Distribution :
This is what you install when you install Setuptools .
It includes several pieces that Phillip Eby wrote , that work together but are not strictly a single thing .
setuptools The Package : This is what you get when you do import setuptools .
Setuptools largely works by monkeypatching distutils , so simply importing setuptools activates its functionality from then on .
This package is entirely focused on installation and package management , it is not something you should use at runtime ( unless you are installing packages as your runtime , of course ) .
pkg_resources
The Module : This is also included in Setuptools The Distribution , and is for use at runtime .
This is a single module that provides the ability to query what distributions are installed , metadata about those distributions , information about the location where they are installed .
It also allows distributions to be “ activated ” .
A distribution can be available but not activated .
Activating a distribution means adding its location to sys.path , and probably you ’ve noticed how long sys. path is when you use easy_install .
Almost everything that allows different libraries to be installed , or allows different versions of libraries , does it through some management of sys.path .
pkg_resources also allows for generic access to “ resources ” ( i.e. , non-code files ) , and let ’s those resources be in zip files .
pkg_resources is safe to use , it does n’t do any of the funny stuff that people get annoyed with .
easy_install : This is also in Setuptools The Distribution .
The basic functionality it provides is that given a name , it can search for package with that distribution name , and also satisfying a version requirement .
It then downloads the package , installs it ( using setup.py install , but with the setuptools monkeypatches in place ) .
After that , it checks the newly installed distribution to see if it requires any other libraries that are n’t yet installed , and if so it installs them .
Eggs the Distribution Format :
These are zip files that Setuptools creates when you run python setup.py bdist_egg .
Unlike a tarball , these can be binary packages , containing compiled modules , and generally contain .pyc files ( which are portable across platforms , but not Python versions ) .
This format only includes files that will actually be installed ; as a result it does not include doc files or setup.py itself .
All the metadata from setup.py that is needed for installation is put in files in a directory EGG - INFO .
Eggs the Installation Format : Eggs the Distribution Format are a subset of the Installation Format .
That is , if you put an Egg zip file on the path , it is installed , no other process is necessary .
But the Installation Format is more general .
To have an egg installed , you either need something like DistroName - X.Y. egg / on the path , and then an EGG - INFO / directory under that with the metadata , or a path like DistroName. egg - info / with the metadata directly in that directory .
This metadata can exist anywhere , and does n’t have to be directly alongside the actual Python code .
Egg directories are required for pkg_resources to activate and deactivate distributions , but otherwise they are n’t necessary .
pip :
This is an alternative to easy_install .
It works somewhat differently than easy_install , but not much .
Mostly it is better than easy_install , in that it has some extra features and is easier to use .
Unlike easy_install , it downloads all distributions up - front , and generates the metadata to read distribution and version requirements .
It uses Setuptools to generate this metadata from a setup.py file , and uses pkg_resources to parse this metadata .
It then installs packages with the setuptools monkeypatches applied .
It just happens to use an option python setup .py -- single - version - externally - managed , which gets Setuptools to install packages in a more flat manner , with Distro.egg - info / directories alongside the package .
Pip installs eggs !
I ’ve heard the many complaints about easy_install ( and I ’ve had many myself ) , but ultimately I think pip does well by just fixing a few small issues .
Pip is not a repudiation of Setuptools or the basic mechanisms that easy_install uses .
PoachEggs :
This is a defunct package that had some of the features of pip ( particularly requirement files ) but used easy_install for installation .
Do n’t bother with this , it was just a bridge to get to pip .
virtualenv :
This is a little hack that creates isolated Python environments .
It ’s based on virtual - python.py , which is something I wrote based on some documentation notes PJE wrote for Setuptools .
Basically virtualenv just creates a bin / python interpreter that has its own value of sys.prefix , but uses the system Python and standard library .
It also installs Setuptools to make it easier to bootstrap the environment ( because bootstrapping Setuptools is itself a bit tedious ) .
I ’ll add pip to it too sometime .
Using virtualenv you do n’t have to worry about different library versions , because for any one environment you will probably only need one version of a library .
On any one machine you probably need different versions , which is why installing packages system - wide is problematic for most libraries .
( I ’ve been meaning to write a post on why I think using system packaging for libraries is counter - productive , but that ’ll wait for another time . )
So … there ’s the pieces involved , at least the ones I can remember now .
And I have n’t really discussed . pth files , entry points , sys.path trickery , site.py , distutils.cfg … sadly this is a complex state of affairs , but it was also complex before Setuptools .
There are a few things that I think people really dislike about Setuptools .
First , zip files .
Setuptools prefers zip files , for reasons that wo n’t mean much to you , and maybe are more historical than anything .
When a distribution does n’t indicate if it is zip - safe , Setuptools looks at the code and sees if it uses __file__ , an if not it presumes that the code is probably zip - safe .
The specific problem James cites is what appears to be a bug in Django , that Django looks for code and ca n’t traverse into zip files in the same way that Python itself can .
Setuptools did n’t itself add anything to Python to make it import zip files , that functionality was added to Python some time before .
The zipped eggs that Setuptools installs are using existing ( standard ! )
Python functionality .
That said , I do n’t think zipping libraries up is all that useful , and while it should work , it does n’t always , and it makes code harder to inspect and understand .
So since it ’s not that useful , I ’ve disabled it when pip installs packages .
I also have had it disabled on my own system for years now , by creating a distutils.cfg file with [ easy_install ] zip_ok =
False in it .
Sadly App
Engine is forcing me to use zip files again , because of its absurdly small file limits … but that ’s a different topic .
( There is an experimental pip zip command mostly intended for App Engine . )
Another pain point is version management with setup.py and Setuptools .
Indeed it is easy to get things messed up , and it is easy to piss people off by overspecifying , and sometimes things can get in a weird state for no good reason ( often because of easy_install ’s rather naive leap - before - you - look installation order ) .
Pip fixes that last point , but it also tries to suggest more constructive and less painful ways to manage other pieces .
Pip requirement files are an assertion of versions that work together .
setup.py requirements ( the Setuptools requirements ) should contain two things : 1 : all the libraries used by the distribution ( without which there ’s no way it ’ll work ) and 2 : exclusions of the versions of those libraries that are known not to work .
setup.py requirements should not be viewed as an assertion that by satisfying those requirements everything will work , just that it might work .
Only the end developer , testing the system together , can figure out if it really works .
Then pip gives you a way to record that working set ( using pip freeze ) , separate from any single distribution or library .
There ’s also a lot of conflicts between Setuptools and package maintainers .
This is kind of a proxy war between developers and sysadmins , who have very different motivations .
It deserves a post of its own , but the conflicts are about more than just how Setuptools is implemented .
I ’d love if there was a language - neutral library installation and management tool that really worked .
Linux system package managers are absolutely not that tool ; frankly it is absurd to even consider them as an alternative .
So for now we do our best in our respective language communities .
If we ’re going to move forward , we ’ll have to acknowledge what ’s come before , and the reasoning for it .

DALLAS – Successful terrorist organizations throughout history have used social wings as a means of building popular support , an internationally - recognized terrorism expert said Thursday .
Bruce Hoffman , a professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University 's School of Foreign Service and a former Scholar - in - Residence at the CIA , testified in the trial of five men accused of funneling millions of dollars to social support organizations controlled by Hamas .
Hoffman 's testimony did not delve into specific charges or evidence against the former officials of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) .
Rather , Hoffman was a prosecution expert , outlining the structure of terrorist movements like Hizballah in Lebanon and the Irish Republican Army .
Terrorist organizations that do not have a social arm , said Hoffman , historically are the " least consequential . "
" Is charity in the hand of a terrorist organization a good thing or a bad thing ? " asked federal prosecutor Barry Jonas .
" Absolutely a bad thing , " said Hoffman , author of Inside Terrorism .
Charity by terrorist organizations is different from those of truly charitable organizations because a terrorist organization 's deeds are " self - serving . "
In other words , Hoffman said , terrorist organizations perform charitable work in order to " exercise control over the population . "
For example , most terrorist groups with social arms run or support schools and hospitals .
That allows them to indoctrinate the local population and gain their support .
The five HLF defendants are accused of conspiring to provide material support to Hamas , designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 1995 and in a separate designation two years later .
HLF routed millions of dollars to Palestinian charities , known as zakat committees that prosecutors say were controlled by Hamas .
Defense attorneys argue that the men were merely offering supplies – financial support for widows and orphans , medical supplies and school needs – to needy Palestinians .
Defense attorneys all passed when given a chance to cross examine Hoffman .
Earlier , attorney Nancy Hollander , who represents former HLF Executive Director Shukri Abu Baker , asked FBI agent Lara Burns on cross examination whether she had seen evidence that the Palestinians receiving HLF support were in desperate need of assistance .
At another point , Burns was asked about book bags HLF sent to Palestinian schoolchildren .
Hoffman 's testimony offered a stark contrast to the defense 's arguments , by demonstrating how HLF 's charitable work fit into a larger perspective .
Viewed in this context , HLF could be seen as part of the " social wing " of Hamas , which was designed to win the hearts and minds of the people for Hamas .
While Hamas purports to be divided into social , political and militant wings , U.S. law prohibits providing support to any of them .
Burns ' cross examination followed her second stint on the witness stand for this trial .
In her second testimony , she helped summarize dozens of prosecution exhibits , trying to show how they tie the defendants and the zakat committees to Hamas .
Her cross examination lasted a day and a half and often was tedious .
Unlike Burns ' testimony , Hoffman 's was free of exhibits and moved faster .
A mistrial was declared a year ago after jurors could not reach unanimous verdicts on most counts against the defendants .
Some jurors indicated there was not enough evidence to show the men did anything but provide charity .
Hoffman did not testify in that trial .
His testimony marks another adjustment in the prosecution 's case since then .
Burns ' return to the stand is another .
Last week , jurors heard from a former HLF insider , who testified that he was sure money he routed to HLF would ultimately benefit Hamas .
The trial is in recess until Monday .

The most infamous riot in the history of the performing arts began with the violins in Stravinsky 's " The Rite of Spring . " 
But more remarkable than the fistfight was the way the piece revolutionized classical music and ballet .
On the night of May 29 , 1913 , an elegant Parisian crowd assembled for the first performance of Igor Stravinsky 's eagerly anticipated new ballet , " The Rite of Spring . " 
The opening seemed promising , but then the violins kicked in with a pulsing chord so dissonant that it made spectators wince .
As the orchestra continued , the audience hissed and booed .
They rose to their feet and shouted — some defending the music , but most denouncing it .
People began whacking each other with canes , umbrellas , and , before long , bare fists .
Stravinsky 's musical revolution had arrived .
Prelude to " The Rite " 
By one account , the idea for " The Rite of Spring "  came to Stravinsky in a dream .
He envisioned a pagan rebirth ritual , with people throwing themselves before vengeful gods .
Rather than a cheerful celebration of springtime , it was a dark and superstitious rite .
To compose music appropriate for such a vision , Stravinsky tossed aside convention and broke new ground in rhythm and harmony .
He constructed atonal chords never heard before and developed a meter so complex that he struggled to accurately record it on paper .
At times in the piece , parts of the orchestra actually seem to be playing against each other .
Stravinsky first performed " The Rite of Spring "  for ballet director Sergei Diaghilev and orchestra conductor Pierre Monteux .
Both men were shocked and overwhelmed .
Later , Monteux wrote that he did n't understand one note of it and wanted to flee the room .
Nevertheless , plans for the ballet got under way .
Diaghilev entrusted the choreography to dance phenom Vaslav Nijinsky , whose steps proved just as inspired as the music .
The first signs of trouble came during rehearsals .
The ballerinas complained that Nijinsky 's flat - footed , straight - knee jumps jarred them to their bones , and the musicians struggled to keep up with Stravinsky 's galloping pace .
At one point , after practicing a particularly dissonant section , the orchestra could n't help but burst into nervous laughter .
The Least Quiet of Riots
On opening night , the scene was chaotic .
Only minutes into the performance , the audience 's reaction was so loud that the ballerinas could n't hear the music .
Horrified , Stravinsky fled backstage to find Nijinsky standing on a chair desperately calling out the time for the dancers .
Meanwhile , Diaghilev was frantically turning on and off the house lights in an attempt to pacify the crowd .
By intermission , the police had arrived , and the theater manager took to the stage , begging the audience to calm down .
The truth is that the spectators were reacting as much to the dancing as to the music .
" The Rite of Spring "  contained no elegant arabesques or ballerinas in tutus .
Instead , the dancers moved more with their hips than their feet , evoking something raw and primitive .
What 's more , they dressed as pagan tribesmen , wearing rough tunics and stylized masks on their faces .
It was the antithesis of classical ballet .
In one scene , the dancers encircle a girl who stands transfixed with fear .
Tribal elders swarm around this " chosen one "  until she begins to leap frantically into the air .
Her dance becomes more and more frenzied until she finally collapses dead — a ritual sacrifice to spring .
After the Revolution
For several more nights , Diaghilev and Nijinsky performed " The Rite "  to outraged Parisians .
Stravinsky , however , grew too sick to attend .
Five days after the ballet 's premiere , he fell dangerously ill with typhoid fever .
But the following March , the piece was played again in Paris as an orchestral work ( without the ballet ) .
This time , instead of rioting , the audience cheered and then carried the composer aloft on their shoulders .
These days , " The Rite of Spring "  is more likely to elicit polite applause .
The innovations that made it revolutionary nearly a century ago are staples of dance and music today .
In the world of ballet , " The Rite "  introduced the idea that dance did n't have to be refined to be significant , and Nijinsky 's choreography deeply influenced modern dance pioneers , such as Martha Graham .
In the realm of music , the impact was just as profound , advancing the notion that abrasive music could also be beautiful .
The genius of the piece is that it contains all the basic principles of a successful composition — compelling melodies , dynamic rhythms , contrast , repetition — while also pushing them to extremes .
After the scandalous riot , it only took a few short years for " The Rite of Spring "  to be widely embraced .
By the 1920s , it was being performed in the United States , and by the 1940s , it had become background music in a Disney movie .
By expanding the boundaries of acceptability , Stravinsky made room for all the dissonant music of the 20th century , from Arnold Schoenberg to Sonic Youth , and changed the definition of music forever .
The Mouse & The Musician In 1940 , " The Rite of Spring "  took a big leap from avant - garde to mainstream when Stravinsky let Walt Disney use the piece for an animated movie .
In the score of Fantasia , a truncated version of " The Rite "  plays during the scenes depicting the beginning of life on Earth , from the primordial ooze to the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Years later , Stravinsky wrote critically about Disney , claiming the film company had pressured him into licensing the rights to the music .
He went on to describe the performance as " a dangerous misunderstanding "  of his composition .
Disney representatives were baffled and offended .
In response , they released photos of Stravinsky in the studio holding up animation mockups and smiling .

Here 's a recreation of the original from the Joffrey Ballet :
“ Spooky action at a distance ” is how Albert Einstein famously derided the concept of quantum entanglement — where objects can become linked and instantaneously influence one another regardless of distance .
Now researchers suggest that this spooky action in a way might work even beyond the grave , with its effects felt after the link between objects is broken .
In experiments with quantum entanglement , which is an essential basis for quantum computing and cryptography , physicists rely on pairs of photons .
Measuring one of an entangled pair immediately affects its counterpart , no matter how far apart they are theoretically .
The current record distance is 144 kilometers , from La Palma to Tenerife in the Canary Islands .
In practice , entanglement is an extremely delicate condition .
Background disturbances readily destroy the state — a bane for quantum computing in particular , because calculations are done only as long as the entanglement lasts .
But for the first time , quantum physicist Seth Lloyd of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that memories of entanglement can survive its destruction .
He compares the effect to Emily Brontë ’s novel Wuthering Heights : “ the spectral Catherine communicates with her quantum Heathcliff as a flash of light from beyond the grave . ”
The insight came when Lloyd investigated what happened if entangled photons were used for illumination .
One might suppose they could help take better pictures .
For instance , flash photography shines light out and creates images from photons that are reflected back from the object to be imaged , but stray photons from other objects could get mistaken for the returning signals , fuzzing up snapshots .
If the flash emitted entangled photons instead , it would presumably be easier to filter out noise signals by matching up returning photons to linked counterparts kept as references .
Still , given how fragile entanglement is , Lloyd did not expect quantum illumination to ever work .
But “ I was desperate , ” he recalls , keen on winning funding from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ’s sensor program for imaging in noisy environments .
Surprisingly , when Lloyd calculated how well quantum illumination might perform , it apparently not only worked , but “ to gain the full enhancement of quantum illumination , all entanglement must be destroyed , ” he explains .
Lloyd admits this finding is baffling — and not just to him .
Prem Kumar , a quantum physicist at Northwestern University , was skeptical of any benefits from quantum illumination until he saw Lloyd ’s math .
“ Everyone ’s trying to get their heads around this .
It ’s posing more questions than answers , ” Kumar states .
“ If entanglement does not survive , but you can seem to accrue benefits from it , it may now be up to theorists to see if entanglement is playing a role in these advantages or if there is some other factor involved . ”
As a possible explanation , Lloyd suggests that although entanglement between the photons might technically be completely lost , some hint of it may remain intact after a measurement .
“ You can think of photons as a mixture of states .
While most of these states are no longer entangled , one or a few remain entangled , and it is this little bit in the mixture that is responsible for this effect , ” he remarks .
If quantum illumination works , Lloyd suggests it could boost the sensitivity of radar and x-ray systems as well as optical telecommunications and microscopy by a millionfold or more .
It could also lead to stealthier military scanners because they could work even when using weaker signals , making them easier to conceal from adversaries .
Lloyd and his colleagues detailed a proposal for practical implementation of quantum illumination in a paper submitted in 2008 to Physical Review Letters building off theoretical work presented in the September 12 Science .
Actually proving this effect may be the real challenge .
The easy part is creating entangled photons : just shoot light through a special , “ downconverting ” crystal that acts as a beam splitter ; it produces separate yet linked rays .
One ray illuminates the object , and the other serves as a reference .
The returning and reference beams then are merged together ( basically , by making them go through a splitter in reverse ) ; the photons that were entangled should be more likely to recombine , or “ upconvert . ”
But any experiment to prove that quantum illumination can boost the sensitivity of imaging has to use weak signals , and creating materials capable of upconverting faint beams with high efficiency is technically daunting , Kumar says .
Still , Lloyd predicts experimental tests of this scheme might come later this year .
Besides boosting imaging sensitivity , the effect might confer benefits on quantum computing or quantum cryptography , Kumar suspects .
“ The quantum world is quite exotic and complex , and this shows there are surprises there that lurk around corners all the time , ” he says .

Now that the Windows 7 beta is out , the benchmarks are coming fast and furious , and while 7's been previously found to best XP and Vista during " real - world " tasks , it looks like XP is still the outright speed champ on current hardware .
That 's at least the word according to InfoWorld , which pitted all three systems against each other in a suite of tests designed to suss out how each performed on modern multicore systems , and while we wo n't pretend to grok all the data , there 's nothing complicated about the final results , which showed that " any illusions about Windows 7 somehow being leaner or more efficient than Vista can now be thrown out the window . "
Sure , there was some speedup -- 7 was 60 percent faster than Vista during the dual - core workflow tests -- but overall , 7's just slower on dual - and quad - core hardware than XP .
However , there 's a silver lining here : InfoWorld says the slowdown is in large part due to the extra code Vista and 7 use to manage multicore processors , and as the number of cores increase , the corresponding performance gains are much bigger than with XP since they can be used more efficiently .
Of course , by the time we 're all sitting pretty with 48 - core Larrabee machines this all might be just a distant memory , so for right now we 're just going to get back to installing the Windows 7 beta on anything we can find and reveling in the glory of perceived speedups .
Read - Analysis I ( against Vista alone ) Read - Analysis II ( against Vista and XP ) :
The author of one of our sources here has seen been released from InfoWorld due to breach of trust .
InfoWorld maintains that Randall C. Kennedy 's " insight and analysis [ is believed ] to be accurate and reliable . "
< asdftimo > hey roconnor , what do you think about this function for determining if a given number is prime :
< asdftimo > isprime n=not ( elem 0 $ map ( \x -> mod n x ) $ takeWhile ( \x -> x ^2 <= n ) ( 2:[ 3,5.. ] )
< roconnor > asdftimo : that 's not a bad start
< roconnor > asdftimo : it would be better if you test only prime numbers instead of 2 and the odd numbers
< asdftimo > im using isprime to generate
< asdftimo > primelist = [ x | x <- 2:[ 3,5.. ] , isprime x ]
< asdftimo > yeah , im going to then use this list to find prime factors
< roconnor > how about primelist = 2 :[x | x <-[ 3,5.. ] , isprime x ]
< asdftimo > i do n't understand why that is an improvement
< roconnor > and then use takeWhile ( \x -> x ^2 <= n ) primelist in your isprime
< asdftimo > roconnor : that 's kind of strange , since they both point to each other , but i guess i'll go try that ...
< roconnor > :)
< roconnor > you need to pull the 2 : out in front in order for the recursive definition to get going .
< roconnor > kinda like a starter motor on an engine
< asdftimo > roconnor : that is fucking cool
< asdftimo > it works
< asdftimo > i love haskell
< asdftimo > it is going to take me another good 5 mins to comprehend this , but i can tell it is pretty amazing
The worst part of breaking a bone ( besides the pain ) is the healing process .
Wearing an uncomfortable cast can be irritating and aggravating , making it harder to move around for months at a time .
Well , that process may soon change .
A company has developed a product called “ Injectable Bone ” that may repair the broken bone in minutes .
The U.K. company , called RegenTec , has created a white powder that is designed to be injected into a person in order to speed up the healing process of broken bones .
“ You wo n't be able to just walk out of a hospital with a broken leg , ” said Robin Quirk , a professor at the University of Nottingham and co-developer of the technology .
“ What we are trying to do in the short term is have something that fills the void left by a break that acts like normal spongy bone and encourages natural regeneration . ”
Injectable Bone is a mix of ceramic and polylactic acid .
On the outside , it looks like white powder .
When injected into the body with a needle , the higher temperature inside causes the two components to mix together to form a hard , spongy mass similar to bones in the body .
While there are already other products similar to Injectable Bone , those products experience some problems in that they harden into a solid mass or raise body temperature enough to damage other tissue in the immediate area .
Researchers state that Injectable Bone could actually promote bone growth by adding different mixtures in with the powder .
“ We can actually control the rate of degradation to tailor it to the individual 's healing , ” said Quirk .
While Injectable Bone is n’t meant to permanently replace bone , it does work to give the body time to repair itself .
The creators of the product say that it could also possible be used to replace metal pins currently used in surgery .
RegenTec hopes to have Injectable Bone available within 18 months , but is currently waiting for FDA approval .

WASHINGTON - U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday raised concerns about the U.S. military 's increased use of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , and said KBR and other companies should be held accountable for the electrocution deaths of U.S. soldiers and other mistakes .
Democratic Sens. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said the Army recently told the mother of a U.S. soldier that her son's electrocution death in Iraq was not accidental , but a " negligent homicide " by contractor KBR and two of its supervisors .
" Soldiers have died .
Someone needs to be accountable for that , " Dorgan told a news conference , describing the Pentagon 's use of contractors in Iraq a " huge mess . "
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said the company 's investigation had produced no evidence linking the company to the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , who died from electrocution while taking a shower at his Baghdad base .
" KBR takes exception to the senators ' assertion that we have been derelict in our duties to protect the troops , " she said , pledging continued cooperation with the investigation .
Sen . Carl Levin , the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee , repeatedly questioned Defense Secretary Robert Gates at a hearing Tuesday about the use of contractors to protect U.S. facilities in war zones .
Such work was " an inherently governmental function , " he said .
" It should not be performed by contractors . "
Gates told the committee the U.S. military would need to continue using private contractors to provide security in Afghanistan , at least until U.S. troop levels there increased .
But he said he was creating a supervisory structure to oversee the work of private contractors in Afghanistan , based on an oversight body built up in Iraq over the past year .
" We 're trying to take the lessons learned out of Iraq over the last couple of years in terms of the lack of oversight , and transfer that to Afghanistan , " Gates said , adding that a broad study was underway about the use of private contractors .

He declined to comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday which said U.S. troops had come into conflict with private security companies in Afghanistan , and some employees were taking orders from the Taliban .
Last month , five security guards who worked for North Carolina - based Blackwater , the largest security contractor in Iraq , were charged with killing 14 unarmed civilians and wounding 20 others in a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that outraged Iraqis and strained U.S. - Iraqi relations .
Gates did not address the electrocution death or the Blackwater incident directly .
But he said the use of contractors " grew willy - nilly in Iraq after 2003 . "
" All of a sudden , we had a very large number of people over there and ... as became clear , inadequate capacity to monitor them , " Gates told the committee .
He said training was one area that could be done legitimately and less expensively by contractors , but there had not been any coherent strategy thus far on " what we will allow contractors to do and what we wo n't allow contractors to do . "
Gates said the military also needed to decide what to do with large quantities of U.S. government - owned equipment now being operated by private contractors , particularly once the United States began drawing down its forces in Iraq .
" All of this is going to require a high level of supervision and I think we need to think pretty quickly and ... with some agility in the Department of Defense to make sure that we get this right , " Gates said .
Dorgan and Casey said they asked Gates to meet with them and Cheryl Harris , Maseth 's mother , after an Army investigator told Harris in a December email that two KBR employees and the company itself could be criminally liable for Maseth 's death .
Dorgan , who heads the Senate Democratic Policy Committee , said he has chaired 18 oversight hearings on contracting abuses and corruption in Iraq and Afghanistan , exposing " billions of dollars in wasteful spending , " shoddy work by private contractors , and unsafe water supplies .

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation also released a statement saying there was no indication of risk unless the ash was ingested .
Image
The area around the Kingston Fossil Plant in Harriman , Tenn. , where 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash spilled on Monday .
But residents like Deanna Copeland were thinking further into the future .
“ Our concern is , what happens if this liquid dries out ? ” Ms. Copeland said .
“ There are huge health concerns .
It ’s going to get in our house .
We ’re going to breathe it in .
It would be like walking through a dust bowl , and we do n’t know what ’s in the dust . ”
A round - the - clock cleanup effort continued on Friday , much of it clearing roads and railway tracks that were blocked by the sludge .
Several booms , or skimmers , were installed on nearby rivers to catch floating cenospheres , a valuable component of the ash used to make bowling balls and other manufactured goods .
A weir , or underwater dam , that would keep settled ash from moving downstream was about one - fifth completed , T.V.A. officials said .
Some nearby residents said that the authority had done little to address their concerns .
“ We ’re terribly frustrated , ” said Donald Smith , 58 , a laboratory facilities manager who lives in the affected area .
“ It seems like T.V.A. is just throwing darts at the problem , and they do n’t have a clue how to really fix it .
“ It was nice that they came by to talk to us .
They ’re making an effort .
But what upsets me is they did n’t have a plan in place .
Why had n’t anybody thought , ‘ What happens if this thing bursts ? ’ ”
Residents said they were stunned by the new figure for the size of the spill .
“ That ’s scary to know that they can be off by that much , ” said Angela Spurgeon , whose dock and yard are swamped with ash .
“ I do n’t think it was intentional , but it upsets me to know that a number was given of what the pond could hold , and the number now is more than double . ”
Authority officials offered little explanation for the discrepancy , saying the initial number was an estimate based on their information at the time .

Here is a simple , stone cold fact .
You cannot read or hear the truth about what is happening in Gaza from any corporate media in the United States .
The only thing you will find there are regurgitations of Israeli spin , which are themselves only regurgitations of the kind of spin that American militarists have put on their own depredations -- for centuries now .
Up and down the American media and political establishments , you will find nothing but bleatings about Israel being " forced " to launch its vicious blunderbuss attacks against heavily populated Gaza because of the " recent spate of Hamas bombings " since the end of a six - month ceasefire .
This is of course a damnable and deliberate lie .
Papers in Israel -- in Israel , but not the United States -- are reporting the truth : the murderous assault on Gaza was planned not only before the six - month ceasefire ended -- it was planned before the cease - fire even took effect .
Indeed , the cease - fire was part of the military plan to decimate the civilian areas of Gaza ; it was a hoax , a scam , a deliberate feint to buy time for military preparations -- precisely the same strategy followed by the Bush Regime ( and its bipartisan Establishment supporters ) in " going to the UN " to seek a " peaceful solution " to the " Iraqi crisis " -- when the invasion was already in the works .
Haaretz reports on the Israel 's deceit in the latest outrage , in the aptly titled piece , " Disinformation , secrecy and lies : How the Gaza offensive came about " :
Long - term preparation , careful gathering of information , secret discussions , operational deception and the misleading of the public - all these stood behind the Israel Defense Forces " Cast Lead " operation against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip , which began Saturday morning .
he disinformation effort , according to defense officials , took Hamas by surprise and served to significantly increase the number of its casualties in the strike .
Sources in the defense establishment said Defense Minister Ehud Barak instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the operation over six months ago , even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with Hamas .
According to the sources , Barak maintained that although the lull would allow Hamas to prepare for a showdown with Israel , the Israeli army needed time to prepare , as well ..
The story also notes that the recent racheting of tension was sparked , deliberately , by a heavy - handed Israeli incursion into Gaza :
The plan of action that was implemented in Operation Cast Lead remained only a blueprint until a month ago , when tensions soared after the IDF carried out an incursion into Gaza during the ceasefire to take out a tunnel which the army said was intended to facilitate an attack by Palestinian militants on IDF troops ....
While Barak was working out the final details with the officers responsible for the operation , Livni went to Cairo to inform Egypt 's president , Hosni Mubarak , that Israel had decided to strike at Hamas .
In parallel , Israel continued to send out disinformation in announcing it would open the crossings to the Gaza Strip and that Olmert would decide whether to launch the strike following three more deliberations on Sunday - one day after the actual order to launch the operation was issued .
" Hamas evacuated all its headquarter personnel after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday , " one defense official said , " but the organization sent its people back in when they heard that everything was put on hold until Sunday . "
Not only did this deception lead Hamas to send its officials back to work -- it also meant that there was no general warning to the masses of civilians packed like sardines into Gaza 's hellish confines .
It meant that civilian casualties would be maximized -- especially when the initial assault was launched in the middle of the day , with thousands of schoolchildren out at their lesson .
As Glenn Greenwald notes , Israel 's massive bombing of civilian areas -- even if couched in terms of " retaliation " for scattershot strikes on Israeli territory by a political faction -- constitutes " a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions . "
Greenwald also adroitly turns Barack Obama 's campaign kowtowing to Israeli militarism on its head :
[ Obama on the campaign trail ] : " The first job of any nation state is to protect its citizens .
And so I can assure you that if -- I do n't even care if I was a politician -- if somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
Ca n't the exact same mentality be deployed to justify everything Hamas has done and is doing , to wit : " if a foreign power were brutally occupying my country for four decades -- or blockading my country and denying my children medical needs and nutrition and the ability even to exit -- I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
And I would expect Palestinians to do the same thing " ?
But the last thing that our political class ever extends is reciprocal , two - sided analysis to this dispute .
What is the ultimate context of this carnage ?
The fact that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine had their land taken away from them by force -- not in some ancient , historic era , but within the lifetime of many thousands of Palestinians still living .
I hold no brief for Hamas ; like the Angry Arab , whose coverage of the conflict has been relentless and penetrating , I do n't care for any party based on religious extremism .
But as Greenwald notes , every action taken by Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups could be characterized as " retaliation " for the theft of their land , not to mention the war crime of collective punishment and genocidal blockades visited upon the Occupied Territories for years .
But there is not a single peep of this perspective from America 's ruling class and its media courtiers .
Of course , it is a bit much to expect a nation which itself was built on land theft , repression and slaughter to see anything wrong or " disproportionate " in Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians .
What else are you supposed to do when those dang heathen savages come around with their war parties and tomahawks , trying to get back the land that God Almighty has granted to good white folk ?
Meanwhile , here 's what Israel 's " Manifest Destiny " looks like on the ground in Gaza .
From the Maan News Agency ( via the Angry Arab , as was the photo above ) :
Frank Clifford was a reporter and editor for the Los Angeles Times from 1982 until 2007 , covering government and politics , including two presidential campaigns , before focusing on environmental issues .
As the paper 's editor for environmental news from 2001 to 2007 he was in charge of a series of articles on the impacts of worldwide ocean pollution , for which his paper won a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism in 2007 .
He is the author of one book , The Backbone of the World : A Portrait of the Vanishing West Along the Continental Divide ( 2002 / Broadway Books ) .
Clifford currently works as a freelance writer based in Santa Fe , New Mexico .

What drew you to write about the wolves ?
Smithsonian offered me the assignment two months after wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains had been removed from Endangered Species Act protection .
During that time more than 40 wolves that ranged outside of Yellowstone Park had been killed .
Their future clearly hinged on people 's willingness to leave them alone if they were n't doing any harm .
Extinct in the region since the 1930s , wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995 .
The economy and the ecology of the area both benefitted as the new wolves attracted more visitors to the area and reduced the size of huge elk herds that had been crowding out native plants and animals .
But as the park 's wolf population grew , many of the animals left the park and some of them preyed on livestock .
This story explores a question raised by that reintroduction .
We brought back wolves partly out of nostalgia for the wildness of a long gone frontier .
Now that wolves are back among us , how much wildness are we willing to tolerate ?
What surprised you the most while covering this story ?
The debate over wolf protection has been passionate at times , but the attitudes toward wolves by people who live closest to them are not always cut and dried .
The hostility traditionally expressed by western livestock associations and local elected officials does n't reflect the views of many residents , including some ranchers , who search for ways to coexist with wild predators , including wolves and grizzly bears .
Did you have any favorite moments that did n’t make it to the final draft ?
At the end of a long day wandering around the park , looking for wolves and not finding any , I 'd returned to my car and started driving toward the exit when I found myself staring at several members of a wolf pack arrayed across the road , 50 feet in front of me , like a welcoming committee .
Nine in all , there were pups and grown - ups , some howling , some playing , others just sitting on their haunches watching me approach .
It was clear to me in an instant why nearly 100,000 people say they come to Yellowstone each year just to see wolves .
The promised unveiling of the polygraph results was used as a suspense - building device
Dr. Phil McGraw gets to the polygraph in the 4th quarter of the show
Dr. Phil : Well , Drew Peterson has been living under an umbrella of suspicion in the death of his third wife and the disappearance of his fourth wife .
Now , he says that he 's been portrayed as sinister in the media , but says that he is innocent of any wrongdoing in either one of those circumstances .
Now he recently submitted to a polygraph examination to help try and clear his name .
Well , let 's take a look at Drew 's polygraph results .
Three out of the six answers that Drew gave regarding Stacy 's disappearance were found to be deceptive .
First two questions
Dr. Phil :
The first question , " On Sunday , October 28th 2007 , did you last see your wife Stacy in your home before going to bed after coming home from work ? "
And the answer was , " Yes . "
And it was scored as a deceptive answer .
That that was not truthful .
It was deceptive that that 's when you last saw your wife .
Any thought or comment on why that would come up deceptive if you 're telling the truth ?
Drew Peterson stays cool as a cucumber
Drew Peterson : I answered truthfully and I have no idea why it came up deceptive .
Third question
Dr. Phil :
The next question , " Do you know the whereabouts of your wife Stacy ? "
Answer : " No . " Results : " deceptive . "
Next question , " Did you receive a phone call from your wife , Stacy , on the evening of October 28th , 2007 , telling you that she was leaving you ? "
You answered " Yes " and the result was " deceptive . "
Now , any thought , theory or idea as to why that would come up deceptive if you were telling the truth ?
Drew Peterson : I have no idea .
I can't even answer for it .
Retired FBI polygrapher Jack Trimarco
Dr. Phil : Now , I want to introduce Jack Trimarco .
Jack Trimarco is one of the most recognized and respected polygraph examiners in the United States .
I want to get his opinion on what Drew 's polygraph results suggest or reveal , and I want to say , there were three more questions that were answered that showed no deception .
I 'm going to read those questions and the results in just a minute , but let 's talk about these three .
Jack , what 's the reliability of this kind of test , and what 's the variability of this kind of test .
Jack Trimarco : Well , Dr. Phil ...
Everything depends on the examiner .
When a qualified , experienced , honest polygraph examiner conducts an exam , you expect , based on studies , a 93 percent validity rate .
First two questions Peterson passed
Dr. Phil :
Well , let 's talk about the rest of these questions that came up .
Question : " Did you have any involvement in the physical removal of your wife , Stacy , from your home on Sunday , October 28th 2007 ? "
Answer : " No . " Results : " No deception . "
Question : " Did you in any way physically harm your wife , Stacy , during the time that she disappeared ? "
Answer : " No . " Results : " No deception . "
Question : " Did your wife , Stacy , call you on Sunday , October 28th 2007 and tell you that if you wanted the car , it was parked at the Clow Airport ? "
Answer : " Yes . "
Results : " No deception . "
Third question Peterson passed
Dr. Phil : Now , one of the things I 'm concerned about is this call , uh , about the car being left at the airport , which occurred on , again , according to the same night [ sic ] , says " no deception , " but the other question , uh , about the call coming in , says that it was deceptive .
( Facing Jack Trimarco )
How would that occur within the same protocol , because this is talking about the same phone call , the same time , the same night .
How would one be deceptive and the other not unless the test is just ... not valid ?
Jack Trimarco : I would like to know who hired the polygraph examiner .
Drew Peterson 's Lawyer , Joel Brodsky
Dr. Phil : ( Facing Peterson 's attorney , Joel Brodsky ) Joel , comment ?
Joel Brodsky : Lee McCord is the polygraph examiner that I hired .
We paid him a standard fee of five hundred dollars per examination .
He did them on two successive Sundays .
He took , you know , two hours of pre-examination before he 's gotten to the questions .
He 's been an examiner in Chicago for 34 years , was the chairman of the board that administers discipline to polygraph examiners .
He 's a man of impeccable reputation and impeccable qualifications .
Trimarco grimaces as Brodsky cites polygrapher Lee McCord 's qualifications
Dr. Phil : Okay .
We 're going to take a break and we 're going to talk about the results of the polygraph questions about Drew 's third wife , Kathleen Savio .
Dr. Phil discusses the polygraph questions about Kathleen Savio
Dr. Phil ( returning from commercial break ) :
Well , Drew Peterson has been living in the media spotlight ever since his fourth wife , Stacy , vanished last October .
Now , Drew denies any wrongdoing in connection with her disappearance , and he says that he had nothing to do with the death of his third wife , Kathleen Savio .
Well , let 's talk about the polygraph that was given on Kathleen Savio -- to Drew about Kathleen Savio , um , and I 'll tell you right up front , none of his answers were found to be deceptive .
( To Drew Peterson ) You told the truth there ?
Drew Peterson calmly maintains his truthfulness
Drew Peterson : I told the truth everywhere .
Dr. Phil :
And it was confirmed by the polygraph protocol , that circumstance .
Drew Peterson :
That 's what it says , yeah .
Dr. Phil :
Do you have confidence in that ?
Drew Peterson : I do n't know ...
I have confidence I was telling the truth .
But confidence in the polygraph itself , I 'm not sure .
I 'm not that familiar with it to make that sort of conclusion .
On 10 November 2008 , theshow featured an interview with Drew Peterson , the former Illinois police officer who is a suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , Stacy Peterson , and the death of his third wife , Kathleen Savio .
Also appearing on the show were 1 ) Derek Armstrong , whose newly released book , has been previously discussed on AntiPolygraph.org , 2 ) Peterson 's lawyer , Joel A. Brodsky , and 3 ) Los Angeles polygraph examiner Jack Trimarco , who was in the studio to comment about Peterson 's polygraph results .
An unofficial transcript of the portion of the show concerning the lie detector results , along with frame grabs , is now available .
Once again , as in the many Dr. Phil episodes where the lie detector has been consulted , it offered no real answers and if anything served to muddy the waters :
Here , Trimarco repeats his stock answer when asked about the validity of polygraphy .
The fact of the matter is that polygraphy has not been proven to reliably detect deception at better - than - chance levels under field conditions .
The best available field studies suggest ( 255 kb PDF ) that " if a subject fails a polygraph , the probability that she is , in fact , being deceptive is little more than chance alone ; that is , one could flip a coin and get virtually the same result for a positive test based on the published data . "
The consensus view among scientists is that polygraphy has no scientific basis at all .
Dr. Phil then notes with concern the contradiction inherent in Peterson 's having both passed and failed a polygraph question about a phone call he allegedly received from his wife , Stacy .
Jack Trimarco seems unwilling to accept that the polygraph could be at fault .
So there you have it .
Drew Peterson 's polygraph results leave us none the wiser regarding the disappearance of his fourth wife and the death of his third .

For commentary on otherpolygraph episodes , see :
Radley Balko , senior editor at Reason , has an update on Dymond Milburn , the 12 - year - old girl who was grabbed out of her front yard by three undercover police who accused her of being a prostitute and then beaten so badly she had to go to the hospital to get her head injuries treated .
Balko has learned that the lawsuit is real , not a hoax as some have suggested .
Here 's a copy ( pdf ) of the complaint .
And here 's a record of the filing in federal court .
In the Houston Press the attorney for the officers Milburn is suing gave a statement :
" The father basically attacked police officers as they were trying to take the daughter into custody after she ran off . "
" The city has investigated the matter and found that the conduct of the police officers was appropriate under the circumstances .
It 's unfortunate that sometimes police officers have to use force against people who are using force against them .
And the evidence will show that both these folks [ meaning 12 - year - old Dymond and her father ] violated the law and forcefully resisted arrest . "
Says Balko : " As far as I can tell , Texas does appear to allow for a citizen to resist an unlawful arrest if the arrest meets certain conditions : "
Texas Penal Code Chapter 9 , Subchapter C , Section 9.31 , Subsection C : ( c )
The use of force to resist an arrest or search is justified : ( 1 ) if , before the actor offers any resistance , the peace officer ( or person acting at his direction ) uses or attempts to use greater force than necessary to make the arrest or search ; and ( 2 ) when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect himself against the peace officer 's ( or other person 's ) use or attempted use of greater force than necessary .
Balko comments :
Even setting aside the severe beating Milburn 's lawsuit says she received at the hands of the police ( which is presumably backed by records from the hospital she was admitted to later that night ) , you 're left with several plain - clothes police officers jumping out of an unmarked van , calling a 12 - year - old girl a prostitute , then attempting to snatch her from her own front yard .
I would think that those actions alone would satisfy the " greater force than necessary " portion of the statute .
Dymond Milburn Update
Men who are sexually active in their twenties and thirties are more likely to develop prostate cancer later in life according to a new study .
The study , conducted on more than 800 men , shows men who frequently masturbate are at greater risk , according to the January issue of BJU International .
The study , led by the University of Nottingham , looked at the sexual practices of more than 431 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 60 , together with 409 controls .
Men who took part in the study were asked about all aspects of their sexual conduct , including how active they were , when they began engaging in intercourse , and how often they masturbate .
The study participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their sexual habits in each decade of their life since their twenties .
Hormones appear to play a key role in prostate cancer and it is very common to treat men with therapy to reduce the hormones thought to stimulate the cancer cells , said lead author Dr Polyxeni Dimitropoulou , who is now at the University of Cambridge .
A man 's sex drive is also regulated by his hormone levels , so this study examined the theory that having a high sex drive affects the risk of prostate cancer .
More men with prostate cancer fell into the highest frequency groups in each decade when it came to sexual activity than men in the control group , and 40 percent of men in the cancer group fell into the highest frequency category in their twenties ( 20 or more times a month ) compared to 32 percent in the control group .
Similar patterns were observed in the men's thirties and forties .
Men with prostate cancer were also more likely to masturbate frequently than men in the control group , with the greatest difference in the twenties ( 34 % versus 24 % ) and thirties ( 41 % versus 31 % ) .
What makes our study stand out from previous research is that we focused on a younger age group than normal and included both intercourse and masturbation at various stages in the participants ' lives says Dr Dimitropoulou .
Overall we found a significant association between prostate cancer and sexual activity in a man 's twenties and between masturbation and prostate cancer in the twenties and thirties .
However there was no significant association between sexual activity and prostate cancer in a man 's forties .
A possible explanation for the protective effect that men in their fifties appear to receive from overall sexual activity , and particularly masturbation , is that the release of accumulated toxins during sexual activity reduces the risk of developing cancer in the prostate area .
This theory has , however , not been firmly established and further research is necessary .

Anime fanboys and fangurls will be able to hop along with Haruhi Suzumiya — the official website is here ( in Japanese ) and you can purchase the game here .
I can really see this game being a real hit with the cosplay crowd at anime conventions !

The World Series of Poker ended this week at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas , and Denmark 's Peter Eastgate ( pictured above ) became the youngest - ever winner of the world title .
He is very much the new breed of player : 22 years old , Danish , mathematically brilliant , who gave up a fledgling career in accounting to " turn pro . "
As the winner of the main event Peter won about $ 9.2 million , but would he actually end up with all that money
Denmark 's tax rate is 45 % on the first 4 million Danish Kroners ( about $ 680,000 ) and 75 % on income above that .
Mr. Eastgate will owe about $ 6.7 million in Danish taxes , and will get to keep only $ 2.5 million of his winnings — just 27.23 % of his prize .
In other words , he faces an effective tax rate of 72.77 % .
Ouch .
Ivan Demidov of Moscow finished second and won $ 5.8 million .
Russia has a 13 % flat tax rate , so Mr. Demidov will owe about $ 755,247 to the State Taxation Service of Russia .
After taxes , Ivan will still have more than $ 5 million , more than twice as much as the first place Danish winner .
Sources reveal to In Touch that it was Katy Perry who ultimately broke things off with John Mayer , ending their relationship after nearly two years of dating !
Why ?
Because of her own growing uncertainty about his ability to stay faithful .
“ She always thinks John is either going to cheat or is cheating , ” the source explains .
And her fears might not have been so far - fetched .
Now , sources confirm exclusively to In Touch that John got cozy with 24 - year - old spin instructor Lauren McHale last spring during a brief break with Katy .
Katy Perry Looks “ Upset ” At Dinner With Friends Just Days After Breakup
“ He was acting single , ” an insider explains to In Touch of John , who bought Lauren and her friend ’s drinks after meeting them at a Venice , Calif. , bar before heading to Lauren ’s home to continue the party .
The insider adds that though they were just supposed to be on a short break , John showed no signs of any communication with Katy at all .
“ He told her he thought she was good - looking and did n’t talk about Katy at all , ” the insider tells In Touch .
“ At the end of the night , he kissed her . ”
For Katy , her uncertainty was enough to call things off , says the first source .
“ She ’d rather have kept dating , but he wanted to marry her .
He pressured her .
He gave her a ring and made the relationship more serious , which scared her because of his past . ”

It 's been clear for a long time that the giant obscene " F " word in Internet censorship is feminism .
Ever since the Breast Cancer Support group on AOL got shut down by the parent company for using the word " breast , " it 's been clear that women 's health , bodies , and sexual politics are " Not Safe for Work , " and beyond the pale of decent conversation and discourse .
How far does the insanity extend ?
Well , here 's the latest gem .
You know Google .
They have " safe " filters on their search engine so you can avoid seeing obscenities if you choose the " safest " setting .
In many workplaces and schools , that safe setting is chosen for you , so you do n't fall out of your crib over a four - letter word .
Well , get this :
If you set your Google SafeSearch filter on " strict filtering " and search for clitoris , you get zero returns .
But if you try a Google SafeSearch " strict filtering " search for penis , you get ...
33,000,000 returns .
That 's because " clitoris " is on Google 's list of naughty words which are never , ever " safe . "
( Comstock Films has more on what it 's like to be dragged into Google 's Sex Ghetto , kicking and screaming , and I thank them for this amazing find ) .
The self - imposed censorship of language and topic taboos on the Web is the most parochial , stifling , and bigoted aspect of Internet journalism .
A daily city newspaper has a more grownup attitude toward sex , reproduction , health issues , and artistic license than any major Web search engine or news group .
As I wrote in an earlier post , " Not Safe for Prudes : "
NSFW is unmandated , unlegislated censorship — there 's no ballot to punch , no senator to harangue .
The great majority of NSFW warnings are the result of unconscious class and gender bias , with the conceit of American ethnocentrism .
It 's made a mockery of out of journalism and the First Amendment .
It 's as if the First Amendment exists on paper , but not out here in cyberspace where you can be a dog .... but not a female with primary and secondary sexual characteristics .
I recall the 1970s abortion rights poster that read " If men could get pregnant , abortion would be a sacrament . "
The sexism of the Internet infrastructure is the same joke .
There is no way that men would consider " prostate cancer " an inappropriate search or conversation item .
They would never for a moment consider that their " penis " was a word that could n't be allowed in a respectable business or learning environment .
But women 's bodies ?
Oh , you 're familiar with the filthy and unspeakable territory those will lead you into .
It 's in the Bible , right ?
Let 's stop coddling Internet censorship as if it were an etiquette or a " children 's " issue .
The people suffering from being firewalled and banned are n't commercial porn- makers designed with hardcore prurient appeal — they 're educators , healthcare professionals , midwives , nurses , doctors , researchers , artists , writers , filmmakers , political activists , critics and analysts — all of whom find their interest in women 's lives to be shrouded in the great Internet burqa of " safeness . "
The scale of Israel 's attack on the Gaza Strip , and the almost daily reports of war crimes over the last three weeks , has drawn criticism from even longstanding friends and sympathisers .
Despite the Israeli government 's long - planned and comprehensive PR campaign , hundreds of dead children is a hard sell .
As a former Israeli government press adviser put it , in a wonderful bit of unintentional irony , " When you have a Palestinian kid facing an Israeli tank , how do you explain that the tank is actually David and the kid is Goliath ? "
Despite a mass of evidence that includes Israel 's targets in Operation Cast Lead , public remarks by Israeli leaders over some time , and the ceasefire manoeuvring of this last weekend , much of the analysis offered by politicians or commentators has been disappointingly limited , and characterised by false assumptions , or misplaced emphases , about Israel 's motivations .
First , to what this war on Gaza is not about : it 's not about the rockets .
During the truce last year , rocket fire from the Gaza Strip was reduced by 97 % , with the few projectiles that were fired coming from non-Hamas groups opposed to the agreement .
Despite this success in vastly improving the security of Israelis in the south , Israel did everything it could to undermine the calm , and provoke Hamas into a conflict .
Israel broke the ceasefire on 4 November , with an attack in the Gaza Strip that killed six Hamas members , and the following day severely tightened its siege of the territory .
Imports were reduced to 16 trucks a day , down from 123 daily just the previous month ( and 475 in May 2007 ) .
Following the unsurprising surge in Palestinian attacks , Israeli officials claimed that an all - out war was unavoidable ; without mentioning that an operation had been planned for some months already .
Second , the current operation is only in a limited sense related to both the upcoming Israeli elections and restoring the IDF 's so - called deterrence .
While it has been pointed out that a hardline approach to Palestinian " terrorism " can play well with the Israeli public , wars are not necessarily Israeli politicians ' tactic of choice – the Lebanon war was fought a few months after one .
Israel is also supposed to be restoring the reputation and " deterrence factor " of its armed forces , after their humiliation in Lebanon in 2006 .
Suffice to say that until this weekend 's unilateral ceasefire , in an aid - dependent enclave defended by an almost entirely isolated militia , Israel 's operation had already lasted three times longer than the 1967 war when Israel defeated its Arab neighbours and occupied the rest of Mandate Palestine .
These three suggested motivations have sometimes reached the level of assumed knowledge , providing the background for further comment and reporting .
Based on this kind of analysis , then , criticism of Palestinian civilian casualties is framed as " disproportionate " or " heavy - handed " , but fundamentally a case of self - defence .
It is understood that any democratic nation would have to respond to terrorist rocket fire , but Israel has gone a bit too far .
There is , however , no shortage of evidence available that points to rather different Israeli aims .
Estimates for the proportion of civilian deaths among the 1,360 Palestinians killed range from more than half to two - thirds .
Politicians , diplomats and journalists are by and large shying away from the obvious , namely that Israel has been deliberately targeting Palestinian civilians and the very infrastructure of normal life , in order to – in the best colonial style – teach the natives a lesson .
Given the enormous scale of what Palestinians have described as a " war of extermination " – it appears that some 15 % of all buildings in the Gaza Strip were completely destroyed or collapsed and there is an estimated $ 1.4bn worth of destruction to vital civil infrastructure – it is impossible to list every atrocity .
Israel has repeatedly hit ambulances , medics , clinics , and hospitals , while last week , aid volunteers who tried to douse a fire in a Red Crescent warehouse ( attacked by Israel ) were then shot at by Israeli forces .
UNRWA facilities have also been attacked , including several schools sheltering civilians – just this last weekend , a civilian refuge was repeatedly shelled .
Last week , the UN headquarters was also shelled , hitting a vocational centre , a workshop , food warehouse , and fuel depot .
Like the massacre of 6 January , Israeli officials quickly began to produce a confusing fog of denials , apologies , promised enquiries and contradictions .
Those are just some of the more shocking examples from a military operation that has targeted everything from schools , money - changers and a bird farm , to entire apartment blocks , harbours , and a market .
Palestinians have been killed when Israeli tanks fired shells at residential neighbourhoods .
Every day has brought fresh horrors ; last Wednesday , for example , 70 unarmed civilians including 18 children were killed by the Israeli military .
This week 's Observer carried a story alleging Israel bulldozed homes with civilians inside ( not for the first time ) and shot those waving white flags .
Little wonder that Israeli officials predicted with concern that " negative sentiment " towards the state would " only grow as the full picture of destruction emerges " .
Much of this is widely known , and easily accessible ; yet still the analytical emphasis has remained on Palestinian rockets , Israeli elections , and deterrence .
I would like to suggest three alternative purposes for Israel 's Operation Cast Lead that go beyond the usual perspectives , and presuming with Yale professor David Bromwich that " if Israel in 2009 reduces to rubble a large portion of the Gaza Strip and leaves tens of thousands homeless , there is a strong chance that this was what it intended to do " .
The first aim is to humiliate and weaken Hamas .
On the one hand , this seems obvious , but contrary to how the goal is often understood , this is not primarily to protect the Israeli public – as pointed out previously , ceasefires and negotiations are far more likely to deliver security for Israeli citizens – but rather it is a political goal .
Hamas had withstood isolation , a siege , mass arrests , and an attempted western - backed coup .
Moreover , cracks were appearing in the international community 's resolve to parrot Israel 's line on Hamas .
The group , with its resilience and ability to deliver on negotiated ceasefires , was threatening the chance to make a deal with the Ramallah " moderates " , and so :
A hammer blow that shattered the movement , launching some of the resulting splinters in directions that once again put all of them beyond the pale , was the most effective way to keep at bay those third parties reaching the conclusion that engaging rather than excluding Hamas could enhance the prospects of peace .
Back in December , before both the end of the six - month truce and the start of Operation Cast Lead , foreign minister Tzipi Livni stated that an extended truce " harms the Israel strategic goal , empowers Hamas , and gives the impression that Israel recognizes the movement " .
By the end of the month , Livni would be telling a press conference that " Hamas wants to gain legitimacy from the international community " and stressing that it is " important to keep Hamas from becoming a legitimate organisation " ( apparently winning a democratic election is n't enough to confer legitimacy ) .
Just as Israel chose " blood over diplomacy " in order to avoid enhancing " Hamas 's image as a responsible interlocutor " , so this weekend , Israel chose a unilateral ceasefire for the same reason , " hoping to send the message that Hamas is not a legitimate actor " .
A war begun in order to delegitimise Hamas would not make way for a ceasefire in which Hamas was a partner at the negotiating table .
Hence Israel decided to shortcut the Egyptian - driven efforts at securing a ceasefire , and opt for a unilateral approach that allows Israel , the US , Egypt , Mahmoud Abbas , Britain – in fact , every interested party , except the Gaza Strip authorities – to work together on an apparent solution .
It is also worth pointing out that the unilateral nature of the ceasefire frees Israel to define an infringement or collapse on its own terms .
The second aim of Israel 's war is to teach a lesson to the Palestinians in Gaza , and elsewhere , that the only way to avoid the wrath of the Israeli military is to accept Israel 's idea of a two - state solution , a generous concession to be gratefully received by Abbas and fellow moderates .
It is a reflection of the approach outlined by the IDF chief of staff , Moshe Ya'alon , in 2002 that " the Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people " .
On 4 January , Israeli President Shimon Peres said that Hamas needed " a real and serious lesson " ; days later , he was more explicit , reportedly declaring Israel 's aim to be " to provide a strong blow to the people of Gaza so that they would lose their appetite for shooting at Israel " .
The next day , the Washington Post also described how Israeli officials were hoping that the attacks would mean " that Gazans become disgusted with Hamas and drive the group from power " .
This Israeli strategy was previously deployed in Lebanon in 2006 , when senior military commanders redefined civilian villages as " military bases " which would be subjected to " disproportionate force " causing " great damage and destruction " .
As I previously noted , the lessons learned in Lebanon were not just wrong , but criminal : a retired IDF major general and former adviser to the prime minister , Giora Eiland , reflected in a paper that " the destruction of homes and infrastructure and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people are consequences that can influence Hezbollah 's behaviour more than anything else " .
Ironically , the same Peres who now justifies collective punishment , in 2002 chastised Avigdor Lieberman for suggesting that the IDF should bomb civilian targets , warning the minister that such a tactic would be a war crime .
The last three weeks show that proposals made by Israel 's political extremists and originally considered outlandish , do not take long to become normal policy .
Deliberately targeting civilians and vital infrastructure for political purposes links smoothly , into the post - conflict phase , with the Israeli and US plan to try and rescue the deeply discredited image of the Palestinian Authority through a politicised reconstruction of the Gaza Strip .
As US state department spokesman Sean McCormack coyly put it , the " military solution " must be followed up by investing in infrastructure and helping the population " so that they can make a different kind of political decision " .
The third aim of Israel 's attack on the Gaza Strip is to further " catastrophise " the territory , reducing the capacity for continued existence to the barest of minimums – perhaps to bring about " an end to the persistence of Gaza 's ordinary people in wanting the chance of a peaceful and dignified life " .
One obvious benefit to Israel of pulverising " civilian Palestinian infrastructure " is that " people who lack collective institutions and are reduced to scrabbling for their very survival are easier to dominate " .
Yet , there is more going on here .
Israel seeks to turn the Gaza Strip into a depoliticised humanitarian crisis , always on the brink of catastrophe , always dependent ; its population reduced to ration - receiving clients of international aid .
Yitzhak Rabin famously wished that Gaza " would just sink into the sea " , but perhaps the best Israel can do is to share the problem with the international community , possibly to the extent of troops on the ground .
Increasingly focusing on Egyptian responsibility is also part of this , whether in terms of arms smuggling , aid supplies , or for some , direct rule .
In all of this , the Gaza Strip has become a laboratory for future possible scenarios in the West Bank ( where a process of " development - isation " and NGO - funded occupation is well established ) .
All three of these Israeli aims – to delegitimise and sideline Hamas , to persuade Palestinians to give up their resistance and to shirk responsibility for a shattered Gaza Strip – require the deliberate commission of war crimes and gross human rights abuses .
As time will tell , they are also doomed to fail .

A large portion of the Apple Mac community is waiting for Apple to refresh the Mac Mini line .
We learned today that the next generation of Mac Mini computers will be based on Nvidia 's Ion platform .
An Nvidia partner confirmed to us that Apple was the first to receive samples of Nvidia 's Ion platform , which we covered extensively during CES .
In fact , Apple received prototype units long before Nvidia partners who opted to work on Ion .
We 're told that some partners still only have blue prints of Ion .
Apple 's MacBook and MacBook Pro unibody notebooks already use Nvidia 's 9400M GPU for graphics duties , and this GPU is precisely what Ion uses .
The GPU is capable of full HD video decoding and also supports Nvidia 's CUDA technology for more general purpose computing .
Pairing up with the 9400 M is Intel Atom 330 processor .
The Atom 330 runs at a clock speed of 1.6 GHz on a 533 MHz front side bus and has two times the execution resources and L2 cache as the Atom 230 .
Because of the size of the Ion platform , we can expect the new Mac Mini to be even smaller than the current generation unit .
Our source also informed us that Apple will be launching the new Mac Mini sometime in March of this year , around the same time that CeBit happens .
At this time , no pricing information has been confirmed .
But judging from Apple 's release patterns , we can expect the new Mac Mini to cost roughly the same as the current generation of Mac Mini when they initially launched in the $ 500 to $ 700 range .
Nvidia itself stated previously that it expected Ion products to start at roughly $ 400 .
Update :
We had a discussion with Kasper at AppleInsider on this detail , and according to Kasper , Apple may be using Nvidia 's Ion platform for an updated Apple TV .
This seems highly plausable .
At this time however , neither we nor AppleInsider are absolutely sure where Apple will be using Ion , but an Nvidia partner explicitly said Apple has Ion for Mac Mini .
Poisoned Sponge urged me to play this .
I now urge you to do likewise .
It ’s from Blendogames ( aka Brandon Chung ) , built on the Quake - 2 derived KMQuake2 engine and is intellectually a cross between Hitman , No-one Lives Forever and Team Fortress 2 , with a big splash of arthouse gibber .
It ’s also the wittiest game I ’ve played since …
World of Goo ?
Yeah , sounds right .
And best of all , prominently features music from much - beloved - by - RPS - film Brazil .
Get it here and play it – and remember F6 is Q2 ’s quicksave for the jumpy bits – and a little bit of spoiler - heavy analysis beneath the cut .
Seriously , you ’ve played it ?
Was n’t that just delightful .
And incredibly confident .
And even surprisingly polished – a tad buggy around the edges , occasionally – but slickly picks up the lessons of other games and runs with them .
The TF2 - esque information dumps via the environment were particularly well done .
Yeah , first - person platforming , but we ’ll forgive that , eh ?
And it ’s really beautiful and lively and full of individual moments which all too many mainstream games could n’t match .
Particular favourites ?
The cigarette smoking in the chase sequence .
The open - air party with dozens of planes flying around it .
The bit where you fall onto the table and everyone ’s just staring at you .
And , of course , the ending …
And it ’s … okay , this is veering into pretentious territory , as I ’ve got no idea of the creator ’s intent .
Theory says that does n’t matter , but if the reason that the game ’s as brief it is something as simple as “ Yeah , got bored with it ” or “ Gonna do future episodes ” this may fall apart .
But as is …
Well , one of the interesting things about Gravity Bone is that while it ’s a short - form game , it does n’t act like a short - form game .
If a game ’s going to be this small , you can tell – in that the skills are introduced immediately and you ’re kind of left to it .
Instead , Gravity
Bone takes the mainstream videogame structure of slowly introducing skills .
It makes you think it ’s going to go on .
I mean , if they ’re giving you these skills one at a time and gradually broadening what you can do … well , why would they do that if they ’re not going to continue ?
Hell , when you pick up all the equipment that ’s available , it fills in slots 1 , 2 and 4 .
What ’s in 3 ?
Clearly something ’s going to be in 3 ?
That ’s what games have taught us .
Except , no , the game just ends with the hero being shot and falling , flashbacking to his doom .
It ’s kind of plays the opposite gag of You Have To Burn The Rope .
That says upfront all that this is all that it ’s going to be .
This implies it ’s going to be something else , but … well , no it ’s not .
The hero could always be shot before his adventure starts , and the illusion of games arc is always that – just an illusion .
Yeah , Gravity
Bone does it with enough joy to avoid any sense of cynicism , but the point ’s there beneath all the bonhomie .
But putting aside whether I ’m onto something there or not , there ’s much to admire here .
It ’s an indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn , displaying an enormous amount of craft in every part .

The URL of this article is : http://globalresearch.ca/articles/TOK403A.html
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR AFGHANISTAN , TOKYO THE PEOPLE Versus GEORGE WALKER BUSH President of the United States of America INDICTMENT
The Prosecution has presented a formidable Indictment against the Defendant , George Walker Bush , President of the United States and Commander - in - Chief of US military forces for serious crimes ; waging a war of aggression on Afghanistan , war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Afghan people , against prisoners of war ; and the use of radioactive depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction , against the people of Afghanistan ; with serious fall out effects on the military personnel of the United States , UK and other forces deployed ; and on countries , in and around the region .
Relevant for the trial , is the profile of the Defendant , elected as the 43rd President of the United States , and sworn in as President in January 2001 ; the year of the military attack on Afghanistan ; after an election which received international focus , in view of the issues involved , resolved by the Supreme Court .
The Defendant 's past history , of close association , with the Corporate sector in the United States of America , has been highlighted in the indictment by the prosecution , in particular with the Oil and Energy sector ; the Defendant formed an oil company , the Arbusto Energy Inc in 1978 , which was unsuccessful ; after which Spectrum 7 Energy of Ohio was formed in 1984 with the Defendant as CEO ; thereafter the Defendant was a Consultant to Harken Energy from 1986 , prior to being elected as Governor of Texas in 1994 and re-elected in 1998 .
2 . Accomplices and Accessories to the Crimes of waging a war of aggression , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
In view of the undisputed facts , that apart from the military forces of the United States , ordered to be deployed by the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief for the war on Afghanistan , military forces of other governments were deployed and leading members of the defendant 's administration , participated in the decision making ; the prosecution has clarified in the indictment , that other members of the Defendant 's administration who were a party to the conspiracy to wage a war on Afghanistan , and those heads of government who have deployed military forces of their countries to assist in the military occupation ; are equally accomplices and accessories to the crimes committed by the Defendant ; though in this trial it is the Defendant who has been proceeded against .
3 . Universal Jurisdiction
The Tribunal being conscious of the basic principle of jurisprudence that ' no one must be condemned unheard ' , that ' justice must not only be done but appear to be done '; appointed amicus curiae , a Senior counsel from Japan , to assist with the defense of the Defendant ; amicus curiae entered a plea of " not guilty " , on behalf of the Defendant and questioned the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as and by way of preliminary objection ; the Defendant , though duly served by the Secretariat of the ICTA through the embassy of the United States in Tokyo and directly , failed to appear before the Tribunal and enter a plea .
Professor Willaird B. Cowles in an article titled ' Universality of Jurisdiction over War Crimes ( California Law Review , Vol. 33 ( 1945 ) p.177 ) emphasized that : …….. " all civilized states have a very real interest in the punishment of war crimes " … and that " an offense against the laws of war , as a violation of the laws of nations , is a matter of general interest and concern " …
This was in an academic paper written more than half a century ago , when the principle of ‘ Universality of Jurisdiction ’ , and the personal accountability of individuals for War Crimes , was gaining adherents among jurists , after the Second World War .
The objection raised to the exercise of jurisdiction by this Tribunal on behalf of the Defendant , by amicus curaie ; and the United States government claiming " impunity " in various forums , against indictment for war crimes ; is best answered by the undertaking given to the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg , by the Chief Counsel for the government of the United States of America , Mr. Justice Robert H. Jackson , who stepped down temporarily , as Judge of the United States of America , to represent the United States before the Nuremberg Tribunal , established pursuant to the Moscow Declaration and the London Agreement of 1945 , to which the government of the United States was a signatory .
Justice Jackson categorically declared that : " If certain acts of violation of treaties are crimes , they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others , which we would not be willing to have invoked against us … "
In view of this position taken before the Nuremberg Tribunal , the Defendant is liable not only before this Tribunal , but the entire claim of ‘ impunity ’ of the government of the United States , is legally untenable ; no government can surrender the right vested in its citizens to invoke International Criminal Law , not by a Resolution of the Security Council nor by bilateral treaty .
On the issue raised by amicus curiae , of how authoritative is the verdict of such a Tribunal ; it is necessary to restate , that sovereignty is a constitutional and political concept , which resides in the final analysis with the people ; who have a right to judge through legal forums created by them ; at a critical period of history for serious crimes committed against humanity ; in particular , when several governments across continents have abandoned the democratic principle of governance ; many being elected in seriously flawed electoral process ; on the basis of Corporate support and campaign contributions 4 . The World Disorder .
The critical question , among others , posed before this Tribunal by the Prosecution is , how do we challenge this ' world disorder ' ; this is a juridical question ; yet the law is always a reflection of existing economic and political systems ; though all legal systems maintain that the purpose and objective of law , is the preservation of the ‘ Rule of Law ’ within and between nations ; this presupposes that there are no privileged individuals , classes , or groups , within and across nations .
5 . The Charge of Waging a War of Aggression .
The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg referring to the charge of waging a war of aggression , highlighted the gravity of this offense in the following words : " To initiate a war of aggression ….is not only an international crime ; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes , in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole " .
The legal defense of the Defendant to this charge , is to be found in public statements made by the Defendant , after the terrorist attacks of 11th September 2001 , on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon , by hijacking of aircraft in the United States ; which admittedly , destroyed the lives of approximately three thousand innocent citizens of the United States ; and of other nationalities and religious beliefs .
The defense advanced by amicus curiae is , that the military attack of 7th October 2001 ordered by the Defendant , as President of the United States and its Commander in Chief , was a ‘ just war ’ or a ‘ bellum justum ’ ; a war of self defense , a preventive war ; in response to the terrorist attacks of al Qaeda , masterminded by Osama bin Laden , harboured by the Taliban government in Afghanistan , which had permitted terrorist camps on its territory ; who were committing hostile acts against the United States of America .
6. 11th September 2001 attacks in the United States had no connection with Afghanistan .
The prosecution has questioned the factual and legal basis of this defense , submitting at page 17 of its Indictment that -
" ….. it is not etablished that the 9.11 incidents were the acts of Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda …….. the letter to the Chairman of the UN Security Council which the United States sent on October 7 ,2001 and another letter which the United Kingdom sent of October 4 , 2001 and the videotape released on December 13 are inadequate as defences .
Therefore the criminal activities of Osama bin Laden and the members of the al Qaeda have never been established enough to prosecute them for 9.11 incidents " .
Admittedly videotapes of an individual claiming to be Osama bin Laden , reaching swiftly into the hands of the administration of the Defendant , and other governments , desiring to advance their own explanation for events ; is not proof of the involvement of Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization , in the terrorist attacks of 9.11 ; this is tainted evidence .
On the basis of the facts which have emerged in the public domain , of the background of Osama bin Laden and of those alleged to have perpetrated the attacks of the 11th September 2001 ; of which judicial notice can be taken as per rules of evidence of the ICTA statute ; the core issue which confronts this Tribunal is whether those who allegedly committed the crimes of the 11 th Septermber 2001 in the United States , had any connection with Afghanistan .
The relevant facts to assess the defense are :
A . As per identities of the hijackers / terrorists of 11th September disclosed by US Intelligence Agencies ; 15 are citizens from Saudi Arabia ; and four others are citizens of countries like Kuwait , Morocco , UAE .
B . There is yet , no authoritative report on the perpetrators of 9.11 .
The organization and circumstances , which resulted in the hijacking of so many aircraft .
The US Senate Investigative Commission has held back crucial pages of its report , dealing with the role of " friendly " governments .
C. The families of the victims of the 11th September 2001 terrorist attacks , have demanded another Commission ; publicly requesting disclosure of vital evidence , such as the " black boxes " , " voice recorders " , the complete " air traffic control records " of the relevant flights ; and the airport " surveillance tapes " showing passengers boarding the flights and passenger lists .
D .Administration and Justice Department officials moved to prevent disclosure of evidence , that could be used in discovery proceedings , in Civil Law Suits filed by many families of 9.11 victims ; Judge Hellerstein , hearing the suits has suspended 9.11 tort law suits , pending clarification of government 's decision .
E Another 10 member commission jointly of the Senate and White House , the Keenan Committee has been appointed , which has yet not given an authoritative report on the events of 9.11 ; some of the members of this committee , have issued statements of being denied Daily Intelligence Briefings made to the President by the CIA in the months preceding the attack .
F . General Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States military , admitted , that no US aircraft from any US air base , or from Norad , the joint US - Canadian Air Defense Command were mobilized or scrambled on 11 th September 2001 to protect the citizens of the United States .
G .Osama bin Laden is not an Afghan or a religious fighter , but a wealthy billionaire ; a citizen of Saudi Arabia ; recruited as the Intelligence asset of the United States and other countries for many years ; the pivot of the ' Arab fighters '; trained in furtherance of the military strategic interests of the government of the United States on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border ; for deployment in various regions .
The bin Laden family has had extensive financial interests in the United States and Saudi Arabia , including in the Carlyle Corporation , in which the Defendant and his family also had investments .
H . The takeover of the Taliban militia in 1996 , as the de facto government in Kabul controlling several regions of Afghanistan , was with the backing of the California based oil and energy company , Unocal , with extensive military and logistic support from the United States , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
Jane 's Defence Weekly an authoritative journal on defense acquisitions the world over , has conservatively estimated that half of all military supplies of the Taliban militia were from Pakistan ; which in turn obtains substantial military supplies from the government of the United States .
I . The de facto Taliban government in Kabul , was wholly dependent for support on the government of the United States and Pakistan ; and had not committed a single act hostile to people of the United States ; prior to the military invasion of Afghanistan on 7th October 2001 and the dispersal of the Taliban forces .
It was not the case of the Defendant that the United States was attacked by the Taliban government .
J. The al Qaeda a fact which is undisputed was not an organized military force ; they were " foreign fighters " recruited by covert agencies from several countries .
K . On the submission advanced by amicus curiae that this was a " just war " what has been termed as " bellum justum " against international terrorism , to disperse terrorist bases in Afghanistan ; it is public knowledge that the terrorist bases , were established to conduct the " holy war " against communism on the Pakistan / Afghan border by the United States with the assistance from the ISI in Pakistan ; this has been officially confirmed by the public admissions of Zbigniew Brerzinski , the eminent former National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter ; who has disclosed that the first directive sanctioning assistance for the training of such fighters on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border , to pursue the civil war against the communist government in Afghanistan , was issued by President Jimmy Carter on July 3 ,1979 ; prior to the arrival of Soviet troops into Afghanistan ; this had the desired effect of involving the Soviet military in support of the Afghan government , which escalated the civil war ; these facts have been independently confirmed by the former Director of the CIA Robert Gates in the book " From the Shadows " .
On the basis of the aforesaid factual position the defense advanced that the military attack on Afghanistan was a " just war " as a measure of " self - defense " or a " preventive war " can not be legally sustained .
7 . The war on Afghanistan not in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , customary International Law and the decisions of the International Court of Justice .
Despite the aforesaid findings on facts , the absence of evidence to establish that the 9.11 attacks had any connection with Afghanistan ; even if such a conclusion was possible , as per the public statements of the Defendant on the reasons for waging this " War against Terror " ; would this justify a full scale military onslaught on Afghanistan by the Defendant , with hundreds of bombing sorties .
One of the most significant 20th Century developments in International Law , has been the restriction and regulation by treaty and customary law of the former unregulated privileges of States to resort to war .
The Defendant as President of the United States and as Commander - in -Chief of the United States Armed forces , was not constitutionally empowered to declare war ; the Congress under the US Constitution was not authorized to delegate to the President of the United States its constitutional power to declare war .
Whereas under Article 1 , Section 8 , clause 11 of the Constitution of the United States , the power to declare war vests with Congress ; limitations are imposed on the exercise of this power , by Article 1 , Section 8 , clause 15 , which mandates that Congress is not authorized to " call forth the militia " except to " execute the laws of the Union and to suppress insurrections and invasions " .
The terrorist attack of 11th September 2001 was neither an invasion or insurrection of the United States of America ; Congress could not delegate what was constitutionally impermissible ; prima facie the military attack on Afghanistan was an unconstitutional and illegal exercise of power by the Defendant .
Moreover the war on Afghanistan was not justified in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ; Article 2 , paragraph 4 of the United Nations , a treaty ratified and signed by the United States , specifies that -
" all members shall refrain in their International relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State , or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations . "
The only exception to the aforesaid binding rule , is the right to resort to self - defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , strictly subject to the rule of law and procedure laid down in the UN Charter ; the nature of incidents of 9.11 , were terrorist attacks ; as such Article 51 of the United Nation Charter could not be resorted to ; the issue ought to have been resolved by resorting to Conventions against terrorism to which the United States is a signatory .
Article 33 of the UN Charter mandates that before resorting to war , every government is required to resort to negotiation , mediation , conciliation , arbitration and judicial settlement .
Admittedly this mandatory procedure was not complied with .
The communication of John Negroponte , US Permanent Representative to the Security Council , indicates , that the decision by the Defendant to resort to war was taken , before the complete facts were available on the nature of the attack .
This communication informed the Security Council that : " Since 11 September , my government has obtained clear and compelling information that the Al Qaeda organization which is supported by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , had a central role in the attacks .
There is much we do not know .
Our enquiry is in its early stages .
We may find that our self - defense requires further actions with respect to other organizations and States "
It was clear that the enquiry , as to the nature and cause and perpetrators of the attack were in the " early stages " ; war can not be resorted to unless the facts are clearly ascertained , it is a remedy of last resort ; the last sentence of this communication , that the government of the United States reserves its right to take " further actions with respect to other organizations and States " establishes that a case for continuous military intervention was already being made .
The right to resort to war as a measure self - defense , is neither unrestricted nor subjective ; as observed by the International Court of Justice in the case relating to " Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua ( Nicaragua V The United States of America , I.C.J. Reports 1986 p.94 para 176 ) ruling that :
… " the submission of the right to self - defense to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary International Law .. " …. " there is a specific rule whereby self - defense would warrant only measures which are proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it , a rule well established in International Law " …
This dual condition applies as much to customary International law and to the right of self - defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations .
The terrorist attacks of 9.11 in the United States were not carried out by any government or an armed contingent of any government or State party ; nor authorized in any manner whatsoever by the de facto Taliban government in Kabul ; the response of the Defendant in waging a war to devastate an entire nation , was neither a proportional response , nor warranted .
The Defendant and his administration from the past practice of States , was wholly aware , that many countries facing terrorist attacks ; hijackings of aircraft , shooting down of civilian aircraft , and continuous cross border terrorism for several years ; have not resorted to war ; opting to negotiate on the issues .
The United States government could have resorted to the provisions of the Tokyo Convention or to the 1971 Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the safety of Civil Aviation ; or to any of the existing Conventions against terrorism ; a proportionate response .
Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations permits the exercise of the right to self - defense only " until the Security Council has taken measures " .
The Security Council responded immediately ; the Security Council , by Resolution No.1368 passed on 11th September 2001 and Resolution No.1373 dated 28th September 2001 ; called on member States to work together urgently to " fully implement the relevant International Anti-Terrorist Conventions " and " prevent and suppress the financing " of terrorist attacks by " freezing financial " assets .
It may be argued , that the Defendant made an attempt to prevent the war , by demanding that Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda , should be handed over by the Taliban ; this admittedly was not a bona fide attempt ; as wholly inadequate time was allotted for the staged negotiations , even though the Taliban government , made some responses .
In less than a month of the terrorist attack , before dawn on 7th October 2001 , the US - UK coalition forces launched serial bombings in Afghanistan on Kabul and on 31 major cities and towns without exhausting other alternative remedies .
The document Prosecution Ex . B - 1 which is the address of the Defendant to Congress dated 20th September 2001 establishes that the Defendant declared that the Al Qaeda organization , was to be found in sixty countries ; that the " war against terror " , was just beginning with Afghanistan , as the first target , but not the last ; and that for the Defendant , the military attack on Afghanistan was only the first of a series of wars to be initiated against different nations .
In any assessment of the nature of the war in Afghanistan , it must be remembered that the United States had termed Soviet military troop presence in Afghanistan , in support of the then Afghan government in 1979 ; as Soviet military aggression ; applying the same standards , the war waged by the Defendant could not be regarded as a " just war " or a war in " self – defense " ; as the Taliban government admittedly did not request for any military assistance from the United States , which the Afghan government in 1979 had sought from the former USSR , against the Mujahideen groups waging covert war .
The issue of waging a war of aggression cannot be judged by this Tribunal blindfold ; events in Iraq , even before the hearings of this Tribunal commenced , establish a consistent pattern which this Tribunal is entitled to take judicial notice of ; the war in Afghanistan was followed , by the military attack on Iraq ; on the basis of " non-existing weapons of mass destruction " ; a war in which the entire infrastructure of Iraq was destroyed in a manner similar to Afghanistan ; DU weapons were extensively used in both countries as weapons of extermination of present and future generations , genocidal in properties .
It is only the oil pipelines , oil wells and platforms and the contracts of Corporations which had to be secured ; even as the livelihood and economies of both nations were destroyed .
The war waged on Afghanistan was manifestly a war of aggression .
8. The alternative reaons advanced by the prosecution for the War of Aggression - UNOCAL's ( Centgas consortium ) objective of regime change for the pipeline project .
The prosecution has referred in the Indictment to the involvement of oil and energy Companies of the United States , in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the real reason for this war , and relied on public documents , establishing that the California based Oil Company , the Unocal , through a seven member consortium Centgas , had commenced negotiations with various factions , in the government of Afghanistan ; for its pipelines project , across Afghanistan , Pakistan , to the Indian Ocean ; from the oil - gas rich Central Asiatic Republics of the former USSR ; in preference to the old pipeline routes through Russia or an alternative route through Iran .
( UNOCAL Position Statement : " Proposed Central Asian Pipeline Projects " , ( 1998 ) www,unocal.com ) .
This project aimed at exercising monopoly control over the hydrocarbon resources in this region and distribution through pipelines ; referred to in the Complaint / Petition lodged in 1998 , by citizens groups to the Attorney General of California , under California Code of Civil Procedure 803 and the California Corporations Code , 1801 , for cancellation of Charter of UNOCAL , for violation of human rights within the USA , in Afghanistan and Myanmar .
The Unocal company commenced negotiations with various political factions in the government ; however the internecine fratricidal struggle of the former Mujahideen groups , created a difficult situation for negotiation ; as a consequence the Unocal , supported the creation of a hard line Taliban militia government , with arms supplies and logistic support from Pakistan ; supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia ; which gradually captured Kabul and extensive areas in the southern , central and eastern regions of Afghanistan .
The proposed pipeline project once again faced difficulties , on the failure of the Taliban militia , to control the entire geographical territory of Afghanistan , in particular the Northern regions close to Turkmenistan and other Republics ; vital for the pipelines , which continued under the control of the Northern Alliance ; and the difficulties in respect of the alternative negotiations being conducted by the Argentinian Company Bridas in the same region .
Unocal in these circumstances , increasingly frustrated , sought political / military alternatives by way of " regime change " .
Admittedly Unocal ’s case on the pipeline project was advanced through successive US administrations .
Financial investments and inflows of capital into the United States , it has always been emphasized by US oil and energy Corporations ; could be controlled , by monopoly control and distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the world .
The prosecution has placed on record before this Tribunal , Prosecution document Ex. A - 40 which is the testimony of John J. Maresca , Vice President , International Relations , UNOCAL Corporation , to the House Committee on International Relations , Subcommittee on Asia and Pacific on 12th February , 1998 ( www.house.gov/international_.relations105th ap/wsap212982.htm.)
A core document on the stand of the prosecution , that the reason for the war lay elsewhere ; in the hydrocarbon resources of the region .
John Maresca , Vice President of Unocal , in his testimony outlined implicitly a future rational for a military invasion of Afghanistan and take over of its resources .
The testimony indicates disillusionment with the Taliban forces , which UNOCAL had once supported and spells out future possibilities -
" … The country has been involved in a bitter warfare for almost a decade .
The territory across which the pipeline would extend is controlled by the Taliban , an Islamic movement that is not recognized as a government by most other nations .
From the outset we have made it clear that construction of the proposed pipeline cannot begin until a recognized government is in place that has the confidence of governments , lenders and our company … .
In spite of this , a route through Afghanistan appears to be the best option ….
Centgas cannot begin construction until an internationally recognized Afghanistan government is in place .
For the project to advance it must have international financing … "
In 1998 even as the Taliban and Northern alliance battled for control of the Northern Region , the UNOCAL company posted on its web page on August 21 ,1998 ( also reproduced in the memorandum submitted by citizens groups in the USA to the Attorney General of California in 1998 referred to earlier ) the following statement --
" As a result of sharply deteriorating political conditions in the region , Unocal which serves the development manager for the Central Asian ( Centgas ) pipeline consortium , has suspended all activities involving the proposed pipeline project in Afghanistan " ….
" Unocal will only participate in construction of the proposed Central Asian Gas Pipeline when and if Afghanistan achieves peace and stability , necessary to obtain financing from International Agencies for this project and an established government is recognized by the United Nations and the United States . "
Simultaneously the economic and political reasons , which was the ideology for the new wars for oil , hydrocarbon and other resources , amid deteriorating economic conditions for Corporate America ; was being worked out by the Project for the New American Century , which dovetailed with the aggressive economic policies of the Oil , Energy and other Corporations .
In 1997 prominent Republican party members among them , Donald
Rumsfield , Dick Cheney , Jeb Bush , Paul Wolfwitz , John Bolton , Peter Rodham , Zalmay Khalilzad ( an employee of UNOCAL ) and 18 other prominent Americans , broadly known as the neo- conservatives , organized the Project for the New American Century , the PNAC ( www.newamericancentury.order ) for the establishment of a New World Order .
A reference to these facts , influencing the ideology of the Defendant is necessary ; just as a reference to the ideology of the Nazi party was permitted to be brought on record at the Nuremberg trials .
Objectively considered , governments of both Republican and Democratic parties have resorted to war , to control regions and resources prior to , during and after the Second World War .
However the PNAC in its document published in September 2000 called " Rebuilding America 's defenses : Strategy , Forces and Resources for a New Century " was an ideological justification to prepare the citizens of the United States for continuous wars ..
The PNAC documented highlighted that -
….. "
At present United States faces no global rival .
America 's grand strategy should aim to preserve and extend this advantageous position so far into the future as possible ……'
……. "
Further the process of transformation , even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event ----- like a new Pearl Harbour ……. "
……. "
And advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool …….. "
The prosecution has conclusively proved its case , for the alternative reasons for the war of aggression waged by the Defendant ; which was regime change , in the interest of Unocal ‘s pipeline project , by inviting judicial notice of the Tribunal to established facts , that whereas Afghanistan was attacked on 7th October 2001 ; a conference was convened by the government of the United States and NATO on 27th November 2001 , acquiesced to by the Secretary General of the United Nations to form a transitional government , not in Afghanistan but in Bonn ; where the four non-Taliban Northern Alliance groups remained present .
The cabinet was nominated on 5th December 2001 by the United States of America and other occupying powers not by these groups .
Even earlier , on 1st December 2001 , President Hamid Karzai , a resident of the United States over several years , a green card holder ; the former official Representative of Unocal to the erstwhile Taliban militia's de facto government in Kabul , was sworn in as head of the interim government ( officially called the Transitional Government of Afghanistan ) .
Unocal now directly controls the government of Afghanistan .
On 23rd January 2003 , the Project for the New American Century , the PNAC sent one more note to President Bush which stated ………… " we write to endorse the bold course you have chartered for American National Security strategy …….. the victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan was an essential step in stabilizing that country ……… other rogue states remain a major problem . "
In 1864 referring to the increasing interference of Corporations in the political life of the USA ; President Abraham Lincoln was to warn in a letter to Colonel William Elkins :
" I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country … Corporations have been enthroned and an era of high corruption will follow and the money power of the country will endeavour to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed … "
The decision for regime change in Afghanistan , as in the changes of the earlier governments in Afghanistan , was dictated by the interests of Unocal and the Centgas consortium ; the result was war .
9.Testimony of RAWA Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women
A vital and independent witness at this trial , is Witness D , a representative of RAWA , the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women ( the name of the witness cannot be disclosed for reasons of personal security ; the Tribunal has resorted to alphabetical identification of these witnesses with a view to ensure their security ) who deposed on the tragedies inflicted by the government of the United States and other outside powers on the Afghan people ; emphasizing that the war waged by US forces did not liberate the people and women of Afghanistan as was claimed by the Defendant ; the militarily attack on Afghanistan , brought even more suffering on the Afghan people ; who faced bombings and were once again refugees in the camps .
Women faced increasing insecurity and even rape and kidnapping by warring factions .
That the Taliban militia was initially supported by the United States , as were the former Mujahideen who had regrouped as Northern ‘ war lords " ; Osama bin Laden , not an Afghan had been supported by the United States .
The witness emphasized that women in Afghanistan , did not need to be emancipated by foreign military forces ; they had been emancipated by the Afghan ruler Shah Amanullah in 1920 , and had the right to vote from 1929 ; .
Despite the dispersal of the Taliban women continued to be oppressed , by the " war lords " who were members of the Karzai Government and some of the provincial governors .
Coercive laws , continued to exist against women , even in Kabul ; the dignity and equal rights of Afghan women , which prevailed in the period prior to 1979 , before the civil war commenced in Afghanistan , has not been restored . ;
Afghanistan because of these civil war conditions , followed by military occupation , was economically devastated and had been reduced to the world ’s biggest producer of opium .
The evidence of this witness , who does not belong to any of the political factions in the tortuous history of Afghanistan , supports the prosecution case , that the war waged by the Defendant was not a " just war " , against terrorism ; and that the defendant had committed the serious crime of waging a war of aggression against a nation already facing difficult conditions , by external support to extremist and other organizations misusing religion in Afghanistan ; and that women had not been emancipated by this war as was claimed by the Defendant .
10 .
The effects of 9.11 and of the war on the people of the United States .
The 11th September 2001 terrorist attacks and the war , raise issues as to the use of 9.11 attacks and the war ; within the United States ; even as Corporations , collapsed , due to financial accounting frauds and systemic problems , which resulted in millions of job losses , attributed to 9.11 by the media ,
Two witnesses appeared before the Tribunal , to depose about conditions in the United States , immediately after the 11 th September 2001 .
Mr. Bobby Marsh who lost a loved one in the World Trade Centre , gave the Tribunal a poignant account of the personal tragedies of so many people in the United States , including his own ..
The attacks were seen by him and other people in the United States , first on Television .
The visual images had a devastating impact on him and other people ; those who had loved ones in these buildings were agonized about their safety .
The witness deposed that he was informed on the cell phone by Margaret , his close friend and companion who worked at the World Trade Centre , ; that instructions had been given by some officials to all those trapped in the towers , when the attack took place , to stay where they were , till the fire brigade department gave further instructions ; his companion who obeyed the instructions died .
This was the last communication that he was to receive from her .
Many people who rushed to safety , ignoring official instructions , survived .
This witness further deposed that the terrorist attacks of 11th September 2001 were used to create paranoia among the people ; there was an attempt to create a war hysteria .
The media in particular was immediately mobilizing people for war ; on the other hand the anti- war movement was supported by thousands of Americans across the United States who did not support a war on Afghanistan ; even some of those who were affected by the 9.11 terrorist attacks and had lost their loved ones .
Ms Gloria Lavera , President of the press workers union , the Union of Typographical Workers gave detailed evidence on the use of the print and television media to create mass hysteria ; and on the deteriorating situation within the United States for the freedom and democratic rights of citizens ; with workers losing jobs , facing repression , and reductions in their social security benefits ; the witness mentioned that immigrants were detained in hundreds without trial and no access to legal counsel .
Simultaneously surveillance commenced , on different groups and individuals , by intelligence organizations within the United States including illegally accessing their internet . , telephones , and even libraries to verify their political beliefs .
In this atmosphere , the Patriot Act was passed , sacrificing political freedom in the name of National Security ; authorizing detentions and extensive surveillance of law abiding citizens .
In answer to a question from the Tribunal , as to in whose interest the Patriot Act was passed ; this witness replied that it was passed in the interest of the Corporations in the context of mounting job losses .
11 . War Crimes
The Defendant as Commander –in – Chief of US forces , was aware that the military attack on Afghanistan was unjustified ; yet orders were given for the carpet bombing of cities , towns , and villages .
The nature of weapons of mass destruction used , the range of firepower unleashed in a country with few military targets ; resulted in mass murder of civilians and unnecessary loss of life of combatants who were surrendering .
The entire infrastructure of Afghanistan was destroyed ;
The women of Afghanistan who have lived through the horror of these war crimes , have given evidence before this Tribunal ; their oral evidence has been reinforced and supported by authoritative reports of humanitarian and scientific organizations .
It is clear from these reports from neutral sources , that the bombings of United States military forces were indiscriminate , sparing neither the International Red Cross Hospitals in Kabul and Kandahar , the Kajakai dam ; warehouses of the Red Cross where food was stored ; the maternity hospital at Kabul ; the military hospital at Herat ; homes , electrification facilities , irrigation projects , schools , TV stations and telephone exchanges were among other institutions indiscriminately bombed and destroyed ; constructed over years of development efforts by the people of Afghanistan , a landlocked developing country .
The testimony of Kenji Katsui , a journalist from Japan , who with a team investigated the destruction caused by the war and bombing ; reveals that in several parts of Kabul , in towns and villages across of Afghanistan , civilian homes and the infrastructure of the country was in ruins , due to bombing ; sources of water supply and electricity were affected , normal life in such circumstances for the people was impossible .
The witness conceded that a civil war , had raged in Afghanistan for more than 20 years , causing immense suffering ; however he emphasized , that the war waged by the United States was the final blow .
The witness handed over the video film taken by him which was screened by the Tribunal , of the destruction caused and interviews with people in Afghanistan .
The witness maintained that his testimony was supported by the entire investigative team ; present as observers at the trial .
There have been other agonizing accounts before this Tribunal , of indiscriminate bombing of civilian homes and areas ; from witnesses for whom it was not easy to depose , as they were women from Afghanistan , the victims of the bombing , directly affected .
Witnesses A , B and C ( whose identities have been concealed on request by referring to them in an alphabetical order )
Witness
A had lost members of her family in the bombings of Kabul in a civilian home ; Witness B fled from Afghanistan , when the bombings commenced from US aircraft ; trekked several miles seeking shelter in refugee camps on the borders of Afghanistan / Pakistan , which she said lacked in 2001 the basic facilities , such as food and other amenities , which had been available during the earlier civil war in Afghanistan , when she had sought shelter from successive regimes and their atrocities ; deposing that she and her family had become a refugee four times since 1979 .
Witness C had lost her daughter , a dedicated young teacher in her early twenties , immediately after her marriage ; the couple had been bombed in their home , by United States forces while they were asleep ; her only desire was that a school be constructed , to commemorate her daughter 's commitment to education .
On answers to questions from the Tribunal the witnesses denied that their homes were military targets , or in close proximity to any military installations ; Witness
A stated that a few Taliban were residing in residential homes in the area , but there were no military installations .
The witnesses agonized by their loss , maintained , that the reason for their presence at the trial , was the necessity to find a voice for the suffering inflicted on them , without reason ; and the disruption of their lives earlier by the civil war between the Mujahideen forces and the government of Afghanistan , when Russian troops arrived ; thereafter by the warlords ; after that by the Taliban forces ; and finally by the US military invasion , bombings and occupation ; they had lost hope for the future .
Even as the Tribunal prepared for its concluding hearings in December 2003 ; a UN spokesmen on 5th / 6th December expressed regret that 15 children were killed in US bombing , on a village .
Whereas US forces claimed that this was collateral damage as they were pursuing the Taliban .
12 . Plea on behalf of the Defendant of " collateral damage " on civilians that use of weapons of mass destruction not prohibited by a specific Convention ; legally untenable in view of clear rules of International Humanitarian Law for the conduct of warfare .
The defense advanced by amicus curiae on behalf of the Defendant , to the charge of war crimes committed on civilians , by indiscriminate bombings on the population , and on existing civilian infrastructure ; on combatants and non-combatants alike ; is that this was collateral damage in a just war against terrorism ; that the Defendant had no knowledge of the bombings on civilians and civilian infrastructure ; and that none of the weapons used in Afghanistan by US forces , even though weapons of immense destructive power were prohibited by specific Conventions to which the United States was a signatory .
It is necessary to reiterate well established principles of Interntaional Humanitarian Law which prohibit such war crimes .
In the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on Nuclear Weapons rendered in 1996 ; Judge Christopher Gregory Weeramantry , in a learned and reflective judgement , recalled , that traditional principles of Humanitarian Law is deep rooted in many cultures and civilizations , whether " Hindu , Buddhist , Chinese , Christian , Islamic and traditional African " among other civilizations , over thousands of years , Referring to and quoting the famous " Martens clause " introduced by unanimous vote into the Hague Convention of 1899 on the Laws and Customs of War on Land ( Hague IV ) and the 1907 Hague Convention which mandated that
- …. "
In cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them , the inhabitants and belligerents remain under the protection and the rule of the principles of the law of nations , as they result from the usage established among civilized peoples , from the law of humanity and the dictates of conscience . "
Justice C.G. Weeramantry referred in his judgement to an interesting historical fact , relevant in this trial of the Defendant ; that Mr Martens , author of the aforesaid " Marten Clause " had clarified , during the negotiations of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions ; that Mr. Martens owed the inspiration of this clause " to President Abraham Lincoln ‘s directives to Professor Leiber , to prepare instructions for General Grant , to draw up regulations , for the humane conduct of the War of Secession in the United States , between forces of the Union and Confederacy " ….. and what was referred to as the " Martens clause " in International Humanitarian Law was its " logical and natural development " .
To contend as the Defendant does , that the United States Armed forces and its President , is not bound by rules of International Humanitarian Warfare for the manufacture , stockpiling and use of weapons , in violation of the laws of warfare ; of which a critical clause , reproduced thereafter in practically every Convention regulating International Humanitarian Law , was inspired by President Abraham Lincoln of the United States ; is an attempt to turn back the clock of history , and to continue the tragic and criminal decision making of the government of the United States , that led to the nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , serious war crimes ; and which the Tokyo District Court in Shimoda v The State ( The Japanese Annual of International Law , Vol 8 1964 , p 240 ) did not take to its correct logical and legal conclusion ; though the court conceded in a part of its reasoning , that it could " safely see that besides poison gas and bacterium the use of means of injuring the enemy which causes at least the same or more injury is prohibited by International Law… . "
It is necessary to recall the threat of the government of the United States
to bomb Vietnam " into the stone age " while assessing these Crimes .
The International Court of Justice in the Advisory Opinion on Nuclear
Weapons in 1996 ; referred to customary International law regulating the conduct of war ; to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions ; the four Geneva Conventions including the Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating Poisonous and other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare ; the two Additional Protocols of 1977 , binding on all State parties , even those who are not signatories , as these protocols merely reaffirm existing principles of International Customary Law regulating armed conflict ; the Environmental Modification Convention of 1977 and the Conventional Weapons Convention of 1980 ; as International Humanitarian Law on the conduct of warfare emphasizing that the " Martens Clause " is the link between Treaty Law and Customary International Law in International Humanitarian Law .
In addition to the aforesaid Conventions , the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction of 1997 , and similar Conventions ; merely codify , established principles of customary International law , that the right of parties " to adopt means of injuring the enemy are not unlimited " and " arms , projectiles or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering shall not be used " ; and that civilian populations are not to be harmed , among other principles codified subsequently by Convention .
The working paper prepared , pursuant to the Resolution 2001/ 6 , by Y.K.J. Yeung Sik Yuen on " Human Rights and Weapons of Mass Destruction , Or With Indiscriminate Effect , or of a Nature to Cause Superfluous Injury or Unnecessary Suffering " for the Sub-Commission on the promotion and protection of Human Rights , of the Commission of Human Rights , Economic and Social Council ( E/ CN.4/Sub.2/2002/38 dated 27th June 2002 ) broadly reiterates the principles of the aforesaid Advisory Opinion of the ICJ .
The author referring to the principles of customary International Humanitarian Law , and to the Conventions and treaties , in force for over a century has correctly summarized the tests to be satisfied before weapons systems fulfil the legal test for deployment as follows -
" The above Conventions are by no means exhaustive and taken together with the precepts of customary International Law show that a number of legal principles banning or limiting certain arms are now firmly established .
Weapons are to be considered banned if :
Their use has indiscriminate effects ( no effective distinction between civilians and belligerents ) ;
Their use is out of proportion with the pursuit of military objective ;
Their use adversely affects the environment in a widespread , long term and severe manner ;
Their use causes superflous injury and unnecessary suffering . "
In accordance with these tests , the following weapons systems used in Afghanistan are illegal and their permitted use by the Defendant , Commander - in – Chief of US forces are War Crimes .
The illegal weapons are :
1.Depleted Uranium munitions
2. Fuel –air explosives ( FAEs ) or Daisy Cutters
3.Cluster bombs .
4.Anti-Personnel mines
13 . Use of genocidal and omnicidal radioactive Depleted Uranium weapons in Afghanistan , a war crime , genocide , and omnicide
The evidence presented before the Tribunal , which has shocked the conscience of the judges of this Tribunal , is the thoroughly researched evidence on the genocidal and omnicidal nature of Depleted Uranium weapons used in Afghanistan by United States military forces , with the Defendant as their Commander - in - Chief by Leuren Moret , President , Scientists For Indigenous People , City of Berkely Environmental Commissioner ; Professor Katsuma Yagasaki of the Faculty of Science of the Ryukyus University , Okinawa ; and of Major Doug Rokke , Professor of Physics and Geosciences of Jacksonville State University , former Director of DU weapons project of the US army from 1994 - 1995 in charge of the cleaning up of DU in Iraq , himself affected by DU .
These three witnesses made available to this Tribunal , details of their investigations , scientific documents , memorandum from the US army sources and the Manhattan project ; statistical studies of people of Iraq , children and others exposed to DU ordnance after the first Gulf War , including from the Gulf War Veterans Association , on the nature of this weapon ; which prove beyond doubt that the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief of US forces used DU weapons in Afghanistan , in the manner that Zyklon - B was used across Europe ; as a weapon of mass murder in Afghanistan calculated to destroy of all living species exposed .
Professor Albrecht Schott , Scientist , World Depleted Uranium Centre , Berlin in an address titled " Consequences of the Military and Civil Use of Depleted Uranium ( DU ) " , at the public symposium on ' American Policy and its Consequences ' , has described Depleted Uranium as " A Weapon Against This Planet . "
Prosecution Document E-130 ; this leads logically to the word " Omnicide " used by witness Leuren Moret , among other scientists while describing the effect of this weapon system ; as going beyond the " silent genocide " it has inflicted on the Afghan and Iraqi people .
Rosalie Bartell author of the classic book " No Immediate Danger " has given the following comprehensive meaning of the term Omnicide as :
" The concept of species annihilation means a relatively swift , deliberately induced end to history , culture , science , biological reproduction and memory .
It is the ultimate human rejection of the gift of life , an act which requires a new word to describe it as omnicide . "
The use of DU ordnance in Afghanistan by the United States military forces has not been denied .
The US military forces with the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief , with full knowledge of the nature and impact of the weapons system , known to the Manhattan project as early as 1943 ; used DU ordnance by way of attack aircraft , AH - 64 helicopter gun ships , advanced cruise missiles , CALCM among others .
PGU - 14 API uranium piercing munitions fired by Vulcan Canon installed on A10 Gun ships , and AH - 64 Apache gun ships apart from the Bunker buster bombs ( DU weapons ) which were dropped from F - 16 attack planes .
It is authoritatively estimated by independent scientific investigations and reports on record before this Tribunal , and the prosecution conservatively estimates , that at the very minimum 500 - 600 tonnes of DU ordnance were used throughout Afghanistan including at Tora Bora , Shaikoot , Paktia , Mazare - e- Sharif , Jalalabad , Nangarhar , Khost , Kundoz and Kabul around Bagram from October 2001 after the bombings commenced on 7th October 2001 , whereas Dr Mohammed Daud Miraki of the Afghanistan Recovery Fund refers to not less than 1000 tonnes of Depleted and undepleted Uranium being used .
On 16th January 2002 , the Secretary for Defense , Mr. Rumsfield in a briefing confirmed that " high levels of radioactive count " had been confirmed due to the result of " Depleted Uranium shells on some warheads " - Prosecution Document Ex .
E - 122 .
Mr Philip Coyle Senior Adviser of the Centre for Defense Information in Washington DC , admitted that DU weapons had been used in Afghanistan .
The documented reports of Marc Herold and Dai Williams , Prosecution documents at Ex .
E - 118 and E - 119 ; the Survey of the Uranium Medical Research Centre , Washington DC ; Prosecution Document - E 120 ; the reports of Dr Mohammed Daud Miraki , Afghan Recovery Fund , referred to above , Prosecution Documents Ex. E - 137 and E - 138 , among other documents ; refer in detail to the widespread use and effects of DU weapons on the people in Afghanistan inflicting slow and painful death , termed the " silent genocide " ; affecting the unborn , altering irreversibly the genetic code of all those exposed .
Testimonies of fathers and mother , made to the field teams of the Uranium Medical Research Centre ( UMRC ) are horrifying :
" What else do the Americans want ?
They killed us , they turned our new borns into horrific deformations , and they turned our farm lands into grave yards and destroyed our homes .
On top of all this their planes fly over and spray us with bullets … …we have nothing to lose ……. we will fight them the same way we fought the previous invaders ……. ( Sayed Gharib at Tora Bora ) .
Ms Leuren Moret gave vital evidence of United States military policy , on the use of DU weapons , tracing the history of its creation and the politics of its use - Prosecution document Ex .E 156 .
Ms Leuren Moret deposed that - after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , an international outcry and taboo against nuclear weapons , prevented the further use of nuclear and radioactive weapons ; this policy was abandoned in 1991 ; a decision was made by the Strategic Command in the USA to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons by introducing DU into the battlefield ; this witness has aptly described DU as the " trojan horse " of nuclear weapons ; with similar effects .
The witness maintained that it was the cost factor which made DU weaponry an attractive weapon for the arms industry ; though on the other hand the cost to humanity , was an unacceptable cost ; deposing further , that DU being a byproduct from nuclear weapons and nuclear power industries ; a " radioactive " hazard , a liability to the Department of Energy ; millions of tons were passed on to the " military - industrial " complex for the manufacture of weapons .
By selling depleted uranium weapons to more than 20 countries , the DOE has made a profitable business for the arms industry .
The documents produced by this witness , handed over to her by Major Doug Rokke ; prove conclusively that the United States government and military were aware from 1943 , of the genocidal and omnicidal nature of DU weapons .
A memorandum dated 30th October 1943 , received by General Groves in charge of the Manhattan Project ( nuclear weapons project ) from three physicians working under him , Prosecution document Ex - E 126 , recommends that radiological materials be developed for use as a military weapon on the battlefield .
It was a blueprint for depleted uranium weaponry .
The aforesaid memorandum describing the property of DU weapons describes that
" ….
The material … ground into particles of microscopic size ….. would be distributed in the form of dust and smoke by ground fired projectiles , land vehicles and bombs ….
inhaled by personnel …. it is estimated that one millionth of a gram accumulating in a persons body would be fatal .
There are no known methods of treatment for such casualty … areas so contaminated by radioactive dusts and smokes would be dangerous as long as high concentration of metal was maintained .… reservoirs or wells would be contaminated ….. food poisoned …. particles larger than I micron would be deposited in the nose , trachea and bronchi…particles smaller than 1 micron are more likely to be deposited in alveoli where they will remain ….or be absorbed into the lymphatics or blood …….
Beta and gamma emitting fission products …… may be absorbed by the blood and distributed to the whole body . "
In the second document produced , memorandum dated 1ST March 1991 addressed by Lt.Col.M.V.Zeiman ( after the first Gulf War of 1991 ) to Major Larsson of the Studies and Analysis Branch on the subject of " The Effectiveness of Depleted Uranium Penetrators , Prosecution Document Ex. E - 127 , emphasizes that … " the impact of DU penetrators were very effective against Iraqi armour ... there has been and continues to be concern regarding the impact of DU on the environment … … DU rounds may become politically unacceptable …and thus be deleted from the arsenal … we should ensure their future existence … I believe we should keep this in mind when after action reports are written " .
The interpretation of this memorandum , by the witness Leuren Moret , that this memorandum in fact directed , that after action reports should be falsified , to conceal the real effects of DU weaponry , is correct .
The third significant document produced by this witness , is the communication dated 19th August 1993 , Prosecution Document Ex .
E - 128 , by Brigadier Eric .
K.Shinskei , at the relevant time Brigadier General , GS , Director of Training forwarded to the Assistant Secretary of the Army ( Installation , logistics and Environment ) on the subject : Review of Draft Report to Congress - Health and Environmental Consequences of Depleted Uranium in the US army .
This communication states that after Operation Desert Storm ( the first Gulf War ) the GAO examined the Army 's ability to contend with Depleted Uranium contamination .
The GAO published a draft memorandum which was accepted by the Department of Defence on 15th January 1993 which was a tasking memorandum directing the Secretary of Army to -
Provide adequate training for personnel who may come in contact with DU contaminated equipment ; Complete medical testing of all personnel exposed to DU contamination .
Develop a plan for DU contaminated equipment recovery during future operation .
Leuren Moret , concluding her testimony deposed , that from the properties of DU weapons ; its radioactive particles travelling through air , water and food sources ; it is not only countries where these weapons are used which are in the affected zone , but all countries within a radius of approximately 1000 miles of the use of DU weapons ; due to the wind factor and atmospheric dusts ; a map was displayed indicating the countries in the DU affected zone from the use of the weaponry in Afghanistan and Iraq , placed on record of this Tribunal which indicates that Iran , Pakistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Russia , Georgia , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , China and India , are among the countries affected by the use of DU weaponry in Afghanistan ; and Saudi Arabia , Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Turkey , Iran are among the countries affected by the use DU weapons in Iraq during both the military attacks against Iraq .
Major Doug Rokke Director of the DU project from 1994 to 1995 , himself a victim of the DU weapons , clean up operations after the first Gulf War ; was interviewed at the Hamburg Conference on DU in October 2003 , by Prosecutor Kazuko Ito ; the video of interview is Prosecution document Ex. E 124 ; amicus curiae who has seen the interview has raised no objections to its production .
Major Doug Rokke commenting on his attempts to focus on the risks of DU weapons while in charge of the DU program of the US army stated :
" ... military officers from the UK , Australia , Canada and Germany participated in the project to study the risk of DU weapons and I was directed by the Army to direct the team …we submitted recommendations which were completely ignored ... the US army has not taken any measures to protect soldiers .
Although we made a proposal that clean - up is essential , complete clean up is impossible .
Therefore we proposed , not to use DU weapons any longer .
However our proposal was ignored by the upper level of the government and completely ignored by NATO , UK , Australia and others "
Referring to the videos which had been made for the Pentagon about DU weapons ; on risks , clean up measures , method of measuring radioactivity etc. for the US army ; the witness emphasized that these videos were never used and the U.S decided to seal this DU project , because the results revealed that DU weapons were extremely risky and its use would be prohibited by international pressure .
The United States government the witness stated , continues to use these weapons because they are inexpensive and effective , and also because it is a milestone to make fourth generation nuclear ordnance acceptable , by advancing the proposition that contamination of fourth generation nuclear weapons , would not exceed the levels of radioactive contamination of DU .
The evidence of Major Doug Rokke , has to be assessed in the light of the report on Gulf War Veterans .
By now half of all the 697 , 000 soldiers involved in the 1991 Gulf War have reported serious illnesses .
According to the Gulf War Veterans Association , more than 30 % are chronically ill .
Children born to soldiers of coalition personnel after the Gulf War were born deformed or with serious birth defects ; including those who had healthy babies earlier .
Recently a soldier in the UK has succeeded after several years of struggle , in obtaining a judgement which recognizes the DU weapons had caused serious physiological effects .
The third witness before the Tribunal on the issue of the use of DU weapons as a War Crime , Professor Katsuma Yagasaki , Prosecution documents Ex. E 158 and 159 presented oral and documentary evidence clarifying that the term " depleted " seems to convey the incorrect impression that DU is uranium that does not contain radioactivity any more , which is not the case ; as DU ammunition causes radioactive contamination and is no less serious than nuclear weapons .
Even one DU particle has adequate capacity to cause cancer and once absorbed into the body can transform genes , cells and affect all the organs and lymph nodes .
Professor Yakasaki deposed that the total amount of 235U dispersed in Hiroshima was 61.2 kilograms ; since it was estimated that about 500 - 600 tons of DU weapons were used in Afghanistan , DU pollution in Afghanistan is 8,170 tons more than in Hiroshima ; that the adverse effects of radioactive contamination in Afghanistan and the internal radiation risk is beyond our imagination , as the alpha ray from the DU damages the DNA irreversibly and that the entire concept of low radiation risk was misleading with respect to internal exposure , as DU is absorbed by inhalation and internal contamination .
Professor Yagasaki in the paper on record before this Tribunal presented at the ‘ World Uranium Conference Weapons Conference ’ in October 2003 ; calculated that 800 tons of DU is the atomicity equivalent to 83,000 Nagasaki bombs .
The amount of DU used in Iraq is equivalent to 250,000 Nagasaki bombs .
Professor Yagasaki affirmed that DU shells are atrocious radioactive weapons which should not be used ; and that DU has a long life of 4.5 billion years remaining in the soil , air , water in all affected zones .
The Tribunal on an issue vital for this trial had to deal with the ambiguity of the WHO report ; this report Prosecution document Ex. E - 123 was placed before Professor Yagasaki by the Tribunal , to elicit his scientific response to the document , since it was relied on by amicus curiae to defend the use of this weapons system by the Defendant ; stating that the WHO report did not refer to such horrific consequences ; the WHO report was found to be vague and evasive , partly admitting , partly in denial , not in conformity with the overwhelming and authoritative evidence from 1943 , deposed to by the witnesses ; moreover the WHO report was not signed ; no scientist or panel of scientists had authenticated this report .
In his paper on ' Undiagnosed Illnesses and Radioactive Warfare ' Dr.Asaf Durakovik who first identified the " Gulf War Syndrome " caused by exposure to DU ordnance , Prosecution document Ex. E - 120 ; has on the basis of investigations carried out on Gulf War Veterans in Canada and elsewhere ; reported that DU accumulates in the bone , kidney , reproductive systems , brain and lung , with verified genotoxic , mutagenic and carcinogenic properties , as well as reproductive and teratogenic alterations even 10 years after inhalation exposure or receiving of shrapnel wounds ; this contradicts the WHO report
Professor Yagasaki gave details to the Tribunal on the unscientific nature of the WHO report on material particulars , in particular on the inability of the report to analyze the properties of DU .
On reading the unsigned report of the WHO report on DU munitions , I find that while concealing the serious effects of the weapons system ; it attempts to take a safe and evasive position , in the eventuality of the report being faulted by the on the ground situation , by mentioning that :
…." following conflict , levels of DU contamination in food and water may be detected in affected areas after a few years .
This should be monitored …. "
" where possible , clean up operations in impact zones should be undertaken , if there are substantial number of radioactive projectiles remaining and where qualified experts deem contaminated levels to be unacceptable ….. "
. The WHO is contradicted by its own scientist , Dr. Michael H.Repacholi of the WHO who is quoted by Dr. Mohammed Daud Miraki in his report ‘ Silent Genocide from America ’ Prosecution document Ex. E – 137 , as having reported that :
" DU is released from fired weapons in the form of small particles which may be inhaled , ingested or remain in the environment ….. children may be at greater risk of DU exposure … within a war zone … through contaminated food and water …
A recent BBC Television report of February 2004 quoted Dr. Keith Baverstock , Senior Radiation Specialist to the WHO , who stated that he was the co-author of a WHO Report 2001 , on the affects of DU on health which was classified as " Secret " by WHO to prevent its release to the public .
On October 20 , 2002 Dr Asaf Durakovik , Professor of nuclear medicine at George Town University whose report has been submitted to the Tribunal ; reported preliminary test results on sick civilians from Southern Afghanistan at Qatar .
Specimens contained 100 times the normal level of uranium concentration .
Curiously this was undepleted and not depleted uranium …….
Dr Asaf said in an interview to Al - Jazeera television in November 2002 , that the US forces had used more DU in Afghanistan than they had in the first Gulf War and the Balkans . "
" A large number of health specialists in Afghanistan … … regard the increasing birth defects to be the result of the dropping DU munitions on Afghanistan … children were born with no eyes , no limbs , tumours protruding from their mouth …. with deformed genitalia "
It was noticed that soldiers , birds in large numbers died after bleeding from their mouths , noses and ears ; many people died without any physical injuries after having developed unusual symptoms .
Marc .
W Herold of the University of New Hampshire in the detailed study titled " Uranium Wars : The Pentagon Steps Up Its Use of Radioactive Munitions " has reported that –
" in the Afghan campaign , a new generation of uranium weapons is suspected to have been used extensively for targeting underground facilities and caves … … "
Intensely bombed hard target zones ……….. may now be heavily contaminated with DU oxide …….. During the course of the operation , US planes conducted 950 sorties and dropped more than 3,450 bombs . " " … risks to US and Afghan troops being sent out to check out bombed cave systems are horrendous …… even more serious are ….. in densely populated target zones like Kabul ….. " " ….
Given the heavy US bombing of the mountains of eastern Afghanistan ‘ it seems probable that large amounts of DU have found their way into the rivers of the Hindu basin whose source is precisely in the mountains of the Hindu – Kush .
For example heading east from Kabul …. the Kabul river crosses into Pakistan and feeds the Indus river .
In arid areas like Southern Afghanistan , most of the uranium oxide would remain as surface dust where it will have been widely dispersed by wind and vehicle movements …. " . " ….
In mid-December , the Pentagon announced the development of another new , high –tech bunker busting bomb in Afghanistan .
The laser –guided bomb is a thermobaric weapon , a high pressure explosive that destroys underground caves and tunnels ….. "
14 . The Use of Cluster Bombs { CBU 87 and CBU 103 } & Daisy Cutters { Fuel Air Explosive } War Crimes
Apart from using DU weapons with the full knowledge of the Defendant , the Commander - in - Chief of the military forces of the United States , Cluster Bombs and Fuel - Air Explosives ( Daisy Cutters ) were used by the United States military .
The report of Human Rights Watch has in a report titled " Fatally Flawed : Cluster bombs and Their Use by the United States in Afghanistan " reported that –
" …… the US arsenal included cluster bombs , large bombs that release hundreds of smaller ammunitions or bomblets … , they also have serious civilian side effects … ( the areas over which the bomblets disperse ) as well as the fact that they leave behind large numbers of unexploded sub-munitions , that they become de facto land mines .
The United States dropped about 1,228 cluster bombs containing 248,056 bomblets between October 2001 and March 2002 ….. the United States primarily used two models , the CBU – 87 , a veteran of the Gulf War and the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia , and the new … … CBU – 103 ….. Navy CBU –99s , CBU – 100S and JSOW were also used . "
In a three and a half week mission to Afghanistan in March 2001 , Human Rights found ample evidence that cluster bombs caused civilians harm
" …. Cluster bombs also left unexploded bomblets , or live duds which continue to injure and kill innocent civilians long after the attack …. common post –strike victims in Afghanistan include shepherds grazing their flocks , farmers plowing their fields , and children gathering wood . "
In the report by Laura Flanders titled , Weapons of Mass Destruction ( US is dropping World ’s Biggest Non-Nuclear Weapons in Afghanistan ) on record before this Tribunal describes , that BLU – 82 is named " Daisy Cutter " because of the nature of crater it leaves .
That it has the ability –
" to clear a 3 mile long path .
Dropped from a huge transport aircraft " Big Blue " releases a cloud of inflammable ammonium nitrate , aluminium dust , and polystyrene slurry which is then ignited by a detonator .
The result is a firestorm that incinerates an area the size of five football fields , consumes oxygen , and creates a shock –wave and a vacuum pressure that destroys internal organs of anyone in range " .
None of these weapons systems used in Afghanistan satisfy the tests of International Humanitarian Law ; the use of these weapons are war crimes .
Humanity cannot evade or avoid the question , as to the nature of criminality of an individual and system , which seeks to destroy not only existing life , but to mutilate the life to come .
15 . War Crimes committed by the Defendant on of Prisoners of War :
The relevant details from the Fact Sheet on Status of Detainees at Guantanamo Bay , released by the office of the Press Secretary on February 7 , 2002 Prosecution document Ex - 31 states :
" …. The President has determined that the Geneva Convention applies to the Taliban detainees but not to the al Qaeda detainees .
Al Qaeda is not a State party to the Geneva Convention ; it is a foreign terrorist group .
As such its members are not entitled to POW status .
Although we have never recognized the Taliban as the legitimate Afghan government , Afghanistan is a party to the Convention , and the President has determined that the Taliban are covered by the Convention , however the Taliban detainees do not qualify as POWs ……. "
The official stand of the United States government that the Taliban fighters are not entitled to POW status is in violation of Article 4 of the Geneva Convention 1949 ( III ) on Prisoners of War which defines a POW as follows :
" Prisoners of war , in the sense of the present Convention , are persons belonging to one of the following categories , who have fallen into the power of the enemy :
Members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict as well as the members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces .
The United States government had dealt with the de facto government of the Taliban directly and through Unocal ; prisoner of war status cannot be denied to the Taliban combatants ; even though the United States had not recognized the Taliban , which was recognized only by Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and the UAE with the United Nations continuing to recognize the previous government .
The Geneva Convention 1949 ( III ) Article 4 , does not mandate that a party to the conflict should be recognized as a government , before members of its armed forces are entitled to POW status .
The status of of Al Qaeda or " foreign fighters " differs as admittedly they belonged to various countries , not parties to the conflict and it is not conclusively established that they were " volunteers " or " mercenaries " ; Yet the " foreign fighters " are entitled to humane treatment , under the Martens Clause of the Additional Protocol 1 of 1977 , a rule of customary law ..
The issue is far more complicated than it appears ; and the facts however distasteful to concerned countries , are that the " foreign fighters " were recruited , from several countries ; the US , UK , Saudi Arabia , Australia , Canada , Pakistan , Morocco , Saudi Arabia and others ; trained on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border by special forces of the United States , Pakistan and other countries in furtherance of the strategic interest of the United State and of those countries , who were close allies ; a fact admitted to by Mr.Brerzinski , former National Security Advisor and former Director of the CIA Director Robert Gates ;
The legal issue which arises for determination is can the United States government deny the " foreign fighters ’
POW status , having recruited , financed , trained and supported " foreign fighters " through friendly intelligence agencies , and agreed to their assisting the Taliban in a supporting role for regime change ; or is the POW status of " foreign fighters " to be strictly determined , by the people and government of Afghanistan , who for more than two decades have been torn apart , by countries waging a civil war through hired " foreign fighters " within its territories ; and in pursuit of resources of the region which extends from Central Asia across to Eastern Europe , to former Yuglslavia , referred to by Zbigniew Brerzinski , former National Security Adviser as Eurasia ; a region where the " foreign fighters " trained on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , have been actively engaged .
Despite the serious and illegal use of these " foreign fighters " ; their status would have be first to ascertained by a competent Tribunal ; not by a secret military commission or a secret military tribunal ; in accordance with Article 5 of the Geneva Convention which stipulates that :
" Should any doubt arise as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy , belong to any one of the categories enumerated in Article 4 , such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal . "
Until their status is ascertained by competent tribunals those who are suspected of being foreign fighters , are entitled to POW status .
Article 13 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 1949 mandates that :
" Prisoners of War must at all times be humanely treated .
Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited ……. no prisoner of war must be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments which are unjustified .
Likewise prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity . "
The Indictment has charged the Defendant , as Commander - in - Chief of United States military forces for serious war crimes against prisoners of war .
The policy of the Defendant and the United States government , as reflected in the reports of humanitarian organizations ; supported by circumstantial evidence ; leads to the conclusion that the objective appears to have been to eliminate in particular " foreign fighters " ; probably to suppress evidence of the use of " Arab and other foreign fighters " , in Afghanistan and different regions .
News paper reports and articles before the Tribunal have quoted the Secretary of Defence , Mr Donald Rumsfield to this effect ; however it would be unsafe to rely on these reports without corroboration .
In this context a similar approach was adopted for different reasons in the Boer War ; the informal communication of Lord Kitchner to field commanders was that " no prisoners " were to be taken ; this resulted in the killing of surrendering Boer prisoners of the British forces ; and an uproar in Europe ; as a consequence , officers of a Australian contingent then serving the British Imperial forces in South Africa , were made scapegoats and faced a court martial for killing surrendering prisoners of war ; at the highest level no responsibility was taken .
The documentary evidence presented , including the film of Jamie Doran the Irish film maker " Afghan Massacre : The Convoy of Death " Prosecution document - 1 ; supported by actual incidents , investigated and reported by correspondents and individuals ; reports of humanitarian organizations including the Red Cross ; of Amnesty International ; confirm that war crimes were committed by US military forces under the overall command of the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief .
There is however difficulty in attributing criminal responsibility to the Defendant , as Commander - in Chief of US forces , for Taliban prisoners and foreign fighters , where there is a lacuna in the evidence , and differing versions have been presented by the prosecution in respect of two issues relating to the prisoners of war ; whether the decision to transport prisoners in containers was that of US forces or the Northern Alliance ; and whether the prison at Sheberghan was in the overall control of US forces .
The International Tribunal of the Far East constituted after the Second World War held that :
" In general the responsibility of prisoners held in Japan may be stated to have rested upon :
Members of the Government ; Military or Naval Officers in command of formations having prisoner in their Possession ; Officials in those departments which were concerned with the well being of prisoners ; Officials , whether civilian , military , or naval having direct and immediate
Control of the prisoners " .
These were the officials who were responsible for Prisoners of War or detainees .
The incidents relating to culpability before the Tribunal are :
A. Bombing of Detainees and POW at Qala - I - Janghi .
The United States special forces directed the bombing by warplanes and helicopter gunships of 4000 Taliban soldiers and foreign fighters , including hundreds of civilians and paramilitary personnel from Pakistan ; who had surrendered after negotiations at Kunduz and were detained in the Qala - i - Janghi under the pretext that there had been a prison uprising ; triggered by the presence of CIA interrogators .
Hundreds of prisoners were killed and maimed ; for which the Defendant has direct responsibility , as the Commander - in - Chief of US forces ; the decision to bomb the prisoners was taken by special forces and Intelligence teams .
This is borne out by factual , visual and circumstantial evidence .
B. Torture of Prisoners at Baghram and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean
Prisoners were shackled and tortured , at the prison camp at Baghram airport Prosecution document 62 OCS NEWS 17TH January , 2003 , exclusively under the control of US forces ; blindfolded , beaten , illuminated with strong halogen lights for 24 hours , continuously deprived of sleep ; left standing and kneeling for hours on end ; brutalities , inhumane treatment and insults were inflicted on these prisoners ; detained for interrogation in a cluster of metal shipping containers guarded by wires with no access to the outside world and during interrogation with no exposure to daylight ; the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief of United States Military forces was responsible for the treatment of prisoners and detainees in the custody of the United States .
National Security Officials in Washington according to the Washington post , defended the use of violence and torture against detainees and POW saying that -" if you do n't violate someone 's human rights some of the time , you probably are n't doing your job … . "
Prisoners and detainees at Diego Garcia also received similar treatment .
C. Guantanamo Bay
Prisoners and detainees were transported shackled and hooded , denied adequate food and water while being illegally transported from Afghanistan to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuban territory , which is Cuban territory under illegal occupation ; with the knowledge and assent of the Defendant ; the detainees were held incommunicado , in constructed open cages ; tortured , subject to interrogation with deprival of sleep ; kept in solitary confinement , beaten .
In the early period of their detention , the International Committee of the Red Cross was denied access to these prisoners ; eventually the Red Cross was permitted access and publicly condemned the conditions under which the detainees and POW had been held ..
It is documented that about 649 persons are known to be incarcerated and denied access to lawyers any legal system to prove their innocence or status .
No Tribunal has been constituted in accordance with the Geneva Convention to ascertain their status
The inhuman conditions , the interrogation by " stress and duress " techniques , and torture have led to suicides and attempts at suicide .
In violation of article 12 and article 13 of the Geneva Convention ( III ) 1949 , these detainees have been transferred to other countries for interrogation , not parties to the war .
The details about Guantanamo and Baghram have been incorporated in a memorandum to the Inter - American Commission On Human Rights Organization of American States by the Centre for Constitutional Rights and the International Human Rights Law Group , New York submitted on 13 February 2003 .
D. Transporting of Prisoners in Containers
The prosecution has in its indictment referred to the serious war crime of transporting hundreds of prisoners who were captured ; the Taliban and foreign fighters who had surrendered at Kunduz in Cargo containers , and the death of these prisoners from suffocation due to lack of access to air and water .
The prosecution submits that one hundred to two hundred men were placed in each container , which was about 40 feet long .
The prisoners were transported to Sheberghan Prison , without air or water and majority of them suffocated to death .
During transportation of these prisoners , rifle shots were fired at the containers by soldiers , for creation of ventilation holes which killed some of the prisoners
The documents relied on by the Prosecution is Prosecution document Ex . P - 1 Jamie Doran ' s report in the film " Afghan Massacre : the Convoy of death " and the article of Newsweek Prosecution document - K - 61 .
However , whereas the incident is established beyond doubt , there are contradictions as to who took the decision to transport prisoners in this manner ; whether this was an on the spot decision of commander of the Northern Alliance , or a pre-planned conspiracy involving US forces ; in view of the lacuna in the evidence which requires further proof , if it is to be attributed to the Defendant , there is difficulty in attributing criminal responsibility to the Defendant in respect of this extremely serious incident leading to the mass murder of Taliban soldiers and foreign fighters from Pakistan and other countries without conclusive evidence .
. An officer of the Northern alliance has been quoted by the prosecution as stating in Prosecution document P - 1 on prisoners of war :
" We took charge of transferring detainees .
In Qala Zeini we got hold of 25 containers on the way to Sheberghan prison and put 200 or so prisoners into each container . "
The subsequent evidence relied on by the proseuction from Prosecution document -K 61 ( as told to a correspondent of Newsweek ) is by a person under an assumed name of Mohammed , who states that he drove one of the Containers , in compliance with the request of a soldier under General Dostum ; the prisoners in the containers struck at the wall of the container and shouted for water stating that they were dying ; the driver made holes with a hammer in the container ; when a soldier under General Dostum heard the sound ; he pretended that he was merely sealing holes .
Mr Mohammed Ikram , a well known Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan , while deposing on instructions given to him by his client , on the treatment of Prisoners of war ; mentioned that there was gross internal interference by the Intelligence agencies of the United States in Pakistan , including in matters of internal investigation ; and that his client was unable to remain present to depose on aspects of treatment of prisoners of war by US troops , before the Tribunal , in view of delay in the issue of his travel documents ; as a consequence , vital evidence on war crimes against detainees and POW was not made available , which would have been conclusive on the transfer of prisoners in containers and other issues .
Mr Mohammed Ikram Chaudhary , Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan , gave details of the instructions given to him by his client on the treatment of detainees by the United States Occupation forces , even though he stated that his client had not been involved in hostilities ; and informed the Tribunal of the interference of the Intelligence Agencies of Pakistan in the criminal investigation and administration in Pakistan , violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty ; deposing that he had filed a suit for damages against the government of the United States , against the illegal detention and torture of his client , Mr. Mohammed Sagheer , resident of Pattan in the North Western Frontier Province of Pakistan , by US forces in Afghanistan ; his ill treatment , torture , denial of adequate nutrition , medical assistance within Afghanistan , and illegal transportation to Cuba in shackles and hooded and subsequent incarceration at the US military base Guantanamo Bay ; .
Mr Mohammed Ikram Chaudhary , advocate , produced before the Tribunal , the legal notice sent on behalf of his client to the Government of the United States .
The Tribunal in view of the difficulties faced by Mohammed Sagheer in attending the trial a travel documents were not issued to him on time by the Government of Pakistan , could not address questions on the incidents directly relating to the affected individual ; though the fact of detention and treatment of Mohammed Sagheer is part of the same pattern .
The Prosecution in respect of serious incident of transporting prisoners in containers , has submitted , that both the Northern alliance and the Taliban militia had used " Containers " to inflict mass murder , on prisoners taken from each other in the past ; and this had happened at Mazaar - e - Sharif on both sides ; even before the military attack by United States military forces .
In this context the evidence of the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women , Prosecution witness D , on the brutalities committed by both political groups , trained to misuse religion and carry out violent attacks , by outside powers , to devastate Afghanistan , is relevant and requires investigation even within Afghanistan .
In view of the lack of conclusive evidence of the involvement of military forces of the United States , it is not possible to arrive at a conclusive finding , to hold the Defendant guilty of this serious episode of transportation of prisoners in sealed containers ; as a consequence of which hundreds , some claim thousands , lost their lives due to suffocation and the firing of rifle shots to create holes for ventilation when the prisoners were inside the containers ; the incident needs further investigation and inquiry by obtaining direct evidence of survivors .
E . Conditions at Sheberghan Prison
The Physicians for Human Rights have given a report on the unsatisfactory conditions in Sheberghan prison , the risk of gastrointestinal illness , respiratory diseases caused by overcrowding , scanty clothing and lack of protection against cold weather , the inadequate diet , lack of hygiene , and adequate medical supplies .
However there are contradictions in the prosecution case as to who was in control of prison conditions and prisoners at Sheberghan prison .
In the Indictment presented to the Tribunal , at part III , War Crimes Against Prisoners of War , paragraph 4 , the prosecution has stated that
" 3000 prisoners thus transported as above described were held in the Sheberghan camp where soldiers of the Northern Alliance were keeping guard …. this particular prison is known for its poor conditions … the walls are weather beaten … inmates were virtually unattended … Northern alliance was primarily in charge of keeping the prison under control … however as CIA personnel interrogated prisoners here and made arrangements for sending them to Kandahar airport and then to Guantanamo Bay ; US forces were practically the major administrator of the prison … Bush was in a position to make the prison guards aware of appropriate procedure …. "
This evidence is not conclusive to hold the Defendant guilty of conditions in the prison and of treatment of Prisoners in this prison ; the evidence indicates that the prison was earlier in a state of neglect and as per the prosecution case , the Northern alliance controlled this prison and the prison guards ; whereas the CIA interrogated prisoners and made arrangements for transporting them .
Further and precise particulars and investigation will be required of the nature of involvement of US troops at the Sheberghan prison to attribute criminality to the Defendant in respect of this prison .
F . Killing of uncoscious and seriously wounded prisoners at Dashte-e - Leili
At Dasht - e - Leili , seriously injured and unconscious 500 - 600 Taliban prisoners and foreign fighters were killed by shooting , their hands were bound ; the evidence in Prosecution document Ex–1 not been contradicted ; it is established that there were 30 to 40 US soldiers present who observed the shooting and execution of these prisoners ; this evidence conclusively proves that the Defendant as Commander - in - Chief of US forces , was guilty for the execution of prisoners of war at Dashte - e - Leili who had surrendered and were seriously injured and that US soldier were present when the shooting took place ; against all rules and norms of warfare of the Geneva Convention ( III ) of 1949 and the Additional Protocol I of 1977
16 . Crimes Against Humanity
Afghanistan , known to the International Community , had been subjected to a brutal civil war for more than two decades ; . From 1979 the Afghan people had constantly buried their dead ; famine conditions prevailed from 1999 ; as a consequence hundreds of thousands were dying and turning into refugees , searching for food , in and around three International frontiers .
It was a defenseless country , when the Defendant ordered the military attack and merciless carpet bombing ; despite warnings by UN and other humanitarian agencies that the effect of war on the Afghan people would be catastrophic .
US - UK Coalition forces recklessly fired thousands of bombs and missiles including radioactive DU weapons against a country which was not the enemy .
Customary International Law over centuries reflected in the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 , the Hague Convention of 1899 , Hague Convention of 1907 , the Geneva Convention IV of 1949 and the Additional protocol 1 of 1977 ; on the laws of warfare have enjoined that civilian populations are to be protected in times of War ;
The common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions provides that persons taking no part in the hostilities , including those who have laid down their arms , the sick and wounded …." shall in all circumstances be treated humanely , without adverse distinction .
Violence to the life and person of the above categories is prohibited .
Weapons deployed against military targets and combatants should not therefore be of indiscriminate effect as to affect civilians and those who have laid down their arms "
Article 48 of Protocol I of 1977 , Additional to the Geneva Conventions promulgates the basic rule of customary International Law applicable to all States whether signatories or not to the Additional Protocol 1 ; as these customary laws of warfare have been in existence for over a century and a half and reflect the provisions of multilateral treaties already in existence and reads as follows :
" In order to ensure respect for and protection of civilian population and civilian objects , the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objects and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objects "
The Defendant , the President of the United States of America , who has made impassioned pleas for bringing " democracy " and " freedom " to Afghanistan , Iraq to several other States ; concepts which presuppose deep concern for the human condition , failed to observe the basic rule of warfare and committed crimes against humanity .
According to UNCHR report , people escaping the bombings were not in a position to carry personal belongings or food and were rendered completely destitute .
The foreign ministry spokesmen of Pakistan stated that " Pakistan was not in a position to deal with mass flows of Afghan refugees into Pakistan .
" Consequently thousands were turned away from the Pakistan border .
Despite 10 million land mines being buried into Afghan soil , people were fleeing in different directions displaced from their hearth and home , by aerial bombings , unaware that even the ground was unsafe .
The UNCHR estimated that after 7th October 2001 air strikes , the number of new refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan alone " exceeded one million " not including those who fled towards Iran and north of Afghanistan .
On October 10 , 2001 , Abdul Rasheed , the representative and Deputy Manager , of the Social and Economic Department , of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , discussing the situation in Afghanistan warned that -" several million people are facing starvation and the food situation is very serious " , inviting world attention to the fact , that the World Food Program and FAO had predicted a shortage of one million ton of food in Afghanistan due to severe drought for several years ; he added that the situation " would be worse " because of the air strikes .
On 1st November 2001 , UN Special Envoy Brahimi warned that stored food with the onset of cold weather would only last four months for 400,000 people ; there were another 900,000 facing the food crisis .
On November 20 ,2001 the local representative of UNICEF pointed out , that there were 2 million people weakened from hunger in and around Mazare -e - Sharif and without food aid while warehouses storing grains were being bombed across Afghanistan .
As the bombings continued , people died from the bombs , from hunger , cold and malnutrition apart from lethal radioactive DU weapons contaminating the environment through , air , water , and food with radioactive particles .
The organization of ‘ Doctors without Borders ’ reported in February 2002 , that one out of six children suffered severe malnutrition which would result in death without treatment .
The death rate of children , as reported by Doctors without Borders went up to 3.2 , as against the earlier 1.4 .
The International Committee of the Red Cross reported children being sold for food .
Even refugee camps were not spared the bombings .
The deliberately fostered divide by more than one Intelligence Agency to divide the people , resulted in different ethnic groups fleeing areas , worried about reprisals from rival forces ; all of whom whether Northern Warlords or the Taliban had been assisted at one time or another by the United States ; ethnic strife was a policy to control the people of Afghanistan and ensure continuance of the civil war to effect regime change ; devastating peoples lives as armed bands roamed the countryside .
The " extermination " of people by creating catastrophic humanitarian conditions arising out of acts of aggression ; subjecting people to displacement from their hearth and homes by bombings resulted in more than a million refugees crowding into camps ; subjecting people to death from starvation , disease , cold and exposure ; polluting water sources ; destroying homes and infrastructure all " Crimes Against Humanity " ; hundreds of thousands died from the catastrophe of war , without health care with hospitals , schools , hydroelectric and irrigation dams a
Moving homes in New Orleans to higher ground within the city limits could lessen the impact of any future floods without inhabitants having to abandon their beloved city altogether .
Without moves to combat the rise in sea level due to climate change , the capacity of hurricanes to flood coastal cities like New Orleans will only grow , say Torbjörn Törnqvist and Douglas Meffert of Tulane University in New Orleans ( Nature Geoscience , DOI : 10.1038/ngeo365 ) .
The risk of flood damage to homes could be reduced by shifting the population to higher - lying areas of the city that are currently undeveloped , say …
Had a friend shoot blank 12 gauge rounds out of his shotgun , then he loaded a live round ( not knowing the wads from the blanks never left the barrel ) .
The barreled pealed back far enough to catch his hand , shattering several bones .
He was young and dumb but lucky in that he made a full recovery .
Looks like this rifle guy also got lucky .

When people get in trouble , they often turn to faith .
These days , faith - based organizations can provide more than just spiritual guidance ; they may help solve money problems , too .
Faith - based debt counseling combines practical financial guidance with a specific religious foundation .
In the United States , the three largest faiths — Christian , Muslim and Jewish — share some commonalities in their approaches to money : the importance of making responsible financial decisions , making full repayment of all debts and charitable giving .
Christian debt counselors , the most common type of faith - based debt counselors , advise clients according to principles found in the Bible , while Jewish principles are based on the Torah , and Muslim principles on the Quran .
According to numerous Jewish and Muslim experts , no specific faith - based debt counseling organizations exist within either faith .
The lack of debt counselors within these religions , particularly among practicing Muslims and Orthodox Jews , can be attributed to the strict financial principles that govern their everyday lives , especially those concerning interest payments and debt repayment .
Because practicing Muslims are forbidden from paying interest on money borrowed , they can only use noninterest - bearing ( also referred to as “ Shariah - compliant ” ) financial products , says Abdi Shayesteh , a senior associate with King & Spalding law offices in New York City and a member of the Middle East and Islamic Finance Practice Group .
“ This is perhaps why you do n’t see Muslim debt counselors — there is no need for a debt - counseling service company , because a practicing Muslim does n’t subscribe to debt service products , such as credit cards . ”
Shayesteh is referring to ordinary credit cards , which charge interest on balances .
Shariah - compliant credit cards have been introduced in recent years , which do not charge interest .
The Jewish Orthodox community similarly prohibits the payment of interest , according to Dena Shapiro Frenkel , an Ameriprise financial adviser and host of the Cents - able Finance radio show , which is broadcast out of Loyola College in Baltimore .
Both Jewish and Islamic laws require that the faithful not incur debt they cannot reasonably repay .
Islam teaches that Muslims may only have a maximum of 30 percent debt - to - equity , or leverage , while Orthodox Jews are forbidden from borrowing money without a specific plan to repay that debt .
“ Debt is supposed to be something you can manage , ” says Frenkel .
“ You ’re not allowed to go into debt if there ’s no way for you to get out of debt , so you have to have some sense of responsibility and accountability . ”
Demand grows for Christian debt counseling services
For devout Christians in search of debt counseling , faith - based organizations can offer more than just number - crunching dollars - and - cents advice .
They can offer financial counsel that can help debtors chart a course to financial freedom that stays true to biblical teachings .
“ We teach what the Bible says , that we ’re not owners , and that we are only stewards ; we ’re trustees of our possessions , and that God is the owner of all things , ” says Chuck Bentley , CEO and president of Crown Financial Ministries , a Christian - based financial and debt counseling organization headquartered in Gainesville , Ga .
“ That ’s a major , major difference between biblical advice and nonbiblical advice , ” says Bentley .
The arrival of Christmas credit card bills , combined with finance - focused New Year ’s resolutions , makes January the peak season for Christian debt counselors , say experts .
“ This January is shaping up as an unprecedented month of demand for help from consumers nationwide , ” says David Jones , president of the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies .

Not all faith - based debt counseling are the same .
Disparities can exist even between Christian debt counseling organizations .
“ Everyone has a different world - view per se , and what I call Christian might be different from what they call Christian .
I try to go by the Bible that says a Christian is a Christ follower , ” says credit counselor Jeffrey Telling .

Seek out their affiliations .
Check out a potential debt counselor ’s website to learn about its professional affiliations , such as membership with the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies ( AICCCA ) or National Foundation for Credit Counseling ( NFCC ) .
The demand for Christian debt counseling services continues to mount .
Family Credit Management , which works with tens of thousands of families each year , estimates a 25 percent year - over - year increase in first - time consumer contacts since 2007 , says Family Credit president Michael McAuliffe .
AICCCA ’s member counseling agencies , which serve approximately 2 million consumers annually , have seen an approximate 20 percent increase over the past year , says Jones .
“ Add to that the demand for bankruptcy counseling and housing counseling and you have a major increase in consumer demand .
Christian credit counseling demand has followed suit .
We do not expect to see this trend reverse anytime soon .
As the financial crisis worsens , more people need help .
However , we are now beginning to see more and more consumers that are beyond help and we expect to see a dramatic rise in personal bankruptcy filings . ”
Few have escaped some level of financial woes .
“ Today , even churches themselves are struggling with debt and mortgages , with many churches themselves facing foreclosure , ” says McAuliffe .
To date , Crown has served more than 50 million people worldwide , with a stunning 140 percent increase in Web and e-mail traffic between September and December 2008 alone .
Bentley attributes these burgeoning numbers , in large part , to broad - scale lifestyle changes , especially in the United States .
“ I think you ’ve seen culture rapidly change effectively over the past 50 years in the things that we value and the financial habits that were formerly really just a part of our core values have changed , and so we ’ve seen a much greater need to keep up with the times and help people , ” says Bentley .
Secular versus faith - based debt counseling
Faith - based and secular debt counseling organizations differ ; each should be considered on its own merits .
In her quest to seek help to manage mounting debt , 38 - year - old Chicago retail investment sales assistant Kay J. interviewed one secular for - profit organization that turned her off immediately .
The company offered her one way to pay off her debts — through a debt settlement plan , in which she would pay approximately 70 percent of her debts , plus significant fees to the debt counseling company .
Such a plan meant Kay ( who asked that her last name not be used for privacy reasons ) would have a credit report showing “ debt settlements ” long after she ’d made her final payment , which would negatively impact her creditworthiness until each item dropped off her report years later .
The bottom line for Kay , though , was that a debt settlement would have dishonored her Christian beliefs and gone against the teachings of the Bible , which dictates that borrowers pay all debts in full .
Though finding a debt - counseling agency with similar spiritual beliefs is important , experts remind consumers that not all so - called faith - based organizations have the consumers ’ best interests at heart ; nor are all secular debt - counseling services for - profit .
In fact , experts encourage consumers to use nonprofit credit counselors , accredited by through Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies ( AICCCA ) or the National Foundation for Credit Counseling ( NFCC ) .
Kay eventually turned to Family Credit Management Services .
“ I liked the fact that their website had them listed with different bureaus and showed their credentials , that they were not - for - profit , and that they offered debt elimination , ” says Kay .
This is paramount when dealing with debt counselors , since scam artists abound in the industry , says Jones .
” I believe many people , especially people of faith , are buffaloed sometimes by going to organizations that claim to be as faithful as they are , but in some cases , may not be , ” he says .
Even if the Christian organization — say , your church — is on the up - and - up , smart consumers must assess the debt counselor ’s level of professionalism .
“ It is legal in many states for a church to provide counseling .
They do n’t have to be registered or licensed if they are a nonprofit church , and so it is entirely possible that well - meaning Christian organizations could have credit counselors in place who are not educated to provide the right kind of counseling and help to people , ” says AICCA ’s Jones .
What the Bible says
about debt and finances Debt : “ The rich ruleth over the poor ; And the borrower is servant to the lender . ”
Proverbs 22.7 Translation : “ Borrowing leads to slavery .
The Bible does n’t condemn borrowing ; it does n’t call it a sin , but it does warn against being imprudent with debt , ” says Crown Financial Ministries ’ Bentley .
Love of money : “ For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil .
Some people , eager for money , have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs . ”
1 Timothy 6:10 Translation :
That ’s right — it ’s the love of money — not money itself — that is evil , according to the Bible .
How faith - based debt counseling works
Family Credit Management ’s counselors approach each client ’s situation individually .
“ The first thing we ’re going to do is listen to the client and ask , ‘ What is your objective here ?
What are your goals ?
Obviously you probably want to get out of debt ; you would like it to go away , but we need to examine where you stand . ’
We ca n’t put a plan together until we know where to begin , ” says Family Credit ’s Central Illinois regional manager Jeffrey Telling .
Developing a spending plan means determining income and “ outgo ” in detail , on paper , so clients can chart their finances .
Success comes in many forms , says Telling .
“ We have to define success .
If I help someone learn to budget , and they go do it on their own without entering my debt management program , where they pay us and we pay the creditors , is that a success ?
Absolutely .
It ’s like if you feed a man a fish , and he ’ll eat today , but teach a man to fish , and he ’ll eat forever .
We prefer to show them how to do it .
There ’s the greatest reward in that , and they will be what we would call recovered from the situation that got them where they are . ”
After assessing Kay ’s situation , her counselor created a budget by dividing Kay ’s total debt into a 36 - month monthly repayment schedule .
Until Kay ’s debts are paid in full , her credit report shows that she is in a debt elimination program .
However , she says , “ As soon as everything is paid off , then that is removed from my credit report and it ’ll just show that my debts have been paid . ”
Taking responsibility : A Christian principle
The first step for those who turn to Christian debt - counseling organizations is to learn what the Bible says about debt .
“ God does n’t want you to be in that bondage , and he has specific rules and instruction and principles to follow to help you get out of it .
One of these principles is to take responsibility for the problem , and do not run from it ; to be straightforward and honest and humble , and to do what you need to do to honor the obligation that you have .
The scripture teaches that it ’s the borrower ’s responsibility to repay , ” says Crown ’s Bentley .
In some cases , bankruptcy may seem the only choice , but “ we believe that it ’s not the best solution , ” says Bentley .
“ The best solution is to make the hard decisions necessary to repay what you borrowed and to walk through that with integrity and character and to make every possible effort to avoid it . ”
Tithing , a practice in which a Christian gives a set amount , usually 10 percent , of his gross income to his church , is strongly encouraged in Christian - based debt counseling , though neither Crown nor Family Credit make tithing mandatory .
“ God would rather have us be a cheerful giver , as opposed to someone who has blind faith and just completely says , ‘ I ’m going to tithe if it kills me . ’
That does n’t make sense .
He ’s the God of mercy , not law , so we make it as a personal , individual decision , ” says Telling .
A long - term lesson
For most faith - based counselors — and their clients — the most advantageous bottom line comes in the form of teaching people to be content and wise with what they have .
Often , this means dispelling money myths , such as the popular belief that more money equals greater joy — what Bentley refers to as “ the real stumbling block for many people . ”
“ In the Bible , ” says Bentley , “ success is defined by our faithfulness with what we have , and success can be achieved whether you have much or little .
We do not teach the prosperity gospel , nor do we teach the poverty gospel .
Righteousness is not obtained through poverty , and it ’s not obtained through prosperity ; it ’s obtained through being faithful to Christ , who gave some people much and some people not so much . ”
“ A biblical message is universally true , and the Bible ’s concern is n’t what you have ; it ’s really what you do with what you have — and it ’s how well we have used it for God ’s purposes for our lives . ”

( CNN ) --
The check is n't in the mail , and it's not going to be for at least 30 days , California will start telling some of its creditors in February .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a point on the state budget in November .
The state , facing a $ 42 billion deficit , will delay some crucial payments to stay liquid , state Controller John Chiang announced Friday .
Among those who will be left waiting for checks are thousands of businesses that provide services and products to the state ; more than 1 million aged and disabled Californians who need to pay for rent , utilities or food ; and individuals and businesses awaiting tax refunds to the tune of $ 1.91 billion .
That includes taxpayers such as Mildred Copeland , 84 , of Toluca Lake , who lives on a fixed income .
She raises a teenage grandson on her Social Security checks and a part - time job waiting tables .
Making her bills is always a stretch , so she counts on her tax refund every year .
" When they need it , they get it , right ? "
Copeland said of paying her taxes on time .
" So why should n't we ? "
Suspending such payments is meant to preserve cash for education , debt service and other payments that are deemed by the state Constitution , federal law or court rulings as having first claim .
But those in education are feeling plenty of pain as well .
That includes students such as Amber Ramirez , who is a freshman at Los Angeles Valley College .
She just learned that her school is cutting 130 classes .
At this rate , " it 's going to take me 15 years to finish my Ph.D. instead of what I had planned , " said Ramirez , who is studying psychology .
Because classes are scarcer , she 's forced to take one class at 8 a.m. and another at 5 p.m .
That kind of schedule makes it hard for her to work even part - time .
Meanwhile , Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to balance the budget .
" For months , I have warned state leaders that our cash flow will be in serious danger this spring , " Chiang said .
" Without corrective action from the governor and legislature , there is no way to make it through February unscathed . "
The state has blown through its cash reserves as it has spent more than it has taken in .
There 's been no money in the state 's general fund for the past 17 months , so California has been borrowing internally from special funds and from Wall Street .
The controller estimates that money will soon be exhausted and that the state will be at least $ 346 million short in February .
" I take this action with great reluctance , " Chiang said in a news release .
" I know it will put many California families who rightfully expect their state tax refunds in a desperate position .
Individuals who already are vulnerable will be hit hard .
Small businesses that do n't get paid may have to lay off more workers .
Rather than helping stimulate the economy , withholding money from Californians will prolong our pain and delay our economic recovery .
" Delaying these payments will get us through the next few months , but it will not solve the problem .
Only the governor and the legislature have the power to avoid this drastic and painful path . "
If Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the legislature do n't come up with a solution , the controller might have to extend delays in payments or issue IOUs .
On January 6 , the governor vetoed an $ 18 billion package proposed by Democrats who pitched it as " a major down payment " toward addressing the state 's budget deficit .
The proposal did n't meet Schwarzenegger 's demands set out in a special session , which limited the General Assembly to working on economic measures before acting on other bills .
" Unfortunately , this package is deeply flawed , and , as promised , I vetoed it the moment it landed on my desk , " Schwarzenegger said in a letter Tuesday to senior lawmakers .
" The measures you sent me punish people with increased taxes but do not make the serious cuts in spending necessary to balance our budget , do nothing to help keep California families working during this recession and do nothing to help Californians facing foreclosure in this mortgage crisis . "
The Republican governor , who declared a fiscal emergency in December , has butted heads for months with the Democratic majority over alleviating the state 's $ 11.2 billion revenue shortfall .
The Legislative Analyst's Office shows the deficit reaching a staggering $ 28 billion by mid-2010 .
" This is the only package that has the votes in the legislature , " state Assembly Speaker Karen Bass said in a written statement .
" I urge the governor to sign the package to solve the cash crisis and settle the other issues as we go . "
Schwarzenegger was swept into office in 2003 as then - Gov. Gray Davis was recalled by the voters , largely because of a $ 23.6 billion budget deficit that he projected would grow to more than $ 34 billion the following year .
CNN 's Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report .

The UK's intellectual property minister has angered the recording industry association by making an analogy between music and complimentary soap
The UK's intellectual property minister and its major recording industry association are embroiled in a heated argument .
The question , it seems , is whether or not British music is a bar of soap .
The furore stems from comments made by Tottenham Labour MP David Lammy , speaking about legislation that would force ISPs to police and punish filesharing .
" We can't have a system where we 're talking about arresting teenagers in their bedrooms , " Lammy told the Times .
" People can rent a room in a hotel and leave with a bar of soap – there 's a big difference between leaving with a bar of soap and leaving with the television . "
Britain 's biggest label association , the BPI , is n't having any of it .
Music creators are " sure to be insulted at the analogy between British music and complimentary soap from hotels , " sniffed Richard Mollet , BPI director of public affairs , in a Billboard interview .
The BPI is currently lobbying the government for stricter anti-piracy legislation .
" We are appalled to see him falsely raising the prospect of arresting people in their bedrooms and fail to see what place this has in the discussion , " Mollet said .
The industry awaits the government 's Digital Britain report , due 29 January , which will make recommendations for dealing with copyright claims , internet providers and the public .
According to early reports – which were er , leaked and shared among industry reps – Digital Britain may recommend the creation of a new body to mediate between rights - holders and ISPs .
They may also suggest that people leave the bloody soap where they found it .
Masked men wielding clubs guard the entrance to the Athens Polytechnic University , keeping watch over the graffiti - covered walls on campus .
Nearby streets are barricaded with the carcasses of burnt cars , and a huge black banner proclaims " MURDERERS " – the rallying cry that has brought Greece 's youths to the streets .
Inside , piles of empty gas canisters testify to the scores of Molotov cocktails assembled there recently For more than a week , Athenian streets have been a battleground between police and protesters , whose anger was sparked by the fatal shooting of a 15 - year - old boy by a policeman .
Protected by Greece 's Constitution from police interference , the Polytechnic has become the headquarters of the protest movement – and a haven for those wreaking havoc on the city 's streets .
As Greeks try to make sense of the chaos – and prepare for another week of protests , ranging from sit-ins to nationwide roadblocks – many here are beginning to ask whether the asylum law is protecting free speech or simply harboring criminals .
" The university asylum is for the freedom of movement of ideas , but not of commitment of criminal actions , " says George Bergeles , a professor at the Polytechnic who is sympathetic to the students ' complaints , but not their harsh tactics .
" The law about university asylum I believe is a fantastic achievement of the university movement , but we should protect it by not allowing criminal offenses to happen inside . "
The Polytechnic holds historic importance for Greeks .
In November 1973 , students barricaded themselves inside in rebellion against the country 's military junta , which had been in power since 1967 .
Fearful that the revolt would spread , on Nov. 17 the national police moved in with tanks , killing a still - disputed number of protesters .
The junta fell less than a year later .
Greece 's new Constitution gave special status to universities and other schools , forever barring the police from entering their grounds .
Today , the Poly - technic and other institutions of learning are once again brimming with revolutionary zeal .
Across Athens , high schools and universities are under occupation by students and other youth angry at the Dec. 6 killing of Alexandros Grigoropoulos and also at a political system they see as corrupt and incompetent .
So far , Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has rejected calls by opposition leaders to hold early elections , but his center - right party holds only a one - seat majority in parliament , and public support for his government was weak even before the riots .
The latest poll numbers show a 20 percent approval rating .
The Polytechnic , which lies on the border of the edgy neighborhood of Exarchia , where the 15 - year - old was killed , is serving as the heart and brain center of the revolt .
There , anarchists – many of whom call Exarchia their home – are helping to organize students and other young people .
The area just outside its gates has been the site of some of the most intense clashes with police .
Inside , protesters regroup and rearm around bonfires that burn through the night .
There 's an air of menace outside the Polytechnic .
But Stergia Sarantopoulou , an architecture student there who has been participating in protests , says the mood is angry but collegial .
Like many students , she passionately defends the asylum law .
" There are historical , political , ideological reasons for the immunity to exist , " she says .
" Universities are our home .
It 's the students home ; it 's the teachers home . "
The university safe - haven policy might at times be abused , Ms. Sarantopoulou says , but in the long run society is better off by having a law that forever ensures a safe place for free speech .
" It 's much more harmful for the state to control [ universities , ] " she says .
The explosion of rioting and looting that took place in the aftermath of Alexandros 's death has faded in recent days , but there are still daily protests , many of which end in hails of rocks and flaming Molotov cocktails .
On Saturday , the one - week anniversary of the shooting , the protests were largely peaceful , though still angry .
In daylight , a fragile normality began to return to the city center , with shops again opening and people returning to work .
But at night , uncertain Athenians stayed away from the normally bustling city center , which was ghostly quiet .
Groups of young people roamed the streets across central Athens , shouting : " This night is for Alexi ! "
A heavy cloud of tear gas and smoke hung over Exarchia , which felt like a rebel - held enclave in a city at war .
Police lingered warily on its edges as young people set up burning barricades and attacked government buildings and banks .
And clashes erupted once again outside the Polytechnic .
Few here think the unrest will end anytime soon , and the rage of Greece 's youth continues to smolder .
The death of Alexandros 's has tapped into anger about a range of broader complaints – about corruption , nepotism , a failing education system , and the poor economic prospects of young people , including unemployment rates in the 25 percent range .
Protests are expected to continue throughout the week , with activists calling for roads to be blocked nationwide on Tuesday .
They say they want to bring down Greece 's whole political system – it's not just the current government that is seen as tainted , most believe the main opposition is little better .
The protesters , however , struggle to articulate exactly what they want in its place .
" Do n't bend your head down , " they chanted as they confronted police recently in front of parliament .
" The only way is resistance . "

Sometimes it is not a case of Bridezilla , it 's her mother or ( in this case ) her father and husband - to - be .
Makes you wonder why she 's getting married .
It was last January -- prime wedding - booking - season since many brides get engaged over the holidays .
The bride and her mother came in first .
Wanted to order a wedding cake for the summer .
Her colors were espresso and cream , and she did not want flowers on her cake .
So I suggested chocolate decorations ( besides curly willow there were not many other brown accents I could think of ) .
We went through photos of cakes -- some we had done , some from books , some from magazines -- discussing the options .
Then her father and husband - to - be came in .
The father planted himself with a book , announcing he was only here to sign the check .
No problems , I had heard that before .
The bride and her mom started showing the fiance photos of cakes and decorations they had in mind .
I have to say that USUALLY , the bride and her mom make most of the decisions about the wedding cake .
Most men are not that involved , but that is not always the case .
In this cake , HE had a ( very strong ) opinion about every idea they suggested .
NO , ABSOLUTELY NOT .
I HATE THAT ONE .
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING .
Made me wonder how much wedded bliss this bride was expecting after the wedding .
I figured they needed some family time and disappeared behind the counter for a while .
Until HE said " what do you think ? " in my direction .
Reasonably fresh out of culinary school , I knew ( and used ) the proper names for many types of chocolate decorations .
Curls and mini curls
Mikados , sticks , cigars and cigarettes ( longer , thinner and fatter curls )
Shavings ( a sheet of chocolate broken into an assortment of sizes )
Shapes and cutouts ( sails , waves , cresting waves , surfing waves , tiles , rounds , stars , hearts , petals , triangles , etc . )
Plaquettes
Tree bark
Vermicelli ( mini sprinkles )
Ruffles
Croquants ( puffed rice enrobed in chocolate )
Cups and bowls
Clay
So I said " Well , chocolate curls or chocolate cigars would be one option . "
Now we hear from the bride 's father : " Absolutely no chocolate cigars , we do n't want people to think we smoke . "
In my last post I discussed cache pressure and how important the cache is for performance .
Out of mild curiosity and a bit of boredom , I decided to see how the same code ( or near enough ) performed in C# .
Why C# ?
A lot of tools are written in C# now , mostly because it ’s a nice language with fantastic library support and solid GUI integration .
It ’s a more productive environment for all those programs that do n’t have to run at 60 fps .
Now given how straightforward the test is – sorting an array – I ’d expected performance to not differ by much compared to the C++ version .
Before I ran this code I was guessing that C# would be maybe 50 % slower and at most half the speed than the C++ version .
Especially since the sorting should be mostly algorithmically and memory bandwidth bound .
You can get both versions of the code here : C++ , C# to test for yourself .
[ EDIT : fixed link to C# code ]
Now for the results .
[ EDIT : a number of issues were raised about this test in the comments and elsewhere – here ’s my response ]
The first issue was to figure out how to actually sort my array in C# – there are a variety of ways to store and sort objects in C # so I first tried the various combinations of Sort & ICompare , Sort < T > & ICompare < T > , using a Comparison function pointer and even C# ’s built - in indirect sort Sort ( Keys , Items ) .
Let ’s set the raw results :
There ’s nothing too surprising really – the generic version of Sort < T > is faster than the non-generic one , probably because the CLR can remove dynamic casts or something .
Also no surprise that the indirect Sort < Key , Items > version is much , much faster than all the other version – this is what we looked into in my original Cache Pressure post .
The only surprise to me is that the IComparer version of the sort is faster than the Comparison function pointer version – I have no idea why , I ’d expect both to be nearly identical .
Anyways , we ’re here to compare C++ to C# , so lets put the results from our Cache Pressure test side by side with these C# tests :
So here ’s the graph of the C++ direct sort vs the generic Sort < T > , IComparer < T> version .
In case you ca n’t read that properly , the C++ version is 10 times faster than the C# version .
You can also see that the lines are nice and parallel , so that ’s no algorithmic difference in sorting routines , both implementations have the same runtime complexity .
We ’re seeing 10 times overhead in execution .
Damn !
That ’s pretty pathetic C# !
And you know what ’s even sadder ?
Here ’s a chart of the slow direct C++ sort versus the fastest indirect C# sort :
So C++ still comes out a head , over twice as fast in fact .
Considering this is the “ fast ” C# implementation and the “ slow ” C++ implementation beats is hands down , you ca n’t help but be disappointed by C# here .
I wo n’t even bother comparing C# ’s sort to C++’s faster indirect sort , we already know the outcome .
Conclusion
So mostly I ’ll let the number speak for themselves , the programs I ran are freely available for you to confirm for yourself .
I do n’t pretend to be any type of C# expert , but my code is pretty much a textbook ( or MSDN example ) implementation .
I even use the exact timing method as the C++ version .
I was very surprised by how much faster C++ ran .
I never expected a 10 times difference in performance .
This does n’t mean I ’ll stop using C# – it ’s still a very productive development environment , especially for GUI tools , which is still often a more important factor than exectuion time .
It does mean that I ’ll probably think twice about implementing high - performance code in C# .
Not just for kids

Walsh sets her story in 17th century Eyam , England , recounting the turmoil and devastation brought with Bubonic plague from the point of view of a fictional 16 year old shepherdess .
In 1665 , the town ’s new and outgoing ministers quarantined the village , preventing anyone from entering or leaving while the disease ran its course .
Recalling what I liked and did n’t like to read as a teenager , I am not surprised at the less - than - glowing reviews some kids have given A Parcel of Patterns on various book sites .
The old English speech patterns , though effective , do slow down comprehension of the plot , which centers upon 2 romances blossoming amongst a plague epidemic in 17th century England .
As an avid but adult reader of medieval / Renaissance history , I can say that this book is a wonderful presentation of the experience of surviving amongst the hardships of everyday life , the Protestant religious conflicts , and the horrors of the plague and other catastrophic illnesses that no one could understand or effectively treat .
I ’d recommend this title to adults more than to teenagers , except to teens with a special interest in medieval history .
CCP , aside from continuing its popular EVE Online and developing a new MMO based on the World of Darkness RPGs , has hinted at a new project that is a radical departure from its other projects : a first - person shooter for consoles .
According to Eurogamer , CCP unveiled some new game footage at its annual fanfest in Iceland this past weekend which showed " a Halo - like shooter on a daylit , Earth - like planet surface .
The architecture and gun designs were clearly redolent of the space MMO 's art style . "
Earlier in the same presentation , CCP execs Hilmar Petursson and Nathan Richardsson mentioned the developer has a " game console strategy " in the works and is apparently working on projects for the 360 and the PS3 .
However , fans wo n't be seeing the shooter anytime soon , as Petursson made a point of mentioning that his studio was focusing most of its resources on the next expansion for EVE Online .
The expansion is due out next March and will feature a massive graphics update on top of a slew of new content , so it seems safe to assume that little news about this FPS will be forthcoming in the near future .
How much tear gas can a nation take ?
How many stones can it collect ?
To ask such questions of an EU member state that is supposed to be as sophisticated as it is modern might seem far - fetched , even silly .
To ask them four years after that country basked in the glory of staging one of the most successful Olympic Games might be considered absurd .
But yesterday , as Greece entered a second week of pitched battles between rock - throwing protesters and riot police - with security forces turning to Israel and Germany to replenish depleted reserves of toxic gases to contain the angry crowds - such questions did not seem foolish .
Or , I 'm sad to say , remotely absurd .
Athens is in a mess and it's not just the rubble or burned - out buildings or charred cars and firebombed rubbish bins and smashed pavements that now stand as testimony to unrest not seen since the collapse of military rule in 1974 .
Twenty - two years after I moved to Greece I have looked into eyes full of anger and despair .
At night , as marauding mobs of Molotov - cocktail wielding youths have run through the city 's ancient streets , I have closed the shutters of the windows to my home .
My friends have done the same .
Those of us who live here - who have seen how frayed the fabric of public order can become - now know , in no uncertain terms , that the orgy of violence that has gripped this beautiful land masks a deeper malaise .
It is a sickness that starts not so much at the top but at the bottom of Greek society , in the ranks of its troubled youth .
For many these are a lost generation , raised in an education system that is undeniably shambolic and hit by whopping levels of unemployment ( 70 per cent among the 18 - 25s ) in a country where joblessness this month jumped to 7.4 per cent .
If they can find work remuneration rarely rises above € 700 ( this is , after all , the self - styled € 700 generation ) , never mind the number of qualifications it took to get the job .
Often polyglot PhD holders will be serving tourists at tables in resorts .
One in five Greeks lives beneath the poverty line .
Exposed to the ills of Greek society as never before , they have also become increasingly frustrated witnesses of allegations of corruption implicating senior conservative government officials and a series of scandals that have so far cost four ministers their jobs .
With these grievances in mind , young people ( who would not normally see themselves as revolutionaries and are a far - cry from the ' extremists '
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis says are behind the disturbances ) have begun stockpiling stones , rocks and crushed marble slabs from Salonika in the north to the resort islands of Corfu and Crete in the south .
They have also started selling them on - at three stones a euro - to other protesters whose parents may live in Hollywood - style opulence , or indeed on the breadline , but who are bonded by a common desire to hurl them at that hated symbol of authority : the police .
The ferocity of the riots has numbed Greeks .
Yet I write this knowing that the protests are not going to end soon .
Greece 's children have been startled by their own success - and by reports of copycat attacks across Europe - and almost unanimously they believe they are on a winner .
' It 's like a smouldering fire , ' says Yiannis Yiatrakis who preferred to leave his study of abstract mathematics to take to the streets of Athens last week .
' The flames may die down but the coals will simmer .
One little thing , and you 'll see it will ignite again .
Ours is a future without work , without hope .
Our grievances are so big , so many .
Only a very strong government can stop the rot . '
So how did it come to this ?
How did a country more usually associated with sun-kissed beaches and the good life erupt into a spasm of destruction that has shaken it to the core ?
How could an entire generation - most of whom were not even born when I arrived here - go unnoticed and yet nurture such burning rage ?
And who is to blame ?
Greek society , the state , or a political system running on empty that no longer inspires confidence or trust ?
Like so many , I was forced to ask all these questions last week as I walked through scarred streets that in more ways than one have become their battlefield .
My hope is that those in power , the crooked politicians , the corrupt judiciary , the scandal - ridden church , will ultimately tour the same routes .
It began with one death , one bullet , fired in anger by a hot - headed policemen in the heart of Athens ' edgy Exarchia district on last Saturday .
At the time most Greeks - including those who are compelled financially to live with their parents into their late thirties - were sitting in front of their TV sets or were out at their local tavernas .
No one thought they would wake up to a revolt in the streets .
But the death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos , a tousled - haired teenager from the rich northern suburbs was the match that lit the inferno .
If the killing had happened in any of the capital 's wealthy satellite suburbs , the reaction might well have been more subdued .
Exarchia , however , is Athens ' answer to Harlem ( without the racial component ) .
It is here that anarchists , artists , addicts , radical leftists , students and their teachers rub shoulders in streets crammed with bars and cafes that are covered with the graffiti of dissent .
It is Athens 's hub of political ferment ; a backdrop of tensions between anti-establishment groups and the police .
Within an hour of the boy 's death thousands of protesters had gathered in Exarchia 's lawless central square screaming , ' cops , pigs , murderers , ' and wanting revenge .
At first , it is true , the assortment of self - styled anarchists who have long colonised Exarchia piggy - backed on the tragedy , seeing it as the perfect opportunity to live out their nihilistic goals of wreaking havoc .
But then middle - class kids - children had got good degrees at universities in Britain but back in Greece were unable to find work in a system that thrives on graft , cronyism and nepotism - joined the protests and very quickly it became glaringly clear that this was their moment , too .
Theirs was a frustration not only born of pent - up anger but outrage at the way ministers in the scandal - tainted conservative government have also enriched themselves in their five short years in power .
Now the million - dollar question is whether protests that started so spontaneously can morph into a more organised movement of civil unrest .
What is certain is that Karamanlis 's handling of the disturbances will go down as a case study of what not to do in a crisis .
Seemingly disoriented and removed , the government 's popularity has dropped dramatically over the past week .
Even diehard conservatives have called me to say they 'll be jumping ship .
So far , Karamanlis has roundly rejected demands that he call early elections which means Greece will be saddled with a lame - duck government ( the New Democrats are anyway hampered by a razor - thin one - seat majority in the 300 - member parliament ) for several months yet .
With daily demonstrations planned in the weeks ahead Greek youth are not going to give in easily .
Far from calming spirits , the tear gas that has been used so liberally against them has only stoked their ire .
A fragile democracy
From the bitter civil war that raged between 1946 and 1949 to the 1967 - 74 military dictatorship , Greece 's postwar history has been more tumultuous than most .
The defeat of the communist EAM party with the help of British and US forces in 1949 led to decades of authoritarian right - wing rule .
Thousands of leftwingers were imprisoned or sent to labour camps .
The right - left divide was later reinforced on 21 April 1967 when in a coup a group of US - backed junior officers , known as the Colonels , seized power .
In a spontaneous uprising on 17 November 1973 , students at Athens Polytechnic rebelled against the regime , leading to the Colonels ' fall in July 1974 .
The restoration of democracy under the late Konstantinos Karamanlis laid the foundations for a reconciliation between left and right under Andreas Papandreou , who introduced socialist government to Greece in 1981 .

The Tanzanian MP recounts the appalling story in a tone of sadness and horror .
A woman named Salma had been told by her family to dress her baby entirely in black and to lay the little girl in a hut , alone .
' The mother did n't understand , but she obeyed the elders , ' said Al - Shaymaa Kwegyir .
' Some hours later , unknown men arrived and went straight to the hut .
They used a machete to cut off the child 's legs .
Then they slit her throat and poured the blood into a pot and drank it . '
Amid a spate of at least 29 murders of albinos in Tanzania , Kwegyir , herself an albino , has become one of the country 's most prominent political campaigners on the issue .
She cited evidence that killers acting for witch doctors are turning to cannibalism alongside their quest for lucrative body parts as magic charms .
Buyers from as far away as the Democratic Republic of Congo , Burundi , Kenya and Uganda believe the legs , genitals , eyes and hair of people with albinism can help them achieve instant wealth .
The youngest victim so far was seven months old .
Kwegyir , 48 , had met Salma in her village in the Mwanga district near Kilimanjaro .
' It is the first cannibalistic case , but in other respects it is a classic example .
Someone in the extended family who has links with a witch doctor will help set up the abduction or killing .
These murders are inspired by ignorance and greed .
An albino hand is selling for two million shillings ( £ 1,200 ) , ' she said .
Despite government moves to protect albinos - who have an inherited gene disorder which results in a lack of pigmentation and can produce near - blindness - the targeted murders , which were first reported a year ago , are continuing .
' Two weeks pass and we think it 's getting better , then another one happens , ' said Kwegyir , who was appointed to parliament in April by President Jakaya Kikwete in order to combat prejudice .
The murders are the result of seemingly conflicting beliefs spread by witch doctors , who are still consulted by many of Tanzania 's 40 million - strong population , that albinos are either cursed or have supernatural properties .
Some fishermen believe that , if they weave the red hair from an albino into their nets , fish will be attracted by the golden glimmer .
Miners for gold , rubies and tanzanite are reported to pay large sums for juju ( magic ) amulets , which they wear around their necks or strapped to their arms and which are made up with a potion mixed from albino body parts .
Others are said to bury the bones of albinos in the ground they are digging .
A relative haven of safety for Tanzania 's albinos is the small park outside the single - storey wards of Dar es Salaam 's Cancer Institute .
In alleys leading between the wards , albinos with bandages on their heads and feet , or slings on their arms , wait for check - ups .
They have russet - coloured hair and milky - white skin , but their facial features are African .
Many are covered in welts , scabs and burns .
Cancer is their greatest killer and , whereas albinos in developed countries can hope to live until normal old age , Africans who have the condition rarely survive beyond the age of 40 .
Zihada Msembo said her greatest enemy used to be the sun .
Now she walks in fear wherever she goes .
' In the streets you hear people plotting .
They say " look at the zeru [ ghost ] .
We can get him " .
We are terrified to go outside or to get into our beds at night . '
The hospital 's rundown gatehouse is the home of the Tanzanian Albino Society .
Its chairman , Ernest Kimaya , 42 , said the organisation ran on an annual government grant which he summarised as ' equal to a week 's tea budget at State House ' .
Albinos need skin creams , spectacles and large - print books , but they receive no funding for these .
Kimaya wears glasses but at his computer his nose is less than 10 cm from the screen .
He said Tanzanian albinos had always faced discrimination in schools or in the workplace .
' People believe a woman who has an albino child has been cursed and that the whole family will now suffer bad luck .
In olden days midwives killed the babies at birth but now that there are health centres , albino babies do survive . '
Kimaya 's society , probably Africa 's oldest albino association , set up in 1980 , feels powerless in the face of the attacks .
' The people who are killing us are witch doctors or agents for them .
What is happening is mad and horrible , ' Kimaya said .
Kimaya said the superstition of money - making had always existed but used to be confined to remote areas .
Tanzania 's recent minerals boom , which has attracted thousands of people to try their luck in small - scale mining , may have contributed to the spread of the belief .
Murders are now also reported in neighbouring countries and Kikwete has asked other heads of state in the Southern African Development Community to act to stamp out the killings .
Last week the Daily News reported the arrest of a 35 - year - old fisherman at Lake Tanganyika who had allegedly attempted to sell his 24 - year - old albino wife to two businessmen from the Democratic Republic of Congo for 3.6 m shillings ( about £ 2,000 ) .
Another report told of a man caught at the border carrying a bag containing a baby 's head .
He told police that a Tanzanian witch doctor had offered to pay him according to the weight of the head .
More than 170 people , most of them witch doctors , have been arrested in Tanzania this year ; 53 are in custody , but Kimaya wants firmer , swifter action .
' We need money to pay a lawyer .
The government has ordered the police to carry out a census of albinos , so that we know how many of us there are , ' he said .
' They have also been instructed to work with villagers to protect us and to escort albino children to school .
It is a big step forward , but we urgently need prosecutions to begin so that Tanzanians hear of this injustice , ' added Kimaya , who is one of three albino siblings out of seven children in his family .
He is married to a black woman and their four children are black .
Even though albinism exists in Europe and North America , where it affects one in 20,000 people , it is far more widespread in Africa .
One of the continent 's music stars , Salif Keita from Mali , is an albino .
One study has put the Tanzanian ratio at one in 4,000 people .
Kimaya believes there are 370,000 albinos in Tanzania .
Some researchers have suggested that the source of the albino gene can be traced to the east coast of Africa .
Despite government efforts and growing pressure from abroad , including a motion condemning the events in Tanzania in September in the European Parliament , the country 's albinos are still living in fear .
Kwegyir was an activist for the ruling party and an information officer at Dar es Salaam airport before becoming an MP .
She said there was an urgent need for the international community to support albinos :
' If we can have skin creams , books and spectacles , this will help us to lead more normal lives and to come out of the shadows and combat prejudice . '
For the moment the safety of albinos is her prime concern .
' On 19 October we staged a demonstration in Dar es Salaam to raise awareness of our situation .
Many people were brave and came out .
But that same evening one of the demonstrators was followed home , grabbed , and the assailants tried to hack off one of her arms .
This was left hanging and later had to be amputated .
The attackers cut off the other arm and ran away .
' Now she is living in constant terror because she wo n't be able to fight back if they come after her a second time . '
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street ’s losses may eventually total $ 60 billion to $ 70 billion , including the $ 47 billion that securities firms have lost in the last two years , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Friday .

As many as 46,000 financial workers may lose their jobs by the second quarter of 2010 , the mayor said at a news conference to unveil his new budget .
Bloomberg , the billionaire who made his first fortune on Wall Street , stressed the pain the industry is inflicting on the city .
As many as 300,000 people could lose their jobs as a result of the crisis , he said .
If the current 30 percent drop in the pension fund ’s assets continues , the city will have to contribute $ 11 billion more through fiscal 2016 .
The mayor , who must close a $ 4 billion budget gap in the current election year , predicted a lengthy economic recovery for both the city and nation .
“ It is n’t just ‘ Go fix the economy , I ’ll be back at lunchtime . ’
These things are going to take many years to fix . ”
Bloomberg said New Yorkers will have to cope with fewer services because 23,000 city workers will lose their jobs through layoffs or attrition starting July 1 under his new budget plan .
These include 1,000 police officers , 451 firefighters , and 14,000 teachers .
The mayor said he must wring more dollars out of the state and U.S. governments and persuade labor unions to accept a new 10 percent contribution for health care and lower pension benefits for new hires .
“ You can only get so much blood out of a stone .
After that , it ’s a headcount thing , ” Bloomberg said .
City agencies will cut another $ 1 billion off their budgets , he said .
FAREWELL TO SALES - TAX BREAKS
Homeowners will lose a $ 400 rebate , saving the city $ 256 million .
The city ’s 4 percent sales tax will rise a quarter of a percentage point , pushing the total city - state levy to 8.75 percent .
The hike , along with the cancellation of a tax exemption on clothing that costs less than $ 110 and two sales - tax holidays is expected to raise $ 950 million .
The mayor ’s remedies , many of which might be tough sales ahead of November ’s elections , ranged from a 25 - cent hike in fees for most parking spaces to 75 cents for half an hour to slowing construction spending on everything from schools to bridges , which means the city will sell 30 percent less debt over the next three years .
The Municipal Labor Committee , a union group , accused Bloomberg of shifting costs to workers , noting he has criticized New York state for the same strategy .
“ High quality service levels will not be maintained when there is an expectation of layoffs or diminished benefits , ” the union group said in a statement .
Bloomberg closed the multibillion - dollar deficit inherited from former Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with temporary sales and income taxes , and has said permanently raising income taxes would drive people out of the city .
But he said Paterson , who has resisted calls to boost income taxes for millionaires , may be forced to do so because of the magnitude of the state ’s budget deficit .
City Comptroller William Thompson , a Democratic mayoral contender , said that instead of raising sales taxes and hitting the poor , the city should instead temporarily hike income taxes for those who earn at least $ 500,000 a year .
We have a new president .
What ’s that going to mean for the solar industry ?
Time will tell , but all signs point to “ awesome . ”
For starters , the skids were greased before inauguration day .
The surprising extension of the Federal Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) for solar energy appended to the financial bailout bill was slated to disappear , but instead was extended eight years .
Moreover , the $ 2000 cap for residential solar installations was removed .
This is a long enough runway for national renewable energy companies to build infrastructure around .
However , in the short term there ’s not a lot of hunger for tax breaks .
Groups like votesolar.org are pushing to make the ITC refundable so more people can use it now .
Banks who provide tax equity solutions for big solar projects have turned the faucet off .
The Obama stimulus package earmarks $ 30B for upgrading grid infrastructure .
There are a lot of solar farm possibilities that do n’t currently make sense because our medieval grid ca n’t get that energy to where it needs to go .
Texas has taken the infrastructure lead , other states need to start planning for enhanced transmission lines .
Obama might also enact cap and trade legislation by the end of the year .
Solar would be a way for companies to avoid penalties , increasing their already compelling incentives to solar up their buildings .
Solar in California will likely grow because of California ’s AB32 ( which caps emissions from power stations , industry and oil refineries starting in 2012 ) and there is a good chance a cap - and - trade system under Obama could be modeled after AB32 .
New renewable portfolio standards ( RPS ) could also put a lot of pressure on states and municipalities to get their renewable programs in gear .
RPS require local energy providers to derive a certain amount of their energy from renewable sources .
States like Pennsylvania , California , Virgina , Colorado , and Oregon have very progressive standards .
Others may be required to jump on board under this administration .
Obama will create a tide that lifts all ships in renewable energy , but I will be interested to see the attention that distributed solar gets comparatively .
Ultimately though , he needs pressure from below to see to it that progressive legislation sees the desks of all legislators .
Not just liberal democrats who see few oil lobby dollars .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama announced New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as his pick for secretary of commerce on Wednesday , calling him a " leading economic diplomat for America . "
Barack Obama has picked Bill Richardson to be the secretary of commerce .
" I know that Bill will be an unyielding advocate for American business and American jobs , at home and around the world .
And I look forward to working with him in the years ahead , " Obama said at a news conference in Chicago , Illinois .
Richardson , one of the best - known Hispanics in the Democratic Party , served as the energy secretary in the Clinton administration as well as being the ambassador to the United Nations .
With the announcement , Richardson becomes the third former presidential rival to join Obama 's team .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden and Sen. Hillary Clinton , Obama 's pick for secretary of state , also competed for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Richardson on Wednesday called it a " great honor " to be chosen for the post .
" There are some who speak of a team of rivals , but I 've never seen it that way .
Past competitors ?
Yes .
But rivals implies something harder - edged and less forgiving .
And in the worlds of diplomacy and commerce , you open markets and minds not with rivalry , but instead with partnership and innovation and hard work , " Richardson said .
Watch Richardson describe how Commerce can push economic recovery »
There 's been speculation for weeks that Richardson would be tapped as the commerce secretary .
Obama spoke with Richardson about the position on November 14 , a senior Democratic source said .
The source said Richardson has always been on Obama 's list of possibilities for the key Cabinet position .
Richardson , 61 , also traveled to Chicago , Illinois , in November to meet with Obama , according to a source .
Richardson also a contender for the secretary of state post , but he lost that to Clinton .
Obama brushed off speculation that Richardson 's post is a consolation prize for Latinos and Hispanic politicians , when asked about recent articles that have made that allegation .
" Commerce secretary is a pretty good job , " Obama said .
" It 's a member of my key economic team that is going to be dealing with the most significant issue that America faces right now , and that is , how do we put people back to work ? "
iReport.com : Your thoughts on Obama 's cabinet picks
Obama said Richardson would be a " key strategist " in his administration .
" I think the notion that somehow the commerce secretary is not going to be central to everything we do is fundamentally mistaken , " Obama said .
Watch Obama tell why he 's confident economy can be fixed »
CNN 's Candy Crowley said Obama went out of his way to show that this announcement is not a consolation prize by giving Richardson a solo news conference .
No other staff appointments were announced at the Wednesday event .
" [ Richardson ] brings to this plate , in particular in an era where the economy is the focus of attention , a lot of skills that could be put to use -- perhaps opening up marketplaces for U.S. products abroad , " Crowley said .
" In New Mexico , he sought to bring in new businesses and to create jobs ... so the Obama team considers this part of the economic team . "
Assuming Richardson steps down as chief executive of New Mexico , Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish takes over .
She was Richardson 's running mate in the 2002 and 2006 gubernatorial elections .
It 's a very different situation in neighboring Arizona , where another Democratic governor , Janet Napolitano , is also stepping down to join Obama 's Cabinet .
Arizona does n't have a lieutenant governor .
Under state law , Secretary of State Jan Brewer -- a Republican -- takes over .
Richardson withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination January 10 , after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary , and later endorsed Obama .
Obama and Clinton both lobbied Richardson for his endorsement .
If confirmed as secretary of commerce , Richardson will be charged with bringing much - needed jobs and businesses to the United States .
Obama has promised that his administration will " hit the ground running " when it comes to fixing the ailing economy .
Key members of Obama 's economic team include New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner as treasury secretary , former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers as chief of the National Economic Council , and Peter Orszag as his nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget .
Those named to Obama 's economic team have started working on crafting an economic recovery plan .
Obama has said job creation will be a key part of any economic recovery package .
The president - elect has directed his economic team to develop a two - year initiative that will save or create 2.5 million jobs by putting people to work rebuilding roads , upgrading schools and developing clean energy .
CNN 's Candy Crowley , Ed Hornick , Kristi Keck and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
All About Bill Richardson • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
This is a continuation of a previous post including interesting questions from the comments .
What are parameterisations ?
Some physics in the real world , that is necessary for a climate model to work , is only known empirically .
Or perhaps the theory only really applies at scales much smaller than the model grid size .
This physics needs to be ‘ parameterised ’ i.e. a formulation is used that captures the phenomenology of the process and its sensitivity to change but without going into all of the very small scale details .
These parameterisations are approximations to the phenomena that we wish to model , but which work at the scales the models actually resolve .
A simple example is the radiation code – instead of using a line - by - line code which would resolve the absorption at over 10,000 individual wavelengths , a GCM generally uses a broad - band approximation ( with 30 to 50 bands ) which gives very close to the same results as a full calculation .
Another example is the formula for the evaporation from the ocean as a function of the large - scale humidity , temperature and wind - speed .
This is really a highly turbulent phenomena , but there are good approximations that give the net evaporation as a function of the large scale ( ‘ bulk ’ ) conditions .
In some parameterisations , the functional form is reasonably well known , but the values of specific coefficients might not be .
In these cases , the parameterisations are ‘ tuned ’ to reproduce the observed processes as much as possible .
How are the parameterisations evaluated ?
In at least two ways .
At the process scale , and at the emergent phenomena scale .
For instance , taking one of the two examples mentioned above , the radiation code can be tested against field measurements at specific times and places where the composition of the atmosphere is known alongside a line - by - line code .
It would need to capture the variations seen over time ( the daily cycle , weather , cloudiness etc. ) .
This is a test at the level of the actual process being parameterised and is a necessary component in all parameterisations .
The more important tests occur when we examine how the parameterisation impacts larger - scale or emergent phenomena .
Does changing the evaporation improve the patterns of precipitation ?
the match of the specific humidity field to observations ?
etc .
This can be an exhaustive set of tests but again are mostly necessary .
Note that most ‘ tunings ’ are done at the process level .
Only those that ca n’t be constrained using direct observations of the phenomena are available for tuning to get better large scale climate features .
As mentioned in the previous post , there are only a handful of such parameters that get used in practice .
Are clouds included in models ?
How are they parameterised ?
Models do indeed include clouds , and do allow changes in clouds as a response to forcings .
There are certainly questions about how realistic those clouds are and whether they have the right sensitivity – but all models do have them !
In general , models suggest that they are a positive feedback – i.e. there is a relative increase in high clouds ( which warm more than they cool ) compared to low clouds ( which cool more than they warm ) – but this is quite variable among models and not very well constrained from data .
Cloud parameterisations are amongst the most complex in the models .
The large differences in mechanisms for cloud formation ( tropical convection , mid-latitude storms , marine stratus decks ) require multiple cases to be looked at and many sensitivities to be explored ( to vertical motion , humidity , stratification etc. ) .
Clouds also have important micro-physics that determine their properties ( such as cloud particle size and phase ) and interact strongly with aerosols .
Standard GCMs have most of this physics included , and some are even going so far as to embed cloud resolving models in each grid box .
These models are supposed to do away with much of the parameterisation ( though they too need some , smaller - scale , ones ) , but at the cost of greatly increased complexity and computation time .
Something like this is probably the way of the future .
What is being done to address the considerable uncertainty associated with cloud and aerosol forcings ?
As alluded to above , cloud parameterisations are becoming much more detailed and are being matched to an ever larger amount of observations .
However , there are still problems in getting sufficient data to constrain the models .
For instance , it ’s only recently that separate diagnostics for cloud liquid water and cloud ice have become available .
We still are n’t able to distinguish different kinds of aerosols from satellites ( though maybe by this time next year ) .
However , none of this is to say that clouds are a done deal , they certainly are n’t .
In both cloud and aerosol modelling the current approach is get as wide a spectrum of approaches as possible and to discern what is and what is not robust among those results .
Hopefully soon we will start converging on the approaches that are the most realistic , but we are not there yet .
Forcings over time are a slightly different issue , and there it is likely that substantial uncertainties will remain because of the difficulty in reconstructing the true emission data for periods more than a few decades back .
That involves making pretty unconstrained estimates of the efficiency of 1930s technology ( for instance ) and 19th Century deforestation rates .
Educated guesses are possible , but independent constraints ( such as particulates in ice cores ) are partial at best .
Do models assume a constant relative humidity ?
No. Relative humidity is a diagnostic of the models ’ temperature and water distribution and will vary according to the dynamics , convection etc .
However , many processes that remove water from the atmosphere ( i.e. cloud formation and rainfall ) have a clear functional dependence on the relative humidity rather than the total amount of water ( i.e. clouds form when air parcels are saturated at their local temperature , not when humidity reaches X g / m3 ) .
These leads to the phenomenon observed in the models and the real world that long - term mean relative humidity is pretty stable .
In models it varies by a couple of percent over temperature changes that lead to specific humidity ( the total amount of water ) changing by much larger amounts .
Thus a good estimate of the model relative humidity response is that it is roughly constant , similar to the situation seen in observations .
But this is a derived result , not an assumption .
You can see for yourself here ( select Relative Humidty ( % ) from the diagnostics ) .
What are boundary conditions ?
These are the basic data input into the models that define the land / ocean mask , the height of the mountains , river routing and the orbit of the Earth .
For standard models additional inputs are the distribution of vegetation types and their properties , soil properties , and mountain glacier , lake , and wetland distributions .
In more sophisticated models some of what were boundary conditions in simpler models have now become prognostic variables .
For instance , dynamic vegetation models predict the vegetation types as a function of climate .
Other examples in a simple atmospheric model might be the distribution of ozone or the level of carbon dioxide .
In more complex models that calculate atmospheric chemistry or the carbon cycle , the boundary conditions would instead be the emissions of ozone precursors or anthropogenic CO2 .
Variations in these boundary conditions ( for whatever reason ) will change the climate simulation and can be considered forcings in the most general sense ( see the next few questions ) .
Does the climate change if the boundary conditions are stable ?
The answer to this question depends very much on perspective .
On the longest timescales a climate model with constant boundary conditions is stable – that is , the mean properties and their statistical distribution do n’t vary .
However , the spectrum of variability can be wide , and so there is variation from one decade to the next , from one century to the next , that are the result of internal variations in ( for instance ) the ocean circulation .
While the long term stability is easy to demonstrate in climate models , it ca n’t be unambiguously determined whether this is true in the real world since boundary conditions are always changing ( albeit slowly most of the time ) .
Does the climate change if boundary conditions change ?
Yes .
If any of the factors that influence the simulation change , there will be a response in the climate .
It might be large or small , but it will always be detectable if you run the model for long enough .
For example , making the Rockies smaller ( as they were a few million years ago ) changes the planetary wave patterns and the temperature patterns downstream .
Changing the ozone distribution changes temperatures , the height of the tropopause and stratospheric winds .
Changing the land - ocean mask ( because of sea level rise or tectonic changes for instance ) changes ocean circulation , patterns of atmospheric convection and heat transports .
What is a forcing then ?
The most straightforward definition is simply that a forcing is a change in any of the boundary conditions .
Note however that this definition is not absolute with respect to any particular bit of physics .
Take ozone for instance .
In a standard atmospheric model , the ozone distribution is fixed and any change in that fixed distribution ( because of stratospheric ozone depletion , tropospheric pollution , or changes over a solar cycle ) would be a forcing causing the climate to change .
In a model that calculates atmospheric chemistry , the ozone distribution is a function of the emissions of chemical precursors , the solar UV input and the climate itself .
In such a model , ozone changes are a response ( possibly leading to a feedback ) to other imposed changes .
Thus it does n’t make sense to ask whether ozone changes are or are n’t a forcing without discussing what kind of model you are talking about .
There is however a default model setup in which many forcings are considered .
This is not always stated explicitly and leads to ( somewhat semantic ) confusion even among specialists .
This setup consists of an atmospheric model with a simple mixed - layer ocean model , but that does n’t include chemistry , aerosol vegetation or dynamic ice sheet modules .
Not coincidentally this corresponds to the state - of - the - art of climate models around 1980 when the first comparisons of different forcings started to be done .
It persists in the literature all the way through to the latest IPCC report ( figure xx ) .
However , there is a good reason for this , and that is observation that different forcings that have equal ‘ radiative ’ impacts have very similar responses .
This allows many different forcings to be compared in magnitude and added up .
The ‘ radiative forcing ’ is calculated ( roughly ) as the net change in radiative fluxes ( both short wave and long wave ) at the top of the atmosphere when a component of the default model set up is changed .
Increased solar irradiance is an easy radiative forcing to calculate , as is the value for well - mixed greenhouse gases .
The direct effect of aerosols ( the change in reflectance and absorption ) is also easy ( though uncertain due to the distributional uncertainty ) , while the indirect effect of aerosols on clouds is a little trickier .
However , some forcings in the general sense defined above do n’t have an easy - to - caclulate ‘ radiative forcing ’ at all .
What is the radiative impact of opening the isthmus of Panama ? or the collapse of Lake Agassiz ?
Yet both of these examples have large impacts on the models ’ climate .
Some other forcings have a very small global radiative forcing and yet lead to large impacts ( orbital changes for instance ) through components of the climate that are n’t included in the default set - up .
This is n’t a problem for actually modelling the effects , but it does make comparing them to other forcings without doing the calculations a little more tricky .
What are the differences between climate models and weather models ?
Conceptually they are very similar , but in practice they are used very differently .
Weather models use as much data as there is available to start off close to the current weather situation and then use their knowledge of physics to step forward in time .
This has good skill for a few days and some skill for a little longer .
Because they are run for short periods of time only , they tend to have much higher resolution and more detailed physics than climate models ( but note that the Hadley Centre for instance , uses the same model for climate and weather purposes ) .
Weather models develop in ways that improve the short term predictions , though the impact for long term statistics or the climatology needs to be assessed independently .
Curiously , the best weather models often have a much worse climatology than the best climate models .
There are many current attempts to improve the short - term predictability in climate models in line with the best weather models , though it is unclear what impact that will have on projections .
How are solar variations represented in the models ?
This varies a lot because of uncertainties in the past record and complexities in the responses .
But given a particular estimate of solar activity there are a number of modelled responses .
First , the total amount of solar radiation ( TSI ) can be varied – this changes the total amount of energy coming into the system and is very easy to implement .
Second , the variation over the the solar cycle at different frequencies ( from the UV to the near infra-red ) do n’t all vary with the same amplitude – UV changes are about 10 times as large as those in the total irradiance .
Since UV is mostly absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere , including these changes increases the magnitude of the solar cycle variability in the stratosphere .
Furthermore , the change in UV has an impact on the production of ozone itself ( even down into the troposphere ) .
This can be calculated with chemistry - climate models , and is increasingly being used in climate model scenarios ( see here for instance ) .
There are also other hypothesised impacts of solar activity on climate , most notably the impact of galactic cosmic rays ( which are modulated by the solar magnetic activity on solar cycle timescales ) on atmospheric ionisation , which in turn has been linked to aerosol formation , and in turn linked to cloud amounts .
Most of these links are based on untested theories and somewhat dubious correlations , however , as was recognised many years ago ( Dickinson , 1975 ) , this is a plausible idea .
Implementing it in climate models is however a challenge .
It requires models to have a full model of aerosol creation , growth , accretion and cloud nucleation .
There are many other processes that affect aerosols and GCR - related ionisation is only a small part of that .
Additionally there is a huge amount of uncertainty in aerosol - cloud effects ( the ‘ aerosol indirect effect ’ ) .
Preliminary work seems to indicate that the GCR - aerosol - cloud link is very small ( i.e. the other effects dominate ) , but this is still in the early stages of research .
Should this prove to be significant , climate models will likely incorporate this directly ( using embedded aerosol codes ) , or will parameterise the effects based on calculated cloud variations from more detailed models .
What models ca n’t do ( except perhaps as a sensitivity study ) is take purported global scale correlations and just ‘ stick them in ’ – cloud processes and effects are so tightly wound up in the model dynamics and radiation and have so much spatial and temporal structure that this could n’t be done in a way that made physical sense .
For instance , part of the observed correlation could be due to the other solar effects , and so how could they be separated out ?
( and that ’s even assuming that the correlations actually hold up over time , which does n’t seem to be the case ) .
What do you mean when you say a model has “ skill ” ?
‘ Skill ’ is a relative concept .
A model is said to have skill if it gives more information than a naive heuristic .
Thus for weather forecasts , a prediction is described as skillful if it works better than just assuming that each day is the same as the last ( ‘ persistence ’ ) .
It should be noted that ‘ persistence ’ itself is much more skillful than climatology ( the historical average for that day ) for about a week .
For climate models , there is a much larger range of tests available and there is n’t necessarily an analogue for ‘ persistence ’ in all cases .
For a simulation of a previous time period ( say the mid-Holocene ) , skill is determined relative to a ‘ no change from the present ’ .
Thus if a model predicts a shift northwards of the tropical rain bands ( as was observed ) , that would be skillful .
This can be quantified and different models can exhibit more or less skill with respect to that metric .
For the 20th Century , models show skill for the long - term changes in global and continental - scale temperatures – but only if natural and anthropogenic forcings are used – compared to an expectation of no change .
Standard climate models do n’t show skill at the interannual timescales which depend heavily on El Niño ’s and other relatively unpredictable internal variations ( note that initiallised climate model projections that use historical ocean conditions may show some skill , but this is still a very experimental endeavour ) .

Most people , journalists included , accept the notion that the New Deal “ worked ” to shorten the Depression .
Many economists , and to a lesser extent , historians , disagree .
Why , then , do criticisms of the New Deal get met with a blank stare akin to stating that the world is flat ?
Recently , one Salon.com pundit declared the New Deal success a fact ; nay , an incontrovertible fact .
To argue otherwise is “ abject insanity . ”
Only dim - witted conservatives would believe such nonsense .
At the risk of being labeled “ insane , ” here goes . . .
In 1995 , economic historian Robert Whaples published a survey in the Journal of Economic History asking “ Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians ? ” ( Vol. 55 , March 1995 ) .
Half of the economists and more than a quarter of historians agreed , in whole or in part , that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression .
Specialists of the period may come to this conclusion but most people get their history from textbooks .
A 1998 survey of history textbooks reported how criticism of the New Deal was erased from what most Americans read :
“ only about half of the economists and three quarters of the historians disagreed fully with the statement that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the Great Depression .
Not a hint of that shows up in the textbooks , which cite as criticisms only statements from sources like President Hoover , the Liberty League , or business interests , that to modern ears sound highly ideological , naive , or self - serving .
Obviously , such statements were made , and their tone probably represents accurately the majority of the contemporaneous criticisms .
All the same , one might wish that the texts would also discuss some of the more sophisticated criticisms , or else avoid evaluation altogether because of the complexity of the issue . ”
( Thomas F. Cargill and Thomas Mayer , “ The Great Depression and History Textbooks , ” The History Teacher ( August 1998 ) .
Contemporary critics of the New Deal included John Maynard Keynes ( yes , that Keynes ) .
Keynes repeatedly criticized FDR for discouraging private business investment with his regulations and overheated rhetoric ( the White House charged that opponents were “ Big Business Fascists ” ) .
Radical historian Howard Zinn ( yes , that Howard Zinn ) published Keynes ’s criticisms in his New Deal Thought reader ( 1966 ) .
As one who teaches the economic and business history of the USA , I can say that this subdiscipline is an orphan in the historical profession at large .
Most economic history is consigned to Economics departments , rather than History , where fashionable trends in social and cultural studies hold sway .
Look for specialty studies of the Great Depression and you will find them written by economists .
That is a good thing but most Americans get their understanding of our economic past from history teachers , both K - 12 and post - secondary .
Thus the disbelief that any one could seriously criticize the New Deal .
If this country is to have a “ New New Deal , ” we need a more nuanced understanding of the original New Deal .
In arguing for open debate , one might take a page from New Dealer Harry S Truman , who famously stated that “ the only thing new in the world is the history that you do n’t know . ”

Re : Picking on You
When I e-mailed you yesterday after hearing you expound on global warming on FoxNewsSunday with Tony Snow , it was not to single you out for criticism .
It was simply that I finally decided I had to intervene on this topic after watching so many other reporters make the same mistake .
I understand that it is very difficult to become an expert on every issue in public discussion when you are asked to offer opinions on these talk shows .
It is really almost impossible for political reporters to become expert on public policy issues that are technical in nature .
In preparing for the show , after you are told the topic will come up , you read the major papers and rely upon the work of the reporters assigned to that beat .
You must assume that if The New York Times assigns a reporter to cover global warming , and the reporter refers to carbon dioxide as a “ pollutant , ” that he must know what he is talking about .
It is not always true .
In this case , it is a horrendous mistake for Andrew Revkin to be repeatedly making , to the point where I have privately urged editors at the NYT to assign him to another beat .
As I wrote yesterday , carbon dioxide is not a pollutant .
Ask almost any high school science teacher and they will tell you that life on earth would not be possible without carbon dioxide .
The process by which the sun ’s rays interact with carbon dioxide produces all the things that grow in the earth , which are then converted by living things into the calories they need to sustain themselves .
Do you remember the word “ photosynthesis ” ?
What it amounts to , Ceci , is that when you take a breath , you convert oxygen into carbon dioxide , which you exhale into the atmosphere .
Plants and trees and grass do not breathe oxygen .
The Creator arranged for them to breathe in the carbon dioxide that you exhaled , and convert it to oxygen , which means as long as the cycle continues , you will be able to breathe .
And so will all the animals and all the birds and all the reptiles and all the insects and all the fish .
Carbon dioxide does you no good , or bad , when you inhale it , although is part of the gaseous mixture you do inhale .
Unless there is zero relative humidity , which never happens , you also are breathing in water molecules that contain hydrogen .
Your body recognizes the CO2 and expels it along with the new CO2 created when the oxygen you do inhale oxidizes the carbs you have eaten , courtesy of photosynthesis .
It is not good to inhale a gaseous mixture containing oxygen , carbon dioxide and tars and nicotine , because as the Surgeon General warns , such a mixture can cause cancer .
But the CO2 is definitely not part of that warning .
Now the environmentalists insist that CO2 is causing the earth to warm , and that this occurs not only because of your breath , but also because of the oxidization of petroleum and coal that occurs when we drive our cars and heat our homes and turn bauxite into aluminum .
The reason they single out CO2 is that they can blame it on mankind , when that is impossible when it comes to all the other gases that make up the greenhouse mixture in the atmosphere .
And do not forget that we need greenhouse gases to insulate the earth .
If there were no atmosphere , the sun ’s radiation would not be modulated between night and day and Mother Earth would cook and freeze .
If you take the trouble to figure out the various components of the greenhouse gases that insulate Mother Earth , you would find scientists more or less agreeing that the CO2 component is very small .
How small ?
Well , most of the gases are water vapors that hover above the oceans and the clouds that hover over the lands .
The political greenies cannot ask that an Act of Congress be passed to eliminate the oceans or the clouds , so they get a pass .
The trees and grass that die each year in season also produce carbon dioxide as they are oxidized .
That ’s another chunk of the greenhouse stuff .
There are a zillion termites on earth and these little guys oxidize a great deal of carbon .
Methane is yet another source of insulation .
This comes to us courtesy of the flatulence of cows , although other animals chip in as well .
In terms of producing CO2 , remember that 6 billion human beings inhaling and exhaling all around the clock do not even register on the CO2 scale .
Insects contribute 10 times as much CO2 .
They may be teeny , but all the insects on earth weigh ten times as much as all the humans .
When you throw in all the lions and tigers and bears and horses and squirrels and birds , the human contribution really is insignificant .
But what about the smokestacks and tailpipes ?
Well , Ceci , I went to the trouble of adding up all the greenhouse gases , as provided in Gregg Easterbrook ’s excellent book , A Moment on the Earth , and then converted the total volume to a linear scale .
That ’s so you can get a better sense of mankind ’s total annual contribution .
That is , I wondered if there were one mile of greenhouse gas , how much of that would be the result of all of man ’s doing .
I found that out of 5,280 feet , mankind contributes five - eighths of an inch .
And this is what all the fuss is about at Kyoto .
Do you see why I got so worked up yesterday when you made the comment that CO2 is a pollutant , and the United States is the biggest polluter of all ?

Green technology was hot in 2008 .
Barack Obama won the presidential election promising green jobs to Rust Belt workers .
Investors poured $ 5 billion into the sector just through the first nine months of the year .
And even Texas oilmen like T. Boone Pickens started pushing alternative energy as a replacement for fossil fuels like petroleum , coal and natural gas .
But there ’s trouble on the horizon .
The economy is hovering somewhere between catatonic and hebephrenic , and funding for the big plans that green tech companies laid in 2008 might be a lot harder to come by in 2009 .
Recessions have n’t always been the best times for environmentally friendly technologies as consumers and corporations cut discretionary spending on ethical premiums .
Still , green technology and its attendant infrastructure are probably the best bet to drag the American economy out of the doldrums .
So , with the optimism endemic to the Silicon Valley region , we present you with the Top 10 Green Tech Breakthroughs of 2008 , alternatively titled , The Great Green Hope .
10 . THE ISLAND OF THE SOLAR
With money flowing like milk and honey in the land of solar technology , all sorts of schemers and dreamers came streaming into the area .
One
Swiss researcher , Thomas Hinderling , wants to build solar islands several miles across that he claims can produce hundreds of megawatts of relatively inexpensive power .
Though most clean tech advocates question the workability of the scheme , earlier this year , Hinderling ’s company
Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique received $ 5 million from the Ras al Khaimah emirate of the United Arab Emirates to start construction on a prototype facility , shown above , in that country .

9. NEW MATERIALS CAGE CARBON
Carbon capture and sequestration has a seductively simple appeal :
We generate carbon dioxide emissions by burning geology — coal and oil —
so to fix the problem , we should simply capture it and inject it back into the ground .
It turns out , however , that it ’s not quite so simple .
Aside from finding the right kind of empty spaces in the earth ’s crust and the risks that the CO2 might leak , the biggest problem with the scheme is finding a material that could selectively snatch the molecule out of the hot mess of gases going up the flues of fossil fuel plants .
That ’s where two classes of special cage - like molecules come into play ,
ZIFs and amines .
This year , Omar Yaghi , a chemist at UCLA , announced a slough of new CO2 - capturing ZIFs and Chris Jones , a chemical engineer at Georgia Tech , reported that he ’d made a new amine that seems particularly well - suited to working under real - world condition .
Both materials could eventually make capturing CO2 easier — and therefore , more cost effective .
Perhaps better still , Yaghi ’s lab ’s technique also defined a new process for quickly creating new ZIFs with the properties that scientists — and coal - plant operators — want .
Some of their crystals are shown in the image above .

8. GREEN TECH LEGISLATION GETS REAL
On the federal and state levels , several historic actions put the teeth into green tech bills passed over the last few years .
A review committee of the EPA effectively froze coal plant construction , a boon to alternative energy ( though earlier this month the EPA ignored the committee ’s ruling and it is unclear how the issue will be settled ) .
In California , the state unveiled and approved its plan to regulate carbon dioxide emissions , which could be a model for a nationwide system .
Combined with the green - energy tax credits in the $ 700 - billion bailout bill , the government did more for green tech in 2008 than in whole decades in the past .
7. THE CATALYST THAT COULD ENABLE SOLAR
In July , MIT chemist Daniel Nocera announced that he ’d created a catalyst that could drop the cost of extracting the hydrogen and oxygen from water .
Combined with cheap photovoltaic solar panels ( like Nanosolar ’s ) , the system could lead to inexpensive , simple systems that use water to store the energy from sunlight .
In the process , the scientists may have cleared the major roadblock on the long road to fossil fuel independence : Reducing the on- again , off - again nature of many renewable power sources .
" You ’ve made your house into a fuel station , " Daniel Nocera , a chemistry professor at MIT told Wired.com .
" I ’ve gotten rid of all the goddamn grids . "
The catalyst enables the electrolysis system to function efficiently at room temperature and at ordinary pressure .
Like a reverse fuel cell , it splits water into oxygen and hydrogen .
By recombining the molecules with a standard fuel cell , the O2 and H2 could then be used to generate energy on demand .
6. PICKENS PLAN PUSHES POWER PLAYS INTO AMERICAN MAINSTREAM
Texas oilman T. Boone
Pickens might be a lot of things , but environmentalist he is not .
That ’s why his support for a nationwide network of wind farms generated so much excitement .
While his solution for transportation , natural gas vehicles , may not pan out , his Pickens Plan is the most visible alternative energy plan out there and it began to channel support from outside coastal cities for finding new sources of energy .
Of course , no one said Pickens is stupid .
If his plan was adopted and major investments in transmission infrastructure were made , his wind energy investments would stand to benefit .
5. SOLAR THERMAL PLANTS RETURN TO THE DESERTS
When most people think of harnessing the sun ’s power , they imagine a solar photovoltatic panel , which directly converts light from the sun into electricity .
But an older technology emerged as a leading city - scale power technology in 2008 : solar thermal .
Companies like
Ausra , BrightSource , eSolar , Solel , and a host of others are using sunlight - reflecting mirrors to turn liquids into steam , which can drive a turbine in the same way that coal - fired power plants make electricity .
Two companies , BrightSource and Ausra , debuted their pilot plants .
They mark the first serious solar thermal experimentation in the United
States since the 1980s .
BrightSource ’s Israeli demo plant is shown above .

4. OBAMA PICKS A GREEN TECH EXPERT TO HEAD DOE
President - elect Barack Obama ran on the promise of green jobs and an economic stimulus package that would provide support for scientific innovation .
Then , Obama picked Steven Chu , a Nobel - prize winning physicist , to head the Department of Energy .
Chu had been focused on turning Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory into an alternative - energy powerhouse .
The green tech community rejoiced that one of their own would be in the White
House .
That ’s because green tech is going to need some help .
With the world economy falling into recession , the price of oil has dropped , even though there are serious concerns about the long - term oil supply .
When energy prices drop , clean tech investments do n’t seem quite as attractive , and the renascent industry could be in trouble .
It ’s happened before , after all .
Back in the ’70s , geopolitical events sent the price of oil soaring , which , as it tends to , created a boom in green tech .
But the early
1980s saw the worst recession since the Depression .
Sound familiar ?
In the poor economic climate , focus and funds were shifted away from green tech .
The last nail in the coffin was the election of Ronald Reagan , who immediately pulled off the solar panels Jimmy Carter had placed on the White House .
The green tech industry collapsed .
History has given U.S. alternative energy research a second chance and environmental advocates hope that a different president will lead to a very different result .

3. SOLAR CELL PRODUCTION GETS BIG , GIGA ( WATT ) BIG
Every clean tech advocate ’s dream is a power - generating technology that could compete head - to - head with coal , the cheapest fossil fuel , on price alone .
Nanosolar , one of a new generation of companies building solar panels out of cheap plastics , could be the first company to get there .
Early this year , the company officially opened its one - gigawatt production facility , which is many times the size of most previous solar facilities .
Nanosolar , in other words , has found a process that can scale : it works as well in production as it does in the lab .
That ’s the main reason that the company has picked up half - a- billion dollars in funding from investors like MDV’s Erik Straser .
" [ It ’s the ] first time in industry a single tool with a 1GW
throughput , " Straser wrote in an e-mail .
" It ’s a key part of how the company is achieving grid parity with coal . "
2. PROJECT BETTER PLACE FINDS HOMES
Green technologies are dime a dozen , but a business model that could allow an entirely new , green infrastructure to be built is a rare thing .
Doing just that is the centerpiece of Sun Microsystems ’
SAP veteran Shai Agassi ’s vision for Project Better Place , a scheme that would distribute charging and swappable battery stations throughout smallish geographies like Israel , Hawaii and San Francisco .
So far , there ’s very little steel in the ground , but in early December , the company ’s first charging location opened in Tel Aviv , Israel .
Agassi ’s plan is one of several projects — like new biofuels rail terminals — that could create fundamentally new energy ecosystems .
Some of these systems , however , are actually throwbacks to earlier eras .
As Peter Shulman , a historian of technology at Case Western
Reserve University , likes to remind his students : in the early 20th century , before the Model T , one - third of all cars were electric .

1. CALERA’S GREEN CEMENT DEMO PLANT OPENS
Cement ?
With all the whiz bang technologies in green technology , cement seems like an odd pick for our top clean technology of the year .
But here ’s the reason : making cement — and many other materials —
takes a lot of heat and that heat comes from fossil fuels .
Calera ’s technology , like that of many green chemistry companies , works more like Jell - O setting .
By employing catalysis instead of heat , it reduces the energy cost per ton of cement .
And in this process , CO2
is an input , not an output .
So , instead of producing a ton of carbon dioxide per ton of cement made — as is the case with old - school
Portland cement — half a ton of carbon dioxide can be sequestered .
With more than 2.3 billion tons of cement produced each year , reversing the carbon - balance of the world ’s cement would be a solution that ’s the scale of the world ’s climate change problem .
In August , the company opened its first demonstration site next to Dynegy ’s Moss Landing power plant in California , pictured here .

Secret of the Lusitania : Arms find challenges Allied claims it was solely a passenger ship
Her sinking with the loss of almost 1,200 lives caused such outrage that it propelled the U.S. into the First World War .
But now divers have revealed a dark secret about the cargo carried by the Lusitania on its final journey in May 1915 .
Munitions they found in the hold suggest that the Germans had been right all along in claiming the ship was carrying war materials and was a legitimate military target .
Doomed : A contemporary view of the sinking of the Lusitania off Ireland in May 1915
The Cunard vessel , steaming from New York to Liverpool , was sunk eight miles off the Irish coast by a U - boat .
Maintaining that the Lusitania was solely a passenger vessel , the British quickly accused the ' Pirate Hun ' of
slaughtering civilians .
The disaster was used to whip up anti-German anger , especially in the U.S. , where 128 of the 1,198 victims came from .
A hundred of the dead were children , many of them under two .
Robert Lansing , the U.S. secretary of state , later wrote that the sinking gave him the ' conviction we would ultimately become the ally of Britain ' .
Americans were even told , falsely , that German children were given a day off school to celebrate the sinking of the Lusitania .
The disaster inspired a multitude of recruitment posters demanding vengeance for the victims .
One , famously showing a young mother slipping below the waves with her baby , carried the simple slogan ' Enlist ' .
Two years later , the Americans joined the Allies as an associated power - a decision that turned the war decisively against Germany .
The diving team estimates that around four million rounds of U.S. - manufactured Remington .303 bullets lie in the Lusitania 's hold at a depth of 300ft .
The Germans had insisted the Lusitania - the fastest liner in the North Atlantic - was being used as a weapons ship to break the blockade Berlin had been trying to impose around Britain since the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 .
Winston Churchill , who was first Lord of the Admiralty and has long been suspected of knowing more about the circumstances of the attack than he let on in public , wrote in a confidential letter shortly before the sinking that some German submarine attacks were to be welcomed .
He said : ' It is most important to attract neutral shipping to our shores , in the hope especially of embroiling the U.S. with Germany .
' For our part we want the traffic - the more the better and if some of it gets into trouble , better still . '
Hampton Sides , a writer with Men's Vogue in the U.S. , witnessed the divers ' discovery .
He said : ' They are bullets that were expressly manufactured to kill Germans in World War I - bullets that British officials in Whitehall , and American officials in Washington , have long denied were aboard the Lusitania . '
The discovery may help explain why the 787ft Lusitania sank within 18 minutes of a single German torpedo slamming into its hull .
Some of the 764 survivors reported a second explosion which might have been munitions going off .
Gregg Bemis , an American businessman who owns the rights to the wreck and is funding its exploration , said : ' Those four million rounds of .303s were not just some private hunter 's stash .
' Now that we 've found it , the British can't deny any more that there was ammunition on board .
That raises the question of what else was on board .
' There were literally tons and tons of stuff stored in unrefrigerated cargo holds that were dubiously marked cheese , butter and oysters .
' I 've always felt there were some significant high explosives in the holds - shells , powder , gun cotton - that were set off by the torpedo and the inflow of water .
That 's what sank the ship . '
Mr Bemis is planning to commission further dives next year in a full - scale forensic examination of the wreck off County Cork .
People visit the Creative Technology booth at an IT show in Singapore March 9 , 2006 .
REUTERS / David Loh
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Singapore 's Creative Technology CREA.SI , which makes digital music players , has cut its workforce by 2,700 , or almost half , after the firm sold its manufacturing unit in Malaysia , a newspaper reported on Saturday .
The jobs were axed in the 12 months ending June 30 last year and were reported in an annual filing on December 31 , the Business Times said .
Creative Technology has been struggling for years to wrest market share from Apple Inc's AAPL.
O more popular iPod .
According to Reuters data , Creative Technology reported a net loss of $ 32.2 million in the three months ending September 30 last year .
" The law may not change the heart , but it can restrain the heartless . "
-- Martin Luther King
For years now , heartless people have been running many of our world 's banks and investment houses , and our laws have been insufficient to restrain them .
Boards of directors , CEOs , and their leadership teams created incentive systems that rewarded self - interest , impatience , and bottomless greed .
That 's a deadly three - punch combo that can flatten employees , customers , and shareholders alike .
And it has .
So we should not be surprised to find that even as banks have toppled , even as tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs , even as shareholders have been wiped out , and even as taxpayers are on the hook for trillions via future higher taxes or hyperinflation , the " leaders " of these organizations have continued to pay themselves obscenely .
How obscenely ?
Despite losing $ 35 billion in 2008 , Wall Street firms paid out $ 18 billion in cash bonuses !
Specific examples are more enlightening still .
Exhibit A
Washington Mutual CEO Kerry Killinger took home $ 88 million in the seven years preceding the collapse of the bank , which was later handed over to JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) at a 95 % discount to prior highs .
Killinger apparently designed a gimme - gimme culture fueled by reckless urgency and deceit .
He has n't returned a dime of his compensation .
Exhibit B
After leading AIG's ( NYSE : AIG ) credit - default swap unit , which lost $ 11 billion in one year , Joseph Cassano was allowed to keep $ 34 million in bonuses for the year .
He was then hired for $ 1 million per month to consult the company on its maze of transactions .
In total , Cassano was rewarded with more than $ 280 million for helping to destroy the world 's largest insurer .
Exhibit C
During a 15 - year period as CEO of Lehman Brothers , Richard Fuld lapped up hundreds of millions in rewards .
That includes a $ 22 million retirement pay package in the year his company went under .
Exhibit D
A year ago , John Thain was given a $ 15 million signing bonus to take over at Merrill Lynch ; in 2008 , the company posted losses of $ 27 billion .
Today , Merrill is widely considered a bankrupt subsidiary of Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) .
Yet this December , Thain lobbied hard to be paid a $ 10 million bonus .
And why not ?
His predecessor , Stanley O'Neal , received a $ 160 million retirement package after posting writedowns of $ 8 billion in a single quarter .
Hard as it may be to believe , there is no law that mandates the return of compensation when an executive 's actions destroy a corporation .
There 's also no law that says you can't be heartless .
Being soulless is n't criminal .
And having no shame is n't actionable .
To take legal action , federal authorities have to prove that these and other bankers had an intent to deceive .
For example , if they can prove that Thain misled Bank of America before the acquisition , or that Thain and BofA misled regulators about the condition of the bank to secure bailout money , those points would be cause for prosecution .
But in the many cases in which regulators wo n't be able to prove anything , we wo n't see orange jumpsuits on the hundreds of bankers for whom they would fit .
Hundreds ?
Yes , certainly .
At least that many .
Remember that the banking sector has wiped out its investors , is decimating companies that rely on credit , and is primarily responsible for our rising unemployment .
So what are we left with , in terms of people who may go to jail ?
Well , there 's Bernard Madoff -- whose deceit has spanned decades -- as well as what is certainly a team of shills .
Early analysis of the accounting suggests that Madoff actually executed few , if any , trades .
And in a true show of heartless cruelty , when Madoff was arrested , he had $ 170 million set aside not for the clients he had destroyed , but for friends , family members , and select employees .
His lawyer is now being paid $ 1,000 per hour with client capital .
The search for confidence
What the markets need now , we hear every day , is confidence .
Master investor David Swensen , head of Yale 's endowment , said as much on The Charlie Rose Show last week .
And of course , he 's right .
As we saw with the falls of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , Washington Mutual , and Wachovia , lack of confidence leads to bank runs , bailouts , and bankruptcy .
And when our banking system is crippled , there is n't enough confidence left for investors to fairly value even the most honorable organizations -- names such as Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) , Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) , Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK- B ) , and Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE : JNJ ) .
But until there are new regulations in finance , there will be no rebound in investor or consumer confidence .
Until the rules for the TARP plan restrict banks from paying bonuses during the deepest recession in decades , taxpayers will not stop getting angry .
Until we see clear evidence that those who destroy companies will not benefit from their actions , we will continue to suffer the consequences of moral hazard .
In short , until the market system looks meritocratic and constrained by ethics , why should we expect the mainstream investor and consumer to demonstrate confidence ?

1969 : Two Soviet spacecraft rendezvous in orbit and transfer cosmonauts , marking the first time spacefarers go up in one craft and return to Earth in another .
Soyuz 4 lifted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome on Jan. 14 with Commander Vladimir Shatalov flying solo .
Soyuz 5 followed a day later , carrying three cosmonauts : Boris Volynov , Aleksei Yaliseyev and Eugeni Khrunov .
The mission , with the docking and transfer as its centerpiece , was undertaken as part of the experimental run-up to a Soviet lunar mission , which never came off , and as a dress rehearsal for the establishment of a permanent space station , which did .
Soyuz 4 was the active vehicle in the docking maneuver , which went off without a hitch .
After conducting various scientific experiments , running tests of both vehicles ' on - board systems , and evaluating the docking procedure , Yaliseyev and Khrunov donned their space suits , bid Comrade Pilot Volynov a hearty farewell and joined Shatalov in Soyuz 4 .
They would be very glad they did .
The vehicles separated on Jan. 17 , and Soyuz 4 enjoyed an uneventful return to Earth after making 48 orbits of our watery blue sphere .
Volynov remained in orbit for another day and headed home on the 18th after notching 49 go - rounds .
To say that Volynov experienced one of the roughest re-entries in the history of space flight ( at least by anyone who lived to tell the tale ) is to say the least .
Soyuz 5 's service module failed to detach at retrofire , causing the vehicle to assume an aerodynamic position that left the heat shield pointed the wrong way as it re-entered the atmosphere .
The only thing standing between Volynov and a fiery death was the command module 's thin hatch cover .
The interior of Volynov 's capsule filled with noxious fumes as the gaskets sealing the hatch started to burn , and it got very hot in there ( which , a short time later was something he probably missed ) .
Luckily for the cosmonaut , the stress and heat being generated outside the spacecraft caused the connecting struts on the service module to finally give way .
When they did , Volynov 's module , now freed , immediately corrected its position so that the heat shield faced in the right direction .
But wait .
There 's more .
In the chaos of re-entry , some of Soyuz 5's parachute cables fouled , resulting in only a partial chute deployment .
Just to ice the cake a bit , the soft - landing rockets failed , too , so Volynov was very aware of impact when his hardy Soyuz module plowed into the earth .
It hit the ground so hard , in fact , that Volynov broke his teeth .
But wait .
There 's more .
Given that the entire re-entry - and - landing process was pretty well botched , it 's perhaps unsurprising that Volynov came down well short of the intended landing area .
In fact , he landed in the Ural Mountains , where he was greeted by a local temperature measuring a brisk minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit With rescue several hours away at best , our intrepid cosmonaut decided to hoof it for safety .
He plodded a few kilometers before finding a cheery fire and a brimming samovar in the cottage of a welcoming peasant .
But wait .
There 's still more .
You'd think that after all this , the guy might be tempted to call it a career .
But no , not our Volynov .
He returned to space seven years later as commander of Soyuz 21 and spent 18 days aboard the Salyut space station .

From the Age of Aquarius , to the Mayan Calender–these things seem to be at least intuitive for ancient cultures .
Why is that ?
What was it about these ancient cultures that allowed them to perceive a natural shift in the forces of the universe ?
It allowed them to see far beyond their own civilizations ; in fact , it did little to inevitably help their own shifts and downfall .
Strangely , each prediction , be it astrological or cosmological , predicts a similar theme :
We live in an age which will be coming to an end around 2000 AD or after .
The new age will be rapidly approaching , and will be a time of new culture , events people .
For Aquarius , the age is a time of science reason and reflection .
For the Hindu cycles , we enter the Dwapara epoch :
Dvapara Yuga : archana ( worship ) .
In the Dvapara Yuga , science flourishes , people experience the spiritual in terms of subtle energies and rational choices , inventions are abundant , particularly those that dissolve the illusion of distance ( between people and between things ) , and power is mostly in the hands of women .
The end of this age ( in the descending phase ) is associated with the death of Krishna , and the events described in the Mahabharata
Interesting how this coincides with the age of Aquarius , no ?
And though labeled “ New Age , ” alot of theories on 2012 seem to coincide with these sentiments .
The Yugas seem to express a natural , cyclical pattern which increases in speed as you progress through .
Transitions happen faster , last shorter time , etc .
It would make sense that we are emerging from “ Kali Yuga , ” or an age of bare physical subsistence , where power and survival and the physical world are all we are aware of ( for the most part ) .
Fascinating that , should this be true , ancient civilizations living in the heart of Kali Yuga could predict such cosmic and unseen cycles .
I do n’t think this counters their philosophy , it just brings up a remarkable question :
How did they do it ?
Was it the residual vibrations from the last greatest epoch , the Satya Yuga ?
Here is a list of the ages :
1. Satya Yuga : ( Dhyana ) or meditation .
The highest yuga , the greatest majority of people can experience spirituality by direct intuitive realization of truth .
The veil between the material and the transcendent realms becomes almost transparent .
Satya Yuga is also called the Golden Age .
2. Treta Yuga : Yajna ( sacrifice ) .
The Treta Yuga is the mental age .
Mental power is harnessed and men are in power .
There are inventions that dissolve the illusion of time ( inventions are characteristic of both Dvapara and Treta ) .
Clairvoyance and telepathy are common skills .
3. Dvapara Yuga : archana ( worship ) .
Science flourishes , people experience the spiritual in terms of subtle energies and rational choices , inventions are abundant , particular those that dissolve the illusion of distance ( between people and things ) , and power is mostly in the hands of women .
The end of this age ( in the descending phase ) is associated with the death of Krishna .
4. Kali Yuga : daana ( alms ) .
In the lowest epoch , most people are aware only of the physical aspects of existence .
The predominant emphasis of living is material survival , and power is mostly in the hands of men .
Looking at these , and particularly 3 ) Dwapara Yuga .
“ Dissolve the illusion of distance ( between people and between things ) –could this be the development of quantum physics and string theory ?
The new technological revolution ?
Would the singularity play an important part in all of this ?
We live now at the end of Kali Yuga , a time where the physical realms have their greatest hold on our experience of existence .
Could this be why so many of us see nothing greater than the attainment of wealth , power ?
Could this also be why so many philosophers have become nihilist and existential ?
Or are these things , though they seem permanent , only shifting times , and those who know they are can perceive the dawn of a new age ?
More questions than answers , I ’m afraid .
It leaves everything to be a greater mystery , but I ’m beginning to suspect and perhaps intuit a bigger picture , and we ’re all a part of it .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday plunged into Israeli - Palestinian peace diplomacy on his first full day in office and looked poised to order the closing of the internationally condemned military detention camp at Guantanamo .

Acting swiftly on Day One after his inauguration , Obama also summoned his economic team and war council to press ahead with plans for rescuing the battered economy and ending the unpopular war in Iraq .
With his prompt attention to the decades - old Middle East conflict , he made clear it would be a top foreign policy priority among the litany of problems he inherited from his Republican predecessor George W. Bush .
Obama -- who had vowed a bolder pursuit of Israeli - Palestinian peace than Bush -- called Israeli and Arab leaders to commit to “ active engagement ” and to promise his help in consolidating the Gaza ceasefire .
And Obama ’s immediate focus on Guantanamo , where the harsh treatment of terrorism suspects under the Bush administration damaged America ’s moral standing in the world , showed his determination to clean up the U.S. image abroad .
“ He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful , working closely with the international community , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said of Obama ’s quick foray into Middle East diplomacy .
Obama ’s packed agenda signaled the Illinois Democrat was serious about meeting his promise to break sharply with Bush ’s policies at home and abroad .
He also continued filling out the top spots in his Cabinet .
Hillary Clinton won overwhelming U.S. Senate approval as secretary of state , despite renewed Republican concerns about potential conflicts of interest created by overseas fundraising by her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
As part of Wednesday ’s burst of activity , Obama ’s aides circulated an unsigned draft executive order that would set a one - year deadline for closing the Guantanamo prison , opened by the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks of 2001 .
The camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , which Obama had vowed to shut down , had drawn condemnation from human rights groups for interrogation methods like “ waterboarding ” -- or simulated drowning -- that they said amounted to torture .
The Obama administration would also start an immediate review on how to deal with the remaining prisoners held there , according to the draft order obtained by Reuters .
MIDEAST ENGAGEMENT
Obama made clear his Middle East strategy would be different from Bush , who was faulted by critics for taking a largely hands - off approach to peacemaking for much of his eight years in office .
A final failed push for a peace deal was widely seen as too little , too late .
Obama spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan ’s King Abdullah not long after he stepped into the Oval Office for the first time since his historic inauguration as the first black U.S. president .
He is expected to name a Middle East envoy soon , with former U.S. Sen .
George Mitchell widely considered his choice for the job .
On the domestic front , with markets volatile and job losses mounting , Obama held a late afternoon meeting with top economic advisers to try to chart a course out of the worst economic crisis in decades .
Treasury Secretary - nominee Timothy Geithner , appearing before a Senate panel for a confirmation hearing , said the government ’s response would be made in coming weeks .
Obama ’s advisers have been working with the Democratic - led Congress on an $ 825 billion fiscal stimulus package .

Geithner , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , also apologized for “ careless mistakes ” in underpaying taxes , which has cast a cloud over his nomination .
But senators said they saw no reason he would not be confirmed later this week .
With Iraq also high on the agenda , Obama planned to discuss withdrawal strategies with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top commanders on Wednesday .
Obama has said he favors a 16 - month timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq , and U.S. officials said that in his meeting with military leaders he would discuss the possibility of accelerating that departure .
Obama also will discuss plans to bolster troops in Afghanistan , where the Taliban is resurgent and which critics said Bush neglected because he was distracted by Iraq .
When Obama entered the Oval Office on Wednesday , he found a note left for him by Bush that was in an envelope marked “ To : # 44 , From : # 43 . ”
Before plunging into his White House duties in earnest , Obama attended a prayer service at Washington ’s National Cathedral , a traditional morning - after - inauguration event .
Later , at a televised event to welcome new White House officials , Obama announced he was freezing the pay for senior White House staff and tightening up rules for former lobbyists who work in government -- an effort to make good on campaign promises for ethics reform .

The new fin whale quotas are a huge increase from previous years
Iceland 's fisheries ministry has issued whaling quotas substantially enlarged from those in previous years , as the government prepares to leave office .
The quotas would allow catching of 100 minke whales and 150 fin whales annually for the next five years .
The incoming interim administration is likely to be led by parties opposed to whaling , and may cancel the move .
The move comes just after details emerged of an eventual possible deal between pro- and anti-whaling nations .
Environmental groups swiftly condemned the announcement by fisheries minister Einar Gudfinnsson .
Probable interim leader Ingibjorg Gisladottir is against the hunt
Minister warns on whaling " This is basically an act of sabotage , an act of bitterness , against the incoming government , " said Arni Finnsson from the Iceland Nature Conservation Association ( INCA ) .
Mr Finnsson said he would urge the incoming administration , likely to be led by the avowedly anti-whaling Social Democrats and Greens , to overturn it .
Green MP Kolbrun Halldorsdottir , tipped as a possible environment minister in the new regime , indicated she would favour this , though cautioning that the new government will have a lot of other issues to deal with .
" In my opinion , it 's extremely foolish of the minister , and I can promise you that if my party can form this interim government then we will at least discuss it and find out what we can do about it , " she told BBC News .
Last year , ex-foreign minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir , who is likely to lead the interim government , said that whaling risked damaging Iceland 's long - term interests .
Big fins
The fin whale quota particularly angers conservationists .
Internationally it is listed as an endangered species , and the quota of 150 is a major escalation on the total of seven that have been caught over the last three seasons .
Blog :
The whale papers
The outgoing Icelandic government had previously said it would issue quotas only where there was a market - but fin meat is not eaten in Iceland .
Last year the single company hunting fin whales , Hvalur hf , exported a consignment of meat to Japan .
After delays in customs , it entered the country and has reportedly been sold .
Hvalur CEO Kristjan Loftsson indicated that the export had persuaded the government that there was a market .
" They were just listening to me on this one , " he said .
" We exported whalemeat to Japan , and it 's gone through customs and there is no hindrance there . "
Mr Loftsson said he planned major exports from this year 's hunt , assuming the quota was not revoked .
The minke quota is more than doubled to 100 , the size that companies have lobbied for in recent years .
Minke meat is sold and eaten in Iceland .
Minke and fin catches would stay within limits set by Icelandic scientists , a measure designed to ensure the hunts are sustainable .
European rules
Some observers believe that Hvalur hf and the outgoing government are using whaling as a way to lobby against Iceland joining the EU .
EU membership is widely seen as the most feasible way for the country to weather its financial crisis .
Fishing magnates , including Mr Loftsson , fear the EU's Common Fisheries Policy would be introduced , to the detriment of both fish stocks and fishermen .
" We do n't see any point to have that to manage our fisheries - we can do it here better ourselves , " he said .
He also said that an annual catch of 150 fin whales could generate seasonal employment for up to 200 people .
Reykjavik has been hit by protests against the financial crisis
The EU would be likely to demand an end to whaling as a condition of membership .
But Mr Finnsson of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association said it was not in Iceland 's interests to provoke the EU .
" Even if we do n't join this year , it 's obvious that we need close relations and we can't step on one another 's toes , " he said .
Iceland 's is the smallest annual catch of the three countries with whaling programmes that are not intended to satisfy the subsistence needs of aboriginal peoples - the other two being Norway and Japan .
At the weekend , delegates from six countries met in Hawaii to discuss a possible " compromise package " between Japan , the most politically assertive of the three , and the anti-whaling lobby .
The wording of draft proposals , seen by BBC News , has angered conservation groups which see it as giving too much ground to Japan .
Trade was not covered in the proposals .

( CNN ) --
The man tapped by Illinois ' embattled governor to fill an open U.S. Senate seat will be turned away if he arrives for Tuesday 's inauguration of new members , according to two Democratic aides .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , left , named Roland Burris to fill President - elect Barack Obama 's Senate seat .
Roland Burris , Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's pick to fill President - elect Barack Obama 's vacant Senate seat , will not be allowed on the Senate floor , according to the aides -- one who is familiar with Senate Democratic leaders ' plans , and the other an aide to the Senate Democratic leadership .
Democrats in the Senate have twice this week said they have the authority to refuse to accept anyone appointed by Blagojevich , who was arrested December 9 , accused by federal authorities of corruption , including allegedly trying to sell Obama 's seat for personal gain .
Blagojevich , who denies wrongdoing and has ignored calls to resign , named Burris -- a Democrat and a former Illinois state comptroller and attorney general -- to serve the last two years of Obama 's Senate term .
The first Democratic aide said if Burris tries to enter the Senate chamber on Tuesday , the Senate doorkeeper will stop him .
If Burris were to persist , either trying to force his way onto the Senate floor or refusing to leave and causing a scene , U.S. Capitol police would stop him , the aide said .
Watch efforts to keep Burris from the Senate
" They [ police ] probably wo n't arrest him , " but they would call the Senate 's sergeant - at - arms , the aide said .
Burris has indicated he intends to be at the Senate on Tuesday .
When asked about what would happen if he shows up , Burris told the Chicago Tribune that he is " not going to create a scene in Washington . "
" We hope it 's negotiated out prior to my going to Washington , " he added , according to the Tribune .
Burris told CNN that he was " certainly going to make contacts with the leadership to let them know that the governor of Illinois has made a legal appointment , and that I am currently the junior senator for the state of Illinois . "
" And we 're hoping and praying that they will see the reason in appointing me as a very qualified , capable , able and ready - to - serve individual , " Burris said .
The Senate sergeant - at - arms , Terrance Gainer , served in the Illinois government at the same time as Burris .
Gainer was the director of the Illinois State Police from 1991 to 1995 -- the same years Burris was the Illinois attorney general .
Senate Democratic leaders also have discussed what might happen if Blagojevich shows up on Capitol Hill on Tuesday , the first aide said .
This would be a " radioactive " situation , according to the aide , because Senate Democratic leaders could not deny Blagojevich entry , as sitting governors have floor privileges in the Senate .
Governors are allowed to walk around the Senate chamber or talk with senators while on the floor , though they cannot vote or formally address the Senate .
Blagojevich 's spokesman , Lucio Guerrero , said the governor is aware he is allowed access to the Senate floor , but " the idea of going on Tuesday was first raised by a reporter , " not Blagojevich .
The governor is not planning on going to Capitol Hill , Guerrero said .
CNN 's Bill Mears contributed to this report .

Here 's a partial list of those who have trusted AREA 5 with their content needs .
A more plausible route to sustained recovery would be a drastic reduction in the U.S. trade deficit , which soared at the same time the housing bubble was inflating .
By selling more to other countries and spending more of our own income on U.S. - produced goods , we could get to full employment without a boom in either consumption or investment spending .
But it will probably be a long time before the trade deficit comes down enough to make up for the bursting of the housing bubble .
For one thing , export growth , after several good years , has stalled , partly because nervous international investors , rushing into assets they still consider safe , have driven the dollar up against other currencies  making U.S. production much less cost - competitive .
Furthermore , even if the dollar falls again , where will the capacity for a surge in exports and import - competing production come from ?
Despite rising trade in services , most world trade is still in goods , especially manufactured goods  and the U.S. manufacturing sector , after years of neglect in favor of real estate and the financial industry , has a lot of catching up to do .
Anyway , the rest of the world may not be ready to handle a drastically smaller U.S. trade deficit .
As my colleague Tom Friedman recently pointed out , much of China ’s economy in particular is built around exporting to America , and will have a hard time switching to other occupations .
In short , getting to the point where our economy can thrive without fiscal support may be a difficult , drawn - out process .
And as I said , I hope the Obama team understands that .
Right now , with the economy in free fall and everyone terrified of Great Depression 2.0 , opponents of a strong federal response are having a hard time finding support .
John Boehner , the House Republican leader , has been reduced to using his Web site to seek “ credentialed American economists ” willing to add their names to a list of “ stimulus spending skeptics . ”
But once the economy has perked up a bit , there will be a lot of pressure on the new administration to pull back , to throw away the economy ’s crutches .
And if the administration gives in to that pressure too soon , the result could be a repeat of the mistake F.D.R. made in 1937  the year he slashed spending , raised taxes and helped plunge the United States into a serious recession .
The point is that it may take a lot longer than many people think before the U.S. economy is ready to live without bubbles .
And until then , the economy is going to need a lot of government help .
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - European Commission plans to introduce a 14 percent tax on cellphones with TV receivers would kill the potentially lucrative market before it ever takes off , a senior official at the world ’s top mobile TV chip maker said .

On December 10 the Commission sent member states a formal proposal to reclassify some phones as “ multi- functional devices , ” which would trigger additional taxes on phones with TV receivers .
“ It ’s crazy .
This would definitely be a killer , ” said Azzedine Boubguira , head of marketing at Paris - based DiBcom .
Phone makers and operators are keen to tap the potentially lucrative market for mobile TV broadcasts , with the EU Commission citing a global market forecast of 7.8 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion ) in 2013 .
For mobile TV -- which so far has been launched in just a few countries , mostly in response to the high cost of the phones needed to show it -- an additional 14 percent tax would be another major blow .
“ No - one will pick it up .
No-one .
We were thinking : will people be ready to pay for the subscription , but now they are not being able to buy even the handset , ” Boubguira told Reuters in an interview .
He said the problem will also put off handset makers who have so far introduced only a few models which can receive TV broadcasts .
“ There wo n’t be demand , there wo n’t be phones and there wo n’t be the market , ” he said .
The Commission said it had put the proposal forward in an attempt to unify taxation across the 27 - country bloc after Germany and Netherlands said they would introduce such charges .
Europe 's top cellphone vendors , Nokia NOK1V.HE and Sony Ericsson 6758 .
TERICb.ST , who together make almost every second phone sold in the world , are strongly against the tax .
The Commission ’s plan will be discussed next February within the Customs Code Committee , which can also decide on the matter .

There 's something weirdly fascinating about professional wrestling .
Not that we 've ever watched it ourselves , mind you .
But a , uh , friend tells us that you know someone is gonna get thrown out of the ring onto the fragile tables sitting over there and you know that guy 's gonna struggle to get up and then grab a folding chair to swing back into the ring .
Neither contestant apparently watched last week 's match because one of them still walks into the other 's elbow .
And when the elbow guy starts arguing with the referee , he does n't think to look behind for the folding chair coming down to bloody his head .
It 's a lot like watching Illinois politics .
We too should have seen this latest move coming .
Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's brazen , bold blitz of naming Roland Burris to fill the vacant Barack Obama Senate seat is at once a brilliant and cunning and cynical political move .
In the last hour before the announcement , Senate Democrats , including Illinois ' Dick Durbin , realized they 'd been outfoxed , hastily conferred by phone and tried to duck by desperately announcing they were n't gonna seat Blagojevich 's pick anyway .
A vacationing Obama , who 's got nothing to do with it anymore and once vowed to stay out of picking his successor , sent word anyway from Hawaii that he sides with Durbin against Blagojevich , whom he helped elect in 2002 .
Too late .
The governor said the other day he was going to fight , fight , fight his case to his last dying breath .
So Sunday night he calls up the wily , old , not always successful Burris who 's always dreamed of an office higher than state comptroller or attorney general , both of which he held .
The son of a railway worker , Burris is a Howard University Law School graduate who as a teenager helped integrate a local swimming pool .
Never lacking in confidence , Burris even hopelessly challenged current Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley back in the 1990s .
Burris has state political experience going back to the '60s .
He was the first black person elected to statewide office in Illinois and did it as a native of southern Illinois , parts of which culturally and geographically are farther south than Richmond , the one - time Confederate capitol .
Burris has been party loyal .
He 's been beaten often , though not bowed , by other Democrats -- Paul Simon in 1984 to win Chuck Percy 's Senate seat -- including Blagojevich in 2002 .
The 2002 race was the third straight Democratic gubernatorial primary that Burris lost .
( See Burris and Blagojevich speak for themselves in the videos below . )
But he came around to support good old Rod in that general election and the 2006 reelection , as did both Obama and his new chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel .
Unlike , say , Caroline Kennedy , ....
Richardson waves at supporters .
Richardson exits Cabinet due to probe
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson announced Sunday afternoon that he is withdrawing as President - elect Barack Obama ’s nominee for secretary of Commerce because of unanswered questions about a federal grand jury investigation back home .
" I have concluded that the ongoing investigation also would have forced an untenable delay in the confirmation process , " Richardson said in an e-mailed statement issued by the transition .

Obama accepted the withdrawal with regret , saying in an accompanying statement that he looks forward to Richardson 's " future service to our country and in my administration . "
Richardson said he had told Obama that " eager to serve in the future in any way he deems useful . "
The grand jury has been investigating “ pay - to - play ” allegations concerning a New Mexico state contract awarded to a California firm that has contributed to three political committees formed by Richardson , The Associated Press reported last month .
A source close to Richardson told Politico , " There are too many unanswered questions and while he thinks the results of the grand jury will turn out in his favor , he does n't want to distract attention from the administration . "
A Senate aide told Politico there had been " nervousness " within the Senate and more specifically the Senate Commerce Committee about the grand jury probe in recent weeks .
The announcement prompted immediate finger - pointing about the vetting process , with Democrats wondering what Obama screeners asked Richardson and what he told them , and whether he was really involved or was just being tarred by the actions of others .
One source told Politico that he heard from several members of the Commerce committee who were uncomfortable with the probe .
In a statement first reported by NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell , Richardson said : " Let me say unequivocally that I and my administration have acted properly in all matters and that this investigation will bear out that fact . "
Richardson , who had sought the Democratic presidential nomination himself , was the highest - ranking Hispanic in the prospective Obama administration .
The revelation came in the hours before Obama was scheduled to leave Chicago to come to Washington to live and work ahead of the inauguration on Jan. 20 .
Richardson ’s withdrawal is the first false start for a presidential transition that has had an exceedingly smooth public face .
His decision is linked to a federal grand jury investigation into whether a financial services company won state contracts after its CEO contributed to a PAC controlled by the governor .
California - based CDR Financial Products
Inc won nearly $ 1.5 million in contracts from the New Mexico Finance Authority in 2004 , after which company president and founder David Rubin gave thousands to Richardson , including money that helped underwrite his expenses at that year ’s Democratic National Convention .
Rubin also later gave money to Richardson ’s failed presidential campaign .
The FBI is asking whether members of the governor ’s office asked other state officials to give preferred treatment to CDR .
At a time when Obama ’s own governor is facing criminal charges for , among other things , pay - to - play politics involving the Senate seat the president - elect is vacating , the prospect of headlines alleging similar behavior in New Mexico were enough to imperil Richardson ’s appointment .
Richardson , who was Energy secretary and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton , said he will continue as governor .
The full statements from Obama and Richardson are on the next page .
Obama :
" It is with deep regret that I accept Gov. Bill Richardson 's decision to withdraw his name for nomination as the next secretary of commerce .
Gov. Richardson is an outstanding public servant and would have brought to the job of commerce secretary and our economic team great insights accumulated through an extraordinary career in federal and state office .
It is a measure of his willingness to put the nation first that he has removed himself as a candidate for the Cabinet in order to avoid any delay in filling this important economic post at this critical time .
Although we must move quickly to fill the void left by Gov. Richardson 's decision , I look forward to his future service to our country and in my administration . "
Richardson :
" For nearly three decades , I have been honored to serve my state and our nation in Congress , at the U.N. , as secretary of energy and as governor .
So when the president - elect asked me to serve as Secretary of Commerce , I felt a duty to answer the call .
I felt that duty particularly because America is facing such extraordinary economic challenges .
The Department of Commerce must play an important role in solving them by helping to grow the new jobs and businesses America so badly needs .
" It is also because of that sense of urgency about the work of the Commerce Department that I have asked the president - elect not to move forward with my nomination at this time .
I do so with great sorrow .
But a pending investigation of a company that has done business with New Mexico state government promises to extend for several weeks or , perhaps , even months .
" Let me say unequivocally that I and my administration have acted properly in all matters and that this investigation will bear out that fact .
But I have concluded that the ongoing investigation also would have forced an untenable delay in the confirmation process .
Given the gravity of the economic situation the nation is facing , I could not in good conscience ask the president - elect and his administration to delay for one day the important work that needs to be done .
" So , for now , I will remain in the job I love , governor of New Mexico , and will continue to work every day , with Lt. Gov. Diane Denish , to make a positive difference in the lives of New Mexicans .
I believe she will be a terrific governor in the future .
I appreciate the confidence President - elect Obama has shown in me , and value our friendship and working partnership .
I told him that I am eager to serve in the future in any way he deems useful .
And like all Americans , I pray for his success and the success of our beloved country . "

How to Make Your Own Eye- Popping 3 - D Pictures Reference : http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/3d01.html
Since settling in on the red planet , the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity have sent back a number of 3 - D postcards to countless fans outfitted in red - and blue - tinted spectacles .
To some , the realistic pictures of the rocky martian terrain may seem magical , but the concept behind the illusion is in fact quite simple .
" Basically , 3 - D pictures trick your brain into doing what it does all the time in the real world , " says Zareh Gorjian , a graphic artist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who makes 3 - D pictures and animations of Mars for a living , both the black - and - white kind and the more advanced color versions .
So simple is the trick that , with a little effort , anybody with a camera , a computer equipped with photo - editing software , and a pair of tinted glasses can make their own 3 - D pictures of Mars , family members , pets or anything else worth placing in front of a lens .
Gorjian , who has been toying with the technique for 10 years , transforms all sorts of pictures into 3 - D feasts for the eyes , including his latest vacation photos .
" It 's just fun , " he says .
The key to 3 - D imaging lies in simulating a left and right eye .
For the Mars Exploration Rovers , this is accomplished with the aid of a left and right camera eye .
Images from the rovers ' stereo camera lenses ( either the hazard - avoidance cameras , the navigation cameras or the panoramic cameras ) are tinted in red and blue , then merged into one blurred picture , which pops off the page when viewed through a pair of red - and blue - tinted glasses .
" Your brain thinks it is seeing two separate left and right images and so does what it always does -- combines them into one picture , " says Gorjian .
These basic 3 - D photos are called anaglyphs and work best when viewed in black and white .
Color anaglyphs are trickier because red and blue objects appear only to one eye .
" You give up full color when you use the red and blue glasses , " says Gorjian .
Instead , he and his colleagues at JPL's Multimission Image Processing Laboratory create 3 - D color photos using two sophisticated techniques : polarization and infrared - transmission .
In polarization , the light from left and right eye images is polarized , or made to travel in opposing , perpendicular directions .
In infrared - transmission , left and right eye images are flickered back and forth on a special screen faster than an eye can blink .
Both strategies require specialized glasses for viewing .
Black - and - white 3 - D images do not require fancy tools or equipment and can be snapped and clicked into being by following these directions recommended by Gorjian : Step 1 Start out by picking a subject .
People are a good place to begin because they tend to pop out in 3 - D photos .
Place the subject in a setting with a lot of angles and depth ( not in front of a flat wall ) , and about 10 to 15 feet from the camera .
Hold the camera steady by securing your elbows in your chest and snap a picture .
Make sure your subject stays very still , then step just a tiny bit to the right , about the distance between your eyes or less , and take the same picture .
When you slide over for the second shot , you -- and most importantly your camera -- should move in a parallel line .
Note : If Mars is your subject , the pictures have already been taken for you .
Scan through the raw images on the JPL web site http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov and pick out left and right eye images for your favorite photo ( only images taken by the rovers ' navigation cameras , hazard - avoidance cameras and panoramic cameras come in pairs ) .
The stereo images will look identical , but you can tell if an individual image is from the left or right camera eye by clicking on it and looking at the file name displayed in the web address bar .
Left camera eye image file names will contain the letter " L " four characters in from the end , and right eye image file names will similarly carry an " R . "
Two raw image examples can be found at RIGHT
http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/2/n/043/2N130199337EFF0700P1817R0M1.HTML
and LEFT http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/2/n/043/2N130199337EFF0700P1817L0M1.HTML
Step 2
The next step involves transferring the images into photo - editing software .
Any program will work as long it allows for red , blue and green color channels to be manipulated independently .
The following instructions will refer to Adobe Photoshop .
If your pictures are digital , just open them up in the software .
If your pictures are hardcopies , transfer them to a computer using a scanner , or drop them off at a photo - developing store and ask for digital files ( any file type will work ) .
Step 3
Once the left and right eye pictures are open , convert them both to grayscale by clicking on the ' Image ' menu bar and selecting ' mode ' then ' grayscale ' .
Next , assign the left eye image red , green and blue ( RGB ) channels by going back to the ' Image ' menu bar and selecting ' Mode ' then ' RGB ' ( the image will still appear gray ) .
Do not repeat this step for the right eye image .
Step 4
Now you are ready to merge the left and right images .
To begin , make sure the left eye image is still selected .
Open the channels display menu by clicking on the ' Window ' menu bar and choosing ' channels . '
Highlight the blue and green channels ( press the shift key to highlight both at the same time ) .
Important : only the blue and green channels should be shaded blue .
At this stage it does n't matter which boxes to the left of the channels show eyeballs ( eyeballs indicate which channels are displayed ) .
Step 5
Go back to the right eye image , select the whole thing ( go to ' Select ' menu bar , then press ' all ' ) and copy it ( go to ' Edit ' menu bar , then press ' copy ' ) .
Switch back to the left eye image and paste ( go to ' Edit ' menu bar , then press ' Paste ' ) .
Now , highlight the RGB color channel ; an eyeball should appear in all four channel boxes .
At this point , you should see a blurred red and blue picture .
Step 6
You are almost done .
But first the left and right eye images need to be better aligned .
Start by highlighting only the red channel in the channels display menu ( it should be shaded blue ) .
The next step is crucial because it allows the red - tinted picture to be shifted over while the blue - tinted picture is still visible .
Go to the RGB channel and click only on the square box to the left .
An eyeball should appear in all four boxes , but only the red channel should be shaded .
Now pick a point in the center of the picture to match up ; for example , if a person is your subject , eye pupils are a good target .
Zoom in on the target by selecting the magnifying glass icon in the tool bar then click on the target until it appears fairly large .
Step 7
Next , select the ' move ' tool located in the upper right corner of the tool bar .
Using the up and down arrow keys , slide the red - tinted image over until your target matches up and no longer shows any rings of color .
Step 8
Zoom back out .
Objects toward the outside of your picture should still be haloed in red or blue .
In other words , the overall goal in this step is to limit the colored tints as much as possible .
To cut out excess red or blue at the far edges of your picture , crop it using the crop tool , also located in the tool bar ( once you 've outlined your picture with the tool , go to the ' Image ' menu bar then press ' crop ' ) .
Your creation is ready to be viewed !
Just don your paper glasses ( the left eye should be tinted red ) and watch the picture jump out at you from your monitor screen or a printed picture .
In conclusion ...
This procedure works for people too , but you have to have them stay VERY still while you shoot the pictures !
Failure to Launch : 7 Possible Reasons Why Your Computer Wo n’t Turn On
Close to 90 % of American households — and nearly all businesses — own some sort of a computer or laptop .
But if your computer wo n’t turn on , then you know that sometimes , technology can be anything but convenient .
Before you press a thousand buttons and end up deleting the files or making the problem worse ?
If your PC wo n’t turn on , take a breath and read this post .
In it , we ’ll fill you in on some of the most common reasons why your PC wo n’t power on or why your laptop wo n’t turn on .
We promise you — this can be fixed .
1. Because It ’s Not Powered Properly
Before we get into the more complicated reasons why a PC wo n’t power on or why your laptop wo n’t boot up ?
Let ’s start with something that everyone seems to overlook : the fact that the power supply or charger is n’t actually plugged in .
Yes , we ’re serious .
First , make sure that the socket is completely plugged into the wall , whether it powers a laptop charger or the PC computer .
Also ensure that the charger you ’re using is compatible with your device , and that it is n’t broken or damaged in any way .
Make sure that your power supply is actually working , as well .
If your computer wo n’t turn on after this , then it ’s time to look at other common cases .
2. The Battery Is Dead
Though there are tons of accessories you can get for your computer or laptop , few things are as essential as the actual battery .
If you notice that things work well when your charger is connected to your laptop , but that you ca n’t ever unplug it without your computer dying ?
It ’s likely a sign that you ’re in need of a new battery .
If you can , try to actually take out the battery and see if the laptop is able to turn on when you ’re using only the charger .
If so , then you ’ll know for certain that it ’s time for a battery replacement .
In some cases , you may be able to get a new CMOS battery for as little as ten dollars .
3 . There ’s a Problem With the Motherboard
Next , take a quick look at the motherboard of your computer .
If you own a desktop computer , take a look to be sure that the power switch and the motherboard are actually connected .
You should be on the lookout for a pair of red and black wires .
If the wires are loose or are unplugged , then this is likely the reason behind the computer ’s loss of power .
Plug them in , and things should work .
In some cases , you may need to replace the motherboard on your desktop computer altogether .
Unfortunately , getting a new motherboard for a desktop computer is much easier than getting one for a laptop .
You ’ll need to take your laptop into a professional if it still wo n’t turn on and you think the motherboard is the issue .
4. Because the Computer Keeps Freezing
While in some cases , your PC wo n’t turn on at all , in others , it may turn on , freeze , and then immediately turn itself off again .
This is frustrating , and it may actually mean that you ’re dealing with loose hardware .
This fix is a little more labor - intensive , but serves as a “ last ditch ” effort before you decide to take your laptop or PC into a professional .
First , turn off the computer and wait for 2 - 3 minutes .
Then , reboot your computer .
Make sure that you ’re operating in “ Safe Mode ” during the reboot by hitting the F8 key .
If you ’ve recently installed new software , now is the time to uninstall it .
In some cases , the problem may be fixed here .
But if things persist , you ’ll need to keep going .
You should use a screwdriver to open up the back of your PC , with your hand on the metal at all times to prevent shocks to the system .
Remove the memory card , the graphics card , battery , and wires .
Walk away for five to ten minutes , and then gently put all the parts back in again .
Then , plug the computer back in , and attempt to reboot it .
This should solve your issue .
But if it does n’t …
If Things Still Are n’t Working
So , you ’ve tried all of these things , and your computer wo n’t turn on no matter what you do .
It ’s likely time for you to get the help of a professional , as there might still be a way to save your computer .
You could be dealing with a broken fan in the computer , there could be other internal part errors , or your power supply unit may be altogether broken .
In some cases , the issue could be with your hardware , or even the result of a coding issue , faulty update , a virus or cyber attack , or more technical glitch .
Check out this website to learn what you should look for in computer tune up specialists .
When Your Computer Wo n’t Turn On : Wrapping Up
We hope that this post has helped you to understand some of the most common reasons why your computer wo n’t turn on .
Whether you ’re dealing with a poor connection , internal parts issue , or something else altogether , do n’t lose hope until you take it into a professional if the problem persists .
Of course , if you ’ve damaged , spilled something on , or dropped your computer or laptop — or if it ’s just old — it could be time for a new one .

LOS ANGELES , Jan. 31 ( UPI ) --
Fans of Girl Scout cookies in cities like Los Angeles will find smaller cookies in each box despite the price staying the same , a Girl Scout official says .
Carol Dedrich , a Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles spokeswoman , said the organization decided to shrink their cookies instead of increasing the cost of their traditional product , The Los Angeles Daily News said Friday .

Dedrich said the cookie boxes themselves will also be smaller this year , but their cost will remain at $ 4 despite the changes .
The changes in the cookie products will likely serve as a good lesson for Girl Scouts nationwide , the spokeswoman added .
" The focus of the cookie program is not just about selling cookies , " Dedrich told the Daily News .
" It 's about teaching the girls how to market , develop budgets and provide good customer service .
...
This is a great opportunity for the girls to truly understand how the economy affects everyone and everything in business . "
Mr Obama lifted the controversial funding ban in his first week in office The Vatican has condemned President Obama 's move to restore US funding for family planning clinics abroad that give advice on or carry out abortions .
One Vatican official warned against the " arrogance " of those in power who think they can decide between life and death .
Another official said it dealt a blow to groups fighting against " the slaughter of the innocents " .
The White House says the move aligns the US with other nations fighting poverty and promoting health care .
On Friday , Mr Obama ended a ban on giving US federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information about them .
Robust language
In an interview published in an Italian newspaper on Saturday , senior Vatican official Monsignor Rino Fisichella urged Mr Obama to listen to all voices in America without " the arrogance of those who , being in power , believe they can decide of life and death . "
" If this is one of President Obama 's first acts , I have to say , in all due respect , that we 're heading quickly toward disappointment , " Mr Fisichella , who heads the Vatican 's Pontifical Academy for Life , told the Corriere della Sera .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It should be the right of all women of the world to take decisions such as this .
Joy , Switzerland Another Academy official , Monsignor Elio Sgreccia , said it had dealt a harsh blow to US Catholics and people across the world who are fighting against " the slaughter of the innocents " .
The criticism from the Vatican adds to concerns from evangelical Protestant groups that the US decision could presage a wider dismantling of the legal limits of abortion .
Critics of the former funding ban had long argued that it hurt some of the poorest people in the world by denying money to groups that might support abortion , but also work on other aspects of reproductive health care or HIV / Aids .
The ban was first introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan .
It was rescinded by President Bill Clinton , before being reinstated by President George W Bush in 2001 .

New Hybrid Nanostructures Detect Nanoscale Magnetism
Research could pave way for new data storage devices , drug delivery systems
A key challenge of nanotechnology research is investigating how different materials behave at lengths of merely one - billionth of a meter .
When shrunk to such tiny sizes , many everyday materials exhibit interesting and potentially beneficial new properties .
Magnetic behavior is one such phenomenon that can change significantly depending on the size of the material .
However , the sheer challenge of observing the magnetic properties of nanoscale material has impeded further study of the topic .
Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have developed and demonstrated a new method for detecting the magnetic behaviors of nanomaterials .
They created a new process for creating a single multi-walled carbon nanotube that is embedded with cobalt nanostructures .
The cobalt clusters measure from 1 nanometer to 10 nanometers .
After a series of experiments , the research team has concluded that the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes is sensitive enough to detect and be affected by trace amounts of magnetic activity , such as those present in the embedded cobalt nanostructures .
It is believed to be the first instance of demonstrating the detection of magnetic fields of such small magnets using an individual carbon nanotube .
Results of the study were reported in the paper “ Detection of Nanoscale Magnetic Activity Using a Single Carbon Nanotube ” recently published by Nano Letters .
“ Since the cobalt clusters in our system are embedded inside the nanotube rather than on the surface , they do not cause electron scattering and thus do not seem to impact the attractive conductive properties of the host carbon nanotube , ” said Swastik Kar , research assistant professor in Rensselaer ’s Department of Physics , Applied Physics , & Astronomy , who led the project .
“ From a fundamental point of view , these hybrid nanostructures belong to a new class of magnetic materials . ”
“ These novel hybrid nanostructures open up new avenues of research in fundamental and applied physics , and pave the way for increased functionality in carbon nanotube electronics utilizing the magnetic degree of freedom that could give rise to important spintronics applications , ” said Saroj Nayak , an associate professor in Rensselaer ’s Department of Department of Physics , Applied Physics , and Astronomy , who also contributed to the project .
Potential applications for such a material include new generations of nanoscale conductance sensors , along with new advances in digital storage devices , spintronics , and selective drug delivery components .
Co-authors of the paper include Caterina Soldano , formerly a graduate student at Rensselaer who is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Centre d’Elaboration de Matériaux et d’Etudes Structurales in Tolouse , France ; Professor Saikat Talapatra of the Physics Department of Southern Illinois University , Carbondale ; and Prof. P.M. Ajayan of the Rice University Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science .
Researchers received funding for the project from the New York State Interconnect Focus Center at Rensselaer .

In addition to being a complex , beautiful and rapidly changing country , we ’ve all heard that China is a copyright lawyer ’s worst nightmare .
A place rife with pirated DVD ’s , software and all manner of luxury clothing and handbag knockoffs .
It seems that pirated goods have become such a lucrative industry that the country is now dedicating an entire mall to the concept .
According to recent news reports , a mall in Nanjing , China is set to open with all manner of “ copycat ” stores , sporting awnings with none - too - subtle reinterpretations of well - known Western brands .
If you ’re looking for your morning pick - me - up , go no further than “ Bucksstar ” coffee , the place for all your $ 5 latte needs in Nanjing .
When you get hungry , mall visitors can patronize the local “ OMC McDnoald ’s ” or even grab some “ Pizza Huh . ”
Perhaps the pizza chain name is in reference to the quality of the ingredients ?
When I first stumbled upon this article , I actually did a half - spit take .
Could this be legit , I thought ?
Yet in a country with a rapidly emerging consumer class and growing lust for fancy French wine and gated communities , it starts to make more sense .
For many individuals , owning and consuming brands legitimizes their place in the world , announcing their ascension to the modern global economy .
The creators of this mall in Nanjing seem to have come to a similar conclusion – even a knockoff of the real thing , no matter how awkward and blatant to Western eyes , is better than no brands at all .

Advertisement Israeli jets have attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth day , with raids on a number of Hamas government buildings and security installations .
Air strikes early on Tuesday killed at least 10 people , medical officials in the coastal enclave said .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for an immediate ceasefire and condemned both Israel and Hamas .
About 320 Palestinians have died since Saturday , the UN says .
Four Israelis have been killed by rockets from Gaza .
One was a soldier , the first member of the military to die since the current fighting began .
While recognising Israel 's right to defend itself from militant rocket attacks , Mr Ban condemned its " excessive use of force " .
See detailed map of attacks " The suffering caused to civilian populations as a result of the large - scale violence and destruction that have taken place over the past few days has saddened me profoundly , " he said .
' Bitter end '
Forty people were said to have been wounded in Tuesday 's raids , which targeted Hamas - run offices and security installations , Palestinian officials said .

Meanwhile , an Israeli naval vessel has blocked pro-Palestinian activists trying to carry medical aid to Gaza by sea and escorted their boat back to Cyprus .
The two vessels collided during the incident , causing damage to both boats but no injuries .
The activists said the naval vessel had rammed them after they ignored warning shots fired across their bow .
Israel 's defence chief earlier said his country was fighting a " war to the bitter end " against Hamas .
The UN says at least 62 of the Palestinians killed so far have been women and children .
Israel has massed forces along the boundary with Gaza and has declared the area around it a " closed military zone " .
Correspondents say the move - in addition to the call - up of thousands of reservists - could be a prelude to ground operations , but could also be intended to build pressure on Hamas .
The Red Cross earlier described the situation in Gaza 's hospitals as chaotic , with medical teams " stretched to the limit " .
Trucks laden with medical aid have been permitted to cross into Gaza from Egypt at the Rafah crossing .
European Union foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Paris later ( 1730 GMT ) to discuss the escalating crisis .
The meeting , hosted by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , is expected to consider the idea of an humanitarian aid corridor , and how to bring additional aid to Gaza .
Angry protests Dozens of Hamas centres , including security compounds , government offices and tunnels into Egypt , have been hit since Israel started its massive bombing campaign on Saturday morning .
US tacitly backs Israeli offensive Aid worker diary : Gaza raids Rocket attacks plague Israeli towns Israel says its aim is to end the rocket attacks by Hamas - linked militants - of which there were reportedly more than 40 on Monday .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak said Israel wanted to deal Hamas a " severe blow " and its operation would be " widened and deepened as needed " .
The US - Israel 's strongest ally - said the onus was on Hamas to end the violence and commit itself to a truce , but there have been angry protests against the offensive in many cities across the Arab world and in several European capitals .
The strikes began less than a week after the expiry of a six - month - long ceasefire deal with Hamas , which has controlled Gaza since 2007 .
Israel withdrew in 2005 but has kept tight control over access in and out of Gaza and its airspace .

( CNN ) --
The mayor of Portland , Oregon , publicly apologized Tuesday for lying about a sexual relationship he had with an 18 - year - old male in 2005 , and for asking the teen to lie about it .
" This was a serious error that happened about four years ago , " Portland Mayor Sam Adams tells reporters .
" I want to apologize to the people of Portland for my dishonesty and for embarrassing them , " Mayor Sam Adams , a Democrat , said at an afternoon news conference .
But the mayor -- who is openly gay and whose election last year possibly made Portland the largest U.S. city to elect an openly gay mayor -- said he has no plans to resign .
" This was a serious error that happened about four years ago , " Adams said .
" My job now is to come clean -- I mucked it up -- and to press forward . "
Adams returned to Portland from Washington , where he had planned to attend the inauguration of President Barack Obama , to hold the news conference .
A day earlier , Adams issued a statement saying : " In the past , I have characterized my relationship with Beau Breedlove as purely nonsexual .
That is not true .
Beau Breedlove and I had a sexual relationship for a few months in the summer of 2005 after he turned 18 years of age . "
Adams issued the statement Monday after a local newspaper , the Willamette Week , published a story about the relationship between Adams , who was a city commissioner in 2005 , and Breedlove , then a legislative intern .
During the mayoral campaign , questions had emerged about whether Adams and Breedlove had a sexual relationship .
Adams said he had lied about the relationship during the campaign , and had asked Breedlove to lie , because of " untrue rumors being circulated saying that I had broken the law regarding sex relations with a minor . "
" The allegation coming at me was ' sex with a minor , ' " Adams said .
" But still , I should have told the truth at the time and taken the consequences . "
The relationship was consensual and " although inappropriate , was legal , " Adams said .
Do n't Miss KPTV : Portland mayor pressured to resign
" I'm the one that should be held accountable .
I 'm the older adult , " he said .
Adams was 42 and Breedlove was 17 when the two met , according to the Willamette newspaper .
Adams emphasized that what he called a " romantic " relationship with Breedlove did not begin until after Breedlove was 18 .
Adams said the two had " maybe three or four dates " over two or three months in 2005 before the relationship ended .
The mayor apologized to Breedlove for asking him to lie , and to Portland 's gay community " for embarrassing them . "
It was not clear whether Breedlove was in attendance at Tuesday 's news conference .
Adams said that " this is fundamentally an issue of a public official lying . "
" I do n't think this fundamentally is an issue about sexual orientation , " he said .
" Other people can debate that but , for me , it 's about an error in judgment and then seeking to make amends for that and being very up - front about the mistake and then carrying on , " he said .
Asked by a reporter if he lied to get elected , Adams said : " I definitely lied to avoid what I thought was another lie that I could n't overcome .
So , in a way , yes . "
Asked if he had thought he could get away with lying , Adams responded : " I think that 's going to be up to my colleagues and the people of Portland . "

He said it was likely to have been formed by a volcanic eruption up to 1,800 years ago .
Doing the following mortgage mistakes throughout the mortgage procedure can have a few massive disadvantages .
Being denied for a loan or delayed closings because of the following mortgage mistakes is something that we need to prevent committing at all costs .
The key to being successful is to get information .
Hence , you need to guarantee to know the following mistakes and avoid them :
Failing to get pre-approved before shopping for a house
Deciding and starting to shop for a home even without getting pre-approved for a house loan will just place you in an advantageous position .
A lot of realtors ask their customers to be pre-approved before taking them to home openings .
Moreover , sellers are much less likely to get an offer from a prospective buyer who has n’t secured a pre-approval for financing .
So , we highly recommend that you should get pre-approved with the help of a reputable and trusted Las Vegas mortgage company .
Changing jobs amid the mortgage process
Your income and employment are the major aspects when it comes to assessing and calculating your mortgage .
A change in your employment can mean beginning a new mortgage application , and the process over and over .
The best thing to do is to wait for your loan to be closed before changing jobs .
Also , secure savings that can aid you to maintain and cope up with your financial responsibilities during the moments of job changes .
Not paying your bills or taxes
Though this might be obvious , documentation is needed to prove that you ’re updated on any state property tax or federal income taxes before your application for a mortgage can be approved .
If you have unpaid bills , it can affect your credit score .
Also , your loan might be denied when you missed a bill payment within the duration of the mortgage process and you have a bad credit score .
Providing misinformation during the application
The greatest means for a mortgage provider to provide you the precise and right qualification , mortgage process timeline , and assessment of your probable interest rate is to know and determine what your financial outlook and goals are as great as they can .
When vital data will be inaccurate or left out during the initial application , there ’s a possibility that your loan will either be denied or delayed during the mortgage process ’ underwriting phase .
So as much as possible , you need to double - check and make sure that everything ’s filled up with only the correct information .
Neglecting to ask questions
You should always ask questions and never forget about this .
Your chosen mortgage provider will definitely assist you to know every step of the mortgage process and your greatest mortgage options you can avail of .
Make sure to ask and reach out to your mortgage consultant if ever you have any concerns or clarifications in mind throughout the mortgage process .
