The company lists Red Hat and Canonical as competitors to Windows on PCs in an SEC filing
Microsoft for the first time has named Linux distributors Red Hat and Canonical as competitors to its Windows client business in its annual filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
The move is an acknowledgment of the first viable competition from Linux to Microsoft 's Windows client business , due mainly to the use of Linux on netbooks , which are rising in prominence as alternatives to full - sized notebooks .
" Netbooks opened Microsoft to the possibility that some other OS could get its grip on the desktop , however briefly , " said Rob Helm , director of research for Directions on Microsoft .
" Now it 's alert to that possibility going forward . "
In its annual Form 10 - K report for the fiscal year ended June 30 , Microsoft cited Red Hat and Canonical -- the latter of which maintains the Ubuntu Linux distribution -- as competitors to its client business , which includes the desktop version of its Windows OS .
Previously , Microsoft had only noted competition from Red Hat to its Server and Tools business , which includes the Windows Server version of the OS for server hardware , in its 10 - K reports .
" Client faces strong competition from well - established companies with differing approaches to the PC market , " Microsoft said in the filing .
" Competing commercial software products , including variants of Unix , are supplied by competitors such as Apple , Canonical , and Red Hat . "
The filing goes on to note , in a thinly veiled reference to netbooks , that Linux has gained what Microsoft characterizes as " some acceptance " as an alternative client OS to Windows , in particular in " emerging markets " where " competitive pressures lead OEMs to reduce costs and new , lower - price PC form - factors gain adoption . "
It also mentions the work of Microsoft 's own OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) partners Hewlett - Packard and Intel to support Linux on PCs .
Seattle - based blogger Todd Bishop called attention to Microsoft 's acknowledged change to the competitive landscape in a blog post on the TechFlash Microsoft Blog .
He also posted a link to Microsoft 's 10 - K filing .
While Linux on servers is a well - established market among business customers , Linux as a viable alternative to Windows on PCs has never taken off .
However , the emergence of the netbook as a low - cost , smaller form factor to the traditional notebook PC has certainly changed that , so much so that Microsoft lately has been pushing a lightweight notebook as an alternative to netbooks , Helm said .
" Microsoft would like the netbook to go away and be replaced by lightweight laptops -- ones with long battery life that cost enough to justify running full Windows on them , " he said .
Helm added that Microsoft is trying to discourage the production of inexpensive computers where Windows becomes the most expensive component because it can't make as much money on Windows on these devices , and they could drive down the price of Windows .
Microsoft 's current Windows client OS , Windows Vista , had too large a hardware footprint and was too expensive for netbooks , giving Linux an opening in that market when it emerged late last year .
However , Microsoft 's eight - year - old Windows XP OS is still the dominant system for netbooks , and the release of Windows 7 in October will feature a Starter Edition that is especially geared toward that market as well .

The Obama Administration argued strenuously on Monday that the Supreme Court ’s 2008 decision providing a right for imprisoned terrorism suspects to challenge their captivity does not apply to “ approximately 600 long - term detainees ” now being held by the U.S. military in Afghanistan .
“ Habeas rights under the United States Constitution , ” government lawyers argued in a 64 - page legal brief , “ do not extend to anemy aliens detained in the active war zone at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan . ”
The new brief can be downloaded here .
It was filed in the D.C. Circuit Court , in Maqaleh , et al. , v. Gates , et al. ( lead case docket 09 - 5265 ) , seeking to overturn a federal judge ’s ruling that the Justices ’ ruling in Boumediene v. Bush does apply to at least three prisoners at Bagram .
The three are Fadi Al Magaleh and Amin Al Bakri , both Yemenis , and Redha al - Najar , a Tunisian .
The arguments rely primarily upon the government ’s interpretation of Boumediene itself , as well as a post - World War II precedent — Johnson v. Eisentrager ( 1950 ) .
The legal contentions are summarized beginning at numbered page 18 of the main document that is linked above .
In an Addendum , the Administration provides documents spelling out new procedural arrangements at Bagram for reviewing the continuing detention of the individuals held there .
The Circuit Court is reviewing a decision last April by District Judge John D. Bates opening habeas rights to non-Afghans captured outside of Afghanistan but now held at the Bagram detention facility run by the U.S. military at an airbase 40 miles from Kabul .
He found that the Supreme Court ’s Boumediene decision , although written to cover only the situation at Guantanamo Bay , outlined principles that would apply to other detention sites where the U.S. has a strong degree of control .
In the new Administration brief , it argued simply that Judge Bates was wrong about Boumediene .
That ruling , it contended , was narrow in scope , confined to Guantanamo ’s situation .
It would be an “ unwarranted extension of such a singular precedent , ” the brief said , to extend it “ from the peaceful locale of Guantanamo to the war - torn zone of Afghanistan … .
Bagram Airfield is in the middle of an active theater of war …Bagram is fundamentally different from the ‘ isolated ’ military base at Guantanamo . ”
“ This is the paradigmatic case , ” it added , “ in which lower courts should tread cautiously in extending a new and unprecedented Supreme Court decision beyond the specific contextin which it was announced . ”
The Court in Boumediene “ made clear that its decision was dependent on the extraordinary nature of the United States presence in Guantanamo . ”
The Administration disputed Judge Bates ’ finding that the lack of adequate procedural safeguards for those held at Bagram should be taken into account in determining whether the prisoners there should have habeas rights .
The method for judging who must remain confined at Bagram , the brief asserted , has nothing to do with the basic question of whether the constitutional right of habeas should apply there .
But , to the extent that the procedures for deciding on detention at Bagram do make a legal difference , the brief stressed that the government was increasing the legal options for prisoners there to challenge their ongoing confinement .
Those new procedures , it added , “ address [ Judge Bates ’ ] concerns .
Those procedures , which it said will go into effect this month after a waiting period for review by Congress , “ support , rather than undermine , ” the conclusion that the Bagram detainees do not have a constitutional right of habeas .
To bolster its contention that Boumediene should not reach to Bagram , the government filing said that , to do so , would make it possible for individuals held by the U.S. military anywhere in the world to go into U.S. courts to challenge their detention abroad , so long as they were held in a country other than their own .
The brief expresses mild resentment over Judge Bates ’ suggestion that the U.S. military may be using the Bagram prison site as a way to put detainees beyond the reach of American civilian courts .
“ The court ’s fears of Executive abuse were not justified , ” it said .
“ When the U.S. Government holds someone for an extended peiod of time at Bagram , it does so of necessity , not because of whim or convenience … .
The United States has no interest in holding detainees longer than necessary . ”
Lawyers for the three non-Afghan detainees involved in the case are to file their merits brief on Oct. 30 .
The Administration ’s reply is due Nov. 16 .
No date has been set for oral argument in the Circuit Court .

IF YOU want to know why carbon - fibre planes such as the Boeing 787 are still on the tarmac , it ’s worth rewinding to the 1950s .
That ’s when the UK ’s chances of dominating the post - war aviation market were dashed by fatal in - flight failures of the de Havilland Comet , the first airliner to sport a pressurised aluminium fuselage .
Metal fatigue induced by repeated pressurisation cycles created cracks that started around the plane ’s window frames .
“ Although much was known about metal fatigue , not enough was known about it by anyone , anywhere , ” lamented Geoffrey de Havilland in his autobiography .
Such are …
Sony teased Final Fantasy XIV and The Last Guardian .
Microsoft trotted out new Halo games .
Nintendo laid down Mario and Metroid .
Everyone sang to the rafters at last week 's E3 about motion controls .
And in the end , despite recessive economics , no one budged an inch on pricing .
Sony even had the audacity to announce its new diet - handheld -- the PlayStation Portable Go--for $ 250 , eighty bucks more than its $ 170 PSP - 3000 for " smaller , " " lighter , " Bluetooth , 16GB of local storage , and extrication of the UMD disc drive .
Is miniaturization worth that much ?
You tell me .
And no , the new downloadable games wo n't be cheaper -- they 'll be priced same as the UMD ones were .
At least one major game publisher weighed in disappointedly .
Activision CEO Bobby Kotick told Bloomberg : " Of all the things that the hardware companies need to be doing right now , it ’s recognizing the difficulties of the economy and pricing their hardware appropriately . "
GameStop CEO
Dan DeMatteo echoed Kotick 's comments in a conference call : " The hardware price points , where they are right now given this economic environment , are too high ... if the platform holders are going to make the numbers that they ’ve forecasted for the year , those numbers will have to change . "
What about the other guys ?
It 's hard to criticize Nintendo , whose $ 250 Wii may be priced high given its low manufacturing costs , but whose sales have -- up until now -- justified its position .
And while Microsoft may be gouging consumers on its peripheral costs ( $ 100 Wi-Fi ? $ 150 for 120 GB ? ) , they dodge system price criticism by unbundling everything and easing your upfront investment .
Sony 's position ?
" We ’re very happy with the price point that we have , " said games division honcho Kaz Hirai at E3 , adding the company " will move when we think it 's appropriate at some point in time . "
Defenders of Sony 's position ?
" It 's the profit - margins , stupid . "
With manufacturing costs still surpassing retail pricing as recently as May , the PS3 remains a loss leader for Sony .
If you 're selling $ 50 short , losing $ 500 k on a hundred thousand units is a lot easier to swallow than $ 50 m on a million .
Sony advocates say the company 's simply waiting until the system passes a certain cost - threshold , and while the PS3's consistently placed last in domestic hardware and software sales since its release , it 's actually been gaining sales ground over the last 12 months , relative to the competition .
Rumors of a cheaper PS3 Slim ?
Price cutting to follow , finally , end - of - summer ?
Where the so - called expert analysts have been flatly wrong , laymen need n't dogmatize .
I 'm giving up second - guessing .
With Sony 's compelling 2009 entertainment lineup at odds with hardware pricing and consumer spending , the company will either turn out to be the turtle - -" slow and steadfast wins the race , " or the mule - -" sedate and stubborn loses it . "
For all our sake 's , let 's hope it 's the former .

A proposed solar energy project in the California desert that caused intense friction between environmentalists and the developers of renewable energy has been shelved .
BrightSource Energy Inc. had planned a 5,130 - acre solar power farm in a remote part of the Mojave Desert , on land previously intended for conservation .
The company , based in Oakland , Calif. , said Thursday that it was instead seeking an alternative site for the project .
The Wildlands Conservancy , a California environmental group , had tried to block the solar development , as had Senator Dianne Feinstein , Democrat of California , who proposed that the area become a national monument .
The land was donated by Wildlands to the Interior Department during the Clinton administration , with assurances from President Bill Clinton himself , the group says , that it would be protected in perpetuity .
But the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , a Bush administration initiative , opened the land to the development of solar projects .
Long ago , many plants evolved their own natural pesticides – chemical compounds that repel or kill would - be herbivores .
Not quite as long ago , humankind learned to use some of these plants for aromatic , medicinal , and flavor - enhancing purposes .
We call them spices .
Now , scientists are looking into using spices and herbs for their evolved purpose – to protect against interlopers on human - cultivated crops .
Presenting at the American Chemical Society ’s 238th national meeting in Washington , Murray Isman , a professor of agroecology at the University of British Columbia , Vancouver , describes his research into clove , thyme , and mint , among other plants , for possible use as pesticides .
Different herbs and spices have different protective properties .
Some kill insects directly , others simply alter their behavior – dissuading females , say , from laying eggs on a plant .
Rosemary and thyme have antifungal properties ; they protect against powdery mildew .
Clove and citrus keep other plants , or weeds , at bay .
The natural pesticides would offer several advantages compared with conventional ones .
First , they do n’t need to go through the time - and resource - intensive approval process of regulatory agencies .
It ’s also possible that insects , which often evolve resistance to conventional pesticides over time , ca n’t adapt as quickly to these compounds .
They ’re more complex than human - manufactured pesticides , which hinder pest adaptation , says Isman .
What ’s more , the compounds are not toxic to the farmers who apply them .
And they can be used in organic - ­certified agriculture .
The potential downside of spicy pesticides is that essential oils degrade quickly in sunlight .
Using them will probably require more applications than what ’s required by conventional pesticides .

In his most extensive interview since Barack Obama took office , former president Bill Clinton predicts that Obama will win passage of health - care reform , urging the Democratic party to " stand and deliver " while the Republicans are " in la-la land . "
Endorsing Obama 's push for health legislation , Clinton tells Esquire executive editor Mark Warren that Democrats should ignore opposition from the GOP .
" The president 's doing the right thing .
It is both morally and politically right , " Clinton says .
" I would n't even worry about the Republicans .
I 'd worry about executing .
'' Do I think he 's doing the right thing , even though he 's jamming a lot of change down the system ?
I do , " Clinton says .
" So there 's a lot that 's like my first year , but it 's going to have a different ending — he 's going to get health - care reform . "
In the interview , which appears in the October 2009 issue of Esquire , the former president also talks candidly about his own efforts to reform health care fifteen years ago , about the Supreme Court decision that resolved the 2000 election , about the state of the Republican Party and the prospect for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections .
Highlights from Esquire 's exclusive interview :
On Obama 's Health - Care Plan
" What I 'm more worried about is our people getting careless , forgetting the experience of ' 94 , and that it is imperative that they produce a health - care bill for the president and make it the best one they can ; if it 's not perfect , we 'll go back and fix it .
But the people hire you to deliver . "
" This electorate has suffered .
They 've suffered economically , they 've suffered an enormous amount of sort of psychic insecurity from 9/11 to the economic breakdown , they 've seen all this change going on around them , and they see in Obama a cool and intelligent guy who can multitask in a world where they know you 've got to multitask .
What they do n't know is whether our guys are going to stand and deliver .
And sooner or later you 've got to stand and deliver .
All we have to worry about is getting things done and doing them as well as we can .
Do n't even worry about the Republicans .
Let them figure out what they 're going to stand for .
' Cause as long as they 're sitting around waiting for us to mess up , they do n't have a chance . "
On the Defeat of His Own Health - Care Plan
" Almost everything anyone today writes about this stuff is wrong .
It 's a classic example of how in a war , the victors get to write history .
" Basically , everybody who writes about this stuff today repeats the health - insurance lobby 's line from 1994 .
Like : " The bill was long and complicated . "
The bill took out four hundred more pages of federal law than it put in .
They say we forced a bill on Congress — untrue .
I asked Congress to write the bill , and Chairman [ Dan ] Rostenkowski [ of the House Ways and Means Committee ] demanded that Hillary send him a bill — a complete bill .
He said , " I wo n't take it up if you do n't .
We do n't know enough about it , the interest groups will eat us alive , we 'll modify your bill , but you 've gotta send us a whole bill . "
It was the demand of the most important committee in the House of Representatives .
And yet I 've read over a hundred stories saying what a terrible mistake we made , it was all our doing .
We did what Congress asked us to do .
We also got two bills out of two committees for the first time ever .
Harry Truman tried to do this , Richard Nixon tried to do it , Lyndon Johnson did n't even try , with the biggest congressional majority in history .
He did n't even try — he quit at Medicare and Medicaid , because he knew how hard it was ... "
" And we now know , and I 'm surer of this than anything :
We just could n't do [ health - care reform ] as long as Bob Dole was running for president .
He 's a good guy , and he 's a friend of mine , and the whole time I dealt with him , the only time he was not as good as his word was on this .
After Rostenkowski had asked for a bill , I personally asked Bob in the Cabinet Room if we could sit down and write a bill together and send a joint bill to the Congress .
Because he was really good on health care for a Republican , cared about it , and he said , ' You know , you need to send a bill in and we need to produce a bill , so that people know there are differences between the two parties and our approaches .
Then we 'll get together and compromise it out . '
When he said that , I think he believed it .
Then he gets Bill Kristol 's famous memo that says , you know , If you let Bill Clinton pass any kind of health - care bill , the Democrats will be the majority party for a generation , and you can forget about your presidential hopes .
Your only option is to beat anything .
Kill it off . "
On Republican Attacks on Obama
" The thing that I think is wrong and dumb about this is that they 're in la-la land about this ' Where was Obama born ? ' and all that kind of stuff , and I think it sounds like an old record with a bad scratch in it .
" Look , as a Democrat , let them have at it .
But for America 's sake , what they should be doing is saying , ' Why are n't they buying what we 're selling ? '
First of all , nothing lasts forever , no theory of the case lasts forever , time moves on .
So their message wo n't fly because the circumstances of America are different , the demography of America is different , the psychology of America is different ...
It 's so plainly out of whack with what you perceive the reality of the day and the challenges that we face .
We 've got 9 percent of all eligible homeowners in America having their mortgages rewritten — 9 percent — and you 're talking to me about where Obama was born ?
Give me a break .
I mean it 's like , what is this ?
" As Democrats , we should let them wander around in this wilderness as long as they 'd like .
We still have a serious responsibility to pass health - care legislation , to pass climate - change legislation , keep working around the edges on this economic crisis , do something that will work on this home - owners thing .
We 've got to do something that will really get us there .
And support the President .
Do something that will really get this stuff done and then be willing to be judged by the consequences of what we do . "
On the 2000 Election
" George Bush ran a brilliant campaign in 2000 — that compassionate - conservative thing was just brilliant — and it got him close enough that he got into the Supreme Court and they issued what I think is one of the five most reprehensible decisions in the history of the Supreme Court .
And they were embarrassed about it , because if you read the decision , it says , ' Now , unlike our other decisions , this has no precedential value ; you can never cite this decision in any other case for the rest of eternity , this is only a one - off . '
I mean , they know better .
They knew better than to do what they were doing — it was just a pure , naked political deal , but anyway , it happened and Gore was a good man and he honored the traditions of America and he thought the principle of judicial review and the role of the Supreme Court was important enough not to attack it , and he took it in good grace . "
On the Alternate History of the 2000 Election
" I think if Al Gore had become president ... first of all , let me inject a little humility here :
No one knows .
But for example , as Colin Powell said when he was secretary of state , our policies with North Korea had led us back from the brink , and we were on the verge of getting a total ban on these missile flights and completing the total denuclearization of the peninsula .
I expect that would 've happened , and if that had happened , I think it is highly likely that the kind of tensions we 've seen in the past few months , including the situation involving those two young women , they might not have happened . "
" I think he would 've had a much more vigorous Securities and Exchange Commission .
Could some of this have still happened ?
Maybe , but we were up on some of this in 2000 , up on Capitol Hill , warning that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were getting overexposed , and their real problems did n't happen until four years after that .
So I think whatever happened in the economic downturn would 've been less .
I 'm reluctant , because I was not there , to talk about the run-up to 9/11 , but I can always say this :
Al Gore was hypervigilant in his following of the intelligence reports and very solid in his understanding of the defense and security policy , and I think he would 've done a really good job .
I think that he would have been reluctant to fight a war on two fronts ; I think he would 've tried to finish the business with Al Qaeda and Afghanistan and let the UN inspectors finish what they were doing in Iraq .
So yeah , it would 've been a very different time . "

In early August , forty - eight hours after returning from a sensitive mission to North Korea that freed the American journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling , Bill Clinton ambles into the sitting room of his house in Chappaqua , New York , in jeans and sneakers .
About to turn sixty - three , looking fit and a little bleary from the week 's exertions , he sits down to talk about the legacy of his presidency .
The occasion is a new book by Pulitzer - winning writer Taylor Branch , who met in secret with Clinton at the White House starting in October 1993 , and almost every month of his presidency thereafter .
The Clinton Tapes : Wrestling History with the President will be published in October .
Clinton has now been out of office longer than he was in , and his perspective on that time is what we 've come to talk about .
But his views on the present quickly asserted themselves as well .
ESQUIRE : Nine years ago , just as your presidency was coming to an end , you told Esquire that you described one of your achievements as a return to presidential activism .
Can you give us your assessment of that activism now , with the perspective of time ?
BILL CLINTON : I think that 's still true , and I also thought my presidency rescued the reputation of government .
Keep in mind , the Republican ascendancy in national politics that began with Nixon 's election in ' 68 really began with their massive gains in the congressional races in 1966 and was based in the beginning on the social debate — the silent majority , the tensions over race , over the war , with women , all of those things .
Then when Reagan came along , he reinforced all that but also had a wholesale assault on government .
The EPA was terrible , trees actually caused pollution ; the Agriculture Department was crazy , ketchup was a vegetable .
The whole idea was that government would mess up a two - car parade , therefore the only thing it was good for was cutting taxes , laying concrete , and supporting the Defense Department .
And so they had this — it was more nuanced than that of course — but the whole idea was to divide the American electorate in ways that worked to their advantage and then make the people deeply suspicious of anything the government did .
So then what I tried to do was take the rhetoric they had used and flip it to show that they said they were for a balanced budget , but they actually quadrupled the deficit , the debt of the country ; they said they hated government waste , but look at the waste of the Defense Department , and that we could actually have a smaller , more efficient , but far more active government that dealt with the problems of the late twentieth century .
And I tried to promote a vision of reconciliation and community that would go behind their politics of division .
And I tried to reverse the income inequality that had been getting much worse since the 1970s .
In a funny way , their policies made it worse , but that helped their larger argument that government could n't do anything .
So I was essentially trying to launch a new progressive era by reigniting government activism tailored to the realities of the late twentieth century .
And to get us pointing into this new era in a way that would bring people together both politically and economically and put the country back in a position to lead the world for peace and prosperity .
And I think , you know , we did pretty well with that .
We had this huge reaction election in ' 94 because they were n't over their government cynicism and the turnout was low , and the Democrats , you know , we could n't pass health - care reform for the simple reason that the Republicans had a filibuster - proof margin in the Senate .
Incidentally , almost everything anyone today writes about this stuff is wrong .
It 's a classic example of how in a war , the victors get to write history .
Basically , everybody who writes about this stuff today repeats the health - insurance lobby 's line from 1994 .
Like : " The bill was long and complicated . "
The bill took out four hundred more pages of federal law than it put in .
They say we forced a bill on Congress — untrue .
I asked Congress to write the bill , and Chairman [ Dan ] Rostenkowski [ of the House Ways and Means Committee ] demanded that Hillary send him a bill — a complete bill .
He said , " I wo n't take it up if you do n't .
We do n't know enough about it , the interest groups will eat us alive , we 'll modify your bill , but you 've gotta send us a whole bill . "
It was the demand of the most important committee in the House of Representatives .
And yet I 've read over a hundred stories saying what a terrible mistake we made , it was all our doing .
We did what Congress asked us to do .
We also got two bills out of two committees for the first time ever .
Harry Truman tried to do this , Richard Nixon tried to do it , Lyndon Johnson did n't even try , with the biggest congressional majority in history .
He did n't even try — he quit at Medicare and Medicaid , because he knew how hard it was .
And so I think I had difficulties , but I think , in general , we restored people 's faith in government .
ESQ : It does seem like the 1990s was the last time that America truly felt good about itself , that there was not a problem that was beyond our reach .
So far in the twenty - first century , we have not necessarily felt that our destiny was ours to determine .
BC : Yeah , well , people believed in possibilities .
And almost more than any specific achievement , I thought that was the most important thing .
I thought that it was really important to give the American people a sense of what the twenty - first century would be like , what its challenges would be like and what its opportunities would be like , and then to convince them that we could in fact meet them .
I think what breaks people is not adversity ; what breaks people is thinking that tomorrow is going to be just like yesterday .
That 's what 's numbing — if you think you can't change , you can't be better .
And I did n't like that .
There was an underlying cynicism , like I said , and we had some horrible , horrible incidents .
Not just Oklahoma City , but all the survivalists in Michigan , all that .
But in the end , you can't love your country and hate your government .
You can criticize your country — that 's every American 's God - given right and 100 percent of us have done it .
But I really believe that eventually , we were going to become a country that was not necessarily more liberal but was more communitarian , with the belief that we had to go up or down together , and we would come to realize that our fates are bound up together , and to realize that our government was an important part — not the only , but an important part — of creating a common future that was positive .
And that is the kind of majority that we have now .
You could see it , by my second term , that worldview caught up with what we could call the Republican worldview , the one that produced their presidential victories from Nixon in ' 68 through Bush II .
And by 2000 , our worldviews were pretty well even , which is why we had a pretty well even presidential race .
Both parties had basically about 45 percent .
And then when the Supreme Court did what it did , President Bush was in .
He later won the 2004 election , but it was the smallest reelection given an incumbent since Woodrow Wilson in 1916 , before World War I , and we had never turned out a president in wartime .
So by 2006 , when the Democrats won big in the congressional races , I remember I told Hillary the morning after the election , I said , " If we do n't nominate a convicted felon , our nominee 's gonna be president . "
Because we finally had the communitarian majority that we'd been working on .
And when we achieved parity in my second term , it was only partly due to the performance of the administration .
We had a role in it — people thought I was doing a good job and they believed in it — but to be fair , what also happened was that America had grown far more diverse , racially , culturally , religiously , in our shared challenges .
You know , there were immigrants in every kind of neighborhood , there were social problems in the suburbs as well as in the inner cities , and we became a highly complicated , interconnected society .
And along with that change came a feeling that we are connected to the rest of the world and we can't ignore what they think or feel .
I think in the last election , for example , that people liked and admired Senator McCain , but I think people thought Senator Obama was a more modern person .
More wired — not just because he was younger — more wired to the interdependent nature of the world and more able to kind of juggle a bunch of different balls at the same time .
That 's what I tried to do for people .
I tried to give people a sense that they could direct their destiny .
They might not be in total control .
I suppose no one 's ever in total control .
I 've reached the age now where hardly a week goes by that some friend of mine does n't turn up sick with a condition that he or she may not recover from — it 's just the rhythm of life , you know what I mean ?
I do n't talk so much about control and life as I used to , but I do think we direct life — we make it better or worse depending on what we do or do n't do , how we think or refuse to think .
ESQ : Just after your presidency , history took a very different turn .
How different do you think things could 've been with different leadership ?
BC : Oh , I think a lot of it .
I think if Al Gore had become president ... first of all , let me inject a little humility here :
No one knows .
But for example , as Colin Powell said when he was secretary of state , our policies with North Korea had led us back from the brink , and we were on the verge of getting a total ban on these missile flights and completing the total denuclearization of the peninsula .
I expect that would 've happened , and if that had happened , I think it is highly likely that the kind of tensions we 've seen in the past few months , including the situation involving those two young women , they might not have happened .
I can't say for sure ; no one knows .
I think that if Gore had been elected , even if Congress had rejected the Kyoto treaty , as they promised to do , we would 've kept in the forefront of this climate - change fight , we'd be a little ahead of the goal , and then I think we would 've had , uh , an even more — I give President Bush credit for putting a good deal of research into this , but I think if Gore had been president , we would 've been creating more green jobs earlier , and it would 've mitigated the impact of this economic slowdown .
I think he would 've had a much more vigorous Securities and Exchange Commission .
Could some of this have still happened ?
Maybe , but we were up on some of this in 2000 , up on Capitol Hill , warning that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were getting overexposed , and their real problems did n't happen until four years after that .
So I think whatever happened in the economic downturn would 've been less .
I 'm reluctant , because I was not there , to talk about the run-up to 9/11 , but I can always say this :
Al Gore was hypervigilant in his following of the intelligence reports and very solid in his understanding of the defense and security policy , and I think he would 've done a really good job .
I think that he would have been reluctant to fight a war on two fronts ; I think he would 've tried to finish the business with Al Qaeda and Afghanistan and let the UN inspectors finish what they were doing in Iraq .
So yeah , it would 've been a very different time .
But on the other hand , one of the things I 've found and that the ' 94 elections proved is that when I was elected in 1992 , the country thought I was in tune with them , and they had abandoned already in their own minds the economic policies of the Reagan years .
They wanted us to go back to a balanced budget , they wanted the middle class to have a better deal , they wanted poor people to be able to work their way into the middle class and not be kept out forever .
But culturally there was still a certain vulnerability to the politics of division , and there was a certain propensity to believe that government would mess up a two - car parade .
And so in that environment , it may be that I have to take some responsibility for trying to jam so much change down the system at one time , and we wound up being punished in the ' 94 election both for what we had done — in terms of the economic plan , which had some tax increases , even though most people got a tax cut , not a tax increase , and people had n't felt it yet improving the economy or reducing the deficit .
The Brady bill and assault - weapons ban , which had just come into play , which the NRA used to terrify hunters — and they had n't been through a deer season yet , so they did n't know that everything the NRA said was false .
I mean , I sailed home to victory in ' 96 , and a lot of places voted out their congressman because they knew the NRA had not told them the truth about the assault - weapons ban and the Brady bill .
So we got hurt by what we did , and then we got killed by what we did n't do — we did n't pass health care .
And we now know , and I 'm surer of this than anything :
We just could n't do it as long as Bob Dole was running for president .
He 's a good guy , and he 's a friend of mine , and the whole time I dealt with him , the only time he was not as good as his word was on this .
After Rostenkowski had asked for a bill , I personally asked Bob in the Cabinet Room if we could sit down and write a bill together and send a joint bill to the Congress .
Because he was really good on health care for a Republican , cared about it , and he said , " You know , you need to send a bill in and we need to produce a bill , so that people know there are differences between the two parties and our approaches .
Then we 'll get together and compromise it out . "
When he said that , I think he believed it .
Then he gets Bill Kristol 's famous memo that says , you know , If you let Bill Clinton pass any kind of health - care bill , the Democrats will be the majority party for a generation , and you can forget about your presidential hopes .
Your only option is to beat anything .
Kill it off .
And keep in mind , the distribution of parties in the Senate was 55 — 45 .
It was n't 60 — 40 like we 've got now .
So when you add the fact that we were taking this up , they had the filibuster votes they needed in the Senate .
[ Today ] one of the reasons you see so many Republicans negotiating is that they know we 've got sixty votes with Specter switching .
And the Obama people wrote the legislation this year in the budget package , and that 's very clever .
They wrote it so that they could take health care and climate change out of the ordinary course of business .
I realized too late that I could n't get the health - care reform through in the ordinary course of business .
If I had known in the beginning what I found out once we got into the weeds , I would have told the American people that I could not keep my commitment to them to put this bill up this quick , and that I was going to set up a bipartisan process and they need to realize that Congress as it currently existed would not pass health - care reform .
So they needed to listen to the Republicans , and they needed to listen to us , and decide who they agreed with and vote in the midterm elections accordingly , and I would hope they would support our people , but we would respond based on what they did .
By fighting that against all the odds , without explaining it to people when we realized it , we made all our vulnerable Democrats more vulnerable .
It lowered the turnout of our voters , and when we did pass the gun legislation in our budget , it raised the turnout of their voters .
ESQ : Nine years ago , you also told Esquire that you 'd learned as president that there 's only so much change the system can absorb .
Is President Obama now learning that lesson as well ?
Does this year at all remind you of your first year ?
BC : Yeah , but there 's never a good time to do something as hard as health care .
When I tried and we did n't succeed — but we had built a strong case against the status quo — we were then able to go back and take a lot of the pieces of what was in the reform and try to implement them .
And we achieved something that had n't been achieved for twenty years before or since :
We got the inflation rates and health - care costs back in line with inflation .
All during the '90s .
Now they are three times the rate of inflation , and health - care premiums doubled in the first seven years of President Bush 's term .
When I started this , we were spending 14 percent of our income on health care , and no other country was spending more than 10 .
That was the number in ' 93 .
In 2009 , we 're spending 16.5 percent of our income on health care , and no other country is spending more than 11 .
So the gap is widening , and the competitive disadvantage of this — we were ranked thirty - sixth or thirty - seventh in our quality of health care in the last international survey .
So the president 's doing the right thing .
It is both morally and politically right .
I went to three hundred towns for Hillary in March , April , and May of last year .
Separate towns —
I did way more events — but I did small - town America .
That 's where I feel comfortable and I like to do it and I thought we could get , in a campaign where we were badly outspent , I thought we could get more votes by having her go do the cities and just sending me out to do the country .
I know President Obama heard the same stories I heard .
Hillary was in the Autism Caucus in the Senate , and so I did n't give a speech without talking about autism .
And I 'm telling you , every place I went , all three hundred of these little towns , there was somebody who had an experience with this and could talk about it and would ask , What are we supposed to do ?
How can we get care for this ?
Why is n't it covered by our policies ?
You know , story after story .
So do I think he 's doing the right thing , even though he 's jamming a lot of change down the system ?
I do .
And he learned from some of the problems that I faced .
For example , I am sure he 's in favor of reinstating the assault - weapons ban , but he let Congress go on that and said , " Okay , you rural guys , we 've got to deal with climate change , we 've got to deal with health care , we ought to do this student - loan thing to get our college costs back in line and make it affordable again , so I 'll cut you some slack on assault weapons . "
So there 's a lot that 's like my first year , but it 's going to have a different ending — he 's going to get health - care reform .
ESQ : Your first midterm elections profoundly affected the course of your presidency .
So how big is next year ?
BC : I think that next year is a big year .
Might the president lose seats ?
He might .
Will he lose the Congress ?
No , I do n't think so .
I just think that —
I do n't know what the exact numbers are , but our party 's cultural base is bigger than theirs , and it will stay bigger until they develop a more modern approach , until they have their version of the Democratic Leadership Council .
ESQ : How did that happen ?
How , when they were so dominant for so long , did they become such a narrow , extreme party ?
BC : It happened for two reasons .
It happened because America changed and moved away from them .
America got more racially , religiously , culturally diverse .
It got younger , and it got on the Internet , and it became more interconnected , and people thought in a different way .
The second thing was President Bush was elected with a Senate majority that would do whatever he asked .
So for the first time since Richard Nixon won on the silent majority and Ronald Reagan won on his version of dividing America , the public actually got to see what would happen if they did what they 'd been talking about .
You know , that old Arab proverb that " Life 's greatest curse is answered prayers . "
So they were preaching to a less - receptive electorate , and they actually had a record where people had seen what had happened when they did what they promised to do .
And I think those two things made a huge difference .
And that 's what you saw in the narrow reelection of ' 04 , the stunning size of the Democratic victory in ' 06 , and the big victory in '08 .
We had a better candidate , we had better conditions for the challenging party , but the culture had changed .
See , we never knew what would really happen if they got to do what they talked about doing , and Bush and his Congress gave 'em the whole dose .
It was no different than what Reagan promised , it was just that Reagan could n't do it .
ESQ : Do you think that we had to go through that pain in order to change ?
BC : No , I do n't .
My honest opinion is that we did not .
The real question is what the memory of those things will mean in the next election — if anything — and the election after that , and I think that depends upon whether the swing voters see those eight years as a product of just President Bush or whether they see that in his foreign and domestic policies he reflected the core of Republicanism .
I think that for our party , I would n't think about that now .
Every time I do a fundraiser for a Democrat , whether it's a senator or Congressman or governor , I say the same thing .
I say , " For forty years , they had a natural advantage over us in presidential politics .
And it was only broken once by Jimmy Carter and twice by me , when they got in trouble .
When they got in trouble over Watergate , President Carter won , and then they got in trouble with the economy , and I won , and then people liked what I was doing so they gave me another term , but by then America was changing .
The hostility toward government was abating .
George Bush ran a brilliant campaign in 2000 — that compassionate - conservative thing was just brilliant — and it got him close enough that he got into the Supreme Court and they issued what I think is one of the five most reprehensible decisions in the history of the Supreme Court .
And they were embarrassed about it , because if you read the decision , it says , " Now , unlike our other decisions , this has no precedential value ; you can never cite this decision in any other case for the rest of eternity , this is only a one - off . "
I mean , they know better .
They knew better than to do what they were doing — it was just a pure , naked political deal , but anyway , it happened and Gore was a good man and he honored the traditions of America and he thought the principle of judicial review and the role of the Supreme Court was important enough not to attack it , and he took it in good grace .
But for them to win consistently again , they 're going to have to come up with a whole new theory of governing and a set of ideas that are relevant to the majority now , to people like Angel .
[ The president introduces Angel Ureña , the deputy director of communications for the Clinton Foundation . ]
Angel looks a lot more like twenty - first - century America than I do , and that 's a good thing , and the Republicans do n't have anything to say to him right now .
Their basic strategy as near as I can tell is to sit around and wait and hope the president screws up .
But what I 'm more worried about is our people getting careless , forgetting the experience of ' 94 , and that it is imperative that they produce a health - care bill for the president and make it the best one they can ; if it 's not perfect , we 'll go back and fix it .
But the people hire you to deliver .
This electorate has suffered .
They 've suffered economically , they 've suffered an enormous amount of sort of psychic insecurity from 9/11 to the economic breakdown , they 've seen all this change going on around them , and they see in Obama a cool and intelligent guy who can multitask in a world where they know you 've got to multitask .
What they do n't know is whether our guys are going to stand and deliver .
And sooner or later you 've got to stand and deliver .
All we have to worry about is getting things done and doing them as well as we can .
Do n't even worry about the Republicans .
Let them figure out what they 're going to stand for .
' Cause as long as they 're sitting around waiting for us to mess up , they do n't have a chance .
ESQ : Republican members of Congress are routinely calling Obama a socialist , and worse .
How do you account for that ?
Or how do you account for the " birther movement , " for example ?
BC : The thing that I think is wrong and dumb about this is that they 're in la-la land about this ' Where was Obama born ? ' and all that kind of stuff , and I think it sounds like an old record with a bad scratch in it .
Look , as a Democrat , let them have at it .
But for America 's sake , what they should be doing is saying , ' Why are n't they buying what we 're selling ? '
First of all , nothing lasts forever , no theory of the case lasts forever , time moves on .
So their message wo n't fly because the circumstances of America are different , the demography of America is different , the psychology of America is different ...
It 's so plainly out of whack with what you perceive the reality of the day and the challenges that we face .
We 've got 9 percent of all eligible homeowners in America having their mortgages rewritten — 9 percent — and you 're talking to me about where Obama was born ?
Give me a break .
I mean it 's like , what is this ?
As Democrats , we should let them wander around in this wilderness as long as they 'd like .
We still have a serious responsibility to pass health - care legislation , to pass climate - change legislation , keep working around the edges on this economic crisis , do something that will work on this home - owners thing .
We 've got to do something that will really get us there .
And support the President .
Do something that will really get this stuff done and then be willing to be judged by the consequences of what we do .
That 's where I was as president .
I think when all 's said and done , all that matters is whether people are better off when you quit than when you started .
The broad canvas is that the Republicans are trying to figure out whether to keep playing their old songs or try to write a new script .
Meanwhile , they 're hoping this president will fail , and they 're trying to spook the Democrats from the more vulnerable districts into helping him fail .
That 's their strategy .
Our strategy should be to try and work and support the president and try to prove that the message of the 2008 campaign — that we live in an interconnected world , that we have to work together , that we have to reach out even to our adversaries around the world , and we have to rebuild America here at home in a way that works for ordinary people — that that theory can be seen in what we do on health care , on energy , in the banking institutions , on the home mortgages , right across the board .
That 's what we need to do .
When I was president , I knew exactly what I wanted to do every day to bring America together and create a greater sense of opportunity and a larger sense of responsibility and a stronger sense of community .
I think they 've got a good agenda here , and they need to execute it .
I would n't even worry about the Republicans .
I 'd worry about executing .
We 're not going to be facing adversity politically here unless we fail to perform for the American people .
And the president 's out there working hard , but he can't do this on his own .
And you can argue the strategies of health care out there flat around , but if we fail to deal with it , there is no question in my mind that it will be a cross around our neck economically and a stain on our nation 's conscience because of the people whom we allow to suffer .
You know , I made a friend in this campaign out of a woman in Richmond , Virginia , who came to see Hillary one night .
She brought her oldest son to see me .
He was twelve and rather severely autistic , and she had two twins — I do n't remember if they were two or three years old — and they were both mentally disabled , they suffered from retardation , and one of them was born with half a heart .
And they could n't get insurance .
The kid had to go to the doctor all the time .
She had just taken them to the dentist that day , and she described what it was like to take children with retardation to the dentist .
She and her husband came with her son , and he had clear manifestations of severe autism , and this woman , she was a lovely woman .
Her husband did n't want to talk about how hard it was , he had his pride , and he just sort of walked it off , but she said , You know , my husband 's a good man and he quit his job and he had saved money , he had always saved money .
And I became eligible for Medicaid so that our children could have care when we ran through all our savings .
And because he was an accountant , we were luckier than most people in our situation .
But she said ,
He 's a scrupulously honest man , and next week he 's going to earn more money than we can earn while staying on Medicaid .
So she said , I 'm here because I think your wife cares a lot about this .
She said , I may be wrong , but I do n't know what we did wrong that makes it like this ; we can't help it that we have a chromosome that makes it likely that we will have babies with mental retardation — we did n't know that .
We can't help it that our kid is part of the trend that we 've had triple the number of kids born with autism here in America in the last twenty years .
We did n't do anything wrong , and we 're doing our best to take care of these kids , and my government tells me that we have to either starve our other kids to get health insurance , or he goes to work to feed them and the one with the heart problem dies .
She says , I do n't believe that that 's right .
And every day , I mean no matter what happened — whether they were trying to impeach me or there was some damn hearing where I was catching hell for something — I tried to get up and I tried to remember somebody like that .
That 's all the Democrats need to do today .
They just need to remember that there 's a reason we win :
We win when people feel that their country does n't care about them anymore , and they 've got to have a little help , and that we can make a new beginning .
And Barack Obama symbolized for a lot of people a new beginning totally wired to the twenty - first century .
And all the rest of us , all we have to do is just keep that in mind .
We 've got to just stand and deliver , over and over and over again .
That 's what sustained me for all eight years —
I did n't give a damn what was in the headlines that day , I just got up and remembered somebody I knew who needed a president and needed us to try and do something , and that 's all that matters .
I may think of those two kids getting off the plane two days ago — those two young women , they 're not kids , they 're my daughter 's age — thirty minutes before I die .
That 's what you think about .
The rest of it is all just smoke and mirrors , all that strategizing and stuff .
This is just the beginning of a cycle , just like Richard Nixon 's election in 1968 , this is the beginning of a cycle , and then Reagan caught it and added to their sort of arsenal for maintaining a cultural majority .
We have it now , and I waited forty years for it .
And if we get all caught up in the politics of it , it will be the worst thing we ever did .
All we gotta do is stand and deliver .
And I believe that with all my heart .
And that 's what I tried to do as president .

Dear Abby , Dear Dolly , Ask Amy - advice columns are always popular in the print media , and South Africa is no exception .
The " Agony Aunts " daily solve problems about love , lust , romance and other relationships , but one thing is consistently left off the page - HIV .
Flip through the country 's most widely read magazines and one story in the advice columns soon appears to be a theme : girl meets boy , boy meets girl , boy cheats on girl .
A report released on 19 August by The Soul City Institute for Health & Development Communication notes that about 40 percent of letters to agony aunts asked for advice about multiple concurrent partnerships , but less than half received answers that included anything related to HIV and the increased risk of infection that accompanies such relationships .
Research into advice columns in 13 mainstream publications over a three - month period found the columnists chose to focus on the emotional or " moral " issues of concurrent partnerships .
I cannot condone the practice of dating married men .
I understand you 've gotten used to this way of life , but it 's wrong and nothing will make it right .
- Advice column in Sunday World , a weekly newspaper
Sue Goldstein , Soul City 's senior executive of South African programmes , conceived of the study after listening to a radio call - in show .
She said the report highlighted a missed opportunity to address HIV , especially given the target audience of these columns - mainly women in their mid-20s .
South Africa 's 2007 antenatal survey showed that women between the ages of 25 and 29 , with a prevalence rate of almost 40 percent , were among the hardest hit by HIV .
According to UNAIDS , the national prevalence is at 18 percent .
Among the report 's recommendations were that columnists talk more about HIV - risk behaviours , avoid moralizing and provide readers with additional resources for further information .
It also recommended that editors set guidelines on what " good advice " should or should not include .
In response to the study findings and workshops with journalists , Soul City has developed a programme that pairs major print outlets with HIV - savvy organizations , in the hope that these partnerships will lead to more sensitized coverage of the epidemic . " [ Journalists ] argued that people were tired of hearing about HIV , or that their aim was to entertain their audiences , " Goldstein told IRIN / PlusNews .
" They may be trying to entertain their audiences , but the reality is that these letters are often serious requests for advice , and one often finds young people reading them ... it 's critical they be given the appropriate information .

Executives at two of the country ’s largest media companies are still trying to salvage what was essentially a cease - fire between MSNBC and the Fox News Channel .
The two cable news channels temporarily resumed their long - running feud this week after The New York Times reported that their parent companies , General Electric and the News Corporation , had struck a deal to stop each other ’s televised personal attacks .
Fox News executives felt that MSNBC had broken the deal when Keith Olbermann , in an apparent show of independence , insulted his 8 p.m. rival , Bill O’Reilly , and the News Corporation ’s chairman , Rupert Murdoch , on Monday .
On his show , “ Countdown , ” Mr. Olbermann called Mr. O’Reilly a “ racist clown . ”
Mr. O’Reilly responded with his own attack two days later on his program , “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” where he claimed that G.E. , through MSNBC , was “ promoting the election of Barack Obama and then seeking to profit from his policies . ”
WASHINGTON  The director of the Central Intelligence Agency , Leon E. Panetta , has told the House Intelligence Committee in closed - door testimony that the C.I.A. concealed “ significant actions ” from Congress from 2001 until late last month , seven Democratic committee members said .
In a June 26 letter to Mr. Panetta discussing his testimony , Democrats said that the agency had “ misled members ” of Congress for eight years about the classified matters , which the letter did not disclose .
“ This is similar to other deceptions of which we are aware from other recent periods , ” said the letter , made public late Wednesday by Representative Rush D. Holt , Democrat of New Jersey , one of the signers .
In an interview , Mr. Holt declined to reveal the nature of the C.I.A. ’s alleged deceptions , .
But he said , “ We would n’t be doing this over a trivial matter . ”
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Representative Silvestre Reyes , Democrat of Texas , referred to Mr. Panetta ’s disclosure in a letter to the committee ’s ranking Republican , Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , Congressional Quarterly reported on Wednesday .
Mr. Reyes wrote that the committee “ has been misled , has not been provided full and complete notifications , and ( in at least one occasion ) was affirmatively lied to . ”
We ’ve long been told that women are more selective when it comes to the men they choose to date .
But what if at least a part of that selectivity is due simply to environmental factors and social norms — factors that could be easily manipulated ?
For instance , might approaching — rather than being approached — in a dating situation make individuals less selective ?
Finkel & Eastwick ( 2009 ) set about to answer just that question with an experiment designed to test whether a potential partner ’s “ choosiness ” was due in part to whether they were the ones doing the choosing or not .
They corralled 350 college students into 15 speed dating events for their study .
Participants went on 4 minute “ speed dates ” with approximately 12 opposite - sex individuals during each event .
After each date , participants rated their romantic desire and romantic chemistry for that partner , as well as how much self - confidence they felt that had on that particular “ date . ”
The researchers found that the speed daters who approached their partners relative to those who stayed sitting would experience a greater romantic desire and chemistry toward their partners , and were more likely to respond “ Yes , I would see this person again ” to their partners .
In other words , the people who rotated from person to person were less selective than those sitting , regardless of which gender was doing the rotating .
When men rotated , women ( the ones sitting ) were more selective .
But when women did the rotating , men ( the ones sitting ) were more selective .
Nothing else changed in the experiment , so it was the act of doing the approaching ( or being approached ) that helped determine a person ’s selectivity toward their partner .
The researchers noted ,
" Although Western civilization has become increasingly egalitarian over the past century , certain social institutions remain gendered , some in subtle , almost invisible , ways .
The present research identified powerful consequences of a particularly subtle gender bias : the near - universal tendency to have men rotate and women sit at heterosexual speed - dating events .
" At first blush , this rotational scheme feels like an arbitrary , trivial solution to the logistical problem of ensuring that all of the women speed - date all of the men and vice versa .
Executives from a popular speed - dating company confided in us that they have men rotate because ( a ) women often have more accessories with them at events ( e.g. , purses ) , ( b ) men never seem to mind rotating , and ( c ) it just seems more chivalrous that way .
" Speed - dating scholars have appropriately adopted many procedures from professional speed - dating companies , so it is not surprising that this gendered norm has largely persisted , even for events organized and hosted by scholars .
The present results , however , present a cautionary note :
Even subtle gender norms can have important consequences for romantic dynamics .
Indeed , when researchers adopt a procedure without controlling for it , they risk missing a component of what they study .
In this case , researchers just assumed that since men rotate in real - life , they should do so in speed - dating experiments .
This may have skewed the results of past studies that used this speed - dating procedure , especially those that examined women ’s “ selectivity ” — selectivity that may have been a result of the procedure itself , not the women .
Does this make nullify all previous research on women ’s dating selectivity ?
The researchers draw mixed conclusions :
" What implications do the present findings have for the extensive literature demonstrating that women are more selective than men when choosing mates ?
On the one hand , this sex difference did not significantly reverse at events where women rotated , so on average there was at least an overall trend in the present data for men to experience greater romantic approach ( i.e. , to be less selective ) than women .
" On the other hand , the gendered norm we manipulated in the present study is just one of a universe of possible norms that could in principle affect romantic attraction , and our participants almost certainly had a lifelong history of navigating such norms that no subtle laboratory manipulation could readily erase .
Given that men are generally expected , if not required ( as at professional speed - dating events ) , to approach in romantic contexts , perhaps this factor alone could be sufficient to explain why women tend to be more selective than men .
The present results are at least partially consistent with this possibility . "
At the end of the day , more research is now needed to determine how much more selective women may be than men in dating situations .
The current research calls into question the design of much of the past research in this area , so the answer has suddenly become a lot less clear .

The California Nurses Association just sent out a press release highlighting new report from the Commonwealth Fund that projects a 94 % increase in health insurance premiums by 2020 , if effective reforms are n't enacted .
From the e-mailed release :
Private insurance premiums for employer - sponsored coverage will rise by 94 percent by 2010 , on top of the 119 percent increase since 1999 , according to the Commonwealth Fund report .
The increases in premiums from 1999 to 2008 were four times greater than the rise in family incomes , even prior to the current recession .
" These findings are merely the shocking state of premiums , not even including a concurrent jump in out - of - pocket costs for deductibles , co-pays , and other fees .
It 's no wonder that medical bills now are the leading factor in 62 percent of bankruptcies , and half of American families are rationing medical care because they can't afford it , " noted Deborah Burger , RN , co-president of the 86,000 - member California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee .
Karen Davis from the Commonweath Fund writes :
Health insurance is already becoming unaffordable for families and businesses , with premium inflation outpacing wage increases .
Between 1999 and 2008 , employer family health insurance premiums rose by 119 percent , while the median family income rose by less than 30 percent .
As a result , average family premiums for group policies have risen from 11 percent to 18 percent of median family income .
And if Congress fails to pass health reforms that control health care costs , premiums are projected to rise to 24 percent of a family 's income by 2020 .

In any economic climate , but especially in today ’s recession , most families cannot afford to devote a fourth of their income to insurance coverage , nor can businesses afford their share of insurance premiums in addition to raises for employees .
In light of this reality , it is important to remember the principal goals of comprehensive health reform : 1 ) to cover the uninsured , 2 ) to enhance the affordability of insurance coverage for everyone , and 3 ) to slow the rise in health care costs .
Achieving the first goal without the second and third is a recipe for long - term failure .
The Public Plan : The Leverage to Set Rates
Although the Obama Administration may be scaling back its support for a public plan , Commonwealth Fund and Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) analyses show that offering a strong public health insurance choice as well as private plans through a health insurance exchange will help all Americans , not just the uninsured , by slowing the growth in premiums .
A recent Fund analysis found that offering a public plan alongside private plans to all individuals and employers is our most effective weapon in combating health care costs .
The study found that cumulative health system savings between 2010 and 2020 — compared with projected trends for that period — could be as high as $ 3 trillion if reform includes a public plan that adopts innovative payment methods that reward value and uses its purchasing leverage , along with a reformed Medicare program , to control costs .
The annual growth rate in health system spending would fall from 6.5 percent to 5.2 percent – consistent with an industry coalition pledge to slow spending by 1.5 percentage points annually over the next decade .
The CBO estimates that a public plan premium would be 10 percent lower than those of typical private plans offered in an insurance exchange — a cost break that would provide much - needed relief to families and businesses in every state in the country .
The average family would save $ 2,200 per year by 2020 with reforms that include a public plan .
President Obama pledged during the presidential campaign to save American families $ 2,500 a year through health reform .
This goal needs to be on par with a deficit - neutral health reform plan .
The public option is n't just some kind of political litmus test .
It 's the last stand for affordable health care in the future .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , this post is all full of numbers and wonky , but it 's incredibly important to translate these numbers in to real life .
The public option means that American families will not have to pay a quarter of their monthly income on health insurance in ten years .
It 's bad enough that we 're now paying 18 percent .
In fact it 's criminal , and that 's only among the people who can actually pay for it .
Is n't that basically what fiscal responsibility is supposed to be all about ?
And is n't that what Steny Hoyer 's band of Blue Dogs , who are now making empty threats about their political clout , are supposed to be about ?
Fiscal responsibility ?
It seems that the Blue Dogs fiscal concerns are less about the American public than the state of their own reelection coffers .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday a broad healthcare overhaul was critical to an economic recovery and promised to push a reform package through Congress this year despite growing doubts about the plan , even among fellow Democrats .
In remarks prepared for his opening statement at an evening news conference , Obama said the biggest driving force behind the federal deficit was skyrocketing healthcare costs .
“ If we do not control these costs , we will not be able to control our deficit , ” he said after another day when leaders in Congress struggled to find common ground on the cost and scope of a healthcare plan , Obama ’s top legislative priority .
Hopes dimmed in Congress that lawmakers could meet Obama ’s goal of passing early versions by the August summer recess , but Obama appealed to congressional leaders to help Americans facing higher insurance premiums or lacking insurance .
“ They are looking to us for leadership , and we must not let them down , ” he said .
The measure faces opposition from all sides , with a group of conservative Democrats questioning the cost and funding , liberal Democrats concerned it would not do enough and Republicans blasting the $ 1 trillion - plus price tag and seeing a chance to deal a stinging blow to Obama and Democrats .
“ If they try to fix our healthcare system like they ’ve tried to rescue our economy , I think we ’re in really , really big trouble , ” said House Republican Leader John Boehner .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said panel members meeting behind closed doors to negotiate a bipartisan agreement were making progress , but Republican Senator Orrin Hatch dropped out of the talks and said he would not support the bill as it now stands .
“ It ’s going to take time , but we ’ll get there , ” Baucus said .
Obama had stepped up his involvement , meeting with rebellious House of Representatives Democrats at the White House on Tuesday and scheduling healthcare events throughout the week , topped by the nationally televised news conference at 8 p.m. EDT ( 0001 GMT ) on Wednesday .
The overhaul is designed to create a government - run insurance program to compete with private insurers , expand coverage to most of the 46 million uninsured Americans and hold down soaring healthcare costs that are rising faster than inflation .
But the details have proven difficult for lawmakers to nail down , and a series of opinion polls show Obama ’s approval rating dipping and his support on the healthcare issue falling to below 50 percent in a Washington Post poll .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there were enough votes to pass the bill in the House , but she did not give a firm timetable for a vote .
Boehner questioned her vote count .

“ I ’m not quite sure she knows whether she has the votes or not , ” he said .
‘ LONG WAY TO GO ’
The August deadline for passing versions in each chamber of Congress was endangered by the lengthy negotiations , and Republicans pushed hard for a delay .
Obama wants the first versions of the bills passed before the monthlong break to keep opposition from building during the recess .

Dick Durbin , the Senate ’s second - ranking Democrat , said senators were unlikely to meet the deadline .
“ We ’re going to take a little longer to get it right , ” he told The Hill newspaper .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee canceled a planned drafting session for the second consecutive day on Wednesday in order to work with the fiscally conservative Democrats on the committee known as “ Blue Dogs , ” who could scuttle the bill .
“ We are making progress .
However , we have a long way to go , ” said Representative Mike Ross , leader of the Blue Dogs .
The group planned another negotiating session in the evening , as Obama prepared for his news conference .
Another panel , the House Ways and Means Committee , met to discuss taxes and other issues in its version of the bill .
Its plan to add a tax on the wealthy , to raise about $ 544 billion over 10 years , has come under fire .
“ Everyone believes we are going to make the schedule in the House , ” said the committee ’s chairman , Charles Rangel .
Members of the Senate Finance Committee , meanwhile , spent the morning looking for more ways to save money in the Medicaid health program for the poor , said Senator Kent Conrad .
The more savings lawmakers can wring from existing health programs , the less new revenue they will need to raise .
“ We ’ve gone through a series of options on Medicaid to try to see if there could n’t be additional savings , ” Conrad said .
Senator Olympia Snowe , a crucial Republican swing vote , said the senators negotiating the committee ’s package want to make sure the insurance coverage provided through a proposed exchange program would be affordable .
“ If you have an individual mandate you have to make sure that affordable plans are available , ” she said .
The proposed state insurance exchanges would operate as a clearinghouse where individuals without employer sponsored health insurance and small businesses , with up to 50 employees , could shop for medical coverage plans .
A study conducted by the scientists from the National University of Mumbai ( India ) found out that almost one third of Kama Sutra positions are beyond modern human ’s abilities .
Seven volunteer couples were asked to try out as many erotic positions as possible ( in total Kama Sutra contains 64 positions ) .
The results showed , that the volunteers managed to do at most 40 poses , while 24 of them require special physical training and some of them are even physically impossible .
The scientists remind us that it is most likely that some of the Kama Sutra positions were nothing else but the author ’s fantasies ; they also advise people not to follow the book “ word - by - word ” .
Every year people receive various injuries while trying to study Kama Sutra in practice .

How The Contest Works
I 'm going to be running a contest for the next 11 days .
I 'm going to choose five members every day from the list of 55 members , and with your help , we 'll look into their history of campaign donations from those who made deals with the Baucus " Fauc - Us " Caucus .
Here 's the list of the five members today for us to look into , and shine some sunlight into their closets :
Rep. Xavier Becerra CA - 31
Rep. Steve Cohen TN -09
Rep. Jim Moran VA -08
Rep. John Larson CT -01
Rep. Tammy Baldwin WI -02
And I 'll be posting a poll every day on each of the five members I choose -- Who 's the worst Democratic sell - out to the special interests ?
At the end of the 11 days , we 'll have three days of semifinals where the crowd - sourced research is presented for the worst sell - outs from each day .
And then the seminfinalists advance to one glorious day of finals in which the worst sell - out gets the grand prize package for being compromised by the special lobbying interests :
A dedicated web landing page collecting all of the crowd sourced information about their relationships with lobbyists and their voting history Educational calls into every Democratic household in the district letting them know the member wo n't take a stand to defend the public option Post cards to every Democratic home in the district , directing them to the website and letting them know the member 's history with lobbying interests
An automated call - in number for people ( seniors ) who can't login to the website
We ’ve chosen five Democratic Representatives for our research into how much their vote can be bought for by private insurers , hospitals , PhRMA , and device makers to possibly cave in for the final bill without a strong robust public option in it .
We ’ve been hearing plenty of Democrats say that they “ support ” the public option , but that they ’d support the passage of any bill even if it does n’t include the public option .
How To Kick Ass In The Research For The Contest !
This is where you come in for the research , and I ’ve chosen Rep.
Xavier Becerra as an example to do research on how much his vote can be influenced for the final bill possibly without a public option .
Here are the websites where I started my research on Rep. Xavier Becerra :
OpenSecrets.org a . Scroll down the alphabetical list to select “ Becerra , Xavier ” and click on “ Campaign Committee and Leadership PAC Combined ” for the 2010 cycle when you open the page for Rep. Becerra . b.
You can see that Rep. Becerra ’s received over $ 122,827 from private insurers , hospitals , HMOs , pharmaceutical companies , and device makers .
Many of these associations OPPOSE a strong robust public option in the final bill .
c.
If you click on the tab “ PACs ” on the Becerra page , you ’ll see that he ’s received over $ 32,500 from the Insurance and $ 94,650 from the Health sectors .
Click on the fields for “ Insurance ” and “ Health . ” d.
You ’ll see that when you click on the “ Insurance ” field that Rep.
Becerra has received over $ 2,000 from AHIP , and $ 2,000 from BCBS .
When you click on the “ Health ” field , you ’ll see that Rep. Becerra has received over $ 8,000 from hospitals , and click on “ Health Services / HMOs ” to see that he ’s received over $ 3,500 from WellPoint , Inc. e .
If you click on the tab “ Donors ” on the Becerra page and select “ Campaign Committee and Leadership PAC Combined ” for the 2010 cycle , you ’ll see that he ’s received $ 10,000 from the American Hospital Association , and $ 5,500 from Blue Cross Blue Shield .
FEC.gov a .
Click on the “ 2009 - 2010 ” Election Cycle , and click “ All ” for the Display field .
b. Enter in “ Becerra ” in the Name field , and select “ All ” For State , and for the Office display , select U.S. House since Xavier Becerra is a Representative in the House , select “ Democrat ” for the Party field , and select “ All ” for the Candidate Status .
Then click the “ Send Query ” button , and it ’ll take you to a new page with Becerra ’s full name .
Click on that name .
c.
When you click on the full name of Xavier Becerra , you ’ll see a list .
I want you to click on the two underlined sentences on that page , the “ Non-Party ( e.g. PACs ) or other Committees ” first and then “ Individual Contributions . ” d.
When you click on the “ Non-Party ( e.g. PACs ) or other Committees , ” you ’ll see a long list of donations from political action committees .
Here ’s what I found for Rep. Becerra below from PACs for private insurers , PhRMA , hospitals , and device - makers : $ 1,000 from the Altria Group , Inc PAC $ 5,000 from the American Hospital Association PAC $ 2,000 from America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP PAC ) $ 1,000 from Bayer Corporation Political Action Committee $ 2,000 from BlueCross BlueShield Association ( BluePAC ) $ 3,000 from DaVita Inc PAC $ 1,000 from Eli Lilly and Company PAC $ 1,000 from Patton Boggs PAC $ 3,500 from WellPoint Inc , WellPAC e .
Then go back and click on “ Individual Contributions ” and you ’ll see that Becerra has received over $ 3,400 from the CEOs of the Molina HealthCare , and Molina Health Care , when you google “ Molina Health + public option , ” you ’ll see that Molina HealthCare opposes the creation of a public option .
These CEOs are in Rep. Becerra ’s district , and you have to wonder how much their donations go in making sure that Rep.
Becerra will vote for a mandated bailout of the private insurance industry without a public option in the final bill .
f.
And another interesting fact , when you scroll down the list and start googling the names of these donors , all sorts of interesting things come up , like the fact that William Wynne , who donated $ 500 to Becerra , is a lobbyist with Health Policy Source , a lobbying firm , and that he used to be the health counsel for the Senate Finance Committee .
How much is that $ 500 worth in making sure that Rep.
Becerra support the efforts of the Blue Dogs to weaken the House Tri-Committee to look like the Senate Finance Bill , which is the best wet dream for AHIP ?
If you see anything else about Xavier Becerra that is n't listed above on these two websites , and you 've found more interesting individuals with ties to lobbying organizations for AHIP , BCBS , Aetna , and UnitedHealth , please let me know in the comments below with Rep.
Becerra 's name in the title of your comment !
And let 's start hitting the ground today with the crowd - sourcing effort on the other four Members of Congress !
Remember , they really hate having sunlight being shone on their contributions from special interests , and if they start complaining about our efforts , then perhaps they should do more to back up their verbal support for the public option by making sure that the final bill contains it .
Here 's one other action item for Kossacks in the Maryland , Virginia , and D.C. area :
Please RECOMMEND this diary so that members of the Dkos community can join in with our contest for the worst lawmaker today !
And do n't forget to donate to our public option fund at FDL since Nyceve , Jane , I , and others are working hard night and day on this issue for us all !
UPDATE : You can check the Party Time to see fundraisers for these five members of Congress .
Rep. Becerra had a political fundraiser held for him on May 7th , 2009 .
One of the lobbyists that hosted the " wine - tasting " reception for him is called Dale Snape , and Mr. Snape represents IMS Health , a HMO organization , that opposes the public option .
And here 's today 's poll .
The winner advances to the semi-finals !
The temptation to name the health care reform bill after fallen health care champion Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) is as understandable as it is overwhelming .
But with the bill currently still at the mercy of players who are , shall we say , not as clearly dedicated to a product that offers the kind of help Kennedy envisioned , I suggest that we not offer them the opportunity to attach his name to anything less than a bill he would have fought for .
So while it 's undoubtedly in that spirit that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and others have begun their drive to honor Kennedy 's memory by demanding that the HELP Committee 's bill be passed and named after him , I suggest that it serves us and the Senator 's memory better if our essential element -- a strong public option -- carries his name instead .
I suggest this because I expect the temptation will be equally overwhelming to attach Kennedy 's name to a bill that 's been significantly weakened in the process of merging competing versions in each house , and then again in conference between the House and Senate , even if that bill might not have met with his approval .
Put Kennedy 's name on a weakened bill , and you 'll likely be able to break the progressive bloc in the House in two seconds flat when " the Kennedy bill " comes out of conference with the individual mandate but no public option , and progressives are faced with having to oppose " the Kennedy bill . "
As strong as they 've been on holding firm in their demands , putting the Kennedy name on a weak bill -- and remember , nothing at all prevents this -- can only drain their resolve .
That uncomfortable dilemma should be reserved for those who would oppose the vision Kennedy championed .
They should be forced to stand and vote against the inclusion of " the Kennedy Plan " in the bill if that 's what they insist on , rather than putting Kennedy 's natural allies on the spot and forcing them to choose between the empty act of supporting a bill that happens to carry his name and the vote of principle that he himself might have cast in opposition to an inadequate measure .
Let the affordable health care coverage itself that the public option will make available be what carries Kennedy 's name .
Like the ( Sen. William ) Roth IRA ( established in a Republican reconciliation bill , by the way ) , ( Sen. Claiborne )
Pell grants , or ( Sen. J. William )
Fulbright scholarships , we and future generations of Americans should enjoy comprehensive coverage under the Kennedy Health Care Plan .
With the Kennedy Health Care Plan intact in the bill , there 's no reason the legislative vehicle that creates it cannot also bear his name .
But while there 's still a fight ahead about just what will be in this bill , if we 're going to lend Ted Kennedy 's name to something , let it be done in a way that keeps him in the fight to fulfill his vision right to the last , and which keeps his name on people 's lips when they are finally able to take their families to the doctor without fear of financial ruin , saying , " We 're covered by the Kennedy Plan . "
I ’m excited today to unveil our brand new ad campaign for PlayStation 3 .
This year is going to be a game - changing year for PlayStation .
Last week , we extended an incredible value proposition with the $ 299 price move and the introduction of a sleek new form factor for the 120 GB PS3 .
We ’ve coupled this news with a truly unmatched content line up this year with some of the most eagerly anticipated games in our history .
But this is just half the story .
Today we are laying down the final puzzle piece with a new marketing campaign for the PS3 and the introduction of its new tagline , “ It Only Does Everything . ”
You may remember our MLB ad from earlier this year where we introduced Dustin Pedroia ’s “ Dear PlayStation ” spot and our resident PlayStation expert Kevin Butler .
These new ads , created by our partners at Deutsch LA , birthed a new campaign in which we will have direct conversations with consumers about everything the PS3 can do .
And as you ’ll see below , “ It Only Does Everything . ”
We know many of you would agree that the PS3 is an unrivaled gaming console .
It ’s also the best Blu-ray player on the market .
And most of you are probably aware that you can now download more than 2,000 movies without even leaving your couch .
However , we recognize there are still many consumers who may not be aware of how powerful the PS3 truly is .
So we ’ve tailored this campaign a bit differently to extend our reach and PS3 family .
From now through the holiday season , you ’ll see and hear about all the broad features and benefits this amazing device has to offer across multiple media including TV , radio , online , retail and social networking outlets .
A total of 9 TV spots will roll out throughout the holiday , each highlighting a different benefit and feature of the PS3 .
So whether you ’re a hardcore gamer or a Blu-ray enthusiast , you will have something to takeaway from these ads .
We ’re kick starting the campaign with a TV spot highlighting the new $ 299 price point on September 1 .
But for you , our loyal fans , here ’s an official sneak peek .
It ’s a fully integrated campaign that seamlessly intertwines hardware , gaming and PlayStation Network benefits under one umbrella , each with a dose of our own irreverent humor .
We knew you ’d want more than just one peek , so here ’s a spot in which Kevin commiserates with a consumer about getting her boyfriend to get his PS3 connected to the PlayStation Network .
Enjoy !
We look forward to your feedback and continued excitement , for what will be a truly great holiday and year for PlayStation .
There ’s more to come , so stay tuned .
Thanks ,
Peter Dille
But there ’s another reason health care reform is much harder now than it would have been under Nixon : the vast expansion of corporate influence .
We tend to think of the way things are now , with a huge army of lobbyists permanently camped in the corridors of power , with corporations prepared to unleash misleading ads and organize fake grass - roots protests against any legislation that threatens their bottom line , as the way it always was .
But our corporate - cash - dominated system is a relatively recent creation , dating mainly from the late 1970s .
And now that this system exists , reform of any kind has become extremely difficult .
That ’s especially true for health care , where growing spending has made the vested interests far more powerful than they were in Nixon ’s day .
The health insurance industry , in particular , saw its premiums go from 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1970 to 5.5 percent in 2007 , so that a once minor player has become a political behemoth , one that is currently spending $ 1.4 million a day lobbying Congress .
That spending fuels debates that otherwise seem incomprehensible .
Why are “ centrist ” Democrats like Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota so opposed to letting a public plan , in which Americans can buy their insurance directly from the government , compete with private insurers ?
Never mind their often incoherent arguments ; what it comes down to is the money .
Given the combination of G.O.P. extremism and corporate power , it ’s now doubtful whether health reform , even if we get it  which is by no means certain  will be anywhere near as good as Nixon ’s proposal , even though Democrats control the White House and have a large Congressional majority .
And what about other challenges ?
Every desperately needed reform I can think of , from controlling greenhouse gases to restoring fiscal balance , will have to run the same gantlet of lobbying and lies .
I ’m not saying that reformers should give up .
They do , however , have to realize what they ’re up against .
There was a lot of talk last year about how Barack Obama would be a “ transformational ” president  but true transformation , it turns out , requires a lot more than electing one telegenic leader .
Actually turning this country around is going to take years of siege warfare against deeply entrenched interests , defending a deeply dysfunctional political system .

Neptune twenty years later
KEITH COOPER
ASTRONOMY NOW
Posted : August 24 , 2009
The greatest voyage of space exploration ever undertaken experienced its final highlight two decades ago , on 25 August 1989 , when the intrepid spacecraft Voyager 2 flew within 4,950 kilometres of the beautiful blue ice giant Neptune .
Twelve years after it had departed Earth , swinging past Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus during its epic journey , Neptune and its moons were last on the list before heading into the void of deep space .
Neptune imaged by Voyager 2 from a distance of 16 million kilometres .
The Great Dark Spot is in the centre .

This was truly a voyage into the unknown .
Prior to 1989 , Neptune had existed as just a tiny pale blue disc in telescope eyepieces , accompanied by two points of light , its moons Triton and Nereid .
We knew , given its size and mass , that it was an ice giant like Uranus , 50,538 kilometres across , and not much else .
As the planet loomed large in the viewfinders of Voyager 2 ’s cameras ( its Imaging Science Subsystems were composed of two television - style video cameras – primitive by today ’s digital imaging standards ) , unexpected features began to be discerned within the azure blue–green of its atmosphere , much to the excitement of those watching back on Earth , four light hours away .
Uranus , which Voyager 2 had flown past three years earlier , had turned out to be , dare we say it , a bit dull .
There was n’t much activity visible in its atmosphere , and most of the excitement was saved for its weird moons .
As it receives a mere three percent of the sunlight that Jupiter does , and 900 times less than Earth , Neptune ’s atmosphere was anticipated to be similarly sluggish , but as those first close - up pictures trickled in we found that it was anything but dull .
A close - up view of the Great Dark Spot .
The pinwheel shape indicates that it is rotating anti-clockwise .
Image : NASA / JPL .
Embedded in that cool blue atmosphere ( surely the prettiest colour of any planet in the Solar System ) was a giant spot , larger than Earth itself , a titanic storm like Jupiter ’s Great Red Spot .
This ‘ Great Dark Spot ’ dominated Neptune ’s southern hemisphere , with white , fluffy high - altitude clouds of frozen methane crystals around the border of this giant anticyclone .
Meanwhile , streaky white clouds ‘ scooted ’ all the way around the planet in just 16 hours , and a smaller dark spot , christened ‘ D2 ’ , was being buffeted by winds blowing up to 2,400 kilometres , the most blustery in the entire Solar System .
But time and time again mission scientists kept coming back to that Great Dark Spot .
Where did it get its energy from ?
As Voyager 2 steadily approached Neptune throughout 1989 , it had seen the spot drift up and down , from 27 degrees south to 17 degrees south .
A few years later , the Hubble Space Telescope saw that it had not only stopped drifting , but had vanished totally from existence , to be replaced a little while later by another huge spot in the northern hemisphere .
Whereas Jupiter ’s writhing , churning atmosphere can keep its giant storm active for at least 400 years , Neptune is comparatively peaceful and hence its giant storms are shorter - lived .
Over the last twenty years , we ’ve seen Neptune with a Great Dark Spot of some kind at least fifty percent of the time , powered most likely by internal thermal energy .
As previously stated the blue colour of Neptune ’s atmosphere is stunning , the result of atmospheric methane absorbing redder light but reflecting shorter wavelength blue light , in much the same way that Earth ’s sky appears blue .
The invisible Neptune
Voyager 2 found that there was more to Neptune than met the eye .
It had a magnetic field that the spacecraft stumbled upon , first detecting radio emissions from it and then crossing the bow shock ( the outer boundary of the magnetosphere ) the day before closest approach .
Unusually , Neptune ’s magnetic field is tilted by 47 degrees to the axis of rotation , and is offset from the dead centre of the planet by around 10,000 kilometres .
Consequently Voyager 2 approached Neptune through the southern cusp of its magnetic field , which is at a tropical rather than polar latitude ; indeed the southern magnetic pole was pointed towards that distant point of light that is the Sun when Voyager 2 arrived .
Neptune 's rings are so faint that Neptune has to be blotted out to be able to photograph them .
Image : NASA / JPL .
Perhaps one of the biggest surprises were Neptune ’s rings .
From Earth , astronomers had only detected the merest hint of ‘ ring arcs ’ , rather than full rings , and speculation was rife as to how ring arcs could form .
All that debate went out of the window when Voyager 2 discovered that the rings were actually complete , encircling the planet , but were so dark and diffuse that they were impossible to see in their fullest extent from Earth .
The main rings include the Inside Diffuse Ring ( also called the Galle ring ) , which is 17,000 kilometres above the cloud tops and 42,000 kilometres from the centre of Neptune ; the Inner Ring ( also called the Le Verrier ring ) , 28,400 kilometres above the cloud tops and 53,000 kilometres from the centre of Neptune ; the ‘ Plateau ’ , which is a broad and diffuse sheet of smoke - particle sized dust 56,000 kilometres from the centre of Neptune ; and the Main , or Adams , ring 63,000 kilometres from the centre of Neptune and towering 38,000 kilometres above the cloud tops .
Voyager 2 was able to measure the size and distribution of the rings , and their constituents , by monitoring occultations of stars in ultraviolet light as the rings blocked the starlight , causing the star to flicker .

Voyager 2 passed over the north pole of Neptune to head away from the planet at an angle of 48 degrees to the plane of the Solar System .
Deep space beckoned , but there was one more body for it to investigate : Triton .
Moving around Neptune backwards , Triton is rockier and denser than any of the icy moons of Saturn and Uranus .
It ’s believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object , 2,720 kilometres across , that wandered too close to the ice giant at some point in the distant past .
Voyager 2 flew within 40,000 kilometres , photographing a surface that was frozen but certainly not inactive .
Giant dark plumes of dust and nitrogen were seen spewing up to eight kilometres high , before drifting back to the ground .
It ’s the coldest place in the Solar System that we have measured the temperature of , just 38 degrees above absolute zero .
It is quite possible that if Triton had never been captured by Neptune , we would now be calling it a dwarf planet like Pluto and Eris .
Indeed , it is considered to be a fine analogue to Pluto , and the records of what Voyager 2 saw and measured on this frigid moon will undoubtedly be poured over in the coming years in anticipation of the arrival of NASA ’s New Horizon ’s spacecraft at Pluto in 2015 , when we finally return to the outer Solar System .
Neptune 's moons

Triton 2,720 km 353,000km
Proteus 400 km 92,000km
Larissa 190 km 48,800km
Galatea 180 km 37,200km
Nereid 169 km 5,560,000km
Despina 150 km 27,700km
Thalassa 80 km 25,200km
Naiad 54 km 23,200 km
New discovery
Although this famous fly - by was 20 years ago , new discoveries are still amazingly being made with the data and images that Voyager 2 returned to Earth .
During its visit to the Neptunian system , Voyager 2 also discovered six new moons ( listed above ) including the 150 - kilometre wide Despina .
Ted Stryk , who is actually a professor of philosophy from Tennessee , USA , has achieved considerable success utilising modern image - processing techniques to reveal extra data in the images sent back by the Voyager probes , such as surface details in the dark hemisphere of Uranus ’ moon Ariel .
Recently , after realising that Neptune was the only world for which we do n’t have a photograph of one of its moons transiting across its disc , he found one such image in the raw data files from Voyager .
Cleaning up a sequence of four images , he found both the transit and shadow transit of Despina , an event that had been inexplicably missed by the Voyager imaging team 20 years ago .
It is a breathtaking sequence of images that resonate even more when one considers that there are no current plans to return to Neptune , nor are we likely to go back for at least another 20 or 30 years .

In a matter of hours Voyager increased our knowledge of the outermost planet a hundredfold over what we had learnt in the previous 143 years since Neptune ’s discovery in 1846 .
Since this final encounter Voyager 2 has been ploughing a lone furrow towards interstellar space .
We still keep in touch , like distant penpals , and it has enough power to stay alive for another fifteen years .
It has now passed through the termination shock – the outermost layer of the Sun ’s magnetic domain , where the solar wind slams into the radiation field of interstellar space , and in about 296,000 years it will pass within 4.3 light years of Sirius , before continuing into the vast darkness , possibly long after we are gone .

Interview with Tim Perrett , an XMPie Scala Developer
Timothy Perrett is a Technical Specialist for Europe , Middle East and Africa at XMPie , a business unit of Xerox Corporation .
XMPie offers a full range of software solutions for variable - data publishing including the award - winning product PersonalEffect .
In his ‘ spare ’ time Tim is also a committer to the Scala based “ Lift ” web framework .
He talked to us about the Xerox ICE project ; using XMPie and Scala to improve the Xerox ( UK ) customer experience .
The objective of the ICE project was to provide a full cross-media invitation experience for visitors to the Xerox UK showrooms .
Customers who agree to visit get HTML email communications driving them via a personalised URL to a dynamic web application with information about their visit .
Offline communications including a personalised printed brochure pack and personalised video are also generated .
What was the business problem you were trying to solve ?
Tim : Xerox ( UK ) has a large number of customer showrooms throughout the UK .
These are used for customer meetings and machine and / or software demonstrations .
As you may know , XMPie is a provider of software solutions in and around direct cross media marketing .
The Xerox UK team saw a way to improve the customer experience for every visitor while at the same time demonstrating the power of one of XMPie ’s own products , namely PersonalEffect .
Can you tell us a little about PersonalEffect ?
Tim :
It ’s a sophisticated system and quite popular for running cross-media marketing campaigns .
You can , for example , extract a target recipient list from almost any available datasource , be it Excel , Oracle , or any other OLEDB / ODBC compliant database .
You can use that to communicate with customers over a variety of media , all based on centralized campaign logic .
Each of these communications is monitored by uProduce , as are customer responses and actions – this could be clicking through a response URL , opening an email or responding to an SMS short code etc .
How did you get involved ?
Tim : I am part of the XMPie EMEA technical team .
The Xerox UK team asked us to look at building a layer to automate the systems construction process for the business analyst community using the PersonalEffect API .
They wanted a system that could be maintained with minimal resource , yet give maximum flexibility to the Xerox UK analysts to aid in delivering an impressive and effective experience to visiting customers .
A visiting customer likes to see our systems in action ; this was a large driving factor in the ICE project as a whole - using our own systems in our own customer communications .
Not only is this a great sales story , it ’s a great technical one that is demonstrated to every visitor to a Xerox customer showroom .
Before ICE this used to be a completely manual process , building bespoke communications for each customer ; now they just cut and paste some xml and the Scala application does the rest .
What did this mean technically ?
Tim : XMPie uProduce , a part of the PersonalEffect suite , it is a sophisticated product with an extensive SOAP API that allows you to control all facets of the system .
One part governs job management and queue processing .
A large print job , for example , could be split by the system into recipient records that run as many parallel and different “ jobs ” .
We needed to construct a system that could submit and track the resulting “ jobs ” through the production process .
These jobs could be running on any node of the XMPie uProduce cluster .
We needed to track these multiple concurrent jobs simultaneously during the automated production process - making sure that what the analyst planned actually happened .
What was your approach ?
Tim :
It was important to choose a platform that would play well with lots of concurrent operations in a succinct and usable way .
Scala was the obvious choice with its powerful Actor library .
The project was implemented as a Scala standalone application , one - jar wrapped with a windows executable .
As far as the analysts are concerned it ’s just another native windows application .
It is a seamless integration , using all the productivity of Scala to drive Java JAX - WS code for talking to the SOAP API endpoints .
A good deal of the Java code is object marshalling JAX - WS generated stubs and the rest is a neat Scala SOAP abstraction I wrote for communication with our API .
What IDE did you use ?
Tim : No IDE – I coded with TextMate and a Scala compiler window .
I personally find IDE ’s just get in the way of my coding and prefer to use Maven et al in the terminal .
Did you have any internal resistance to using Scala ?
Tim : Actually no – we have products based on Java so the jump to Scala was a small one with regards to platform / environment .
What was it like to learn Scala ?
Tim : Having already had 2 years experience with Scala I am not really a newcomer to Scala anymore .
For the last 18 months I have been a committer on the open source Scala web framework “ Lift ” .
This has given me a great insight into what Scala can do and what is possible .
So for me , for the ICE project , the choice was obvious .
I knew Scala could deliver what we needed concisely and was confident it could be done in the short time - frame needed .
The ICE strategy and specification evolved over some 6 months of team work .
The automation application however , was designed , written and deployed in just 14 very intense days , start to finish .
What would you advise other people learning Scala ?
Tim : Rome was not built in a day !
After 2 years of Scala coding there is still the occasional thing that catches me out or I find out something can be accomplished with more concise code .
Some people may find the change in approach and thinking a barrier , but hang in there because the overall productivity gains are a more than a sufficient pay off for the learning investment .
A project like ICE is a really big win for everyone and , most importantly , has been really well received by our customers and visitors to the customer showrooms .
Yet another gem from the " Party of Family Values " :
Arguing to restrict the public funding of abortions within the District of Columbia , Rep. Todd Tiahrt ( R - Kans . ) suggested on Thursday afternoon that if such " financial incentives " were available some 47 years ago , President Barack Obama himself may never have been born .
" If you think of it in human terms , there is a financial incentive that will be put in place , paid for by tax dollars , that will encourage women who are -- single parents , living below the poverty level , to have the opportunity for a free abortion , " said Tiahrt .
" If you take that scenario and apply it to many of the great minds we have today , who would we have been deprived of ?
Our president grew up in a similar circumstance . "
" If that financial incentive was in place , is it possible that his mother may have taken advantage of it ? "
Tiahrt asked .
" Clarence Thomas , Supreme Court Justice , if those circumstances were in place , is it possible that we would be denied his great mind ?
The opportunity to have tax - funded abortions , a financial incentive , is something that I think most of us want to oppose in America and it 's certainly deserves a clean up or down vote . "
So is Tiahrt suggesting that only black babies get aborted ?
Has Tiahrt been spending time with Bill Bennett ?
It 's a little horrifying to me that more than 45 years after MLK's March on Washington , the GOP still feels no shame in expressing their abject racism so openly .
It is a small comfort that Tiahrt was booed by his colleagues .
Tiahrt is running for Sam Brownback 's Senate seat in 2010 , and given the tenor of his comments , I 'd say he 's attempting to reach out to the same base .
However , such sickening allusions -- can you imagine the GOP uproar if a Congressman had suggested that Barbara Bush might have wanted to consider an abortion ?-- should not go unchallenged .
The Kansas Democratic Party has put together a petition demanding an apology from Tiahrt : Take it back , Todd .
by Brett Stevens on August 27 , 2009
As humans we learn to distrust early .
First we are told that there is a process , and so we go along with it .
Then we figure out that while the process has a goal , some people have changed their goal to be the process itself , which lets them have other more selfish goals .
For instance , rules about discipline .
You ’re not supposed to cause conflict .
So some kid starts whispering nasty things about your mom until you finally turn around and tell him to shut up .
Then his hand goes up .
The teacher , distracted and barely in control of 30 students , needs to make an example of someone to keep the herd in line .
He sees the raised hand .
You ’re the bad guy now .
This is where Americans and Europeans especially split : Americans have learned to fear bureaucracy more , because in a “ melting pot ” society we cannot rely on common reference points , so everything must be done with very specific rules .
And rules , which work as absolutes without any consideration of context , tend to be overreactions in their mechanical blindness .
A central body decides what is “ right , ” and then forces us all to comply .
Do this or you face bad consequences .
Rules also reflect the utilitarian error of assuming that what most people think they want is what is best for us all .
Even worse , rules are administered by governments .
If you want an unchallenging career where you can almost never be fired , and where you ’ll be valued because you are from a group that traditionally has not succeeded in business , government is a good place to be .
As a result , although not all government workers are this way , many are incompetents bristling with revenge — and rules give them the ability to tell more successful people to STFU .
This is why many of us distrust government .
We do n’t like bureaucracies , and we do n’t trust the rest of you .
We know that most of you are like the kid who insults our mother and then informs on us to the teacher - bureaucracy .
If most of you were n’t this way , humanity would not require so many rules , regulations , legal debates , and oversight .
But it does because when we remove these things , situations really get out of control .
Those of us who have accepted reality have also accepted that most of you have changed your goal to be the process itself , because you have no goal except yourself .
You are irresponsible .
You do n’t care about your effect on others , nature , or the world at large .
You want whatever it is that has popped in your little heads , and you do n’t care what you have to do to get it .
If you get caught , you ’ll blame the person who caught you .
You ’ll blame anyone but yourself .
It ’s never your fault , and we should always pay for your mistake .
That ’s the root of our hatred of socialism — the idea of equality in schools , the welfare state , the nanny state , socialized medicine , no child left behind , you name it — we see how socialism makes more bureaucracy necessary and gives more power to the people without goals who take over the process , instead of having a goal like those of us who are more realistic .
Instead of life being a game where finding the right federal agency or right social policy is the way to win , people like me would argue , life is a game of picking the good people and promoting them , and kicking out the bad , lazy , criminal , irresponsible , opportunist , stupid , etc .
That ’s an analogue to natural selection , and natural selection is the only reason we ’re not still covered in hair , flinging poo and living in trees .
It ’s funny how people are so quick to freak out about someone who denies the theory of evolution , but if you bring up the other part of natural selection — that we ’re not equal , and that for us to improve , we need to weed out the stupid and reward the best — they freak out because , tautologically , that does n’t support equality and they equate equality and tolerance for all people with The One True Moral Path .
Here ’s why we hate bureaucracy :
A County Londonderry pensioner who has lived without electricity for 27 years has been told NIE will charge him Â£ 67,000 to link his home to the grid .
John McCarter , 74 , has no central heating at his Downhill home and uses bottled gas and candles for light .
The electricity company said the cost was so high because cables would have to go underground because he lives in an area of special scientific interest .
BBC
“ Special scientific interest ” shows there was clearly once a reason for what ’s happening here .
But in the hands of a bureaucracy , it becomes a knee - jerk absolute reason that cannot be argued with except by , of course , getting public attention to it .
Yet what about the people without the luxury of so much time they can devote themselves to fighting this one aspect of thousands in life ?
That ’s right : they just STFU while the bureaucracy gloats .
We do n’t want this to happen to our health care .
We do n’t want this to happen to our society .
We also do n’t want it to become part of our values system .
Now look at who ’s cheering for socialized health care .
Big media , as you know , reports what it can but also must make its advertisers happy .
So some stories are “ news ” and others are basically advertising .
They can easily fool us by re-districting categories to include unrelated things with one thing in common , in order to prove a point .
See this in action here :
Critics of President Obamaâ€™s push for health care reform have been whipping up fear that proposed changes will destroy our â€œworldâ€™s bestâ€ medical system and make it like supposedly inferior systems elsewhere .
The emptiness of those claims became apparent recently when researchers from the Urban Institute released a report analyzing studies that have compared the clinical effectiveness and quality of care in the United States with the care dispensed in other advanced nations .
They found a mixed bag , with the United States doing better in some areas , like cancer care , and worse in others , like preventing deaths from treatable and preventable conditions .
The bottom line was unmistakable .
The analysts found no support for the claim routinely made by politicians that American health care is the best in the world and no hard evidence of any particular area in which American health care is truly exceptional .
NYT
What a lovely sleight - of - hand !
First they tell us we ’re doing better in some areas ; then , they say that we ’re not doing enough to “ prevent deaths from treatable and preventable conditions . ”
But they do n’t assess whether the patients have done enough to help themselves in that category .
After all , a patient has to ask a doctor for help , but if we believe these Urban Institute geniuses , the doctor should be prescient and find patients with treatable conditions and force them to get treatment — to keep our numbers up , of course .
The conclusion these rocket scientists draw is that our health system is not the world ’s best , because — and it literally hinges on this — we do n’t do enough to prevent deaths from “ treatable and preventable conditions . ”
Like what ?
Smoking ?
They ’re trying to convince us that the results of patient + medicine are entirely dependent on medicine alone .
Never mind that different countries have different people .
Never mind that not every person takes a responsible attitude toward health care .
We want to have someone to blame !
And so they cook up this “ study , ” which like all things fits under that old saw ( “ correlation is not causation ” ) expanded to our new rule here at Amerika.org : “ considering effects but not causes lets us blame the last visible actor in a complex situation . ”
Like the kid who snaps back at the kid who repeatedly insults his mother .
The ( passive ) aggressor is the insulter , but the blind and stupid social bureaucracy blames the snapper , and then calls it justice , and then tries to rally all of us to crush the snapper if he protests .
That ’s why we distrust the rest of of you : society ’s problem is n’t that it ’s unequal , but that it ’s unjust , especially to those who insist on order that the system itself has not made a bureaucracy out of .
The Patients Association said its report showed that appalling standards were more widespread than just at that trust .
Relatives described how they found their loved ones dehydrated or lying in faeces , blood and urine , and told of problems in getting help from nurses .
Ron Kirk said his father , Leslie , was admitted to hospital in October 2007 having suffered a stroke , but his treatment at the hands of some nurses amounted to cruelty .
His father had been fitted with the wrong catheter , leaving him in pain , but nurses took away his bedside alarm because they thought he was “ pressing it too often ” , Mr Kirk said .
BBC
As William S. Burroughs says , bureaucracies are a cancer .
I doubt he voted Republican .
My guess is that this issue should be bipartisan , but big media and social figures have convinced leftists to cowlike support anything tinged with “ socialism , ” even though socialism itself is a substitute for the goals of the left .
If you ’re the provoker , socialism is good ; if you ’re the independent who does n’t want to hear his mom insulted , it ’s bad .
Here ’s more measuring of effects without considering causes — liberal concern over the “ inequality numbers ” revealing the share of our economy held by the top earners — which of course does n’t consider the vital question : has our population changed ?
Well of course it has , especially dramatically since 1965 .
Maybe this would have a consequence on such numbers .
But we do n’t want to consider that .
We want a single point of blame , so we ’re going to blame the rich for continuing to succeed while we flood this society with home - grown idiots , migrant day workers , college - educated fools sired of strippers by fat businessmen , and so on .
We , the people , want someone to blame so we can go back to ignoring all the problems because … look what ’s on TV !
The problem is not that inequality exists , or that our health care is bad .
Our health care is the best in the world , for those who are willing to be alert , responsible , and proactive about finding care .
Life here is better than anywhere else , if you ’re willing to find a good job , work hard and effectively at it , and be responsible in your personal life .
But that key concept , responsible and attentive , is what pisses wannabe socialists off .
They want a bureaucracy to spoon - feed them , and even while they mew like babies about state control , they wo n’t mind if that state control is both free and easy .
At the end of the day , I — and many others who are now discontented in this country — are from the other group .
We want to tell that kid to shut up about our mother and if he does n’t , we ’ll pound his ass and if we lose , he ’ll know that next time it wo n’t be easy .
We want to work hard on making ourselves responsible and taking care of our families , and we want the clueless and irresponsible people to die out , if possible , but at the very least we do n’t want them perpetuated on our dime .
We like both evolution and natural selection and do n’t go into denial about them for religious or political reasons .
We are the group that has made the USA what it is .
We do n’t require state support .
We do n’t need subsidies .
We do n’t complain , we just do what we do to take care of what we believe in .
Europe also has many of these people , but since 1789 and even more since 1917 , they ’ve been in decline .
This is why to everyone except the Western media , it ’s clear the West is in decline .
The health care debate is just a small part of our attempt to reverse that decline , not by political solutions , but by retuning our spirits and outlooks toward rugged independence and distrust of the parasitic majority , so that we can begin rewarding the excellent among us again instead of spending all of our energy trying to help those who will not and cannot help themselves .
Summary :
Why we do n’t want socialism — we distrust the irresponsible majority who blame us for their own problems

Do n't eat near Ramadan fasters , Home Office staff told
Home Office staff were officially warned not to eat in front of their fasting Muslim colleagues during Ramadan – in case it made them feel hungry .
The advice came in a taxpayer - funded internal document listing do ’s and don’ts during the Muslim holy month , which ends this weekend .
But the guide is now at the centre of a row with Islamic groups who said it was more likely to incite hatred of Muslims than promote understanding .
Fasting : During the holy month , devout Muslims do not drink or eat from dawn until sunset and must avoid 'all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds '
The Home Office Islamic Network produced the five - page information sheet which says : ‘ In practical terms , please be sensitive when eating lunch near a Muslim colleague who is fasting .
This can make an individual feel hungrier and make it more challenging to observe the fast . ’
During the holy month devout Muslims do not drink or eat from dawn until sunset and , according to the document , must avoid ‘ all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds ’ .
It also urged Home Office managers to be flexible over working arrangements .
It says : ‘ The most likely need Muslim staff may present to managers during this period is for flexibility around working hours and break times as those fasting will have a slightly different routine from usual .
Managers and Muslim staff should discuss what their needs are and be responsive and sensitive . ’
Managers were also told : ‘ Muslim staff who are fasting and whose environment allows it may wish to set out for work earlier than usual and finish their working day correspondingly early ... in line with flexi - time arrangements . ’
Last night a Home Office spokeswoman confirmed the document had been distributed to its staff and posted on the department ’s internal intranet system .
She said : ‘ It is not formal departmental guidance and was written by volunteers . ’
The spokeswoman added that the Islamic Network was one of a number of staff faith and equality groups within the Home Office and was paid for by the taxpayer .
The Muslim Public Affairs Committee , which claims to be fighting a ‘ political jihad against Islamophobia ’ , attacked the document .
It said : ‘ It is designed to create more hatred in the hearts of non-Muslims .
‘ We do n’t care how much non-Muslims eat in front of us .
' It ’s never been an issue and never will be and we have never asked for any special treatment or sensitivity from non-Muslims whilst fasting . ’
Via twitter I came across a link to Dan Weinreb 's Tech Talk , Lisp for High - Performance Transaction Processing .
It was posted yesterday .
update
Here are some notes on the talk .
It was n't really much about the low - level details of Transaction Processing , it was more about what ITA does , how they do it , what kinds of problems they face and how they solve them , etc .
Explanation of what ITA does
Discussion of the products
Discussion of the product architecture
Why Lisp ?
Macros : syntax does matter .
Example : flexible , cheap logging with a macro .
100 people on the team , 50 writing Lisp
Lisp also used for ORM , " Quake " , written by Scott McKay
What Lisp changes were needed ?
Timeouts on all I/O operations
Four nines reliable , 24/7 , strict availability requirements ( 300 ms or better ) or ITA has to pay penalties .
How do you upgrade the software while things are running ?
Handling Unix signals .
QPX uses SBCL , RES uses ClozureCL .
ClozureCL compiler is 10 x faster than SBCL's .
Code generation is not as good .
SBCL has a ragtag group , ClozureCL has a company with employees behind it .
They get paid to do what ITA needs .
And Clozure people are friends with ITA people ( Dan has known Gail Zacharias since high school . )
You do n't have to advocate for garbage collection any more .
They use CFFI to call crypto libraries , Oracle interfaces .
Presentation layer is in Java due to libraries .
Inventory manager is written in Python .
Why ?
The guy who wrote it said " I knew python , I thought it would be fun , and I like twisted . "
But there 's no more special reason than that .
But it could be written in Lisp .
Dan started 3 years ago : a lot of cowboy programmers .
Things are much tighter now , more professional .
Tasks , schedules , code reviews , buildbots , etc .
Languages used Lisp , Java , Python , C++ , random shell scripts , perl scripts .
How do you get high level , possibly strong - ego people to work together ?
The example set by Guy Steele for the ANSI standardization process was eye opening for Dan : Guy is diplomatic and a great writer and he made things work .
Code reviews speed up software development : finding bugs early outweighs checking in quickly .
Q : Is there static type checking for Lisp applications ?
A : There are macros people can put in .
But there 's also DEFINE - STRICT - FUNCTION : has type checking for inputs , outputs , preconditions , and postconditions , and is used for module interfaces .
What do you do when a program knows it has a bug ?
Depends on the kind of bug .
Heisenbugs can be restarted in their stateless system .
Reproducible bugs require a different strategy .
ITA is divided into developers and operators .
Ops team demand " opsification " of delivered software : startable , restartable , monitorable , maintainable , etc .
Should the cluster use threads ?
The discussion was heated : some said " Threads are problematic , locking , crashing , everything will break . "
Dan wrote a 35 - page design paper covering possible uses of threads in the project .
8 different schemes , 12 different criteria , hard to decide what 's best .
Finally decided not to use multiple threads for request processing .
Timers and monitoring do run in their own threads .
Careful planning for loading new business data without shutting things down , and even loading data early and specifying " Make this the active data at some particular future timestamp . "
Strategies for live updates of clusters : multiple versions in the same cluster should planned early , not added in late .
Air Canada patterns of usage are diurnal and upgrades could be scheduled in lightened load at night for them .
But a big American airline might be less diurnal and have ten times the volume .
( 45 minute mark : " Oh ! I do n't have much time ! " )
Clojure is up - and - coming .
State of Common Lisp : Really old , 11 active implementations , 3 European conferences , 250 people at the most recent International Lisp Conference .
( ILC videos will be online sometime soon . )
To improve Common Lisp , Dan feels the library ecosystem is a great place to start .
Covers LAIR , Lisp All - Inclusive Repository .
Metadata , reviews , etc .
Single out exemplary libraries , make it easier to document things in textbooks .
Practical Common Lisp brings their hackers up to Lisp - speed quickly .
Common Lisp is on life support : new libraries will extend its life , but it's not the future in Dan 's view .
Scheme is interesting , lots of academic work ongoing .
How to do macros right , modules , continuations , etc .
Clojure : " amazing " , Dan is really enthusiastic about it , has high hopes for the its future .
You can reuse the huge amount of Java effort .
" CL library situation is n't as bad as people think , but we 'll never catch up to the volume of Java libraries . "
Good concurrency story for Clojure .
STM , side - effect free , etc. Java tool ecosystem is also applicable .
Dan thinks Clojure will fill the " industrial strength Lisp " niche in the future , instead of CL .
Scheme is trickier , but maybe it could be unified .
Q : GC is slow on huge heaps , is that a problem with the 300 ms limit ?
A : GC has not yet been a problem .
The performance is acceptable .
Generational GC works great .
In the cluster context , if you have a GC issue , just crash the instance and let something else take over .
MICHELLE
Obama , like her husband , enjoys a good burger , but not as well done .
The first lady brought daughters Malia and Sasha to former “ Top Chef ” contestant Spike Mendelsohn ‘ sGood Stuff Eatery in DC for cheeseburgers , onion rings , fries , and milkshakes .
“ They got the burgers medium , ” says a spy .
( President Obama was mildly ridiculed after ordering a burger medium - well in January . )
“ Three starving Secret Service guys were literally standing over the grill as Spike made the burgers , but did n’t eat , ” our source adds .
Fellow patrons had their cellphones temporarily confiscated to prevent pictures from being taken .
Funding Announced for BC Libraries
On August 20 , 2009 the Province of British Columbia announced that the provincial dollars to support public libraries would be $ 13,700,000 , which is about 78 % of previous years .
While this represents a reduction , the libraries of BC are pleased to see that the provincial government recognizes the integral role public libraries play in community development and literacy .
The library community will work with the province over the next weeks as the details are finalized .
Issues of equity and supporting collaboration will continue to be high priorities .
These are fiscally challenging times and we understand that temporary cuts , while difficult , are necessary .
It is our hope to work in cooperation with government to restore and enhance funding to libraries as the provincial economic picture improves .
Libraries in BC wish to thank the members of the public who supported us .
We believe that the message was heard .
We also would like to thank the provincial government for their ongoing support .
Today I learned that there are somewhere between 100 billion and 1 trillion galaxies in this ever - expanding universe , an estimate made possible by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field .
I also learned that on September 28th , 1969 a meteor was observed in the heavens of Australia .
Impact happened in Murchison , Victoria .
Not just any meteor .
This one was significant due to its total collected mass [ 100 kg ] and the fact that it was rich in organic compounds .
You see , this meteor , known to the world as the Murchison Meteor , is saturated with the building blocks of DNA and RNA .
This meteor contained the ingredients of life– amino acids , nucleotide bases , aromatic hydrocarbons , fullerenes , alcohols , amines , and amides .
And it came from space .
Not from Earth , but space , that vast region beyond our atmosphere .
Out there in the extra-terrestial , out there in space , there exists meteors with a similar organic makeup substantial enough to create life , and , in 2008 , scientists proved that these meteors , including Murchison , did n’t come from Earth .
This fact becomes mind blowing when paired with the previously stated fact , namely , there is anywhere between 100 billion to 1 trillion galaxies , each with its own set of solar systems and planets .
Get it ?
These fertile meteors float around like sperm in an ever - expanding arena of eggs .
All it takes is a planet with an atmosphere similar to ours and YESSS !
Life .
Does n’t seem like much to me .
What will I learn tomorrow ?

WHO WILL be the next to die because our cities spend money on sports stadiums instead of basic infrastructure ?
Two years ago , my former college town , the Twin Cities of Minneapolis - St. Paul , was the site of 13 needless fatalities when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed .
The tragedy occurred the same month that ground was broken on a $ 500 million stadium .
Now , a mere 10 - minute walk from my home , two Washington , D.C. , Metro trains collided , killing nine and sending more than 75 to the hospital .
I spent most of Monday evening on the phone , either assuring people that my family was safe or checking on friends to make sure no one was in the hospital or worse .
My loved ones were all in one piece .
The parents of my little girl 's friends were secure , although several had been on the trains involved -- shaken up for sure , but not grievously injured .
The relief was palpable , even physical .
But then the stories started to be released in small doses , and relief turned to horror .
There were the families of the dead on television : the inconsolable loved ones of train operator Jeanice McMillan , 42 ; David and Ann Wherley , both 62 ; Mary Doolittle , 59 ; LaVonda King , 23 ; Veronica DuBose , 29 ; Cameron Williams , 37 ; Dennis Hawkins , 64 , and Ana Fernandez , 40 .
A teacher , a young mother , a retired National Guard major general , a woman who cleaned office buildings while raising six children -- all gone , leaving devastated friends and family behind .
Then there are victims like 14 - year - old Lanice Beasley .
The tendons in her legs were severed .
While she waited for rescue , Lanice comforted a severely injured woman who ultimately perished right next to her on the ground .
From her hospital bed , Lanice spoke to the press in a fading voice and kept losing consciousness , but she managed to reveal details of the ordeal : " We were by a dumpster on the ground .
I saw her die .
She died right there . "
This is just too much to bear .
My shock became anger as it became clear that none of these people had to die , that no one had to be hurt .
This accident was about as predictable as the setting sun .
The wreckage by my house is not an accident site .
It is a crime scene .
And it happened for one reason : the twisted policies of the under - funded Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority .
The WMATA gets no dedicated federal funds despite the fact that it serves thousands of federal workers .
In fact , it has no dedicated source of funds at all , depending on fares and ads for three - fifths of its budget .

See you at Socialism !
The rest is a pittance from the District of Columbia , Maryland and Virginia , creating an under - funded , overstretched system called by the Brookings Institution " deficits by design . "
All the dirty laundry that Metro riders catch whiffs of on their daily commutes is now in plain view .
Employees have told the Washington Post that the first two cars of the striking train were two months overdue for maintenance on " braking components . "
In addition , the trains involved in the collision were recommended to be taken off the tracks altogether or significantly retrofitted back in 2006 .
The Post also reported that Deborah Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board said , " They have not been able to do that , and our recommendation was not addressed .
So it has been an unacceptable status . "
Even worse , we now know that Jeanice McMillan probably pressed the emergency brake , and it did not respond .
The Metro has now become our broken levee : an utterly preventable tragedy if only people in government had the will to do the public good .
And as in New Orleans , whose Superdome sucked up public money better spent on flood control , if publicly funded stadiums had n't become a substitute for urban policy , we would n't be mourning today .
The boondoggle of government - funded stadiums is just one example from a society that provides handouts to billionaires at the expense of ordinary citizens ' needs .
D.C. MAYOR Adrian
Fenty should be crawling under a rock right now .
Instead , Fenty sees this crisis , according to reports , as his Giuliani moment .
In other words , as an opportunity for him to be some sort kind of strongman visionary in the wake of tragedy .
There he is in front of every camera : the very image of an urban leader .
Spare us your ambition , Mr. Mayor .
Instead , explain how we are going to get Metro funded .
And while you are at it , explain why the District of Columbia is on the hook for a $ 700 million ballpark , where the city 's last - place team in the National League 's Eastern Division toils in front of their dozen or so biggest fans ?
Why , under your watch , does the D.C. government own skyboxes at all sporting venues ?
Why are you in discussion for more stadium spending -- on soccer , hoops and the mother of all stadium deals , the possible return of the Washington Redskins from suburban Maryland to the District ?
Every billionaire sports owner has his hand out , because Fenty has shown that he will turn his pockets inside out for them -- this despite the fact that Fenty became mayor on the strength of standing up to the Nationals stadium deal when he was on the City Council .
The Nats are now owned by the multibillionaire Lerner family , which was essentially handed the stadium and continues to exact concessions from the city .
Fenty should by no means be the only political leader to feel the heat .
The state governments in Maryland and Virginia should also be doing a perp walk .
But the WMATA is the D.C. - area Metro .
If Fenty wants to own this crisis , he needs to own his own accountability .
This is a question of priorities , plain and simple .
But not our priorities .
A majority of D.C. - area residents opposed the public funding of the stadiums .
These are the priorities of power and they must be opposed at all costs .
The advice of peace activist Sister Joan Chittister has some relevance here .
" Anger is not bad , " she has said .
" Anger can be a very positive thing , the thing that moves us beyond the acceptance of evil . "
It 's time to get angry .
Or the next city may be your own .

I ’m starting a short series in How Business Automation Projects Fail .
This is part 1 , where I ’ll cover the case of an apparently simple project to install a common software package .
In part 2 I write about a much more complex and expensive project .
Business Processes
Businesses run by following well defined processes .
Let ’s look at a wholesale distribution business as an example .
Here ’s a grossly simplified version of the core processes at the heart of the business :
An order comes in .
The accounting department vets the payment , issues an invoice when necessary , records the transaction , and passes the order to fulfillment department .
The fulfillment department picks , packs , and ships the merchandise , records the shipping transaction , and adjusts inventory quantities .
The buying department reviews the revised inventory records and places replenishment orders when necessary .
Process Automation
In many cases , business processes can be made more efficient by letting computers do portions of them .
Say you ’re a small wholesaler with an overall selling process similar to what I ’ve described .
You know you want to automate many parts of the process .
You ’d like the computer to do the accounting , keep track of the inventory , alert you when customers have n’t paid and when inventory quantities are low .
So maybe you go to your accountant and ask for advice .
The accountant says “ Buy QuickBooks .
I ’ll help you set it up , ” because that ’s what the accountant is familiar with .
So you do .
A month later you have the software installed and mostly configured , and you start to try running sample transactions through the system .
You quickly discover that there ’s a big problem .
QuickBooks lacks the ability to manage multiple warehouse locations ( this is a hypothetical example ) and you need that badly .
The entire automated system is useless to you without that feature .
Failed Project Postmortem
How did this happen ?
Your accountant recommended a capable and familiar software package without taking the time to define your requirements completely and to compare those with the software ’s capabilities .
The accountant was never trained in that discipline , and neither were you .
What ’s the net result ?
You ’ve lost a month of work setting up the software , and you have to start over from square one .
You still have to find or commission the right software and get it set up .
Does this little story sound far - fetched ?
It ’s not .
It happens to small and medium businesses every day .
This is exactly how software projects fail , how business automation projects fail – by failing to define the requirements formally and to make sure that they will be met by the proposed solution .
In this part I ’ve told about one common way that a packaged software acquisition and installation project can fail .
Stay tuned for part 2 , where I ’ll cover a more complex project where the business commissions a custom software solution .
Holocaust Denial And Uncomfortable Truths
By Robin Davis
06 June , 2009
Countercurrents.org
It has always been those few who can see through the political correctness and hypocrisy of popular attitudes who are considered dangerous .
" Holocaust denial laws " are now in place in about a dozen countries .
Defenders of these laws claim that the expression of unconventional views about the Jewish genocide is " hate speech " and " incitement to violence " and therefore must be suppressed .
But history shows the greatest purveyors of lies , hatred and incitement to violence are those with the power to spread their poison by manipulating popular opinion via the control or complicity of the mass media .
Through a purposefully constructed lens of political correctness the despicable becomes normal .
It is by this insidious process that tyrants make it normal and acceptable to murder those whom they consider threatening or inferior .
We have only to turn on the television to see that process at work .
It is not the unpopular views we should fear but the popular .
When the suppression of free speech serves no purpose other than to silence unconventional opinions we should be alarmed .
We should be even more alarmed when to question oppressive laws is to risk vilification , in this case by the smear of " Holocaust denier " and " anti-Semite " .
Appropriation of the term " The Holocaust " to the Nazi extermination of the Jews minimises the significance of other genocides , including those that are happening right now .
Should these crimes also be closed to opinions that question the accuracy of the official " truth " ?
Stifling open discussion and debate also does an injustice to the other millions of victims of the Nazi concentration camps : the Roma , Blacks , Polish and Russian prisoners , Jehovah 's Witnesses , homosexuals and the mentally and physically disabled .
It sidelines the slave labourers starved , beaten and worked to death in German war industries and the horrors suffered by anyone expressing anti-Nazi views .
It is likely that most people regard the real deniers of the Jewish genocide - the ones who say the extermination crimes never happened at all - in the same light as those who espouse any number of other oddball ideas .
Do we need laws to protect us from those who make obviously unsupportable claims ?
The real threat posed by " deniers " is that others might be influenced to undertake serious study and uncover embarrassing facts that would refute Israel 's " victim " status .
This would threaten Israel 's moral legitimacy , underpinned by the world 's collective shame for looking the other way .
All it takes to invoke that shame is the term anti-Semite , either stated or implied .
But opinions that question the widely accepted WWII Jewish genocide history are not anti-Semitic any more than opinions that question the accepted history of the Ukraine genocide ( 1 ) are anti-Russian .
That we are led to label any deviation from the official history as " Holocaust denial " and " Holocaust denial " as anti-Semitism is no accident .
It has come about by the same semantic sleight of hand that would have us believe anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are one and the same .
They are not .
Many Christians are Zionists while many Jews throughout the world , perhaps even the majority , are anti-Zionist .
Anti-Zionism has nothing to do with persecution of the Jews .
It is simply anti-racism and anti-colonialism as applied to the occupation of Palestine and the subjugation of its indigenous population . ( 2 )
When anyone goes to great lengths to stifle open inquiry and debate on any subject , alarm bells should ring .
Invariably the motivation is suppression of uncomfortable truths .
The uncomfortable truth of the Jewish genocide is that millions of lives would certainly have been saved had it been the priority of the Zionist leadership to save them .
Their priority instead was establishment of the state of Israel .
And then , as now , the suffering of Europe 's Jews and the world 's collective guilt was exploited to that end . ( 3 )
Ironically , when millions of refugees were trying to escape from Europe before the war , and even while the genocide was in progress , prominent leaders of the Zionist movement were " Holocaust deniers " .
When the truth could no longer remain hidden , the Zionist leadership opposed attempts to save the European Jews though financial and humanitarian aid and emigration .
The exception was migration to Palestine , and even the relative few who were saved were selected not according to their plight but according to their perceived value to the future state of Israel .
One proposal by 270 members of the British Parliament , as a part of diplomatic negotiations with Germany during the height of the killings , was to evacuate 500,000 Jews from Europe and resettle them in British colonies .
This offer was rejected by the Zionist leaders with the observation , " Only to Palestine ! " ( 3 )
It is clear from the statements and actions of the Zionist leadership that they considered the suffering of the European Jews advantageous in securing future international support for the establishment of the Zionist state .
Shocking ?
That uncomfortable truth is well documented for those who care or dare to study the subject .
Throughout history Jews , like many other minorities , have indeed been persecuted , but the modern state of Israel never was the victim .
Since its inception it has been the coloniser , aggressor , tormentor and oppressor .
Exploiting the memory of Hitler 's victims to perpetuate the myth of " victim Israel " is cynical .
To do so while attacking its neighbours and inflicting Nazi - style state terrorism , apartheid and genocide on the Palestinians is cynical in the extreme .
While " deniers " are jailed for expressing unacceptable views , the real criminals - those responsible for the agony and death of millions - manipulate popular opinion to make crimes against humanity , war crimes , contempt for international law and indifference to human suffering seem normal and acceptable .
And they do so with impunity .

Version 2.6.0 includes major changes and improvements ( 2.6.1 . fixes just 3 bugs and was released in the same day as 2.6.0 ) :
Voice and Video support
One note though :
Theme support
For Yahoo !
protocol :
Update : I changed version 2.6.0 in this post to 2.6.1 as both versions came out yesterday .
- Thanks to Mike Ruprecht and his Summer of Code project from 2008 , libpurple now has a voice and video framework that can be used to add these features to Pidgin protocol plugins .
Currently Pidgin supports these features only on XMPP , but Mike is working on other protocols .
The biggest setback this far is that these features are not supported on Windows - but the Pidgin devs are working on it !
it appears that the package from GetDeb does not provide voice / video support because Jaunty does not have the required library versions , so you probably must wait until Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala . -
Another Summer of Code project from 2008 , this time by Justin Rodriguez , adds theming support to libpurple and Pidgin .
This currently is n't very well documented at all , but themes are now supported for the buddy list , sounds , and status icons .
-P2P file transfers - Addition of MSN buddies to Yahoo accounts by adding them as ' msn / buddy@ … ' is now supported .
And another addition - very small but I really like it - Support saving animated custom smileys as animated images or animated custom smileys .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The dollar fell for a fourth straight day on Thursday , again touching its lowest levels in a year , as stocks clung to small gains after a U.S. report that showed a drop in jobless claims .
Separately , the British pound and the Canadian dollar advanced after the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada both kept interest rates unchanged .
The dollar index DXY , - 0.04 % , a measure of the greenback against a trade - weighted basket of currencies , fell to 76.824 , from 77.116 in New York trade on Wednesday .
The index earlier touched its lowest level since September 2008 at 76.775 .
The dollar changed hands at 91.74 Japanese yen , down from 92.18 yen Wednesday afternoon .
The euro traded at $ 1.4586 , up from $ 1.4539 .
The dollar , along with other low - yielding currencies , has tended to serve as a safe - haven asset over the past year , falling when equities gained , which was taken as an indication of increasing willingness among investors to move into riskier assets they fled during the credit crisis .
A separate report showed the U.S. trade deficit widened sharply in July .
The trade deficit expanded 16.3 % in July , reaching $ 32 billion from $ 27 billion in June , the Commerce Department said .
See full story .
" Despite the worse - than - expected headline figure , the continued upward trend in exports , coupled with the bounce in July imports , puts a positive spin on U.S. economic prospects , " said Sal Guatieri , senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in a note .
Meanwhile , stocks recovered gains on Wall Street , after the Labor Department said jobless claims fell 26,000 to 550,000 in the latest week , to their lowest since mid-July .
See more on jobless claims .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index SPX , +0.82 % recently traded up by almost 0.9 % .
Canada , England
The Canadian dollar traded at C$ 1.0794 versus the U.S. currency , reversing an earlier gain and compared to C$ 1.0817 Wednesday .
The Bank of Canada on Thursday kept its target for the overnight rate at 0.25 % and repeated its commitment to keep it there until the end of the second quarter of 2010 , conditional on the outlook for inflation .
Growth in the second half of 2009 could be stronger than the central bank predicted back in July .
But overall risk to the bank 's inflation forecasts remain slightly tilted to the downside , it said .
Earlier , the Bank of England made no changes to its monetary - policy stance Thursday , boosting the British pound .
Sterling earlier pushed to a high of $ 1.6685 versus the dollar , up from around $ 1.6515 just ahead of the decision .
It recently remained 0.7 % higher on the day at $ 1.6668 .
The Bank of England made no change to the deposit rate it offers on reserves that banks park at the central bank .
As expected , the bank 's rate - setting Monetary Policy Committee also voted to leave its key lending rate unchanged at 0.5 % and announced no change in its 175 billion pound ( $ 290 billion ) quantitative - easing program .
Minutes of the meeting will be released on Sept. 23 .

When Evo Morales , a former coca farmer , became president of Bolivia in 2006 , he promised to restore the thumb - shaped green leaf to the place of respect it enjoyed in Inca times .
Farmers could legally grow more of it , and his government would build factories to churn out coca shampoo and toothpaste .
He would fight drugs under a policy of " zero cocaine , but not zero coca . "
Now Bolivia 's coca production is up , according to the United Nations -- but so is its cocaine trade .
Cocaine production is potentially up as much as 65 % , ...
This horror story involves a Chico , CA woman , Shelly Andrews Buta , whose insurance company wo n't pay for the cancer treatment that , at least for now , has saved her life .
Shelly is a former Girl Scout troop leader , and a single parent who 's raising two high school students .
Shelly fought breast cancer and had been cancer - free nearly five years when , in April of 2009 , she started feeling something like paralysis in the left side of her body .
Medical tests showed the cancer had returned .
It was on her back , one lung and , most alarming , in her brain .
The 14 tumors in her brain needed immediate attention .
Specialists at UC San Francisco Medical Center recommended a procedure called gamma knife radiation , where the lesions are zapped with gamma rays and without knives .
Her doctors said without the surgery , she would die .
But on the day of the procedure , her insurance carrier , Blue Shield , said it would n't pay the $ 60,000 tab .
Blue Shield of California decided that treating Shelly Andrews - Buta was just too expensive .
So they overruled her doctor 's decision , and denied treatment .
They " recommended " a cheaper ( and much riskier / less effective ) alternative .
Blue Shield said it would pay instead for a less expensive treatment called whole - brain radiation , in which doctors try to kill tumors by exposing the entire brain to radiation .
But Dr. Sneed said that was n't the best option for Andrews - Buta .
" Gamma knife treatment works faster than whole - brain radiation in shrinking lesions , " Sneed said .
She believes Andrews - Buta 's tumors are growing too quickly to be halted by the whole brain radiation .
Sneed is considered an expert on both procedures but said Blue Shield representatives did n't seem to want to listen to her opinion .
" There was n't enough opportunity , I believe , to discuss it and talk about the pros and cons , and my rationale , " she said .
So why did Blue Shield overrule Dr. Sneed ?
In emails , a company representative told CBS 5 Investigates that Blue Shield 's position is that for patients with multiple tumors , gamma knife surgery ' does not improve survival ' better than whole brain radiation .
At this point , if ( when ) this woman dies , there is no legal recourse .
Private insurers cannot be held accountable for causing the death of a subscriber , even when they act deliberately ; denying to cover physician prescribed treatment with the knowledge that their action / inaction will cause the death of their subscriber .
This is the little known ERISA preemption rule , that bars patients from suing health insurers , when the insurance benefit is provided by an employer .
If your loved ones do decide to sue , and actually manage to win , the damages can only equal the cost of the denied treatment !
That 's right !!
" Sorry for your loss ... here 's the money it would 've cost to keep your mom alive ... run along now " !
And even if your policy is not employer provided , and you 're forced to buy your own junk insurance ( because that 's all that 's available in the " free " market ) , you 'll be limited in your recourse by mandatory arbitration clauses and the like .
Shelly Buta , ( a paying subscriber ) , had to take up a collection to pay for a round of chemotherapy .
The cost was staggering ; $ 30,000 ... she still owes on this balance but at least she received some treatment .
Of course this is only one round of chemo .
And she 's not the only cancer patient who will be forced to go without care , and maybe die early so another claim manager can get their annual bonus ....
It would be advisable for Conservatives to read this tragic story ( as well as others like Natalie Sarkisian's ) , and think long and hard before they disrupt another town hall meeting , or start spewing their usual venom about " government health care ... secret plans to kill seniors " , etc , etc .
These hateful miscreants need to be reminded that medical decisions in today 's system are not made between the patient and their doctor ; it 's always the bean counter at the corporate office who decides who lives and who dies .
Milton Friedman would be so proud .
Comic Relief : Blue Shield Boilerplate Response :
" Blue Shield makes medical necessity decisions based on what is the most appropriate safe and effective treatment .
To do that , we rely on the best evidence - based medical research available and the clinical opinion of medical experts .
While we approve of gamma knife surgery when appropriate , in this case , the most appropriate treatment is whole brain radiation therapy , which we would approve for medical necessity if requested . "
UPDATE : Some people got the point of the diary ; some chose not to .
I 'm not here to discuss statistics , dissect the patient 's medical history , or give uninformed medical opinions ( of which plenty were offered from what I see ) .
The doctor knows his patient and his opinion outweighs everyone elses because it 's specific to the case .
I wo n't turn this diary into a thesis on the merits of gamma knife therapy ; that 's not the point and most of you know this .
Again ... some people are curiously choosing to ignore the central point here : For - profit insurer , preventing a patient from getting life - saving treatment because of cost .
That 's the only point .
It 's interesting that some of you chose to get lost in statistics ( or divert the discussion there for whatever purpose ) when one can safely assume that not a single person in here has examined this patient .
OTTAWA – A Montreal man stranded at the Canadian embassy in Sudan for more than a year did not board a flight home today that had been paid for by his supporters .
The Canadian government did not issue the emergency passport Abousfian Abdelrazik would have needed to catch his flight to Abu Dhabi for the first leg of a journey home to Montreal .
" It was booked .
It was confirmed .
It was paid .
Everything was a go , but he needs that travel document , " said his Ottawa - based lawyer , Yavar Hameed .
Hameed said he has not yet been able to speak with his client but assumes he remains at the embassy in Khartoum .
Federal Court Justice Russel Zinn ordered the Conservative government on June 4 to ensure Abdelrazik returns home within 30 days .
He ruled the Sudanese - born man has a Charter right to re-enter his " country of citizenship by choice " .
Zinn ordered authorities to immediately issue an emergency passport and arrange transportation from Khartoum to Montreal if Abdelrazik could not afford to do so himself .
He also ordered the government to provide at federal expense a diplomatic escort to ensure Abdelrazik is not detained in transit or on a layover at a foreign airport .
A spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the government is still reviewing the decision and would not divulge whether it planned to file an appeal .
" We will not comment further until we have reviewed the decision , " press secretary Natalie Sarafian wrote in an email .
This is the second time Abdelrazik was unable to board a flight home paid for by his supporters .
The Department of Justice faxed Hameed a short note April 3 to say Cannon had denied his client an emergency passport on grounds of national security shortly before Abdelrazik was supposed to leave the embassy for the airport .
The government had said on repeated occasions — both to his lawyers and publicly through the media — that it would issue Abdelrazik an emergency passport if he obtained a paid itinerary .
Hameed said this time around there was nothing but silence from the government .
" The government is obliged to consult with us before definitively arranging his travel plans and they have not done so , " Hameed said .
" In fact , we have followed up repeatedly about ( today 's travel plans ) and they said `we are just considering it ' . "
Zinn said in his ruling the government should pay for the travel if there was not enough money left over from the flight arranged April 3 .
" There is any number of ways available to him to return to Canada .
He once secured an airline ticket and may be able to do so again .
In the Court 's view , that would cure the breach and be the least intrusive on the role of the executive , " Zinn said in his ruling .
" If such travel is possible , and if funds or sufficient funds to pay for an air ticket are not available to the applicant from his April 3 , 2009 , unused ticket , then the respondents are to provide the airfare or additional airfare required because , but for the breach , he would not have to incur this expense . "
Abdelrazik alleges Sudanese authorities tortured him after he was arrested in 2003 when he returned to visit his ill mother .
The Sudanese government has released him .

Both the RCMP and CSIS have said they have no current and substantive information linking Abdelrazik to criminal activity .
Abdelrazik 's passport has expired .
He is on a no-fly list under a UN Security Council resolution that imposes sanctions on individuals associated with terrorist groups and the Taliban .
Another resolution says this does not prevent countries from allowing their own nationals on the list to come home .

Matthew Yglesias » British Growing Tired of GOP Lies About UK Health Care :
It ’s too bad that repeated , endless , flagrant dishonesty does n’t do much of anything to damage a politician ’s ability to be taken seriously as a sober - minded centrist deal - maker , or Chuck Grassley would be in a world of pain :
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy would be refused treatment for his brain tumor in England — at least according to one of the allegations lobbed at Britain ’s state - funded health - care service recently by critics of President Obama ’s proposed health - care reforms .
Such claims have irked British health officials , who say they are misleading , exaggerated and sometimes just plain wrong . [...]
One of the most surprising of these was the rumor — given an airing by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) — that Kennedy , 77 , would not receive treatment for his brain tumor if he were in England because he is too old .
“ That ’s just wrong , ” a British Health Department spokesman said .
“ The NHS in England provides health services on the basis of clinical need , irrespective of age or ability to pay . ”

John Mackey is a right wing libertarian .
He ’s a union buster .
He believes that corporations should not be criminally prosecuted for their crimes .
He has just launched a campaign to defeat a single payer national health insurance system .
And he ’s the CEO of Whole Foods .
Primo hangout of liberal Democratic yuppies .
“ We are all responsible for our own lives and our own health , ” Mackey wrote yesterday in the Wall Street Journal .
“ We should take that responsibility very seriously and use our freedom to make wise lifestyle choices that will protect our health .
Doing so will enrich our lives and will help create a vibrant and sustainable American society . ”
Yes it will , John Mackey .
Yes it will .
I do take that responsibility very seriously .
I try to eat well .
And exercise regularly .
I also take my responsibility as a citizen seriously .
After all , Mr. Mackey , we are all responsible for our own civic lives and our own civic health .
We should take that responsibility very seriously and use our freedom and make wise civic and consumer choices that will protect our nation ’s health .
Doing so will enrich our civic lives and help create a vibrant and sustainable American society .
That ’s why , today , Single Payer Action is calling on all American citizens to boycott Whole Foods .
Why ?
Because Mackey has launched a public campaign to defeat single payer national health insurance .
This despite the bottom line reality that single payer is the only way to both control health care costs and cover everyone .

As Dr. Marcia Angell says in today ’s New York Times , “ if you keep health care in the hands of for - profit companies , you can increase coverage by putting more money into the system , or control costs by decreasing coverage .
But you can not do both unless you change the basic structure of the system . ”
Mackey leads his Wall Street Journal diatribe against national health insurance with a quote from one of his heroines – Margaret Thatcher : “ The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people ’s money . ”
And the problem with Mackey ’s campaign is that it results in the deaths of 60 Americans every day due to lack of health insurance .
Mackey is responsible for these deaths as much as anyone .
And we are responsible for putting money into his Whole Food bank account so that he can continue his campaign without resistance .
I know that this boycott of Whole Foods will upset many liberal Democrats .
Where will they buy their organic wines ?
And cheeses ?
And tofu ?
There are options .
Your local health food co-op .
Farmers ’ markets .
Community supported agriculture .
Other corporate chains like Trader Joe’s .
So , please , join the Single Payer Action Boycott of Whole Foods .
Do n’t cross the picket lines .
Do n’t spend another penny at Whole Foods until John Mackey and his right wing friends are defeated .
And single payer is enacted .
Onward to single payer .

Over the past several months I ’ve really started to pay attention to social media and networking and how they can be utilized to help build a brand and drive traffic to my websites .
Considering all of the major social media sites are free and have millions of users , harnessing their “ power ” is pretty important if you ’re trying to make money online .
One of the fastest growing social media sites is Twitter , which currently has between 5 M and 20 M users , depending on your source .
( Kind of a wide discrepancy , do n’t you think ? )
No matter the current number , Twitter is still experiencing massive month - over - month growth .
With such a large and growing user base , Twitter has become a powerful marketing tool for many of us in the internet marketing game , especially those of us who are fortunate enough to have a lengthy list of followers .
Unfortunately for me , until recently I was n’t one of the lucky few who had thousands of followers , so I was afraid that the time I put into using Twitter to gain traffic was kind of wasted .
And based on my initial results , I was definitely wasting my time , not because of Twitter but because of how I was using it .
Like many of you , I initially took the “ link spam the sh*t out of Twitter and hope for the best ” approach .
While I did see a slight increase in traffic , it was n’t worth even the five minutes of time I wasting logging in and posting my tweet .
Then one day it dawned on me : building a Twitter following and ( more importantly ) leveraging that following into traffic was n’t going to be any different than trying to build a following and gaining traffic for one of my blogs .
I could n’t just throw up a tweet and a link and expect the traffic floodgates to open .
In order to really leverage the power of Twitter , I had to post relevant information and ideas that people wanted , even if it did n’t immediately lead to a spike in traffic to my sites .
I had to build a base of solid content and go from there .
For those of you who run blogs this probably sounds pretty familiar .
After changing direction and dropping the link spam routine — yes , I still post links to my sites , just not in every tweet — my followers list has grown rapidly , and so too has the traffic to my sites .
Moral of the story , for success with Twitter , like anything else web related , you need to put in a little bit of time , have lots of good content , build a following and THEN expect to slowly reap the rewards .

— Sources have told WRAL News that they expect former U.S. Sen .
John Edwards to admit that he is the father of his former mistress ' 18 - month - old daughter .
Edwards , a two - time Democratic presidential candidate , confessed last August to having an affair with Rielle Hunter , who served as a videographer on Edwards ' 2008 campaign .
He has denied fathering her daughter , saying his relationship with Hunter ended before the child was conceived .
The name of the girl 's father is n't disclosed on her birth certificate .
Andrew Young , a long - time Edwards aide , initially claimed to be the father of Hunter 's child , but he is reportedly writing a book in which he will claim Edwards is the father .
A federal grand jury is investigating whether Edwards ' campaign funds were illegally paid to Hunter to keep quiet about the affair .
Hunter spent nine hours last Thursday at the federal courthouse in Raleigh , where the grand jury was meeting .
She brought her daughter , Frances , with her .
Young was at the federal courthouse in July when the grand jury was meeting .
Sources said Edwards ' public admission could come before the end of the criminal investigation .
" No statement is planned at the moment , " Edwards ' attorney , Wade Smith , said Friday .
Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb faced the media on Monday for the first time since venting after Thursday night ’s preseason game regarding the inability of the offense to establish a rhythm , due to the periodic use of quarterback Mike Vick .
McNabb , in response to questions from WIP Howard Eskin , tried to downplay the in - game discussion with offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg , during which quarterback told coach how to do his job .
Asked whether McNabb would be more comfortable with Vick taking consecutive snaps or engineering an entire series , McNabb had this to say , via the Philadelphia Inquirer : “ Before you can come up with gimmicks , before you can come up with something else , you got to get your base offense going . ”
It ’s the same notion McNabb mentioned on Thursday night , and we still do n’t know what it means .
At what point has the team gotten the “ base offense going ” ?
When leading by 10 or more points ?
After gaining 250 yards ?
And if “ coming up with gimmicks ” ( a phrase that , in our view , inherently demeans Vick ’s role in the offense ) disrupts the ability of the offense to get up to full speed , does n’t using Vick constitute tapping the breaks if / when the offense otherwise is humming along ?
Bottom line ?
It ’s great that the Eagles have given Mike Vick a second chance .
But his second chance ultimately could screw up the team ’s best chance to win a Super Bowl .
Matt Lauer interviews Bruno ( Sacha Baron Cohen ) about some of his antics in his movie while on the Today Show .

Two people have been successfully prosecuted for refusing to provide authorities with their encryption keys , resulting in landmark convictions that may have carried jail sentences of up to five years .
The government said today it does not know their fate .
The power to force people to unscramble their data was granted to authorities in October 2007 .
Between 1 April , 2008 and 31 March this year the first two convictions were obtained .
The disclosure was made by Sir Christopher Rose , the government 's Chief Surveillance Commissioner , in his recent annual report .
The former High Court judge did not provide details of the crimes being investigated in the case of either individual - neither of whom were necessarily suspects - nor of the sentences they received .
The Crown Prosecution Service said it was unable to track down information on the legal milestones without the defendants ' names .
Failure to comply with a section 49 notice carries a sentence of up to two years jail plus fines .
Failure to comply during a national security investigation carries up to five years jail .
Sir Christopher reported that all of the 15 section 49 notices served over the year - including the two that resulted in convictions - were in " counter terrorism , child indecency and domestic extremism " cases .
The Register has established that the woman served with the first section 49 notice , as part of an animal rights extremism investigation , was not one of those convicted for failing to comply .
She was later convicted and jailed on blackmail charges .
Of the 15 individuals served , 11 did not comply with the notices .
Of the 11 , seven were charged and two convicted .
Sir Christopher did not report whether prosecutions failed or are pending against the five charged but not convicted in the period covered by his report .
To obtain a section 49 notice , police forces must first apply to the National Technical Assistance Centre ( NTAC ) .
Although its web presence suggests NTAC is part of the Home Office 's Office of Security and Counter Terrorism , it is in fact located at the government 's secretive Cheltenham code breaking centre , GCHQ .
GCHQ did n't immediately respond to a request for further information on the convictions .
The Home Office said NTAC does not know the outcomes of the notices it approves .
NTAC approved a total of 26 applications for a section 49 notice during the period covered by the Chief Surveillance Commissioner 's report , which does not say if any applications were refused .
The judicial permission necessary to serve the notices was then sought in 17 cases .
Judges did not refuse permission in any case .
One police force obtained and served a section 49 notice without NTAC approval while acting on " incorrect information from the Police National Legal Database " , according to Sir Christopher .
The action was dropped before it reached court . ®

( The Frisky ) --
There 's a new book out called " Smart Girls Marry Money : How Women Have Been Duped Into the Romantic Dream -- And How They Are Paying For It , " by Elizabeth Ford and Daniela Drake .
Love wo n't pay the bills , says author , so she plans to marry a man with money .
Forget for a moment that they annoyingly refer to grown women as " girls " in their title and check out their thesis : because , for a variety of reasons , men earn more money than women , it 's a wise move to marry someone who can provide for you and your family .
I have n't read the book , so I have no idea if it is filled with sexist swill or not .
But just reading Newsweek 's article about the book , it sounds like pretty sensible advice to me .
Before you get upset , I will acknowledge a bunch of things that I know to be true : yes , women earn less than men for a lot of sexist reasons and that discrimination must stop .
Yes , mothers get " mommy - tracked " and their careers are stalled .
And of course there are all kinds of misfires to the " marry rich " idea , such as the rich guy who is an a -hole .
But that does n't change the fact that marrying a man with money can be a better idea than marrying someone who is broke .
Take me , for instance .
I 'm afraid I 'm going to get tarred and feathered as a " bad feminist " for admitting this , but yeah , I do want to marry someone who can financially support both me and our kids .
The Frisky :
Why you should marry for money --
I 'm not ashamed to " marry for money , " if that 's what would you can even call it , because I do n't fundamentally believe it is the " man 's role " to provide for women .
My actual motivations , as I see them , are pure enough .
I know of great guys out there -- journalists , teachers , non-profit dudes -- who will probably make great dads .
But I personally would n't pair up with them because , realistically , our two salaries together just would n't be enough to cut it for what I want out of life .
But , but , but , " Bank accounts should n't matter at all ! "
And while I agree with that in theory , sorry , a man who can provide for me and our children is just much more attractive to me .
The Frisky : How engagements are a crash course in marriage
Bank accounts -- and debts -- do matter .
And acknowledging that does n't make me a gold digger akin to Anna Nicole Smith -- it makes me smart .
Right now , I rent an apartment in New York City ( not cheap ) and pay all my own bills myself .
But I 'm living at the edge of my own means as it is .
I do n't make a lot of money as a journalist , I owe lots of money to student loans and unless my future husband or I had a great job prospect someplace else , I do n't want to live outside New York City , or very far from NYC , because that 's where the media capital of the world is right now .
The Frisky : Financial responsibilities of a twenty - something ?
Maybe this is n't " feminist , " but logically , I need to marry a guy who makes more money than I do -- preferably a lot more money than I do -- for us to be able to afford what I want and I hope he will want , too .
An apartment big enough for kids , prenatal care , doctors appointments , birthday presents , vacations , summer camp , college , their own car , all that stuff .
I know parents can raise children well on much less .
But personally , that 's not the lifestyle I grew up with .
I want to be able to give my children everything I had -- maybe a little less , maybe a little more -- because I think my parents did a great job .
I also would immediately disqualify entering into a sharing - bank - accounts relationship with a man who proved to be irresponsible with his cash .
College loan debt is fine ( I 've got it ) and a reasonable balance on the credit card debt is understandable ( I 've got that , too ) .
But I could n't wrap up my life or my children 's lives around someone who spent or managed money irresponsibly .
I do n't want to deal with that drama ' cause I know we 'd just argue about it all the time .
The Frisky : How not to discuss money with significant other
True story : I used to babysit for a family where the mom was Latina and the dad was white ; she was able to receive funding from the government to start her own business as part of some kind of " minority small business ownership program . "
But really , her husband , who had been laid off after 9/11 , ran the business and he hired my older brother to work for him .
Over the course of several months , my brother told me all about how this guy I babysat for spent money willy - nilly and eventually ran his business into the ground .
Not surprisingly , this couple separated and I think eventually divorced .
The last time I saw the mother , there was a moving truck in front of their house .
The Frisky : Keep money secret from your significant other ?
I realize that 's just one anecdotal story , but I 'm sharing it to demonstrate a larger point : there is nothing feminist about assuming your partner 's debt .
And it goes both ways -- I would n't blame a man for not wanting to marry a woman who spent money irresponsibly .
Couples ' finances are intertwined with one another and if he screws you up , or you screw up him , bad stuff is gonna happen to both of you .
That 's why a man who makes a decent amount of money and is responsible with it will always , always be more attractive to most women .

According to Salon.com 's Alex Koppelman , Friday 's news reports that Kent Conrad definitively stated he would vote against a public option are n't accurate .
The Sun 's story never quoted Conrad directly about the public option , and the senator 's communications director , Sean Neary , told Salon that the story was inaccurate .
Conrad has been telling his constituents that he wo n't let the government run their health care , which may be the cause of the confusion , but that language does n't preclude the public option .
This is n't exactly the greatest news in the world , because there 's no question that Kent Conrad has been fighting the public option -- but at least he does n't feel comfortable committing himself to voting against it .

Also see Davidsfr 's diary on this story .
Physicists at the University of Rochester have combed through data from satellites and ocean buoys and found evidence that in the last 50 years , the net flow of heat into and out of the oceans has changed direction three times .
These shifts in the balance of heat absorbed from the sun and radiated from the oceans correlate well with past anomalies that have been associated with abrupt shifts in the earth 's climate , say the researchers .
These anomalies include changes in normal storm intensities , unusual land temperatures , and a large drop in salmon populations along the western United States .
The physicists also say these changes in ocean heat - flow direction should be taken into account when predicting global climate because the oceans represent 90 percent of the total heat in the earth 's climate system .
The study , which will appear in an upcoming issue of Physics Letters A , differs from most previous studies in two ways , the researchers say .
First , the physicists look at the overall heat content of the Earth 's climate system , measuring the net balance of radiation from both the sun and Earth .
And second , it analyzes more completely the data sets the researchers believe are of the highest quality , and not those that are less robust .
" These shifts happened relatively abruptly , " says David Douglass , professor of physics at the University of Rochester , and co-author of the paper .
" One , for example , happened between 1976 and 1977 , right when a number of other climate - related phenomenona were happening , such as significant changes in U. S. precipitation . "
Douglass says the last oceanic shift occurred about 10 years ago , and that the oceans are currently emitting slightly more radiation than they are receiving .
The members of the team , which includes Robert Knox , emeritus professor of physics at the University , believe these heat - flux shifts had previously gone unnoticed because no one had analyzed the data as thoroughly as the Rochester team has .
The team believes that the oceans may change how much they absorb and radiate depending on factors such as shifts in ocean currents that might change how the deep water and surface waters exchange heat .
In addition to the correlation with strange global effects that some scientists suspect were caused by climate shifts , the team says their data shows the oceans are not continuously warming — a conclusion not consistent with the idea that the oceans may be harboring " warming in the pipeline . "
Douglass further notes that the team found no correlation between the shifts and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration .
" An interesting aspect of this research is that no reference to the surface temperature itself is needed , " says Knox .
" The heat content data we used , gathered by oceanographers , was gleaned from temperature measurements at various ocean depths up to 750 meters . "
The team also found that the radiative imbalance was sufficiently small that it was necessary to consider the effect of geothermal heating .
Knox believes this is the first time this additional source of heat has been accounted for in such a model .
The team notes that it 's impossible to predict when another shift might occur , but they suspect future shifts might be similar to the three observed .
Both Douglass and Knox are continuing to analyze various climate - related data to find any new information or correlations that may have so far gone unnoticed .

En rekke bilder fra de drapstiltaltes kameraer legges nå fram i retten i Kisangani som bevis .
Det er bilder av de to som poserer i skogen , av drapsbilen og bildet av Moland som vasker vekk den avdødes blod med et smil om munnen .
( Se over ) .
Bildet av Moland vekker sterke reaksjoner i salen .
- Her smiler Moland ved blodsølet .
Han er glad for hva han har gjort .
Kasango er død , til og med uten å kreve betaling , sier aktor .
Han mener de to nordmennene kan ha vært ute etter diamanter .
- Vanlige mennesker kunne ikke ha gjort det Moland gjorde , sier han .
Nekter å svare
Etter å ha fullført deler av prosedyren sin forsøkte aktor å starte sin usspørring av de siktede .
Men
utover å erklære seg uskyldige nekter nordmennene å svare .
Aktor fastholder at de to tiltalte er norske soldater og spør Moland om hvem som har høyest grad .
- Det er min rett å ikke svare , sier Moland , noe som får publikum til å bue .
Også dommeren , Kaptein Claude Disimo , blir svært overrasket .
- Det er din rett , men du skal vite at om du forholder deg stille må retten avgjøre dette alene , sier han .
Dommeren henvender seg til French , men også han sier at han ikke vil uttale seg .
- Men dette er deres sjanse til å hevde deres uskyld , påpeker dommeren uten at det hjelper .
TAUSE : Etter å ha erklært seg uskyldige , nekter de to drapstiltalte nordmennene Joshua French ( 27 ) og Tjostolv Moland ( 28 ) å svare på spørsmål fra aktor .
Foto : Torstein Krokfjord Vis mer
- Hvorfor har dere forsvarer , når dere ikke vil uttale dere ?
spør dommeren .
Tidligere i dag fortalte Moland Dagbladet om avgjørelsen om å ikke svare på aktors spørsmål .
- Vi betrakter ikke saken som en rettferdig rettssak lenger , forklarte Moland til Dagbladet .
Omtales som soldater
Under sin prosedyre har aktor konsekvent omtalt Moland som løytnant og French som sersjant .
De blir også omtalt som spesialsoldater med ekstrakompetanse siden de har vært i Konges Garde , noe som får de to nordmennene til å smile .
- Hold dere alvorlige og ikke le , tordner dommeren da .
Ifølge aktor har Moland bygget opp en kriminell organisasjon som besto av ham og French .
De to er leiesoldater som kom til Kongo på hemmelig oppdrag , hevder han .
Aktor påpeker at det ikke rimer å si at de er turister når de bærer krigsvåpen .
De falske navnene de har oppgitt påpekes også som suspekte .
- Tok fram kamera
Aktor beskriver også omstendighetene rundt selve drapet , slik han mener der sjedde .
- Da bilen stoppet 109 kilometer ut i turen tok « kongen av gangstere » T. Moland opp våpenet og tvang de andre ut .
Og mens Moland tok opp våpenet tok French fram videokameraet , sier han .
Han mener den eneste grunnen til at vitnene reddet livet er at det oppsto en voldsom kamp mellom hjelpesjåføren og French .
- At de to nekter å svare på spørsmål ser jeg som et tegn på at det som sies er sant , sier han .
- Hva aktor sier får være opp til dem .
Og hva angår stillheten så er ikke det noe jeg ønsker å kommentere nå , sier nordmennenes forsvarer André Kibambe til Dagbladet.no .
A 1.3 - metre bear has been shot dead after attacking nine people including tourists at a bus terminal in a mountainous area of Takayama in central Japan .
Four men , including a 66 - year - old , received serious injuries in the attack , including bite wounds to the face , police said , but none are considered life threatening .
The other five were only slightly injured .
Some of the more than 100 people at the scene of the attack escaped danger by taking refuge inside buses .
Employees at the terminal building eventually blocked the bear in a souvenir shop inside the terminal , where hunters later shot it dead .
An employee who tried to prevent the bear from storming into the building said , '' I tried to close the entrance to the terminal building , but it was too late " .

On Tuesday we are releasing an update to the BBC News iPhone and iPad app in the UK designed to make the app faster and more stable , with bigger , better quality images on the home screen .
We are busy doing some research and thinking at the moment about what people are looking for in our News apps in the longer term , but we thought that in the meantime , it was important to fix one or two bugs affecting some users of the existing app and to make it a better , slicker experience overall .
We want to make sure the current app remains a great way to get a quick overview of the top stories across a wide range of subjects , easy - to - scan on a mobile and , once the stories have loaded , handy to read offline too .
So , it will now be quicker to start up the app and to update it , and it should feel smoother and faster as you scroll and swipe through the screens and stories .
The larger homescreen images we 've introduced serve two purposes :
first , you can see what 's in them more clearly and there 's more room for the headline
second , their positioning makes it clearer that you can scroll horizontally in each news category to reveal more stories ( we noticed that in user testing some people assumed there were only three stories a section ) .
There is a new layout on iPad when you view the home screen in portrait mode - designed to show more headlines and make it easier to find the stories you 're interested in .
Among the bugs that we 've fixed is an issue that sometimes caused the app to get stuck when updating , and another where you sometimes saw duplicate stories within a single news category .
For our product team , these improvements required a fairly major reworking of the app 's code .
The good news is that they are now working from a more stable base which can be built on with new features and functionality .
This revising of our code is something we 've already done with our Android app , so we 'll now be able to release upgrades simultaneously on both iOS and Android , which are by far the largest mobile platforms for us in terms of users .
This latest update is already available internationally .
If you 're a user of the app , or decide to try it out , we hope you 'll like the improvements we 've made .
And as we think about our apps generally and plan our next steps , we 'd like to hear about what you 'd most like to see in future .

Moore 's Law was invented by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore Intel has unveiled a new microchip that shows less can be more .
The chip firm has shown what is thought to be the first working chip using transistors with features just 22nm ( billionths of a metre ) across .
Shrinking these basic building blocks of chips will , in theory , make them faster and more efficient .
The chip contains nearly three billion transistors packed into an area the size of a fingernail , but Intel says there could be smaller to come .
The development shows there is still life in Moore 's Law , which states the number of transistors it is possible to pack on a silicon chip for a fixed cost will double every two years .
Generally speaking the smaller the chip 's geometry , the faster and more power efficient the chip .
" Moore 's Law is not a law of physics , it 's a law of human inventiveness , " Intel president and chief executive Paul Otellini told BBC News .
" There is nothing that says that humans can't continue to invent . "
Intel is currently making chips based on 45 nanometre technology and will move to 32 nanometre later this year .
The company 's first chips in the 1970s had just a few thousand transistors .
IBM and a European project called Duallogic are also involved in creating 22 nanometre chips .
' Vision ' Mr Otellini displayed the silicon wafer during his keynote speech at the firm 's developer conference in San Francisco .
He revealed that it contained 364 million bits of memory and has more than 2.9 billion transistors .
It is expected to go into production in 2011 .
Intel says the 22 nanometre technology will not go into production until 2011 " We have at least four generations of what we are shipping today in development .
That is as far out as we have ever been able to develop things .
" Not everything is done but it gets harder for sure .
It requires more invention and more money and it's our job to continue that pace , " said Mr Otellini .
Those attending Intel Developer Forum , IDF , were impressed by what they saw .
" I believe we are always going to be able to improve on Moore 's Law , " said Professor Tom Murphy from Contra Costa College .
" It 's always delightful to see the vision of what Intel is planning because it translates to the toys I will get to play with real soon . "
Haider Sabri from techSpeak said : " I was starting to have doubts that Moore 's Law was valid anymore , but thankfully I have been proven wrong today . "
Meanwhile Matthew Wolf , a research scientist from Georgia Tech , said he could not help thinking the end for Moore 's Law had to come eventually .
" I am coming at this as a physicist and it just had to end sometime .
But I think that the trajectory for the next few years is clearly one that is real and on its way , " said Mr Wolf .
Marketplace During his speech , Mr Otellini also predicted that the worldwide personal computer market was due for a resurgence and could actually defy predictions by growing this year .
Around 5,000 developers are attending Intel 's annual developer forum " In general , technology was the first into the recession and is likely to be the first out .
We have seen this in past recessions and so far the pattern seems to be holding to that .
" The computer has become so indispensable that if it breaks you do n't wait for the recession to buy a new one .
You are going to go out and get another because it is simply a part of your life , " said Mr Otellini .
The optimism displayed by Intel 's boss goes against the grain given recent studies done by research companies IDC and Gartner .
Both have predicted that PC shipments will decline year - over - year in 2009 , representing the first drop since 2001 .
Researchers at Gartner point to a 2 % decline this year , which is an improvement on the 6 % drop the company was projecting a few months ago .
" Things are looking much better in the second half , " Gartner research director George Shiffler told Cnet.com .
" It would n't surprise me if we did see positive growth , but that 's not our call at the moment .
I think that 's more of a best - case scenario , " said Mr Shiffler .

Go tell the world about our fake election
By Alex Strick van Linschoten
So it finally happened .
The election that we ’ve been waiting for and looking forward to at least since last winter took place yesterday all over the country .
I ’ll refrain from writing anything about the rest of the country .
There are plenty of places to get a good sense of what happened .
Make sure to check out www.aliveinafghanistan.org and the various people who ’ve been tweeting news all day from the ground around the country .
I ’ll just be talking about the things in Kandahar that I saw and was able to confirm from here on the ground .
There were n’t so many foreign journalists down here and most are unlikely to publish detailed accounts of what happened and the things that they saw ; NPR decided not to run a piece on the election down here , judging that “ one piece from Kabul was enough . ”
Violence
Things were a lot calmer than anyone would have hoped for , I ’m glad to report .
Not the mass waves of suicide bombers or IEDs lining the road .
In fact the casualty count was quite low : Kandahar ’s police chief told me at close of business yesterday that two children and one adult had been killed during the day and that two others had been injured .
The man who died was probably the first casualty of the day , a military commander called Dost Mohammad and who was out running in a field when a rocket struck close by and he was hit by the shrapnel .
Pajhwok was reporting in the morning that at least six IEDs had been removed from the roads in Kandahar City .
An Afghan National Army commander who spoke to us on condition of anonymity said that 16 or 17 rockets hit the city during the course of the elections .
During the night there were not rockets or attacks it seems , apart from the story I just heard from a policeman here at the airport that five armed men managed to get onto KAF airfield last night .
They were searching all night , apparently .
In Kandahar it seems the Afghan government ’s imposition of a ban on any negative coverage of the election during voting hours was n’t upheld much , if at all .
I spoke to a photojournalist yesterday who said he was actually given a police escort to one of the sites where a rocket hit .
The rockets , starting at 6:30 am local time , were probably responsible for some people deciding not to go out and vote , but I do n’t think it had an overwhelming effect in this respect .
Most people had decided either way a long time ago , and in any case — as I ’ll come to later — apathy was particularly intense for this election .
My personal experience was a lot like what it ’s usually like in Kandahar .
There were some isolated incidents — a couple of rockets landed quite close to us near the end of the day — but on the whole it was quite easy relaxed day .
Some police manning crossroads in town were a bit edgy and conducted searches of cars at gunpoint , but for the most part the police were somewhat laid back ; at quite a few voting stations my colleagues and I were allowed in without body searches or ID checks .
Turnout
I imagine this will be quite an important issue in the coming weeks , perhaps more so than allegations of fraud and vote - rigging .
I visited almost a dozen voting stations in different parts of Kandahar City , including two female - only locations , and nowhere was there intense activity .
We made sure to get to the big locations in the city center as well as smaller places in the west and east of town .
( Read on )
During the morning there were people on the streets walking around town to get to polling centers , but it was far from an enthusiastic turnout .
Everyone I spoke to who was present at the previous elections in Kandahar noted the big difference in numbers of voters .
“ At this large station we had several thousand people waiting to vote at any one time — there were that many people , ” one told me .
Near the end of the day we travelled to a selection of voting stations to take figures for how many people had voted in each location at the various voting booths .
In the interests of full disclosure , here are the numbers I collected :

( missing 4 stations that we did n’t count )
PARTIAL TOTAL : 1,007
There are several things to note from these numbers .
Firstly , turnout was EXTREMELY low .
Zahir Shahi High School and Ahmad Shah Baba High School are arguably the two biggest voting stations in Kandahar City , where in previous elections large numbers of people were seen .
Neither location saw more than 2,000 voters by the end of the day .
Obviously , there is a possibility that some of these locations saw lots more voters after we left , but it is highly implausible , and in fact we were present at Ahmad Shah Baba high school at the 4 pm cutoff time and there was no last - minute surge .
There was , though , a bit of confusion as to whether voting had been extended for an hour or not .
The school I was at started locking vote boxes and counting votes at 4 pm .
A man who came in and said that BBC had just announced a one hour extension was ignored and as far as I know no more votes were cast past the 4 pm mark .
In all the stations that we visited , there were far more election staff than voters — with the exception of Zahir Shahi high school that we visited in the morning where there were several hundred voters lining up to vote .
In Mirwais Mina Girls School , there were a lot of girls staffing the polling locations , but hardly any voters to be seen .
In fact it seems that most of the vote numbers that we noted ( above ) were probably from election officials themselves .
So what do these numbers mean , and what can we deduce further from them ?
In Kandahar province as a whole , there were around 250 or 260 voting stations open .
In the city there were around 50 open and receiving voters .
Even if we assume that they were all as well - visited as Ahmad Shah Baba High School or Zahir Shahi High School ( a preposterous assumption ) then this is still a really low number .
If I take an average of the voting stations that I visited , we have perhaps 600 votes per voting center ( which itself is illusionary since almost no women came out to vote and since hardly any of the centers I visited had 600 people vote there ) .
There were an estimated 1,080,000 registered voters according to IEC officials yesterday and so Kandahar potentially saw 160,000 voters out on the streets .
I think this is an almost completely optimistic figure , assuming more people were out on the streets than my eyes saw .
There still is little information on voting in the districts aside from some stories from Spin Boldak ( see below ) , but anecdotal accounts suggest that hardly anyone voted in the districts as well .
All this indicates a turnout of less than 15 percent , probably in reality somewhere approaching 7 or 8 percent .
One further point : since the last vaguely useful census of Afghanistan and the south was decades ago , it ’s very difficult to get a sense of demographics and how many people are living where etc .
But given the figure of 1,080,000 total registered voters , I ’m amused to take a look at the Afghan government ’s own Central Statistics Office document on population statistics for the period 2008 - 9 .
I do n’t really buy the numbers they state in the booklet , but they state that Kandahar has 1,057,500 total residents ( 352,200 urban and 705,300 rural ) .
Get your head around that one …
Fraud / Improper Practices
I ’ll admit that I ’m not as familiar with Afghanistan ’s actual written voting and election law as I ought to be , but these are some things that I thought seemed pretty ‘ off ’ .
The first thing that I saw when I went to watch the governor , Torialai Weesa , cast the first vote of the day was the large number of Karzai ‘ observers ’ present .
This was repeated at all the other centers I visited , and apparently it was quite uniform all over the country .
These young men were recruited to watch and report instances of voter fraud , but in reality these functioned as campaigners for the incumbent , handing out badges and baseball caps to those who came .
I heard from a number of people during the day that there were 6,000 of these observers for Kandahar province alone , although one person warned me that there were fewer as some did n’t come out to take up their duties that day .
I noticed a fair number of FEFA observers , particularly around the end of the day , in Kandahar City .
They were busy taking figures for how many voters were recorded as having voted in each station .
I look forward to their report on voting irregularities .
Around noon , the news that the supposedly indelible ink could be washed off from fingers with domestic bleach started to hit the streets in Kandahar .
This was good and bad .
On the one hand , a lot of people who were scared of voting for fear that they would be identified by the Taliban by the ink -stain on their fingers suddenly realized that they could go and vote .
I personally witnessed one group of people who were due to travel to Arghestan ( a district of Kandahar ) the next day for a funeral who had decided not to vote for this reason ; when it became clear that the ink was n’t permanent , they all got up and voted .
On the other hand , it meant that lots of people came out and voted twice or more .
I personally witnessed this .
I do n’t think there was too much of this , though , and certainly not enough to sway the vote significantly in one or the other direction .
I believe it was a problem in other parts of the country , too .
If you ’re wondering how people managed to get multiple voter cards , please refer to previous blog posts that I ’ve made , as well as the numerous media accounts of corruption in the registration system , where officials of the election commission and various other power brokers work together to manipulate the system .
From the start of the day , it was noted that the voter cards were not being properly invalidated with the card - puncher .
Again , this was a problem all over the country .
At subsequent voting stations that I visited , staff had taken differing initiatives to correct this — some cut the corners off the cards , others cut a triangle in the bottom right corner , and so on .
From what I observed during the counting of votes , there seemed to be some confusion as to how this was meant to work .
I was based at Ahmad Shah Baba High School and some of the voting rooms were counted very fast , others took much longer .
The difference was of course in the numbers of votes that each room had taken , but also in individual styles — some people would check everything two or three times , and others would just do it once .
Occasionally observers working for Karzai would come in and shout at some of the election people to do things differently , especially if they were taking a long time over the vote count .
I imagine over Kandahar province as a whole there was a lot of variation in how the vote count went .
Women ’s voting centers were interesting to visit .
The first that I saw , Kaka Said Ahmad High School in the center of the city , had some women voting ( perhaps several dozen ) early in the morning .
In one room that we entered , however , the two boxes were open and women were in the process of handling the vote papers .
When we asked the head of the voting center what was going on ( boxes were supposed to be locked and closed ) she said that some women had come very early in the morning ( before the official opening time ) and asked , hands trembling out of fear , to vote quickly .
Later on in the morning an irregularity was noticed , though , since one box had 13 votes inside and the other had 14 .
They were in the process of dealing with this when I entered with my colleague and some journalists from the local Hewaad television station .
In another women ’s voting station ( Mirwais Meena Girls School ) , we were kept waiting outside the locked main gate for around ten minutes before finally being allowed in ( a policeman outside gave us a hand opening the gate ) .
When inside , there were hardly any voters ( under a dozen in the whole building ) but lots of election workers and other girls .
Again , I ’m not sure if this was an irregularity , but my guess is that women ’s polling stations , especially ones in the districts , were easy places for fraud to occur .
I overheard several conversations between provincial candidates or their representatives and people working / observing at voting centers — they did n’t realize I speak Pashtu — during which sums of money were promised in exchange for votes to be cast in their favor .
In this manner , at one station 1,000 votes were thus sold for $ 400 .
I heard stories of this kind of trade in votes throughout the day , and in fact the ‘ warm bazaar ’ had been open for several months .
Earlier in the year it was possible to buy voting cards for $ 1 a card ( they were sold in booklets of 100 usually ) .
By the time the day before the election arrived , they were being sold ( in some instances ) for $ 5 - 10 per card .
The Afghan friends I was travelling around with that day called one of the voting stations for which I gave numbers above ( Shkarpur Darwaza ) ahead of our arrival .
“ Do n’t come !
Do n’t come ! ” our friends were requested .
“ We ’re about to start stuffing the ballot boxes and we do n’t need foreigners here messing up our work . ”
That was one of the election officials of the station talking on the phone .
Needless to say , we went there and took note of how many voters they had on their lists .
Spin Boldak is an interesting case , although , since I did n’t manage to get down there myself and I have n’t yet heard from people who did , I suspect we ’ll never get to the bottom of what happened there .
In the months prior to the election , I heard numerous accounts of how General Razziq ’s men — Razziq is a local border police commander , well - respected in southern Afghanistan — were preventing any non-Karzai supporters from campaigning in town .
“ If anyone puts up pictures of the opposition presidential candidates , like we did a few days ago with 1000 pictures of Ashraf Ghani , they ’re all gone and taken down by the next day , ” one campaigners told me .
So not really a free and fair environment .
As the election day progressed , I started hearing reports that Razziq was influencing the voting .
At 4 pm when voting stopped , I received several credible reports that Razziq had sent his men round to every polling station in Spin Boldak and collected all the ballot boxes .
He then reportedly took them to his house — ‘ to keep them safe and secure ’ — and prevented election observers from entering .
The boxes were stuffed overnight , many claimed .
Again , I have no way of confirming any of this , but I can certainly imagine it happening .
Today just before stepping onto the plane I heard from a friend down in Spin Boldak that there were n’t necessarily extra votes cast but that all votes that were n’t for Karzai were invalidated ( i.e. multiple candidates were selected or some such trick ) , thus giving Karzai a 100 % taking down in Boldak .
These reports all seem pretty blatant and in the open to be wholly true , but given that so many people know about these events I imagine that Spin Boldak will be one of the most highly contested voting districts .
Local Kandahari Perspectives
The saddest thing about all that I described above was watching the faces of my friends — particularly Kandahar ’s youth — as they found out what was going on .
A great sense of disappointment darkened most of my conversations during the last few hours of polling and during the evening and next day .
People focused on some of the details , especially the non-indelible ink that had been promoted with such fanfare by the United Nations earlier that year .
People frequently blamed “ the foreigners ” for mismanaging things and allowing so much fraud and deception to take place .
Admittedly these days conspiracy theories about the invisible hand of ‘ the foreigners ’ are omnipresent in southern Afghanistan , but “ the farce of this year ’s election ” ( as one friend put it ) struck a nerve among those people who did want to vote , who did want a change , who did n’t have a direct stake in anyone ’s campaign .
I remember I sat at my desk in the evening waiting for some of the foreign institutions , embassies et cetera to make a comment worthy of the day .
Instead , we got Kai Eide , the UN special representative , offering his ‘ congratulations . ’
Slowly more internationals started voicing their happiness at how the election had gone .
Most seemed to take a deep breath that there were n’t more violent incidents around the country and that , at least in the public eye , the elections had passed more or less as planned .
A pity that the wishes of ordinary Afghans for a free and fair election were not heard …
Most of my friends down in Kandahar voiced concern at how the voting was being managed , with campaigners and observers inside polling centers .
The threat of violence was not the major factor in determining the low turnout , as I see it .
Rather , apathy among voters meant that only a very small number came out to exercise their right .
There had been such a huge buildup to the elections , in both Afghan and foreign media , that perhaps the only reaction to the day was inevitable disappointment .
Maybe the day could never have fulfilled all our expectations and hopes .
There was a sense that the election could possibly have been a moment where a change or a shift could have changed the trajectory of Afghanistan — I remember watching Afghans around the time Obama was elected and wonder how many of them had hoped Afghanistan could also have its own Obama moment .
For many in Kandahar , and , I imagine , in the districts as well , the provincial council elections were also very important .
From what friends of mine said to me yesterday , people seemed prepared to tolerate more ‘ dirty business ’ for the provincial council than for the presidential voting .
The voting was more of an approximation , they said , and offered a chance to shift the power balance in the province a little .
Nevertheless , watching the low turnout but knowing that the next days would see the ‘ Independent ’ Electoral Commission announce large numbers of voters was enough to make the staunchest optimist just a little bit despondent .
Predictions and Conclusions
It ’s too late for me to predict — as I was going to do — that Karzai will announce his victory ; he already did .
In the coming days a highly dubious turnout will be announced by Karzai and the IEC .
When the final results come out , Karzai will have won , and will have captured over 50 % of the votes .
Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah will go into overdrive for a while , but slowly deals will start to be made behind the scenes .
After several weeks of confusion , the foreign community will cave in ( it pretty much already has done so ) and validate the results .
This will , in turn , lead to further disillusionment with the foreign community .
To a certain extent , especially in Kandahar and the south , the damage is already done .
Even if the internationals were to have a change of heart and get serious , they ’re already being blamed for the failure of this election .
But of course there wo n’t be any serious outcries by the major voices of the international effort because too much is riding on this election passing , and passing without incident .
So we ’ll pick up the pieces and stumble onwards .
The change that people had hoped for did n’t happen .
It was denied them .
And despite all the hope and expectation of some kind of shift , we ’ll just continue forward down the same path we were going before , just now without something ahead of us to light the way forward .

Policio reports :
Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) received a handwritten note Thursday from Joint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Tom Barthold confirming the penalty for failing to pay the up to $ 1,900 fee for not buying health insurance .
Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in jail or a $ 25,000 penalty , Barthold wrote on JCT letterhead .
He signed it “ Sincerely , Thomas A. Barthold .
Two thoughts occur to me .
First , not everyone will have an easy time scraping up the money to pay , although I know some assistance is planned to be made available .
Secondly ( if they ca n’t pay $ 1,900 what are the chances they can pay $ 25,000 ? ) , can our overcrowded penal system handle the increased traffic ?
Should people who could n’t afford to pay be grouped with thieves , drug dealers , and worse ?
To me this type of penalty makes this less appealing than a fully paid public option ( as much as I oppose that ) .
What they should do instead , if they must do this at all , is to freely cover everyone with catastrophic insurance and let individuals buy their own “ other than catastrophic insurance ” on the proposed markets .
This should be without threat of legal penalty and with any available assistance , having the cost of the catastrophic coverage taken out of it .
Fining and imprisoning people for not buying into health care strikes me as against the principles of our nation .
A line was drawn in the sand last week – a response by the Federal Government to the State of Tennessee and their assertion of sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution .
( Editor ’s note : A similar response was sent to Montana Firearms licenses on 07 - 16-09 as well )
Part of a series of moves by states seeking to utilize the Tenth Amendment as a limit on Federal Power , the Tennessee State Senate approved Senate Bill 1610 ( SB1610 ) , the Tennesse Firearms Freedom Act , by a vote of 22 - 7 .
The House companion bill , HB1796 previously passed the House by a vote of 87- 1 .
Governor Breseden allowed the bill to become law without signing .
The law states that “ federal laws and regulations do not apply to personal firearms , firearm accessories , or ammunition that is manufactured in Tennessee and remains in Tennessee .
The limitation on federal law and regulation stated in this bill applies to a firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured using basic materials and that can be manufactured without the inclusion of any significant parts imported into this state . ”
At the time of passage through the TN House and Senate , Judiciary Chairman Mae Beavers had this to say -
“ Be it the federal government mandating changes in order for states to receive federal funds or the federal government telling us how to regulate commerce contained completely within this state – enough is enough .
Our founders fought too hard to ensure states ’ sovereignty and I am sick and tired of activist federal officials and judges sticking their noses where they do n’t belong . ”
The Federal Government , by way of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms expressed its own view of the Tenth Amendment this week when it issued an open letter to ‘ all Tennessee Federal Firearms Licensees ’ in which it denounced the opinion of Beavers and the Tennessee legislature .
ATF assistant director Carson W. Carroll wrote that ‘ Federal law supersedes the Act ’ , and thus the ATF considers it meaningless .

The ATF Letter to Tennessee Firearm Dealers :
Below is the full text of the letter sent last week by the ATF :
U.S. Department of Justice
Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco ,
Firearms and Explosives
Assistant Director
OPEN LETTER TO ALL TENNESSEE
FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSEES
The purpose of this letter is to provide guidance on your obligations as a Federal firearms licensee ( ” FFL ” ) .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ” ATF ” ) is dedicated to your success in meeting your requirements as a Federal firearms licensee .
The following guidance is intended to assist you in accomplishing this goal .
The passage of the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act , H.B. 1796 , 106th Leg. ( Tenn. 2009 ) 1796 ( ” Act ” ) , effective June 19 , 2009 , has generated questions from industry members as to how this State law may affect them while engaged in a firearms business activity .
The Act purports to exempt personal firearms , firearms accessories , and ammunition manufactured in the State , and which remain in the State , from most Federal firearms laws and regulations .
However , because the Act conflicts with Federal firearms laws and regulations , Federal law supersedes the Act , and all provisions of the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act , and their corresponding regulations , continue to apply .
As you may know , Federal law requires a license to engage in the business of manufacturing firearms or ammunition , or to deal in firearms , even if the firearms or ammunition remain within the same state .
All firearms manufactured by a licensee must be properly marked .
Additionally , each licensee must record the type , model , caliber or gauge , and serial number of each firearm manufactured or otherwise acquired , and the date such manufacture or other acquisition was made .
The information required must be recorded in the licensee ’s records not later than the seventh day following the date such manufacture or other acquisition was made .
Firearms transaction records and NICS background checks must be conducted prior to disposition of firearms to unlicensed persons .
These , as well as other Federal requirements and prohibitions , apply whether or not the firearms or ammunition have crossed state lines .
If you have any questions regarding the Federal firearms laws and regulations , please contact your local ATF office .
ATF works closely with the firearms industry and appreciates the important role the industry plays in combating violent crime .

On ABC’s This Week , Sen. John McCain defended Sarah Palin ’s claim that healthcare reform would result in death panels .
McCain argued that reform could lead to death panels , “ So what does , what does that lead to ?
Does n’t that lead to a possibility , at least opens the door to a possibility of rationing and decisions made such are made in other countries ? ”
When asked by host George Stephanopoulos if death panels were and extraordinary lie , McCain answered , Well , I think that what we are talking about here is do – are we going to have groups that actually advise people as these decisions are made later in life and … ” Stephanopoulos pointed out that this was n’t in the bill , but McCain kept trying , “ it ’s been taken out , but the way that it was written made it a little bit ambiguous .
And another thing … ”
Stephanopoulos again pointed out that this was n’t correct .
The provision was about end of life counseling .
McCain kept spinning , “ There was a provision in the bill that talks about a board that would decide the most effective measures to provide health care for people , OK ?
Now , we had amendments , we republican have said that in no way would that affect the decisions that the patients would make and their families .
That was rejected by the Democrats and the health committee . ”
Stephanopoulos pointed out , “ But that ’s not a death panel . ”

Then we got to the crux of the McCain argument that this kind of sort of could lead to death panels , “ So what does – what does that lead to ?
Does n’t that lead to a possibility , at least opens the door to a possibility of rationing and decisions made such are made in other countries ? ”
McCain was arguing that there are n’t death panels , but there could be someday .
I know McCain feels obligated to stand by his old running mate , but his argument makes no sense , unless you believe in some vast Obama conspiracy to kill the elderly .
McCain essentially admitted that there were no death panels , but felt the need to keep spreading the fear .
This is n’t very much straight talk from the former captain of the straight talk express .
Since he lost the election last year , McCain has descended into the realm of a partisan hack .
Maybe he is bitter about losing the election , but to argue a point that has been so widely debunked in such a deeply flawed manner is not very representative of the kind of senator that McCain once was .
I know that he is facing a right wing primary challenger next year , but McCain seems to have completely abandoned any independence that he once had .
Financial and economic problems are bad enough , but , GBP is expected to see renewed threats from Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœH1N1 .
This week alone itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s reported that there has been +55 k new cases , with 29 deaths to date , and expectations that by Aug.
+100 k Britons will be infected Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdailyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Health agencies are estimating that this could result in +65 k deaths .
Kicking the currency while its down is the IMF , who has publicly questioned and vocalized its concerns on the state of the public finances on the currency .
To think we thought it was safe to go back into the water !
Do not be surprised to see North American bourses underperform on the back of the bombings in Jakarta and BOFA and CITIÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s earnings .
They are the most unlikely candidates to be the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgo - to backupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ for Goldman and JPMorgan !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœwhippy and again illiquidÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢
O/N .
Buyer beware !
Do not trust the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœseasonalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s claims data .
Despite initial claims coming in with a lower than expected print ( +522 k vs. +569 ) and continuing claims plummeting ( +6.273 m vs. +6.915 m ) many analysts are dismissing the report with respect to little faith in the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstandard seasonal adjustment factorsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ that are being applied in this unique environment .
Historically itÃ¢â‚¬â„ ¢s unusual to have a period this time of year where seasonally adjusted initial claims collapse , while unadjusted rises .
The same can be said for continuing claims .
The reason being this month tends to carry Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœauto sectorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ shutdowns for their retooling stage for next years production .
Economists will preach that those seasonal adjustments are based on Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœnormal conditionsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
This year being an anomaly , where layoff have occurred throughout the year and more intense since May .
Conclusion , any improvement in the data is overstated because of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœseasonalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ hiccup .
On the face of it , the jobÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s situation is probably beyond the worst rate of losses , but and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a big but , losses remain heightened beyond what is being interpreted !
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.42 % , GBP - 0.88 % , CHF - 0.42 % and lower against JPY +0.10 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.18 % and AUD - 0.69 % .
Despite May Canadian factory sales dropping - 6 % ( double expectation ) earlier in the week , data south of the border has helped push the currency to its highest level in over a month and outperform all G10 currencies .
However , further fears of another financial flop had investors yesterday paring higher yielding currency position and seeking some risk aversion protection .
Better than expected unemployment numbers , combined with a more optimistic BOC business survey and a rocking real estate sector have the Canada Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœBearsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ contemplating throwing in the towel .
Technically below 1.1144 , the currency will once again be back in Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœBullÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ territory .
The looniesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appreciation has been violent and swift .
Do not be surprised to see some sort of retracement and USD profit taking .
This morning investors will have to chew on Canadian CPI data for fodder !
The AUD fell in the O/N session and again pared some of its weekly advance vs. both the USD and JPY , after two explosions in Jakarta prompted investors to shift some of their portfolio in risk aversion mode by purchasing US Treasuries .
Depending on how equities and commodities do in the North American session , some investors are seeing this as an opportunity to own the currency ( 0.8006 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 61.64 down - 38 c ) .
Higher equities means higher oil prices .
Higher risk tolerance means a weaker USD , equals higher oil prices .
A fall in inventories translates into higher oil prices .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœblack - stuffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ also got a helping hand from Roubini stating that the recession Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœcouldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ end this year .
Already this weeks both the EIA and API reports showed a bigger than forecasted decline in inventories on the back of refineries increasing their operating rates .
Stocks fell - 2.81 m barrels to +344.5 m w/w , vs. an expected drop of - 2.1 m .
Refineries operated at +87.9 % of capacity , the most in 11 - months .
On the other hand , gas inventories climbed + 1.44 m barrels to +214.6 m , the highest in 3 - months vs. an expected increase of +0.875 m .
On the face of it a bullish report , couple this with NigeriaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s main rebel group ( MEND ) threatening to end its 60 - day cease - fire gave the black stuff extra legs yesterday .
On - going militia action has cut production by 20 % in the region .
Oil has retreated 14 % from this monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s high .
Technically , prices had got ahead of fundamentals in a big way over the past few months , and recent movements seem to have filled in the gap .
Of course recent strength is highly dependent on advancing equities .
Gold managed to pare some of its initial losses yesterday on the back of the USD , however higher oil prices boosted the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ sÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ appeal as an alternative investment and hedge against inflation ( $ 936 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 9,395 up +51 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,001 up + 44 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,385 + 24 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 2 bp yesterday ( 3.55 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .

See this is actually the sequel to Whitehurst 's famed " PUNCH - YOU-IN - THE - FACE TUNNEL , " where he says he punched some aspiring model in the face and broke her nose and they 're still in court like years later but hey , what sort of tunnel did she think she was getting into ?!!
Anyhow we very much encourage you to read this entire Artlurker .com interview with Whitehurst , cause we 're not technically accredited art experts , so far be it from us to say where , exactly , the Rape Tunnel fits in " the canon " of Modern Rape Art .
But before you book your tickets to Columbus , ladies ( or gents !
Young or old !
He 's taking all comers ! ) , remember :
I want to make it clear that I plan to make the experience as unpleasant as I possibly can to anyone who dares to crawl through the tunnel .
I will try to the best of my ability to make them regret their decision .
We are totally taking a field trip .

UPDATE : A tipster notes that Googling " Richard Whitehurst artist " turns up virtually no background on the guy .
Likewise , the interviewer " Sheila Zareno " seems to be absent from Google .
So this could all be hoax !

What 's crazier ?
Having opposed birth control for married couples , or thinking that there 's nothing extreme about having opposed it ?
Transcript :
WALLACE : You criticize tax credits for child care .
And you even opposed a Supreme Court ruling legalizing birth control for married couples .
Mr. McDonnell , is n’t that a pretty radical agenda ?
MCDONNELL : No .
I think those are a couple of quotes out of a 100 - page document , Chris , and what the whole purpose of the — of the thesis was to say , " Look , families are the bedrock of society . "
...
WALLACE : In fact , we checked the record .
As a legislator , you voted against a resolution that would have called for ending wage discrimination based on gender .
You voted against extending child care services .
And you voted against extending or requiring health insurance plans to cover birth control .
So it ’s not just the thesis .
MCDONNELL : Well , that ’s — you know , Chris , I ’ve had 100,000 votes in the general assembly .
As attorney general , 90 percent of the bills that I introduced got passed .
My opponent voted for 98 percent of them .
I think you have to look at the entire record .
I ’m pro-life .
I believe the government should protect — should protect life .
My opponent ’s got a very different view .
My planer weighs roughly a metric ton , and is a real pain to move and use on the floor .
I built a ~ 10 ” tall rolling base for it so I could position it where I need it , and the whole thing tucks perfectly under one end of one of my work tables .
I got a little bit fancy with the coloring , but I ’m just a little tired of all the browns and yellows of shop stuff , and wanted a little splash of color in there – something that matched the planer , so I chose colors found in it .
There are almost no exposed horizontal surfaces , with the top just fitting around the edge of the bolted - on planer , so it should n’t get obscenely dusty .
Just ‘ very ’ :)
The sides , face frame , back , and drawer front are all 3/4 ” poplar .
The top is 3/4 ” baltic birch .
The drawer walls are somewhere around 1/2 ” ply .
The drawer bottom is 1/4 ” hardboard .
The wheels are 2.5 ” tall swivel casters .
All of these things – including the drawer slides – were scrap , or unused parts left over from other projects .
The only new things , outside of Minwax stain stuff and flat black latex paint , with which I covered the Minwax Ebony stain ( looked bad ) , are the pull , about $ 7 from Home Depot , and 4 carriage bolts long enough to mount the planer to the base .
It was great to spend so little on this .
Joinery included rabbeted sides for the drawer walls , pocket hole screws via the Kreg K3 Master System for the carcase and face frame , and a few wood screws to hold the drawer front onto the drawer box .
My finger is in the last pic to show that it fits by about 1/2 ” under the long work table .
That ’s about as tall as I could reasonably make it .
I ’m excited to start using the planer again in future projects .
It ’s been too hard to get to for me to bother with it for too long now .
It always wanted to become a surface to store things on and around .
No more !
I can already move around the shop with greater ease just having this one bulky item tucked out of the way .
So many more shop aids left to build now .
The build is documented in this blog series .
All of the photos ( a few not in the blog ) are in this flickr set .
Thanks for looking !

The Haskell Formlets library ( described here ) provides an elegant abstraction that takes the tedium out of HTML form generation , validation , and processing ( not to mention make it less error prone ) .
This abstraction allows you to develop HTML form UIs while still thinking in and working with haskell 's type system and data structures .
It also fits very naturally with Happstack 's ideas about using in - memory state to leverage the pure type system .
One important aspect of form abstraction is the handling of lists .
Dynamic lists in particular are a bit more of a challenge because they require Javascript to handle the dynamic creation / removal of form fields .
Until recently , the Formlets library has had poor support for list formlets .
At the recent Hac - Phi Haskell hackathon , Chris Eidhoff and I worked on filling this gap .
We made great progress at the hackathon , and it only took a little more work after the hackathon to finish the functionality we set out to solve .
I would like to provide some help to potential users via a description some of the issues and design decisions we encountered .
Design Issues
Default Values
One critical aspect of form handling is the ability to specify default values for form fields .
I encountered this issue very soon after I started using Formlets .
If you want to edit the state of stored objects through an HTML form , you will probably want to be able to create a form where the object 's current values for all the fields are already filled in .
Then the user just changes the appropriate fields and does n't have to re-enter all the other data .
The Form type by itself is inadequate for this purpose .
We added a new type alias to server this purpose : > type Formlet xml m a = Maybe a ->
Form xml m a
In my experience , working with Formlet instead of Form will make things easier in the long run .
There are certainly simple situations where Form is sufficient , but Formlet is an important abstraction to have around .
Error Handling
The second important issue with list formlets in particular is error handling .
When a single field has an error , the HTML whole form usually needs to be regenerated with an appropriate error indication .
This is especially important in the context of list formlets .
Type Signature
Before continuing , we need to understand the type signature of a list formlet .
Ultimately a list formlet will have the type Form xml m [ a ] .
But we do n't want to construct these formlets manually .
We would like to be able to specify the formlet for a single item and have a function that automatically constructs a formlet representing the list of items .
In the old version of formlets , this function was called massInput .
We might define massInput as follows :
> massInput :: Form xml m a -> Form xml m [ a ]
But this is n't quite right because , as described above , we need the ability to specify default values in a list form .
Here 's where our Formlet type synonym becomes nice :
> massInput :: Formlet xml m a -> Formlet xml m [ a ]
Implementation Possibilities
There are two common approaches to representing a list of items : arrays and linked lists .
The same is true of lists of fields in HTML .
We could do a linked list implementation by adding a hidden element to each list item and have the value of the hidden element somehow tell us how to determine the name of the field (s ) for the next item in the list .
A hidden item with an empty value would indicate the end of the list .
This is the approach used by the old massInput implementation .
Its hidden items contained the prefix to the names of all the fields for the next item .
The other possibility would be to just use a predictable numbering scheme for the field names of list items .
Then , instead of traversing next pointers , we would just increment through the form values until we find one that does n't appear in submitted data .
It was n't until after I did a significant amount of work with the linked list approach that I realized it has a fatal flaw .
When a list item does n't validate properly , massInput is n't able to recover the value of the hidden " next pointer " for that item .
This means that if a user enters a list of 10 items , but makes a mistake in the first item , then the resulting error form will only have one item in the list .
An error in any item will require the user to re-enter all subsequent items in the list .
If you are using lists of complex items , this can be a lot of work and frustration for the user .
New and Improved
The new version of massInput fixes these problems .
It uses the array approach to avoid the problem of vanishing elements when a form has errors , and it allows you to specify a list of default values for the list .
This massInput function is in the Text .
Formlets package , and provides the core dynamic list functionality .
We also introduced a new package Text .
Formlets .
MassInput with some higher level convenience functionality .
In that package , we include javascript code to drive the dynamic " Add Item " and " Remove Item " buttons .
This comes with another massInput function which bundles the core massInput with the add / remove buttons .
Many applications will require javascript that is customized to their HTML structure , but the supplied code should be suitable for basic out of the box use as well as provide an example from which to guide customization .
The last code has not been uploaded to Hackage yet , but it is available from the Github repository .
If you have any questions , comments , or improvements please let us know .

It 's official !
NASA is a jobs program .
I 've been listening to an audio recording of the most recent public meeting of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee ( Augustine Commission ) , held on August 12th , 2009 in Washington , D.C.
This is scheduled to be the last public meeting before the final report is issued , although there is an option for another public session should one prove necessary .
In the instant meeting , several “ integrated options ” ( PPT ) were presented , then a budget and schedule analysis was done for each under various funding assumptions , and the options ranked according to twelve criteria ranging from crew safety and mission success to expanding human civilisation beyond the Earth .
Wanda Austin presented the “ Evaluation Measures and Criteria ” ( PPT ) to be used in this ranking .
The last of these was titled “ Workforce Impact ( NASA and Industry ) ” , slide 16 in the presentation , which appears below ( I 've cropped and scaled the slide to fit on the page , but nothing other than the slide number has been elided ) .
As I was listening to the audio of the presentation , I happened to be walking rather briskly in increasingly intense rain in the hope of outrunning an approaching thunderstorm , but I almost tripped over my jaw when I heard the discussion of this slide .
Now , “ critical skills ” , “ industrial base ” , and “ workforce retention ” have been frequently - mentioned items in the committee 's deliberations to date , so I suppose I should have seen this coming , but it 's still one of the starkest illustrations I 've encountered why government programs and NASA in particular will never accomplish the goal of making humans a spacefaring species .
It 's been a commonplace observation for decades that a principal reason access to space is so horrifically expensive is that the way NASA and other government programs go about it requires a “ standing army ” of tens of thousands of civil servants and contractor employees who have to be paid regardless of the flight rate .
This creates a huge fixed cost component in the operations budget , which cannot be reduced by economising on hardware costs or launching more frequently .
Consequently , most “ new space ” concepts , including my own modest proposal from 1993 , have focussed on reducing the size of the standing army to a bare minimum .
If a crew of just a few people could launch a liquid - fuelled ICBM in the 1960s , why should it take thousands of people to operate space vehicles today , especially given the progress in computing and automation made in the intervening years ?
Well , here 's the answer — because NASA is a jobs program , not a space program !
Its purpose is to employ civil servants and industry contractor personnel , carefully spread around congressional districts and pouring taxpayer funds into their economies .
Look at how the Augustine Commission is scoring the various options they 're evaluating on their consequences for the workforce .
In these criteria , a higher number is good ; a lower number is bad .
So the best possible outcome for an option is if it increases the size of the standing army by more than 10 % , and it is considered the worst possible demerit if it shrinks the standing army by greater than 10 % !
Is it any wonder that all of the options presented in the “ Scenario Affordability Analysis ” ( PPT ) by Sally Ride have huge operational costs on the right side , even after all the design , development , test , and evaluation work is completed ?
Consequently , any option which scores highly on the “ Workforce Impact ” criterion will necessarily result in a program which employs a vast number of people to permit a handful of civil servants to fly in space infrequently .
This may seem counterproductive if you believe that NASA 's mission is the exploration and expansion of the human presence into space , but for a jobs program , it 's “ mission accomplished ” .

August 9 , 2009 --
We face a climate crisis and something needs to change .
The world ’s resources are finite , as is the amount of destruction humans can do to the planet if we are to survive .
There is a debate in the environment movement about whether or not curbing population is an essential part of the solution .
We have a decade , maybe a decade and a half , to transform our current relationship with the planet .
Of course , the starting point for environmentalists cannot be solutions .
We first need to identify the cause of the crisis before we can know how to fight it .
People who see limiting population as essential to solving the climate crisis argue the cause of environmental degradation , at least in part , is overpopulation .
Most “ populationists ” argue there are already too many human beings on the planet to provide for everyone ’s basic needs .
All contend that curbing population growth or decreasing population is some or all of the solution to climate change and to the fact that the basic needs of many people are not satisfied .
In Green Left Weekly # 805 , Jane Addison wrote : “ To address [ the sustainability ] imbalance , we have two options …
On the one hand , we reduce the amount that each of us consumes .
On the other , we reduce the number of us consuming . ”
Addison argued that the best way to balance the sustainability equation is to stop population growth because “ it is morally wrong to deny developing countries — the world ’s majority population — a standard of living equal to that of richer countries ” .
Similarly , in the April 15 Canberra Times , Dr Mark Diesendorf wrote : “ Greenhouse gas emissions , peak oil , urban traffic congestion , air and water pollution , loss of soils and destruction of biodiversity are driven by three factors : population , consumption per person and technological impact .
A doubling of any one of these factors doubles the environmental impact . ”
Populationists thus draw a direct correlation between population size and environmental destruction : the more people , the more pollution .
Generally , the argument is nuanced with an acknowledgement that per person greenhouse gas emissions vary a lot .
For example , Australia ’s per person greenhouse gas emissions are nearly double the OECD average and more than four times higher than the world average .
Population and environmental destruction
Concrete examples disprove the assumed connection between population and environment destruction .
For example , Japan ’s population peaked at the end of 2004 at about 127.8 million and is now in decline .
According to the January 2 British Guardian : “ Health ministry records estimated the population fell by 51,000 in 2008 .
The number of deaths hit a record of 1.14 million ... and the number of births totalled 1.09 million . ”
However , ABC Online said on November 12 last year the Japanese government had announced that Japan ’s greenhouse gas emissions hit a record high in the year ending March 2008 .
Cuba ’s example makes this same point , but for the inverse reason .
From 1990 to 2004 , the Cuban population grew by about 1 million or 8.5 % .
For the same period , total carbon dioxide emissions fell from 32 million tones to 25.8 million tones ; a 19.4 % .
So , a decline in population has no direct link to a decline in emissions .
Population growth does not always increase carbon emissions therefore a decline in population does not automatically lead to a cut in emissions .
‘ Consumers ’ are n’t to blame
Addison calls for pollution control through consumption reduction , but misses the point that under the current economic system production is n't for consumption , it 's for profit .
Populationists tend to reduce the complexity of modern human society down to individual “ consumers ” , as though we all have equal choice and buying power , and therefore equal responsibility to reduce our consumption .
This entirely ignores the fact that we are not all equal consumers .
Capitalism ensures that a tiny minority of the world ’s population makes the big decisions about how things are produced — against the interests of the majority of humanity and the planet .
This ruling minority has an interest in keeping environmentally damaging industries in business .
Their huge control over the market limits consumer choices dramatically .
Changing consumer habits has little impact on this reality .
You ca n’t replace a coal - fired power station with a wind farm by green choices in the supermarket aisle .
Consumption rates are not the cause of the problem — the methods of production and who makes the decisions over it are .
Development and consumption
Linking development levels directly to consumption rates also leads to false solutions .
The argument assumes that countries cannot sustainably develop ; that affluence necessarily leads to increased environmental destruction ; that production is based on human need and consumption , and that the nature of production cannot change .
None of this is true .
According to a 2006 report published by the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , Cuba has sustainable development .
Cuba satisfies the minimum criteria in terms of both the United Nations Human Development Index and ecological footprint , measured as average energy and resources consumed per person .
Yet , Cuba is a poor , Third World country .
According to the UN , GDP per person in 2007 was US $ 4641 .
Yet 2007 World Bank statistics show that life expectancy is higher and infant mortality lower in Cuba than the US , with a GDP per person of $ 45,047 .
There is no direct link between affluence and consumption .
So why are developed countries generally much higher consumers ?
Production and distribution
Populationists reduce us to individual consumers , but we can only consume what is available .
Within the current undemocratic system , the vast majority of us have no say in what or how things are produced .
Everything produced , and the means of production , is owned and controlled by capitalists .
The rest of us have to work to make a living .
Meanwhile , producers use advertising and the media to tell us we need two cars and a large house , that we need to consume beyond satisfying basic needs .
Likewise , the profit motive plays a role in determining population growth .
It is profitable to exploit people in the Third World ; to take their collective natural resources so that they must work to sustain themselves .
All the while , profiteers pay them only a fraction of their worth .
Due to this process , people in underdeveloped countries are forced to have the maximum number of children — future workers — to provide them with the greatest possible security later in life .
We live in a time of abundance , with the potential to produce enough for everyone .
However , distribution of food is on a profit basis , and people starve needlessly .
For example , by 2006 the number of obese people surpassed the number of starving people .
This was not because world hunger decreased .
In fact , the number of those hungry is at an all time high .
It is because the big multinational food companies are out to make a profit , not to feed the hungry .
So production for profit , not a lack of resources , is the main cause of starvation .
Under capitalism , waste is immense .
In February , the United Nations Environment Program released a report that put food waste and losses in the US at around 40 - 50 % .
It said close to one third of all food bought in Britain is thrown away and that , in Australia , food waste makes up close to half of all landfill .
The problem is not that there is n’t enough food to feed the world ’s population , but that it ’s more profitable to waste food than get it to the people who need it most .
Those who see limiting population as a solution to the ecological crisis fail to tackle the cause of climate change at its roots : the environmentally destructive way things are produced and distributed under capitalism .
The problem is not that goods are produced , but how they ’re produced .
The most profitable means of production — at least for short - term profit — tend to be the most environmentally destructive .
But under capitalism , we have little choice about how environmentally unfriendly most of what we consume is .
Recycled products , for example , tend to be more expensive than products made from non-renewable sources .
For example , an aluminium can made from recycled aluminium has , in the course of its production , contributed substantially less greenhouse gas emissions than a can made from newly mined ore .
We could say that there are too many people are buying canned drinks , or limiting how many cans each person can “ consume ” , or we can target the corporations producing the soft drinks , bring their factories under democratic control and convert their production to sustainable , renewable practices .
The system itself does not allow for sustainable development .
Unless we challenge production and distribution , we cannot solve the environmental crisis .
Migration
Addison and Sustainable Population Australia argue that we must prevent migration from Third World to First World countries because the carbon footprint of these people would increase .
This is discriminatory and incorrect .
It assumes current production methods cannot , or will not , change .
It also implies people born in poorer countries have less right to a decent standard of living .
Rather than deny people access to the same standard of living , should n’t we force a change in production methods so that a comfortable lifestyle for everyone is sustainable ?
No time for false solutions
Of course there are limits to population and consumption .
The Earth ’s resources are finite .
But its carrying capacity is dynamic .
Earth could not sustain 6 billion people with Australia ’s current production practices and greenhouse gas emissions per capita .
However , in the same scenario , if Australia moved to a zero-emissions economy , the world could support a much bigger population than 6 billion , with a massive increase in global development .
Population arguments fail to recognise that the cause of the climate crisis is profit - driven production and that population growth , consumption and barriers to technological development and implementation are all products of a system driven by profit .
We do not have time to spend demanding false solutions to symptoms rather than causes .
We have a 10 - year window in which to radically reduce emissions .
The environment movement cannot afford to spend time and energy on false solutions .

Even Fox News Digs Summer Streets
How much of a non-event was this year ’s Summer Streets in terms of media critique ?
In this Fox News piece , via Crooks and Liars , the story is n’t traffic tie - ups or wacky spandex - clad elitists or howling business owners , but the fact that more everyday New Yorkers are taking to the streets on two wheels .
Summer Streets , it seems , has become a mainstream event in just its second year .
Reported the Downtown Express at the beginning of August :
" I thought last year it was going to cause havoc in the community , " said John Fratta , chairperson of Community Board 1 ’s Seaport / Civic Center Committee .
" For the most part I was pretty pleased .
It was a nice event . "
He said he supports the event this year .
The Fox segment does refer to the questionable Hunter College study on unsafe cyclist behavior ( without acknowledging more revealing data on the causes of bike - car collisions ) , and there ’s a completely unsupported ticker squib that attributes complaints over spending on bike infrastructure to unnamed " critics . "
But these feel like token attempts to " balance " an otherwise positive story .
Who knows , maybe in a year or two even Steve Cuozzo will have to re-read his old columns to remember what he hated so much about car - free Times Square .

It ’s not good politics to attack “ Grandma , ” * but …
Everyone has noticed that many of the opponents of health care reform are the elderly and near - elderly ( especially the older batch of Baby Boomers ) .
They rail against “ government - run health care ” – but of course , that ’s exactly what they enjoy – and enjoy it they do , professing higher levels of satisfaction with their insurance than any other group .
So why are they so anxious about health care reform then ?
It ’s simple :
Their rants about “ tyranny ” are just a cover for the fact that they realize their health insurance could barely get better – and so they have little incentive to support any changes , except to benefit their children .
The system we have now works well for only a few groups of people ; it works poorly for many people ( who lack choice and security while paying large sums ) and not at all for about 47 million .
It is estimated that 18,000 Americans die each year because they lack health insurance .
Insurance premiums are rising exponentially and are forcing companies to forgo giving their employees raises .
Millions more each year enter the rolls of the uninsured as fewer and fewer can afford it .
Those who have health insurance often fear what would happen if they lose it and have little choice in picking their plan .
Our current system is self - evidently unsustainable .
Yet those who benefit under our current system – especially those with government - provided Medicare coverage – are adamantly opposed to any changes , even should they benefit the rest of us .
This is the classic Baby Boomer mentality :
Put off every difficult decision and wearying task to the next generation ; sacrifice nothing yourself , take everything .
It is this attitude that George W. Bush with his massive tax cuts and massive spending increases signified ; and it is this attitude that leads men and women enjoying government health care financed by the rest of us to adamantly refuse to even consider changes to our unsustainable health care system that would benefit their children based on the fear that any change might hurt them ( even if it is designed to avoid any such thing ) .
There are other reasons to oppose health care reform – ideological reasons to oppose any government involvement and pragmatic ones to oppose these particular reforms – but the “ movement ” has clearly been dominated by these selfish Baby Boomers concerned , as always , only for themselves .
Here ’s my message to those selfish opponents of health care reform :
Shame on you .
You ’re not even being asked to sacrifice anything .
You only oppose this out of the fear that you someday might be so asked .
Your parents sacrificed for you – and left you with a better world .
They paid 90 % tax rates , went to war , worked hard and made America the most powerful nation in the world .
Now , you wo n’t even support simple reforms .
Shame on you …
* And mine is great , so y’all better leave her out of this .

Note : Here is a Problem Bank List ( Unofficial ) as of Aug 14th ( sortable ) .
The FDIC closed five more banks on Friday , and that brings the total FDIC bank failures to 77 in 2009 .
The following graph shows bank failures by week in 2009 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Note : Week 1 on graph ends Jan 9th .
The pace has really picked up recently , with the FDIC seizing almost 5 banks per week in July and August , and with 4 1 / 2 months to go , it seems 150 bank failures this year is likely .
The current pace suggests there will be more failures in 2009 than in the early years of the S&L crisis .
From 1982 thorough 1984 there were about 100 failures per year , and then the number of failures really increased as the 2nd graph shows .
There were 28 weeks during the S&L crisis when regulators closed 10 or more banks , and the peak was April 20 , 1989 with 60 bank closures ( there were 7 separate weeks with more than 30 closures in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s ) .
The 2nd graph covers the entire FDIC period ( annually since 1934 ) .
For a graph that includes the 1920s and early ' 30s ( before the FDIC was enacted ) see the 3rd graph here .
Of course the number of banks is n't the only measure .
Many banks today have more branches , and far more assets and deposits .
Colonial Bank had almost $ 25 billion in assets when it was seized yesterday .
Guaranty ( Texas , with close to $ 15.4 billion in assets ) and Corus ( $ 7.7 billion ) are on the ropes , and the dollars could really add up .
The FDIC era source data is here - including by assets ( in most cases ) - under Failures and Assistance Transactions
The pre-FDIC data is here .
A naked , blindfolded man crouches on the ground , as a uniformed soldier kicks him in the head then abruptly ends his life with a point - blank rifle shot .
Other bodies lie nearby , their blood staining the earth around them .
The video , aired by Britain 's Channel 4 news , comes with a warning to viewers of " extremely disturbing scenes . "
It shows alleged killings of unarmed Tamils by Sri Lankan soldiers during their military assault on Tiger - held areas last January .
And it has touched off a new political battle over the Sri Lankan government 's actions as it drove the separatist militants – and thousands of Tamil civilians – into a narrow strip of coastal land where the fighters were defeated last May .
" I had to force myself to watch this video , " says Harini Sivalingam , policy director of the Toronto - based Canadian Tamil Congress .
" But it shows what we have known all along .
This is the smoking gun . "
The Sri Lankan government strongly denies that .
It says no summary executions or other atrocities have taken place , calling the footage a fake and insisting it was " doctored " by pro-Tiger advocates .
" It 's a sad day for independent journalism , " said Bandula Jayasekara , Sri Lanka 's consul general in Toronto .
" We have to ask Channel 4 for the proof .
After all , people can say they climbed Mount Everest , but where is the proof of that ? "
Sri Lankan army spokesman Brig .
Udaya Nanayakkara gave a tougher response .
" This video has been made to discredit the armed forces , " he said , adding it was filmed " at a time when the Tigers , too , were operating dressed in Sri Lankan military uniforms . "
Channel 4 correspondent Jonathan Miller , who presented the video Tuesday , said the material was obtained from the press freedom group Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka , which got access to it months after the alleged killings , from the cellphone of a soldier at the scene .
In an email to the Star , the Berlin - based group said it " stands firmly ( by ) the authenticity of the clip . "
It called the government 's denials " routine . "
The organization said the video was taken at a time when the Sri Lankan government had barred journalists from the conflict zone , but that it shows the " reality of the behaviour of government forces . "
The soldiers shown on the video were speaking Sinhala , the language of majority Sinhalese Sri Lankans , it added .
" From the casual nature of the conversations and the fact that it is taking place in an open area and in broad daylight , it can be surmised that these are not extraordinary acts by rogue elements carried out without permission from the top leadership . "
In New York , Human Rights Watch 's legal and policy director , James Ross , said the original version of the video was more graphic .
" These were blindfolded individuals whose hands were tied .
The fact that they were naked males makes it unlikely that they were combat deaths . "
And , he added , the journalists ' group that relayed the video is " not a Tamil group , but a multi-ethnic group of exiled journalists .
They are new , but well regarded . "
Although the video's authenticity could not be conclusively verified , Ross said " it could be a very serious atrocity , and there is a real need for an investigation into this and other possible war crimes . "
A UN special rapporteur who has made similar recommendations said the Sri Lankan government has not followed up on its own efforts to probe past allegations of disappearances and executions .
" My report in 2005 already indicated significant numbers of alleged killings , but commissions of inquiry set up by the government have led nowhere , " said Philip Alston , a law professor at New York University .
" The approach they 've taken , of total denial , has been very successful so far . "
The netroots has made a huge stand for health care reform and we 're not sitting around doing nothing .
Blue America hit Blanche Lincoln hard which forced her to write an op -ed in Arkansas to try and redefine her position and now the PCCC and DFA just hit Ben Nelson in an action called : Health care Ca n't Wait .
Lincoln , who is up for re election took an approach in which she informed her constituents that she 's considering the public option now which is a good start , but Ben 's response was to cry , stomp his feet and declare that health care reform will be killed if Americans stand up and demand that he be part of the solution .
Senator Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) lashed out Friday at the ads being run against his position on health care reform in his home state , saying they would backfire -- and might even derail the entire reform process .
In a statement issued late in the afternoon by Nelson 's office , spokesman Jake Thompson warned that if the new series of ads calling out the Senator 's " stalling " on reform were " an indication of the politics going into August , then health care reform may be dead by the end of August . "
" Nebraskans do n't need outside special interest groups telling them what to think .
Senator Nelson has nothing but praise for Nebraska groups working toward health care reform .
Unfortunately , he says , these outside groups undermine the sincere and dedicated efforts of people in our state , " Thompson wrote .
" Recently , similar ads have run in Nebraska .
Those ads by other special interests prompted hundreds of Nebraskans to call our offices , with 9 to 1 urging Senator Nelson to do exactly the opposite of what the special interest group wanted .
In short , the ads backfired . "
Politicians who dare to say that they will kill health care because the American people want change just proves our point about the gasbags that reside in Washington that rule our country for themselves and not for the people they were elected to represent .
Olive Willis :
They seem to think that the support they got in 2006 and beyond is going to keep them up if they just have a ( D ) behind their names .
Conservative democrats who obstruct meaningful progress in Washington are the political equivalent of Bush Republicans , and they ’ll be treated that way .
Do your job , Senator .
We will not back down and we will not go away .
Blanche Lincoln will hear from us shortly too .
PCCC and DFA are doing their part and so are we .
Please donate to Blue America 's Health Care Choice so we can keep the pressure on .
Disney 's Japan unit has embarked on an experiment at once fascinating and sad : bundling microSD cards with Hollywood popcorn fare like the National Treasure series and Pirates of the Caribbean .
The cards will contain digital copies of the films meant to be viewed on mobile phones and other portable devices ... for an additional ten bucks .
Beginning this fall , Disney will sell a line of its films with both a DVD and a microSD card inside the package .
According to Reuters , it can be had for the low , low price of � 4,935 ( $ 53 ) — a mere � 1,000 ( $ 11 ) more than the DVD alone .
The numbers seem a little odd given that Amazon.
co.jp is already selling Pirates of the Caribbean DVDs for around � 1,200 , but the real story here is the charge for format - shifting .
It has long been apparent that the movie and music industries want to avoid the situation that the music industry found itself in with the compact disk : offering unencrypted digital content that can easily and legally be format - shifted onto computers , iPods , and cell phones .
Much better , from their perspective , to charge once for an album or movie , then charge again to watch the same digital data on a cell phone ( and then again to use it as a ringtone ) .
Given how simple conversion among digital formats is , however , something more was needed to avoid the " buy it once and move to all your devices " mentality of the CD .
That something was DRM .
There 's nothing especially sacred about format - shifting ; media buyers have long recognized the need to pay for certain changes in format ( LPs to CDs , for instance ) .
And of course there 's the convenience of paying extra for a pre-formatted film that does n't require and ripping or tinkering with convertor programs .
But having the data right there on a disc or a computer and having to 1 ) pay extra or 2 ) break the law in order to move it to a different screen that you own is exasperating .
Disney Japan 's desire to make some extra profit from formatting the same film two different ways is commendable from a business perspective , but consumers need to watch out lest the format - shifting rug be pulled out from beneath them .
Once again , an anonymous Best Buy employee has come through with some new Zune HD details , and this one 's infinitely more tangible than a computer screen .
Pictures of an official display sent to Gizmodo seem to all but confirm its street date will be September 15th , just one week past what we heard yesterday .
Pre-orders require a $ 25 deposit , but as for the full price , the best we 've got right now are those $ 220 / $ 280 estimates from yesterday . :
If you needed any more reason to take September 15th off from work , Buy.com has a Zune HD countdown leading to that very day .
Huzzah !
Thanks ,
Stephen !
WASHINGTON  Sonia Sotomayor took the judicial oath on Saturday , becoming the first Hispanic and the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court .
At just past 11 a.m. , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered a pair of oaths to her in two private ceremonies at the Supreme Court building , completing her ascent to a life - tenured position as the nation ’s 111th justice  the first to be nominated by a Democratic president since 1994 .
In the first ceremony , she took the standard oath affirmed by all federal employees , swearing to “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
Only the chief justice , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , Justice Sotomayor ’s immediate family , Judge Robert Katzmann of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , members of the chief justice ’s staff and a court photographer attended this ceremony .
Her mother , Celina Sotomayor , held a Bible for the ritual .
They then walked to the court ’s East Conference Room for the judicial oath , joined by several dozen friends and family members , where Justice Sotomayor swore to “ administer justice without respect to persons , and do equal right to the poor and to the rich , and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me ” under the Constitution and laws of the United States .
The leader of the British National Party , Nick Griffin , has defended his party 's policies on race and immigration , after it won its first European Parliament seat .
The BNP gained more than 120,000 votes in the Yorkshire and Humber region , with Andrew Brons named as an MEP .
Speaking to the BBC's David Dimbleby , Mr Griffin claimed people had voted BNP because racism in this country is " overwhelmingly directed " at whites like himself .
SlashGear Review : Khet , the laser strategy game
Sometime back in 2005 I came across a game called Deflexion .
I ca n’t remember where I saw it , I ca n’t remember exactly when , but I do remember thinking “ Wow , I really have to own this game ! ”
Deflexion was all about lasers and mirrors – bouncing a beam of light around a chequers - style board using mirrored pieces , trying to plan the best pathway so as to hit your opponents king .
I emailed its makers – Del Segura and Luke Hooper , together with their tutor Dr Michael Larson – to see whether it was available here in the UK , only to find that they were still looking for a distributor .
Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago , and imagine my coquettish excitement at seeing the game – now called Khet – on UK site Firebox.com .
A few emails later and I had a copy of the original Deflexion game in my freshly - washed hands .
Deflexion , as my sample is branded , is now Khet on both sides of the Atlantic ; I ’ll point out any minor differences as necessary .
Egyptian themed , Khet uses a 10 x 8 square board measuring roughly 17.5 - inches by 14.5 - inches and made of moulded plastic .
Each square has raised edges to hold pieces in place , and the retail version is decorated around the border with raised hieroglyphics .
At diagonally opposing corners , each player has a class I red laser ( class II in the US ) , pointing directly across the board and operated by a button on the border .
Play begins with each side having twelve pieces , one set in silver and the other in red ( gold in my photos ) , made up of Pyramids , Djeds , Obelisks and a Pharaoh .
The former are equipped with mirrors – one on each Pyramid and two on each Djed – while the latter have none .
From one of two initial set - ups according to the instructions , play consists of each gamer either moving a piece one square in any direction or rotating a piece ninety - degrees , before pressing their laser button .
Obviously , the aim of the game is to construct a series of mirrors with which you can bounce either your laser or that of your opponent to their Pharaoh , at which point you win and are allowed to perform The Dance Of The King Surveying The Vanquished .
Along the way , should you hit the non-mirrored side of a piece , it is removed from play .
That ’s a pretty dry description , so let ’s cut to the chase – Khet is fantastic .
The laser is both an attention - grabbing gimmick and an essential part of play , while the pieces are tactile and pleasing .
Unlike many games which boast broad age ranges ( Khet is advertised as suitable for ages 9 upward ) but in actual fact present too great a learning curve for most children and too little a challenge for adults , it relies more on your ability to strategise and think ahead than grasping obscure rules or testing general knowledge .
The instructions themselves consist of three pages , one of which is taken up with the two initial layouts , and are clearly written and easily understood .
Anyone who can grasp the concept of a laser bouncing at right - angles can play .
What I particularly appreciate about Khet is its longevity .
At £ 34.95 from Firebox.com ( or $ 44.95 direct in the US ) you do n’t want it to grow old before you ’ve got your money ’s worth !
So far , expansion has been tackled in two ways : firstly , different initial set - ups are available online , both from the makers and from other players , while secondly a “ booster pack ” containing a new , laser - splitting piece has been created .
This “ Eye of Horus ” reflects half the light at right - angles and lets the other half pass straight through ; each booster pack comes with two , meaning up to three different lasers could be bouncing around the board .
So far , the Eye of Horus is only available in the US .
My wish - list of future tweaks is , unsurprisingly , a small one .
I ’d like to see some sort of glowing indicator showing where on the boundary wall the laser hits ; this is n’t always obvious , especially when it occurs on the side closest to a player .
Making the boundary edge out of the same , translucent plastic as the pieces would achieve this easily .
Secondly , it would be fantastic if a “ luxury ” version was made , perhaps out of wood and with crystal pieces .
Some people I showed the game to were so impressed by how it looks that they ’d like to have it out on display , as you might a particularly ornate chess - set .
Finally , while the vacuum - formed plastic cover serves its purpose , holding the pieces in place in transit and keeping dust off , a proper , latching lid would be nice .
That way you would n’t have to always transport the game in its box .
If it was n’t already obvious , let ’s make it clear for the record : I love Khet .
More approachable than chess ( and without that feeling that you ’re potentially getting yourself into a game that might last weeks ! ) and less education - dependent than Trivial Pursuit or Scrabble , everyone I ’ve mentioned it to has wanted to try it .
With the option of new layouts and extra pieces , Khet has a longevity measured in years rather than weeks or merely days ( as with some of the so - called “ interactive DVD ” games ) .
Sadly I have to send this review sample back , but my credit card and I both know that ordering my own copy of the game is not only likely but imminent .
And at the end of the day , is there any greater verdict than that ?
Khet is available in the UK from Firebox.com for £ 34.95 and direct from the manufacturer ’s site in the US for $ 44.95 .
Many thanks to Firebox for the review sample .

Hemant Lakhani , the India - born , British clothing merchant , was convicted last week of attempting to sell shoulder - launched missiles to what he believed was a terrorist group , by a New Jersey court April 28 .
He spoke to India Abroad , the newspaper published in the US , owned by rediff.com , in an exclusive interview from prison last year .
Sentencing has been set for August 8 and Lakhani could get up to 67 years in prison .
We reproduce the interview , with kind courtesy to India Abroad .
M y mother always told me to learn to say no , " he says , the sound of soft sobs punctuating his words .
" She told my wife after our wedding to make me learn how to say no . "
" Forty - four years later , in this prison cell , I realize I should have listened to her . "
That is Hemant Lakhani , on the phone from Passaic County Jail in New Jersey in May 2004 , where he has been held without bail since August 2003 .
He pleaded not guilty before US district court Judge Katherine Hayden of Newark , New Jersey and insisted he will never plead guilty .
" I was offered a deal ( plea bargain ) , but why should I say yes ?
Whatever is to happen will happen , Allah sabka hai ( Allah is there for everyone ) and if this man ( the government 's cooperative witness , Habibur Rehman ) is ever extradited , ( Pakistan President Pervez ) Musharraf will throw him in prison for all he has done . "
Lakhani was arrested with a missile after a transnational sting operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( the American version of India 's CBI ) in collaboration with British and Russian intelligence agents .
Lakhani insisted he is innocent , and that Rehman and government agents trapped him .
He was arrested charges of trying to smuggle a shoulder - fired missile into the United States , supposedly so terrorists could use it to bring down a commercial airliner .
He is also charged with trying to smuggle in anti-aircraft guns , tanks , armoured personnel carriers , radar systems and a ' dirty bomb . '
The charges consume his waking hours .
Lakhani spends up to eight hours every day , going over the dozens of audio and videotapes that constitute part of the state 's evidence against him , making copious notes and translating conversations he had with Habibur Rehman .
His faith in himself , his religion , and his destiny remain steadfast .
Yet , in the lonely confines of his cell , the leaves of his past life rustle mournfully in the dark .
Compulsively , almost , he keeps flashing back to other times .
To the time so long ago , when he went to London for the first time in September 1958 to study law .
To other times , when he rubbed shoulders with royalty , including the ruling house of Abu Dhabi and the iconic Princess Diana , who once inaugurated the Asian Women 's Sangam Association , a community organization of which his wife Kusum was a co-founder .
Such happy memories only recall him to the present , and cue fresh sobs as he protests his innocence , and claims he is a victim of entrapment .
" The cooperative witness they have is a liar , an evil man who is charged with several crimes himself and who I suspect has struck some plea bargain with the government , " he said .
" I did do some military dealings , but that was for armored carriers in Angola , " he says .
" And even in this , I insisted that end - user certificates were needed but this man , Rehman , who is also known as Haji , said he would arrange that .
I had no idea he was a crook , and I had no idea this ( the missile ) was meant for here , nor did I ever imagine I would be in jail . "
He is determined , he says , to not allow one man to ruin his life .
During his first few weeks and months in jail , Lakhani says , he faced hostility from prison guards who considered him a terrorist , and anti-American .

( WIRED ) --
In less than a week , Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows , while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free , online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google 's suite of web - based office applications .
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world 's most important tech company .
And not more than a month and a half ago , Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing , which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online .
From the news of it , it 's a full - blown tech battle , complete with behind - the - scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other .
It is , however , not a death match -- it 's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology , since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon .
Google pulled in $ 22 billion in revenue in 2008 , 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web .
Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses , charging $ 50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor , email and spreadsheet programs away .
By contrast , Microsoft sold $ 14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months , making a profit of $ 9.3 billion .
It made a further $ 16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems , which range from XP installations on netbooks , to Vista , to Windows Mobile to its server software .
Google now plans its own range of operating systems , starting with Android , an open - source OS for small devices like smartphones , and Chrome OS , a browser - focused , open - source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops .
Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others ' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them , or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money .
In fact , they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example , Microsoft 's behind - the - scenes campaign to scuttle last year 's proposed Google - Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement .
But in reality , the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside .
And it 's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world 's most important technology company .
Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend .
Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids , and you have a Microsoft family .
And though it is much joked about , Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types , whether they are making small business software , massive online role - playing games or photo - editing utilities .
Google 's ecosystem looks different .
It starts with a Google Chrome browser ( oddly running only on Windows ) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage .
From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor .
But most importantly , Google wants you to search and travel around the web , hitting web pages that run Google - served ads and Google tracking cookies .
You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology , while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium .
So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition ?
Browsers : Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market ( depending on who is counting and how ) .
That dominance remains , even though Microsoft 's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities .
Firefox , Opera , and Apple 's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years , but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind , despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced .
Why does it matter ?
Well , IE installations come with a default home page , do n't they ?
Google 's Chrome browser , on the other hand , is a handsome , whiz - kid of a browser .
It 's sleek and nimble , and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled .
The address bar is the search box ( Google as default , naturally ) .
Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files .
The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes , the rest are unaffected .
Meanwhile , lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser .
Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share .
Online Search : Google 's name now means search to most users .
Google 's search engine means money to Google .
In June , it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users .
In the first three months of 2009 , Google pulled in $ 5.2 billion in revenue , a majority of which came from AdWords , an auction - based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query .
Microsoft recently debuted Bing , a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google .
It 's got some fine innovations , and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data , rather than just retrieving links .
Still , despite these improvements , a $ 100 million ad campaign , and generous press coverage that treats
Bing like an underdog , Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches .
Operating Systems : Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS - DOS and Windows NT , the frameworks that Windows have been built around .
Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world .
By copying its competitors ' best features , leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators , Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years .
That 's despite challenges from Digital Research , Apple and IBM .
Microsoft 's newest version , Windows 7 , will be available in the fall .
Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast , and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista , the successor to Windows XP .
Microsoft also dominates in the business world , where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office .
Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices , which it first launched in 2000 .
Its OS advantages are immense .
It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows .
There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows .
Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware .
And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs .
By contrast , Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices .
Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year .
Last week , Google announced , but did not show off , a new OS to compete with Windows , dubbing it Chrome OS .
That name signifies that Google 's OS will be for the web and browser - based .
It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser , instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples ' OS X do .
It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser , allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help .
Advertising : Google is largely powered by its innovative auction - based text ads on its own site , but then expanded into serving ads on other people 's sites with the Adsense program .
It bought the ad-serving and behavioral - profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $ 3 billion , and has ventured into mobile , print , radio and television ads .
Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google 's online advertising success .
Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet .
To turbocharge its ad - delivery technology , it paid more than $ 6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive , a full - service online advertising concern .
Instead , Microsoft 's online ad business lost $ 1.2 billion in 2008 , double what it lost in 2007 .
The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $ 3.2 billion it took in last year , but has not said it would make a profit .
Contrary to what some might have you believe , the benefits of the Google - Microsoft competition are immense .
Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories .
Gmail 's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular , though not user - friendly , web e-mail service .
Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps , which now bests Google 's efforts in some ways .
Google has been winning the fight for the last few years , showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest .
But the pendulum may be slowing , or even poised to swing the other way .
With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft 's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent , Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users : on the field of innovation .
And that will make for an interesting race , no matter which horse you prefer to ride .

The Moon ’s shadow engulfed Taiwan and a large swath of southeastern China and the Pacific Ocean on the morning of July 22 , 2009 , during an unusually long total eclipse of the Sun .
This pair of images from the Japanese geostationary satellite MTSAT show the view of Earth at 8:30 a.m. local time in Taiwan ( left ) and an hour later ( right ) , near the time in eastern China when the disk of the Moon completely overlapped the disk of the Sun ( called totality ) .
The longest period of totality occurred over the Pacific , where the total eclipse lasted more than 6 minutes .
These images combine current “ daytime ” data observed by MTSAT during the eclipse with a static background image of city lights for the “ nighttime ” portion of the globe .
[ Geostationary satellites do n’t have the sensitivity or spatial resolution to detect urban lights at night . ]
The night lights background is part of the NASA Blue Marble image collection , developed by the Earth Observatory Team in cooperation with scientists from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .

As it currently stands , there is only one Bertone Mantide in the world .
You would think that the owner of a $ 2 million prototype would keep the car safely tucked away in a special garage as a kind of trophy piece and never place it in harm ’s way .
But alas , it is not so with one Dan Watkins , a British ‘ gentleman racer ’ and financier , who is tentatively planning on putting his car to the true test of performance benchmarking by taking on the Nurburgring track record set by the Corvette ZR1 .
PistonHeads has reported that Bertone ’s chief designer , Jason Castriota , is pretty pumped about the idea of taking on the car that holds the current best lap time at The Green Hell for a stock , street - legal , production vehicle .
This is especially important being that the Mantide is based on the Chevy Corvette ZR1 with several marked improvements according to Castriota .
The Bertone Mantide is 176 pounds lighter and 30 % more aerodynamic than the underlying Vette .
The modifications start with flying buttresses to help with air flow across the rear , thereby creating more downforce but without any further drag .
In addition , the nose and front vents of the Mantide have been designed to allow air to pass around the wheels and tires .
Finally , the belly pan of the Mantide is completely flat with a diffuser and two fins on either side of the exhaust pipe .
Autoblog is reporting that Dan Watkins plans to finance this effort with his own duckets .
This involves renting out ‘ The Ring ’ for several days , hiring a professional driver and offering up his very own Bertone one - off .
The biggest challenge would be optimizing the tires and suspension setup for this very challenging track .
Theoretically , the Bertone Mantide has a good chance of besting the Chevy Corvette ZR1 , as it uses the same 638 hp supercharged V8 engine but with significant weight reduction and better aerodynamics .

Dominic Lawson ( I was named after his grandfather , Felix Salmon ) has a column saying that cutting bankers ' bonuses would do more harm than good .
He might be right , but his argument is a little bit odd : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
My distant cousin Dominic Lawson ( I was named after his grandfather , Felix Salmon ) has a column saying that cutting bankers ’ bonuses would do more harm than good .
He might be right , but his argument is a little bit odd :
When people get a cheaper mortgage because some financial whiz - kid on the trading floor did some clever forward buying in the currency markets , they do n’t feel any particular sense of gratitude to the bank .
Even in the good times , politicians are not likely to be misjudging the public mood if they propose to do something a bit nasty to bankers …
If a Treasury minister tells a Today programme interviewer that “ we are imposing greater capital requirements on super - senior tranches of securitised mortgage obligations ” , it is unlikely to resonate with the bleary 7 am listener wanting to hear the noise of a banker having his head rammed hard into a wall .
The problem here is that never in the history of finance has a bank reduced its mortgage rates because it made lots of money in the currency forwards market .
Banks are n’t charitable institutions which cross-subsidize their consumer - facing products from profits elsewhere : to the contrary , they will constantly attempt to maximize their profits in every business .
On the other hand , it was commonplace for people to get cheaper mortgages because banks had stupidly low capital requirements on super - senior tranches of securitised mortgage obligations .
Thanks to those stupidly low capital requirements , banks could sell off “ all ” the risk associated with the bonds they originated , and keep billions of dollars of leftovers for themselves , without having to hold much if any capital against them .
Since banks love to think of themselves as being in the business of buying and selling risk assets , they were happy to originate low - interest mortgages just so long as they could flip them for an immediate profit .
In other words , it ’s systemically - devastating things like badly - structured regulatory structures and capital requirements which are likely to bring down mortgage costs and otherwise directly benefit the public .
Large bonuses for traders , by contrast , will not benefit the public at all — they just benefit the traders in question .
More generally , anything which contributes towards people getting a cheaper mortgage is equally likely to contribute towards a housing bubble .

THE HEALTH - CARE " DEBATE " HAS SUCKED SO much oxygen off Capitol Hill that our lawmakers have ceased burning Wall Street 's dark wizards at the stake .
Let 's hope this damping of the fires of outrage is merely temporary .
The ash heap seems far too small in proportion to the global financial destruction wrought by the financial coven .
Our legislators ' tongues hardly have singed the culprits responsible for what is likely to reign as the grandest case of mass financial negligence of the 21st century .
If this were China , the land of hasty judicial outcomes , several revolvers would be empty by now .
Congress started roasting CEOs , traders , analysts , rating agencies and regulators in 2008 .
It was ardent for a while , fanned by public anger .
The list of stakeholders appearing on the congressional menu is long , but there is one notable omission : accountants , who have played a leading role in every major financial crisis since 1929 .
THE BUMBLING SECURITIES AND
Exchange Commission , which effectively oversees accountants through its supervision of the PCAOB , or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , has had several turns on Congress ' rotisserie .
Just last week Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , grilled the agency again , this time for failing to uncover Bernard Madoff 's Ponzi scheme .
The SEC 's pathetic , Clouseau - like investigation of Madoff 's operation is painfully detailed in a 477 - page report prepared by the agency 's independent inspector general .
A perennial excuse for the SEC 's bouts of ineptness is " underfunding . "
Dodd 's opposition in 1994 to a bill by fellow Democrats that would have let the SEC keep the fees it collects from the companies it regulates arguably is responsible for this .
In 2007 the agency collected $ 1.5 billion in fees and got back $ 882 million in funding from Congress , according to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , this year 's champion of letting the agency retain its loot for recruitment of more qualified personnel .
At least angry investors who lost money in the Wall Street crack - up have n't lowered the heat on the accountants .
KPMG , auditor for infamous subprime - mortgage lender New Century Financial , is being sued by the bankrupt company 's trustee for $ 1 billion .
KPMG also audited Countrywide Financial , now part of Bank of America ( ticker : BAC ) .
Countrywide 's former boss , Angelo Mozilo , is the reigning pinup for the subprime disaster .
There are now 199 subprime - mortgage and class - action lawsuits , 57 of which were filed in 2007 , according to Kevin LaCroix , a specialist in directors ' and officers ' liability for OakBridge Insurance Services , headquartered in Bloomfield , Conn .
In a recent blog ( http://www.dandodiary.com/), LaCroix noted : " One of the characteristics of many of these subprime - and credit - crisis - related lawsuits is the extent to which the plaintiffs are seeking to impose liability on the gatekeepers of the target companies .
The gatekeepers named as defendants include not only the directors and officers of the target companies , but also the companies ' auditors and offering underwriters , as well as the rating agencies that provided rating [s ] on the companies ' securities offerings . "
The SEC might be trying to compensate for its investigative shortcomings by engaging in legal experimentation .
In one case , the sad - sack agency is seeking compensation from Maynard Jenkins , the ex-CEO of CSK Auto .
That company had to restate earnings because of alleged misconduct by some employees , even though Jenkins was n't involved in any financial hanky - panky .
The SEC action will test the reach of the 2002 Sarbanes - Oxley law 's clawback provision , says Gregory Bruch , a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of Willkie Farr & Gallagher .
The clawback provision , which lets the agency seek damages from individual executives , has never before been employed in the absence of wrongdoing by the defendant , Bruch adds .
IF THE CASE IS UPHELD , JENKINS would be out $ 2 million in bonuses and more than $ 2 million from stock sales that he made in the 12 months following the restatement .
Criminal cases are pending against CSK 's former chief financial officer and chief operating officer .
A former controller and a former supervisor pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice , but not to cooking the books .
Bruch says the SEC has a good shot because the clawback statute simply says the restatement must be a result of " material noncompliance of the issuer . "
But the agency might have to show that one of Jenkins ' co-workers engaged in misconduct .
CSK was bought by O'Reilly Auto Parts ( ORLY ) after the events at issue allegedly took place .
Restatements resulting from material misstatements in SEC filings are n't rare .
CFO.com , citing a report by Audit Analytics , says public companies filed 869 restatements in 2008 and 1,235 in 2007 .
In fact , public companies -- including 64 of the Fortune 100 -- often have bylaws triggering clawbacks , to avoid being hit by costly , time - consuming SEC actions .
Others must beware of the SEC 's claw !

THE Volkswagen Jetta TDI rolled gently to a stop at the red light  no squealing brakes , no smoking tires .
On the dashboard , the trip computer display read 62 miles per gallon .
For John Taylor , that was not very good .
Days earlier , Mr. Taylor and his wife , Helen , had completed a 48 - state drive averaging 67.9 miles a gallon : 9,505 miles in 19 days , filling up only 13 times and spending a total of $ 371.03 for diesel fuel .
That beat the Guinness record of 58.8 miles a gallon they set a year ago on nearly the same route in an almost identical 2009 Jetta TDI .
One difference this time was the tires .
The Jetta was fitted with Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max tires , low - rolling - resistance models that will be standard equipment on the 2011 Chevrolet Volt .
Goodyear , a sponsor of the Taylors ’ drive , says the new tire reduces rolling resistance by 27 percent compared with the conventional Assurance tire it replaces , which translates to a 4 percent improvement in highway fuel economy .

My Admittedly Acerbic Observation ...
The former Joseph Ratzinger - Pope Benedict XVI - now claims that atheism is responsible for the destruction of the environment .
In a speech at the Vatican on Wednesday , wearing his nice dress and funny hat , Ratzinger asked his spellbound audience :
Is it not true that inconsiderate use of creation begins where God is marginalized or also where his existence is denied ?
If the human creature 's relationship with the Creator weakens , matter is reduced to egoistic possession , man becomes the " final authority , " and the objective of existence is reduced to a feverish race to possess the most possible .
In answer to your question : No , Joe , it is not true .
You are deluded , in this as in so much of what you think and say .
To atheists - I am one - God is so " marginalized " that he 's off the page altogether .
As for being the " final authority , " our species is exactly that , at least on this planet , since we 've not found any other species that 's as smart or powerful .
And though you may see an objective in " possess[ing ] the most possible , " a remarkable proportion of us both - feet - on - the - ground folks see compassion , caring , and consideration , as appropriate goals .
Groveling and begging for favors that wo n't be granted by a ghost in the sky , are actions alien to us .
Terry Sanderson , President of the UK National Secular Society , commented :
This is rich , coming from the leader of an organization that has plundered the world to enrich itself .
As he sits in his golden palaces , surrounded by unimaginable luxury and material wealth , he lectures the rest of us about restraint and greed .
We have nothing to learn about environmentalism from this hypocrite .
Amen .
Hallelujah .
Whatever .

Despite decades of effort , medical science has n't yet succeeded in preventing or curing infections by human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the virus that causes AIDS .
The virus 's rapid mutation rate has so far prevented the creation of a vaccine , leaving the medical community to fight individual infections with drugs that inhibit viral replication .
These drugs , while effective , are not a cure .
Additionally , they 're costly , have serious side - effects , and must be administered for life .
So , the search continues for other approaches to help prevent new infections , and to treat or cure existing ones .
In this issue of PLoS Biology , Nitya Venkataraman , Alexander Cole , and colleagues describe one of these new approaches : awakening a latent defense mechanism in human cells .
Venkataraman et al. focused their work on retrocyclin , a member of the defensin family of proteins .
Defensins are made by all primates and have potent anti-microbial activity .
Retrocyclin was recently shown to strongly inhibit HIV entry into human cells by blocking the interaction of viral proteins with their cellular receptors .
Unfortunately , although the retrocyclin protein is found in Old World monkeys and orangutans , it is not present in humans ( or gorillas and chimps ) , even though we have the retrocyclin gene .
That 's because the human retrocyclin gene contains a mutation , known as a “ nonsense mutation , ” that prevents the production of the encoded protein .
Nonsense mutations are a common cause of many human hereditary diseases , including cystic fibrosis , some cancers , and muscular dystrophies .
They work by disrupting the genes that contain the instructions for making specific proteins .
Information in genes , encoded in nucleotide triplets called “ codons , ” is preserved as the DNA sequence is transcribed into the RNA molecules that carry it to the cell 's protein factory , the ribosome .
Ribosomes read the order of the nucleotides within codons to determine which amino acids ( protein building blocks ) should be incorporated into a protein , and in what order .
When a ribosome encounters “ stop codons , ” it dutifully stops adding amino acids to a protein .
Nonsense mutations change an amino acid–encoding codon into a premature stop codon , resulting in a truncated protein — or no protein at all — being made .
No one knows how or why humans acquired a nonsense mutation in the retrocyclin gene .
But , since monkey retrocyclin has the ability to block HIV infection , Venkataraman et al. decided it would be worth investigating whether the human version of the protein is similarly useful .
Almost immediately , they encountered a potential problem : even if modern human cells had a functional copy of the gene available , they may not be able to make retrocyclin protein .
That 's because the monkey retrocyclin protein has an unusual 3D structure that is unique .
The production of retrocyclin protein might require some specialized mechanism , which could be absent in humans .
To determine whether human cells have retained the capacity to make retrocyclin protein , Venkataraman et al. corrected the premature stop codon mutation in a copy of the human retrocyclin gene .
Next , they inserted the corrected gene into human promyelocytic cells , and looked to see if protein was produced from the gene .
They found that cells harboring the corrected gene could make a protein similar to the monkey version of retrocyclin .
But could human retrocyclin block HIV infection ?
Indeed , extracts made from cells containing the corrected gene could reduce HIV growth , and so could the retrocyclin protein purified from these extracts .
Collectively , these results suggest that human cells have a potentially important — but latent — mechanism to protect against HIV .
If retrocyclin could be restored in humans , it might make a difference in the fight against HIV .
The authors therefore wondered if it would be possible to make human cells ignore the premature stop codon in the retrocyclin gene .
To accomplish this , they turned to aminoglycosides , compounds known to make human cells ignore premature stop codons .
Aminoglycosides are normally used to fight off bacterial infections ; they work by binding tightly to bacterial ribosomes , blocking their protein - making capacity .
These compounds can also bind to human ribosomes , but they do so much more weakly .
Therefore , they do n't block protein creation in human cells but cause ribosomes to make occasional errors — like missing stop codons .
The authors found that treating human cells with aminoglycosides allowed the cells to make retrocyclin at sufficiently high levels to inhibit infection by HIV .
Importantly , the authors showed that antibodies specific to retrocyclin could destroy the HIV - blocking activity of aminoglycoside - treated cells , indicating that the anti-HIV activity of aminoglycoside - treated cells mediates their new ability to produce retrocyclin .
Might aminoglycosides , or drugs like them , be useful in rallying this ancient defense mechanism to battle against HIV ?
Much more work would be needed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this approach for stimulating retrocyclin production , and to investigate whether this could actually protect people from HIV .
But these findings represent a promising step in that direction .
Theater is a social and collaborative art form , and a playwright ’s work is no doubt most fully realized on the stage .
But to encounter plays on paper is to encounter them in their platonic form .
You ’re glued to the playwright ’s words , not sitting in Row K jostling for an armrest while gawking at , say , Jane Fonda ( who stars in “ 33 Variations ” ) , wondering if all her years of aerobics paid off .
While reading , you can submit more perfectly to the author ’s spell and , what ’s more , you are your own casting director .
Kenneth Tynan , writing in The New Yorker , once divided the British playwrights of the 1960s into two camps , the “ hairy ” and the “ smooth ”  the hairy ones being “ embattled ” and “ socially committed ” while the smooth were “ cool , apolitical stylists . ”
As categories go , hairy and smooth are gloriously inexact .
But Ms. Reza ’s and Mr. LaBute ’s plays strike me as the hairy beasts in this foursome ; they ’re alert , pushy works in which words are hurled like poison darts .
Mr. Foote ’s and Mr. Kaufman ’s are calmer , more self - conscious and a bit less wrigglingly alive , at least on the page .
Ms. Reza is a French playwright and novelist who flings acid dialogue .
Her “ God of Carnage ” is about two 40 - something couples who meet to talk things over after one of their sons has clouted the other , knocking out a few of his teeth .
This conversation becomes a delightful melee ; the couples joust about things from cellphones to miracle drugs to masculinity to Darfur to how to get rid of an unwanted hamster , and it becomes clear that both marriages are hanging by a thread .
One character vomits onstage , onto another ’s rare art books .
A bottle of rum emerges .
The language , in this translation by Christopher Hampton , is fleet and pointed 
“ Courtesy is a waste of time , it weakens you and undermines you ” ; “ Puking seems to have perked you up ”  and Ms. Reza is smart to acknowledge her own verbal facility , which borders on but never crosses over into glibness .
( “ Do stop shoving these thoughts for the day down our throat , ” one character intones . )
By the end these excellent characters are , to paraphrase George in “ Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf , ” walking what ’s left of their scattered , venomous wits .
Image Horton Footes  Dividing the Estate ,  about generations arguing over what to do with the family pile , is a bit too easygoing and familiar .

My heart sank when I picked up Neil LaBute ’s “ reasons to be pretty ” and read the miserably corny introduction , which would better fit “ High School Musical 4 . ” ( “ I hope this play makes a case for being yourself and standing up for what you believe in .
For being brave . ” )
But Mr. LaBute does get one thing right , when he declares , “ I ’ve written about a lot of men who are really little boys at heart , but Greg , the protagonist in his play , just might be one of the few adults I ’ve ever tackled . ”
The plot of “ reasons to be pretty ” sounds like a drunken dinner - party hypothetical :
What would you do if your boyfriend was overheard talking about the hot new chick at work while referring to your own face as merely “ regular ” ?
Greg ’s girlfriend goes ballistic and dumps him , even though he genuinely loves her .
“ You ca n’t swallow that down , ” she says of his comment , “ and find a way to come up smiling or anything , you know what I ’m saying ? ”

Cost Of French Postage Stamps
Postal Codes in France
The five - digit postal code is an essential part of all French addresses .
It is used to identify the commune .
This code comes immediately before the village or town and is on the last line of all French mail .
Within the code , the first 2 digits indicate the number of the département ; while the last three digits are used to identify the commune .
Some smaller communes share the same code with others .
For those of you wondering if I ’ve seen today ’s Family Circus , the answer is yes .
In it , creator Jeff Keane mocks Pearls Before Swine .
If you have n’t yet seen the strip , I present it below .
Please take a close look at the book in Daddy Keane ’s hands .
If you ca n’t read it , the book ’s title is “ Pig and Rat Get Lost . ”
And it bores the Keane kids so much , they leave the room .
I am now thinking about filing a lawsuit against the Keane family for their appropriation of my characters ’ names .
But having been a lawyer , I know the hardship involved in a protracted legal fight .
So instead of continuing this blog entry , I need a few moments to think .
While I do , here are some random Pearls strips to entertain you .
According to the Council of Economic Advisors , on whose staff Larry " Shadow Bernanke " Summers used to sit under the Reagan administration , has released an estimate of the economic benefits provided by the Obama Stimulus .
Net result - without the Stimulus , Q2 GDP ( which as readers will recall came out at - 1 % ) , would have come out at - 3.3 % , indicating that while most pundits were expecting the major flow through of Stimulus spending to occur in Q3 and taper off in Q4 , the majority of the benefits from this program have already likely peaked .
Whether or not this portens badly for future GDP estimates , we will have to see and wait .
From the CEA report :
Estimates of the impact of the ARRA made by comparing actual economic performance to the predictions of a plausible , statistical baseline suggest that the Recovery Act added roughly 2.3 percentage points to real GDP growth in the second quarter and is likely to add even more to growth in the third quarter .
As for stimulus benefits for Q3 , CEA believes that this will add another 3 % in the quarter about to end .
There is broad agreement that the ARRA has added between 2 and 3 percentage points to baseline real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2009 and around 3 percentage points in the third quarter .
Furthermore , even though the economy continues to bleed hundreds of thousands of jobs each month , the stimulus allegedly helped create one million jobs .
So absent the stimulus , unemployment ( and not real unemployment , but the one CNBC uses ) would be around 10.6 % if not higher .
This analysis indicates that the ARRA and other policy actions caused employment in August to be slightly more than 1 million jobs higher than it otherwise would have been .
We estimate that the Act has had particularly strong effects in manufacturing , construction , retail trade , and temporary employment services .
The employment effects are distributed across states , with larger effects in states more severely impacted by the recession .
Bottom line : in the past half a year , GDP will have been beneficially impacted by over 5 % thanks to an unprecedented Stimulus spend .
What happens once all these effects expire is anyone 's guess .

You want to cancel your credit card .
Before you pick up your scissors , though , know this : Canceling a credit card the right way involves more than simply snipping it in two .
It requires you to follow specific steps to close the credit card account for good – with the least damage to your credit score .
Here ’s everything you need to know to cancel a credit card successfully .
Should you cancel your credit card ?
Probably not
The first question to ask yourself before canceling a card is :
Do you really need to cancel it ?
Or would it be better to just put it away and not use it ?
Having an available line of credit on a card with no balance always helps your credit score , and it could come in handy in an emergency or if its terms improve in the future .
However , there are two occasions when closing a credit card is called for :
You ca n’t control your spending and need to remove the temptation .
You are paying an annual fee for a card you do not use .
In those cases , it makes sense to cancel cards , since they are unnecessarily costing you money .
See related : Terms and benefits checkup : Assess your credit card ’s value
First step in canceling a card : evaluate impact on credit score
Before closing any credit card account , you need to consider the possible effect on your credit score .
Just because you cancel a credit card does n’t mean that its payment information comes off your credit report right away .
In the case of open accounts , positive credit data can stay on the credit report indefinitely .
Closed accounts with zero balances and no associated negative information typically remain on a credit history for 10 years from the date they are reported closed .
Most bad marks on your credit report have a quicker expiration date .
Under the Fair Credit Reporting
Act , negative data such as late payments and foreclosures must come off the credit report after seven years .
“ If the account is never again positive , is charged off and sent to collections , the original account and any subsequent collection account will be deleted at that time , ” says Rod Griffin , director of public education with credit bureau Experian .
“ This allows the positive information to remain longer than most negative information . ”
In addition , potential lenders take into account the amount of credit still in use once a card and its associated credit limit gets canceled .
That ’s because credit bureaus and lenders are interested in what is known as a balance - to - limit ratio , also known as your credit utilization ratio , which compares the amount of credit being used to the amount of total credit available to the borrower .
“ The ratio is more important today than how much available credit you have , ” Griffin says .
From a lender ’s standpoint , “ a low balance - to - limit ratio is a strong indicator of good credit risk , ” he says .
To offset the closure of one account , for example , you can request a credit limit boost on another card in order to maintain the ratio .
Depending on your total available credit , closing a credit card account with a high credit limit could hurt your credit score , particularly if you have high balances on other cards or loans .
To make sure closing one card does n’t impact your score , pay off balances on all other cards .
If you have zero balances , your credit utilization rate is zero , and wo n’t be impacted by the loss of a balance .
However , experts say this step may be unnecessary for most people .
“ If a person established good credit , the impact of card closure should be minimal and short - lived , ” says Christina Goethe , former spokeswoman for FICO , the provider of the most commonly used credit score .
“ If a person established good credit , the impact of card closure should be minimal and short - lived . ”
Old credit is the best credit
The age of a credit card account is also an important consideration .
“ The time an account has been open is a factor in credit scores , ” Griffin says .
“ A longer positive history is beneficial to credit scores .
So , closing an older account in theory could have a more negative impact . ”
How negative ?
There ’s no single answer , Griffin says .
“ Credit scores weigh everything in a person ’s credit history in relation to each other .
So , for one person , closing an older account can represent higher risk than it does for another person solely because of the unique nature of their overall credit histories . ”
If you are young and have a short credit history , closing the account could hurt your overall credit score more than if you were someone in their 50s who has a much longer credit history .
As stated earlier , closing the account does n’t wipe that account history off your report , so if you open a new credit card with more attractive terms to replace the card you ’re canceling , your credit score wo n’t take a big hit .
How to cancel a credit card in 7 steps
Provided you have considered these issues and have another credit card you can make charges on , you are ready to cancel your credit card .
Closing an account the right way takes a little time , patience and organization .
As you go through the process of canceling your credit card , you may want to keep thorough notes on who you spoke to , what they said and when .
That way , if anything goes wrong , you will have all the facts recorded .
Use the following steps to cancel your credit card the right way .
1 . Find the number of the customer service department you need to contact
To begin the process of closing the account , gather and write down the customer service number and the mailing address you ’ll need .
The customer service number is on your credit card , monthly statement and the issuer ’s website ; the mailing address is also on the website and the monthly statement .
2. Redeem any remaining rewards
In the case of rewards cards , it is common to lose some accrued rewards when a card is closed , and this may be unavoidable .
But with planning , it should be possible to minimize the loss .
Check the rewards balance and redemption procedures on the issuer ’s website .
If you are unable to apply them to travel or merchandise , you may be able to take accumulated miles or points as a statement credit .
Cash back credit cards generally have the easiest redemption features .
However , most of them require rewards to reach certain thresholds usually – $ 20 or $ 25 – before you can redeem for a statement credit .
A few cash - back programs award accrued cash only once a year , on a predetermined schedule .
Knowing the rules for redemption will allow you to plan how to capture built - up rewards before you cancel the card .
Knowing the rules for redemption will allow you to plan how to capture built - up rewards before you cancel the card .
3 . Pay off any remaining balance
Pay off your credit card in full or , if you can find a balance transfer card with better terms , transfer the balance .
You ca n’t completely close a card until the balance is paid .
If you do n’t want any more charges accrued to the card until the balance is paid , you can contact the issuer and ask that the card be frozen until the balance is cleared and the card closed .
If you normally carry a balance from one month to another , you will need to pay the full statement balance two months in a row to wipe out the balance and stop further interest charges from accruing .
4 . Call your bank
Once you reach the bank ’s customer service representative , confirm that the balance on your credit card is zero .
Do not assume that the balance is zero because you paid the total amount on your most recent bill .
Interest may have continued to accumulate between the time the issuer sent the bill and your payment was made ( that “ leftover ” amount is called residual interest ) .
Once you ’re certain the balance is zero , inform them that you are canceling the card .
While some credit card companies will allow you to cancel without even speaking to a representative , others may be less obliging .
If you are met with resistance , hold firm .
It is your right to close the account .
Tell the rep you want it noted that the account is being closed at your request .
Ask for a name and address you can write to with a notice of your card cancellation and note this along with the call details , including date , time and a way to identify the representative you spoke to .
If you are met with resistance , hold firm .
It is your right to close the account .
5 . Send a letter requesting card account closure , just to be sure
For added insurance ( in case the customer service rep makes a mistake ) , write a short cancellation letter to the card issuer .
Request written confirmation of the account ’s closure .
The letter should include your name , address , phone number and account number , and details from your earlier phone call .
Also , state that you want your credit report to reflect that the account was “ closed at the consumer ’s request . ”
Along with the letter , include the check number ( or a copy of the canceled check or other payment verification ) that you used to pay off your account balance .
Make a copy of the letter for your records .
Send the letter via certified mail or with return receipt requested , so you can prove the company received your letter .
6. Check your credit report to confirm the cancellation
Then sit tight .
Getting the card canceled may take a month or more .
After that time , take a look at a copy of your credit report to make sure the account is marked as “ closed . ”
You can pull a free copy of your credit report once a year from each of the top three credit bureaus ( Equifax , Experian and TransUnion ) at AnnualCreditReport.com .
You can also get a free credit score and report from Bankrate .
If the account appears open , repeat the process :
Call the customer service number to report the mistake , follow up with a letter by certified mail ( including a copy of your original letter requesting that the account be closed ) and then check your credit report again .
If that fails , you can file a dispute through one of the three credit bureaus ( they are required to notify the others ) .
And if that does n’t work , you can file a dispute with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .
7. Dispose of your card properly after confirming cancellation
After documenting the cancellation process and making sure that your credit report reflects the closed account , you are finally free to discard your credit card .
There are numerous ways of destroying of your plastic ( or metal ) , but you ’ll need to pick a disposal method that leaves your information completely unrecoverable from identity thieves .
If you do decide to pick up the scissors , make sure that you are cutting each bit of information including your card number , CVV , expiration date and signature .
For a demonstration , check out our “ How to destroy a credit card ” video .
Although it may be worth temporarily holding off on closing a credit card if you are in the market for a new loan or mortgage , canceling a credit card should n’t be a source of major concern for consumers with good credit , since the resulting impact on their credit scores is likely to be minimal and temporary .

The offer of 40 goats and 20 cows is generous in Kenyan terms
A Kenyan man has told the BBC how happy he is that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to renew his marriage offer to her daughter .
In 2000 , Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor wrote to Mrs Clinton 's husband Bill , then US president , offering 40 goats and 20 cows for Chelsea Clinton 's hand .
In Kenya on the first leg of her African tour , Mrs Clinton was informed by a journalist of the proposal .
" My daughter is her own person .
I will convey this very kind offer , " she said .
If Ms Clinton , 29 , accepted she would become Mr Chepkurgor 's second wife , as he has married since his initial proposal .
If Ms Clinton accepted the offer , she would be Mr Chepkurgor 's second wife
Mr Chepkurgor , 40 , a councillor in Nakuru in Kenya 's Rift Valley , said his first wife knew about the renewal of his affections and " did not object " .
The BBC's Muliro Telewa in Nakuru says the offer of 40 goats and 20 cows for the bride price is very generous in Kenyan terms .
" I feel very good for her [ Mrs Clinton ] to have answered - almost in the affirmative , " Mr Chepkurgor told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" She promised that she will take the proposal to the daughter and I am now waiting , " he said .

A bald penguin has been given a wetsuit to wear at a Hampshire wildlife park to protect him from sunburn .
Ralph , a nine - year - old Humboldt penguin , lost all of his feathers in one day while moulting , instead of the usual four to six weeks .
It left him with sensitive pink skin , so Marwell Wildlife keepers cut up a staff member 's wetsuit to make the kit .
It will protect Ralph until his new feathers have grown , which may take another two to three weeks .
The leg of an adult wetsuit was used for the outfit .
David Schofield , head keeper for the penguins , said : " At first the other penguins were curious but it was n't long before they recognised and accepted Ralph again .
" He does n't seem to mind the wetsuit and is able to swim and move around normally .
Keepers made the special outfit by cutting the leg off an adult wetsuit
" It was quite easy to fit and we were able to customise it by creating the extra openings for his flippers once he was in it . "
Although they cannot fly , penguins have specialised feathers for swimming and each year undergo a complete moult .
They normally shed their feathers at the same time as new ones come through .
Humboldt penguins are native to the cold coasts of Peru and Chile .
Marwell Wildlife said they were thought to be declining in number , possibly due to increased water temperatures and reduced food supply .
Three different types of explosive and incendiary small - arms ammunition have been captured from the Japanese in the Southwest Pacific area .
Because of the unusual characteristics of this ammunition , serious injuries sometimes have resulted when soldiers have tampered with it out of ignorance or curiosity .
Apparently first manufactured for use in Japanese aircraft or antiaircraft weapons , some of this ammunition has been found loaded in five round clips , presumably for use in infantry weapons .
This ammunition — 7.7 - mm or 7.92 - mm — may easily be recognized by color markings at the junction of the bullet with the cartridge or around the primer cap .
It should not be handled carelessly .
The three different types of ammunition are the 7.7 - mm rimmed Navy round , the 7.7 - mm semi-rimmed Army round , and the 7.92 - mm rimless Army round .
Explosive and incendiary rounds may be recognized by the color marking as indicated in the following table :
Class of
Ammunition Type of
Projectile Position of
Color Mark Color Shape of
Nose 7.7 - mm Navy rimmed Explosive Incendiary Primer cap Dull red ?
7.7 - mm Navy rimmed Incendiary Primer cap Green Pointed 7.7 - mm
Army semi-rimmed Explosive Junction of case & proj .
Purple Flat on tip 7.7 - mm
Army semi-rimmed Incendiary Junction of case & proj .
Wine red Pointed 7.92 - mm
Army rimless Explosive Junction of case & proj .
White Flat on tip 7.92 - mm
Army rimless Incendiary Junction of case & proj .
Red Pointed
The 7.7 - mm rimmed Navy round is of two kinds — one is a combination high - explosive and incendiary , the other only incendiary .
Both types of the Army ammunition — the semi-rimmed and the rimless — are loaded either with an incendiary bullet or with a strictly explosive bullet ( see illustration on page 32 ) .

Furor Over an Obama Puff Piece
Student Barack Obama in a 1980 photo shoot at Occidental College . ( Lisa Jack / Getty Images )
It was only a matter of time before someone combined a certain memorable image of a young future president with a jokey twist on his campaign slogan ... to come up with a message that Barack Obama definitely did not approve .
The folks at the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws got there first .
For their annual conference poster , they took an old photo of cool - dude college freshman Obama puffing away -- on a regular cigarette , mind you -- and tweaked it just ever so slightly to fit their message : " Yes We Cannabis . "

Think it might be a problem for the president ( who opposes legalization ) ?
It 's really a problem for the photographer .
Lisa Jack , an Obama classmate at Occidental College , snapped the image in 1980 , one in a series of photos that never saw the light of day until she debuted them in Time 's 2008 Person of the Year issue .
She had no idea her photo had been appropriated by NORML until we told her Tuesday .
" They do not have my permission , " said Jack , a psychology professor in Minnesota .
These photos " are absolutely not to be used in this way .
... I really made a grand effort to do this properly , and I 'm very irritated .
If I 'd wanted these to be used for political purposes , I 'd have sold them to Hillary years ago . "
NORML Executive Director Allen St. Pierre cheerfully acknowledged the lift by artist Sonia Sanchez , who summoned the psychedelic aesthetic of ' 60s rock posters .
" With very little adulteration , she placed what appears to be a cannabis cigarette " in the president 's hand , St. Pierre said .
But she made few other changes : Obama " almost made the photograph for us . "
Everyone who attends the September conference in San Francisco will get a poster ; NORML is also selling them on the Web ( $ 25 for an 18 - by - 24 - inch with St. Pierre 's autograph , $ 15 without ) .
Can they do that ?
St. Pierre admits they did n't get permission , but " our lawyers thought it was adulterated enough to comply with the fair use laws . "
We 'll see .
Shepard Fairey made more dramatic changes to the Obama photo he turned into the now - famous " HOPE " collage -- but he 's still embroiled in bitter litigation with the Associated Press , which owns the original image .
The AP accused him in federal court of " blatant copying . "
And yes , Jack has already called the lawyers for Getty Images , which oversees her photo 's copyright .
Jack , whose photos now have a gallery show in L.A. , grudgingly admits " it 's really cool " that the images are already iconic enough to steal .
She 'd love to see Fairey do a work - up on them -- with permission , of course .
Eddie is forty , owns a sporting - goods store , and is still single .
After watching his ex-fiancée walk down the aisle , he meets Lila , an environmental researcher , who seems too good to be true .
Pressured by his father and best friend , Eddie pops the question and marries Lila after only 6 weeks .
However , as he almost instantly discovers , his new bride is a nightmare with more baggage than he can handle .
She 's immature , foolish , a monster in bed , owes a tremendous amount of money to various sources , and as it turns out , is only a volunteer and does n't actually have a job .
While on their honeymoon in Cabo , Eddie meets Miranda , a down - to - earth lacrosse coach who is visiting with her family .
Sparks fly , and Eddie falls for her .
Now comes the tricky part of breaking off his marriage to crazy Lila , all while keeping the truth from Miranda about why he's in Cabo in the first place ...

Calvino Inman Bleeding Eyes - A Tennessee boy has been called possessed and doctors have called his condition a mystery .
His name is Calvino Inman and his tears are blood .
Many have never heard of Calvino Inman 's bleeding eyes .
The boy , just 15 years old , has baffled doctors with a condition that causes his eyes to bleed at least three times a day .

I feel my eyes watering , sometimes , it will burn as it comes out , " Inman explained , adding that the bleeding can last from just a few short minutes to an hour .
" I 've been called possessed by almost all of my friends .
I guess I 'm used to it now .
At first , it kind of hurt my feelings . "
According to Au.news ,
The first time Calvino Inman experienced the bleeding , his mother , Tammy Mynatt , called paramedics immediately : " The scariest thing in my life is when he looked at me and said ' Mom , am I going to die ? '
That right there broke my heart . "
As for the cause , doctors say they 've never seen anything like it .
" They done an MRI , they done a CAT scan , they done it with and without an IV , they 've done ultra sounds , " Mynatt explained .
Myatt is desperate to find treatment for her son - and will do whatever it takes to find it : " More than anything , I just truly want somebody to say they 've seen this and they can help us .
I do n't care where we have to travel .
I will go wherever we need to go .
I will do whatever I have to do .
I just please want somebody to help my baby .
That 's all . "

Forget all the nonsense spouted by our beloved Foreign Secretary .
He 's all too happy to express his outrage .
The welcome given to Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi in Tripoli was a perfect deviation from what the British Government is trying to avoid .
It 's called the truth , not that Mr Miliband would know much about it .
It was Megrahi 's decision – not that of his lawyers – to abandon the appeal that might have told us the truth about Lockerbie .
The British would far rather he return to the land of the man who wrote The Green Book on the future of the world ( the author , a certain Col Muammar Gaddafi , also wrote Escape to Hell and Other Stories ) than withstand the typhoon of information that an appeal would have revealed .
Brown and Gaddafi .
Maybe they should set up as a legal company once their time is up .
Brown and Gaddafi , Solicitors and Commissioners for Oaths .
Not that the oaths would be truthful .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Megrahi's lawyers had delved deeply into his case – which rested on the word of a Maltese tailor who had already seen a picture of Megrahi ( unrevealed to us at the time ) so he could identify him in court – and uncovered some remarkable evidence from the German police .
Given the viciousness of their Third Reich predecessors , I 've never had a lot of time for German cops , but on this occasion they went a long way towards establishing that a Lebanese who had been killed in the Lockerbie bombing was steered to Frankfurt airport by known Lebanese militants and the bag that contained the bomb was actually put on to the baggage carousel for checking in by this passenger 's Lebanese handler , who had taken him to the airport , and had looked after him in Germany before the flight .
I have read all the interviews which the German police conducted with their suspects .
They are devastating .
There clearly was a Lebanese connection .
And there probably was a Palestinian connection .
How can I forget a press conference in Beirut held by the head of the pro-Syrian " Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine " ( they were known , then , as the " Lockerbie boys " ) in which their leader , Ahmed Jibril , suddenly blurted out : " I 'm not responsible for the Lockerbie bombing .
They are trying to get me with a kangaroo court . "
Yet there was no court at the time .
Only journalists – with MI6 and the CIA contacts – had pointed the finger at Jibril 's rogues .
It was Iran 's revenge , they said , for the shooting down of a perfectly innocent Iranian passenger jet by the captain of the American warship Vincennes a few months earlier .
I still happen to believe this is close to the truth .
But the moment Syria sent its tanks to defend Saudi Arabia after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 , all the MI6 truth - telling turned into a claptrap of nonsense about Col Gaddafi .
And Gaddafi , let 's face it , was in deep trouble .
Libya almost certainly was responsible for the earlier bombing of French UTA flight 772 over Chad in 1989 .
Why not frame him with Lockerbie too ?
Of course , we must now forget the repulsive 2004 meeting that Blair arranged with Gaddafi after the latter had supposedly abandoned plans for nuclear weapons ( not that his Tripoli engineers could repair a blocked lavatory in the Kebir Hotel ) , an act which the former foreign secretary Jack Straw called " statesmanlike " .
This was the same " statesman " who hosted a group of gunmen that attacked a Greek cruise ship ; whose navy had hijacked a yacht called the Silco and held its crew for eight years ; and whose secret service kept the Provisional IRA supplied with weapons .
Indeed , it was the same " statesman " who murdered the regime 's opponents abroad and shot dead a young British policewoman in London .
Thank God for Jack Straw .
He cleaned up Gaddafi's face and left it to Miliband to froth on about his outrage at Megrahi 's reception back in Tripoli .
Meanwhile the relatives of those who died at Lockerbie – and here I am thinking of a deeply sad but immensely eloquent letter that one of those relatives sent to me – will not know the truth .
I suspect that the truth ( speak it not , Mr Miliband , for you do not wish to know ) lies in Lebanon , in Damascus and in Tehran .
Given your cosy new relationship with the last two cities , of course , there 's not a whimper of a chance that you 'll want to investigate this , Mr Foreign Secretary .
And not much encouragement will " Mad Dog " Gaddafi give to such an undertaking , not after the gifts – oil deals , primarily , but let 's not forget the new Marks & Spencer in Tripoli – which he has given us .
Those who complain might be hanged publicly in Benghazi – like the public hanging there of dissident university students in 1979 – or otherwise wiped out , like poor old Mansour al - Kikhiya , who " disappeared " at a Cairo human rights conference in 1993 after complaining about the execution of Gaddafi 's political opponents .
Ironically , Megrahi flew home to Tripoli on an Airbus A300 aircraft , exactly the same series as the Iranian plane the Americans shot down in 1988 – and about which Gaddafi never said anything .
It was Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri ( once Khomeini 's chosen successor but now a recluse under semi-house arrest who stands up for President Ahmadinejad 's political opponents ) who said in Iran in 1988 that he was " sure that if the Imam [ Khomeini ] orders , all the revolutionary forces and resistance cells , both inside and outside the country , will unleash their wrath on US financial , economic and military interests " .
Remember that , Mr Miliband ?
No , of course you do n't .
Not even a whimper of outrage .
The project may help to cut down on the need to clear forests
By James Painter
BBC News , Trinidad , Bolivia
Poor farmers in the heart of Bolivia 's Amazon are being encouraged to embrace the annual floods - by using a centuries - old irrigation system for their crops .
They are experimenting with a sustainable way of growing food crops that their ancestors used .
It could provide them with better protection against the extremes of climate change , reduce deforestation , improve food security and even promise a better diet .
These are the bold aims of a two - year - old project being carried out by a non-governmental organisation near Trinidad , the capital of the department of Beni .
The system is based on building " camellones " - raised earth platforms of anything up to 2 m high , surrounded by canals .
Constructed above the height of flood waters , the camellones can protect seeds and crops from being washed away .
The water in the canals provide irrigation and nutrients during the dry season .
See the idea behind camellones Pre-Columbian cultures in Beni from about 1000 BC to AD1400 used a similar system .
We are only just now learning how our ancestors lived and survived
Maira Salas
Copacabana farmer
" One of the many extraordinary aspects of our camellones project is that poor communities living in the Beni today are using a similar technology to that developed by indigenous pre-Columbian cultures in the same region to solve a similar range of problems , " says Oscar Saavedra , the director of the Kenneth Lee foundation .
He experimented for six years in his own garden to develop the complex system of hydrology .
Ancient and modern communities face the same problems - regular flooding followed by drought .
" The floods were the basis for development and the flourishing of a great civilisation , " says Mr Saavedra .
There were bad floods in 2006 and 2007 , but last year the region saw the worst flooding in at least 50 years .
The floods affected some 120,000 people - a quarter of Beni 's population - and caused more than $ 200 m ( £ 119 m ) of damage .
That experience prompted many local women to enlist in the camellones project .
" I had planted rice , maize , bananas and onions on my plot of land .
But the water left nothing , " explains Dunia Rivero Mayaco , a 44 - year - old mother of three from Puerto Almacen near Trinidad .
" I lost my house too .
We had to live three months in temporary accommodation on the main road .
The children got ill there .
" So that 's why I am working here on the camellones .
I did n't want to lose everything again . "
The canals remain full after the floods recede About 400 families are now enrolled in the project in five locations , growing mainly maize , cassava and rice .
Many of the sites are still in an experimental phase , but the early signs are promising .
Productivity appears to be on the increase .
" These camellones will help us when the floods come , " says Maira Salas from the village of Copacabana , a 20 - minute boat ride down the river Ibare .
" Crops like bananas that die easily have a better chance of survival .
We are only just now learning how our ancestors lived and survived .
" They did not have tractors to build the camellones , and they survived for years .
It 's incredible . "
Villagers are encouraged to embrace the floods and see them as a blessing , not a curse .
During the rainy season , large expanses of land in Beni are under water for several months - except for the raised areas .
When the water recedes into the tributaries that run into the Amazon , it takes nutrients with it leaving a sandy brown soil in which it is difficult to grow crops .
But in the camellones project , the water left by the floods is harnessed to bring fertility to the soil and irrigation during times of drought .
In short , from being victims of the floods , poor people could become masters by turning the excess water to their advantage .
Extreme weather events International charity Oxfam is supporting the project in part because it offers poor people the possibility of adapting to climate change .
If , as predicted by many experts , the cycles of El Nino / La Nina are going to increase in intensity and frequency , then the project has the capacity to help poor families cope better with the extreme weather events and unpredictable rainfall that are to come .
" It should not matter when the rains come as the water can still be managed at whatever time of the year , " says Mr Saavedra .
Other potential advantages of the scheme include :
The system uses natural fertilizers , and in particular an aquatic plant in the canals called tarope which both purifies the water and acts as a fertilizer when spread over the soil
The canals can also provide fish stock , animal fodder and nutrients for the soil
The camellones can act as a natural seed bank which can survive flooding
The system can reduce the need to cut down the forested areas around the communities .
This is because the soil on traditional plots of land is often exhausted after two to three years .
This forces the farmers to clear more land for planting by cutting down the forest .
All this seems too good to be true .
Some of the women say the real test will come when there is a bad year of flooding or a severe drought .
So far , 2009 has not been one of the worst .
There are other huge challenges ahead .
One is to try to provide the families with an income from tomatoes or garden produce .
Another is to overcome the scepticism from some local people about the time and physical effort invested in the camellones compared to other sources of local employment .
Mr Saavedra is convinced the camellones project can be expanded , even to other countries .
" This process could be repeated in various parts of the world with similar conditions to the Beni like parts of Bangladesh , India and China .
" It could help to reduce world hunger and combat climate change , " he says .

The Pre has a rounded design , slide - out Qwerty keyboard and a touch screen .
Many functions can also be used via gestures made on a motion sensitive zone beneath the screen .
Palm has said the operating system for the Pre has been built with the web in mind , so it automatically organises contacts and information accessed via the handset .
The web focus of the Palm Pre has led many to portray it as a rival to the iPhone .
The rivalry got more intense in early June when Apple unveiled the iPhone 3GS which had a faster chipset inside .
Competition is also coming from the HTC Hero - a touch screen phone built around Google 's Android operating system .

Unbylined Turkish Coalition of America blog post slimes FBI whistleblower as ' disgruntled and discredited '...
Brad Friedman Byon
8/14/2009 , 11:59 am PT
In a rather extraordinary unbylined blog item posted on Wednesday , the Turkish Coalition of America ( TCA ) has launched what appears to be an all - out assault on FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds and her remarkable , long - awaited under - oath deposition taken over the weekend in the Ohio Election Commission ( OEC ) 's Schmidt v. Krikorian case .
Called as a witness for David Krikorian ( who is Armenian - American ) , Rep. Jean Schmidt ( R - OH ) 's opponent in 2008 and 2010 , Edmonds ( who is Turkish - American ) testified to infiltration , bribery , corruption , and blackmail within the U.S. Government , by current and former members of the U.S. House and other high ranking officials , on behalf of Turkish interests .
Schmidt , the co-chair of the Congressional Turkish Caucus has filed a complaint with the OEC alleging " false statements " by Krikorian during their 2008 contest when he had alleged she had taken " blood money " from those opposed to a Congressional declaration of Armenian Genocide by the Turks during WWI .
Schmidt is also said to have taken more money from Turkish interests during the 2008 campaign than any other House candidate .
The TCA seems to have " declared war , " according to Edmonds who touched base from out of the country via email on Wednesday .
The scathing blog post alleges Edmonds ' testimony was " a full - on assault against the national interests of the United States and the integrity of its justice system by the Armenian lobby " ; says " Krikorian and his lobbyist backers are getting desperate " ; and otherwise attempts to disparage Edmonds ' character by describing her as " self - aggrandizing , " and a " disgruntled and discredited former federal employee . "
The report offers no evidence to support any of its allegations against Krikorian , Edmonds or " the Armenian Lobby . "
Many of the claims , particularly those concerning Edmonds , are directly contradicted by official reports from the FBI Inspector General 's office , as well as senior , bi-partisan members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee ...
" [ S ] he has a self - aggrandizing imagination inflating her position at the FBI to that of an interrogator of terrorists ; and ... has a book coming out this fall , " the blog post claims about Edmonds .
While we 've interviewed Edmonds for many hours over the years , in depth , and read an extraordinary amount of reportage on her case , we 've never heard or read any such claims of her having interrogated anybody .
As to a book coming out , we know nothing of that either , though it would certainly be welcome !
While alleging in one breath that " Krikorian and his lobbyist backers are getting desperate , " the blog post then goes on to make the rather , um , desperate , charge that : " The irrelevance and insignificance of Ms Edmonds ' deposition can be evidenced by the fact that Mr. Geragos , Mr. Krikorian ’s attorney of record , did not bother to show up . "
Huh ?
Krikorian himself flew in from Ohio for the deposition , and celebrity - attorney Geragos ' firm is , in fact , representing Krikorian , but it 's rather common for other attorneys in any law firm to be present for a deposition .
While we do n't have any particular dog in the Turkish Lobby vs. Armenian Lobby hunt , the use of such a silly claim would seem to suggest the author of the Turkish Coalition 's post was fairly desperate him / herself .
The TCA post goes on to ask why Edmonds ' was called to testify in the case at all , since she admittedly had no specific information on Schmidt 's personal involvement with the Turkish lobby or last year 's race between her and Krikorian .
Schmidt came to Congress in a 2005 special election , several years after Edmonds had left the FBI where she was a translator of pre-9/11 wiretaps .
Why would she testify then ?
Was the Armenian Lobby merely trying to divert the court ’s attention away from the case at hand by introducing a witness who would make further unfounded accusations against the Turkish government , none of which involved the defendant or the plaintiff ?
Or , one might ask , has there even been a bigger waste of time for the American legal system ?
We hate to say it , but this passage seems to offer still more desperation .
The case concerns whether or not Schmidt has been unduly influenced by Turkish lobbyists and / or the Turkish government .
Edmonds testified on just about a half dozen U.S. Congressmembers , current and former , who , she says , had been bribed , blackmailed , and otherwise cajoled or strong - armed into supporting Turkish causes .
Offering up a first - hand witness to such behavior by others in Congress seems a perfectly reasonable part of anybody 's defense in such a case .
The TCA continues by then attempting to simply disparage Edmonds ' character , describing her as " a discredited former employee of the FBI ( who served the federal government for a total of six months before being fired ) . "
They do not , however , offer any actual evidence for their claims that Edmonds has been " discredited , " even as the actual on - the - record evidence suggests quite the opposite .
In 2005 , for example , portions of the FBI 's own Inspector General 's report on her case were unclassified .
They reported her allegations to be " credible , " " serious , " and " warrant[ing ] a thorough and careful review by the FBI . "
As far back as 2002 , Sens. Chuck Grassley ( R -NE ) and Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , then the senior members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , co-wrote letters on Edmonds ' behalf to Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI Director Robert Mueller , and DoJ Inspector General Glenn A. Fine , calling on all of them to take action in respect to the allegations she 's made to Congress and , later , to the 9/11 Commission .
Grassley would discuss Edmonds ' credibility on CBS ' 60 Minutes in a 2002 report when he said " Absolutely , she 's credible ...
And the reason I feel she 's very credible is because people within the FBI have corroborated a lot of her story . "
To our knowledge , none of her on - the - record allegations about Turkish influence and / or infiltration in the U.S. government have been discredited .
Though the TCA seems to have done a fine job of discrediting themselves with such an irresponsible , evidence - free , unbylined attack on an FBI whistleblower .
Here are just a few more snippets from the blog item , which largely speak for and / or discredit themselves :
Saturday ’s deposition was nothing more than an opportunity for Ms. Edmonds to make unsubstantiated claims and air conspiracy theories ranging from the tragedy of September 11th , to lurid sexual innuendo regarding unnamed members of Congress , and briefcases full of money .
Stories such as this belong in a John Grisham novel rather than a formal legal proceeding .
...
It is astonishing how low ANCA [ Armenian National Committee of America ] and its officials will sink to impose their view of history on others .
...
Furthermore , it displays the lethal mixture that results from a disgruntled and discredited former federal employee , a single - issue Armenian lobbying organization that serves the interests of a foreign government to the detriment of the security and interests of the United States , and a fringe candidate in a congressional election willing to make unfounded and slanderous accusations against public servants .
Um , speaking of " mak[ing ] unfounded and slanderous accusations against public servants " ...
Hey TCA , Pot is calling on line one , says you 're black .
The top of both the TCA website and blog notes their tagline : " Fostering Understand of Turkish American Issues through Public Education . "
While noted earlier , we do n't have any personal stake in either side of the centuries old Turk vs. Armenian debate , but an outrageous post like that of the TCA 's certainly engenders sympathy for the Armenian side of the question .
For us , anyway .
If that 's how the Turkish Lobby is willing to behave , if that is their version of " Public Education , " and those are the sorts of scurrilous allegations they 're happy to make --- without even putting anybody 's name on them , or offering evidence to back them up --- it certainly smells like they 're a helluva lot more " desperate " than the " Armenian Lobby " they claim , without evidence , is behind this entire brouhaha .

Stuffed and Fried Zucchini Blossoms are unquestionably the best appetizer I ’ve had so far .
Blossoms are stuffed with cheese and shrimps then dipped into a batter and deep fried .
What a combination !
These are so good !
Out of this world !
Truly addictive !
I need to make them more often .
Well , until their season ends .
You ca n’t imagine how I was happy when I saw these lovely flowers at our local bazaar the other day .
These are not very popular in this city , so I had n’t had a chance of cooking with them before .
I ate zucchini blossoms stuffed with spicy rice and cooked in a pot with olive oil just like other Turkish stuffed vegetables .
They were amazing !
I learnt that this is one of the two most well - known methods of cooking zucchini ( or squash ) blossoms .
I was looking for some rare recipes though .
So I asked friends at instagram and facebook what to make with zucchini blossoms .
Two commonly suggested recipes were rice stuffed blossoms and deep fried blossoms .
One of my facebook friends ( Thank you Irina ! ) shared 3 different recipes that are all intriguing and I will try them later for sure .
Those recipes reminded me of another recipe I had seen before on my favorite Turkish food blog , Dokuzuncu Bulut .
I met the lovely woman behind that blog last summer and we became friends .
She always shares unique recipes on her blog and the one for zucchini blossoms took my attention with the title : Karides ve Peynirli Kabak Çiçeği ( Zucchini Blossoms with Shrimps and Cheese ) .
Thank you Aslı Abla for this to - die - for appetizer and inspiring me for these shrimp cheese stuffed and fried zucchini blossoms !
I did n’t follow the original recipe though , I made some changes and made these Stuffed and Fried Zucchini Blossoms my way .
First I cooked shrimps in a garlic tomato sauce and let it cool down .
If you are interested , in the original recipe shrimps are boiled in water with bay leaf , lemon zest , salt and garlic until they turn reddish and drained .
Then comes the cheese mixture .
You can use whatever cheese you like .
I used a special Turkish cheese curd called ‘ Lor ’ , which is low fat and saltless .
You can replace it with goat cheese , feta or mozzarella .
To give the cheese a little more flavor , I mixed it with a little lemon juice and chopped parsley .
Add the cooked shrimps in this cheese mixture and stuff the flowers carefully .
Try not to tear them when stuffing .
Do n’t worry if you tear though .
Just gently squeeze it in your palm .
It will be okay when dipped into the batter .
I prepared the frying batter using flour , beer , salt and chili powder as told in the recipe , but I changed the amounts since I had fewer flowers .
Dip stuffed blossoms into this batter and deep fry .
Serve hot .
I guarantee everyone in your family will be hooked by these shrimp cheese stuffed and fried zucchini blossoms when you try .
Dark matter and normal matter have been wrenched apart by the tremendous collision of two large clusters of galaxies .
The galaxies are observed in the optical ( shown in orange and white ) .
Most of the normal mass in the clusters ( pink ) is associated with gas heated in their collision .
Dark matter is not visible , but is inferred ( blue ) from gravitational lensing effects ; the dark matter lagged behind the other matter in the collision .
The discovery in 2008 , using NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes , provides additional evidence for the existence of dark matter .
Credit : NASA and the Chandra X-ray Observatory
Among the most astounding , unexpected , and important achievements of the past century ( or even more ) have been the discoveries of dark matter and dark energy , collectively dubbed the " dark sector . "
A whopping 96 % of the essence of our universe lies in the dark sector , where essence refers to everything that controls evolution and large - scale properties of the cosmos .
Dark matter is unseen matter -- unseen in the sense that it emits no detected electromagnetic radiation ( light , radio waves , etc ) -- but it has been definitively spotted nonetheless because its gravity has measurable effects on stars , things that we can see .
Of all of the matter in the universe , an incredible 90 % is dark matter , with galaxies and stars being only minor constituents .
We do not know what dark matter is , only that it is almost surely made of kinds of elementary particles unlike those that comprise normal atoms .
Dark energy , on the other hand , is not a form of matter at all ( nor is it literally " dark " -- that is just a poetic way of saying that it is mysterious ) .
It is the source of the outward acceleration of the cosmos , and , based on reasonable assumptions about our current understanding of elementary particle physics , may arise from the vacuum , which has quantum properties that provide energy to the cosmos .
Alternatively , dark energy may be a feature of gravity that produces cosmic repulsion on a large scale .
CfA scientist Douglas Finkbeiner , together with three of his colleagues , has published a new paper in Physical Review D with a possible explanation for dark matter .
They are able to approximately describe this astonishing dark matter by making an equally astonishing proposition : the existence of a new force of nature .
There are only four known forces in the world : the familiar gravitational and electromagnetic forces , and two forces whose domain is at the scale of the atomic nucleus and are less commonly appreciated , the so - called strong and weak forces .
So far as we know , these are the only forces there are , and scientists have generally supposed that these four will ultimately explain the dark sector as well , once some additional details about particle physics are confirmed with the new generation of particle colliders .
In their new paper , the scientists build on data from five different recent astronomy measurements , most of them probing energetic regimes of astronomy , that have discovered puzzling results including a large excess of high - energy electrons and positrons in space .
These particles cannot easily be explained by the conventional sources , shocks from supernova .
They could come , however , from the self - annihilation of dark matter particles that , like all known forms of other matter , should come in pairs that self - destruct upon contact .
Even without knowing the nature of dark matter , it is possible to argue how it ought to behave so as not to contradict other , known principles and observations .
In working out their self - consistent theory of dark matter , the scientists find that a new , fifth force of nature is implied .
Although this might seem an extravagant solution , they argue that it is in fact a relatively straightforward solution , fits into a very reasonable ( if novel ) picture of particle physics , and fortuitously appears to solve a number of independent problems .
The new ideas , if confirmed , would revolutionize our understanding of the universe .
This paper , which outlines the basic ingredients of the new model , lays out a concrete first step that subsequent research can now either contradict ... or confirm .

FROM EDGE to edge and for all of its length , from Central Los Angeles through Beverly Hills and West Los Angeles and Santa Monica to the sea , Wilshire Boulevard was a walkway .
Once there had been white lines on concrete , and raised curbs to stop the people from interfering with the cars .
Now the lines were gone , and much of the concrete was covered with soil and grass .
There were even a few trees .
Concrete strips had been left for bicycles , and wider places for helicopters carrying cargo too big for the displacement booths .
Wilshire was wide for a walkway .
People seemed to hug the edges , even those on bikes and motor skates .
A boulevard built for cars was too big for mere people .
Outlines of the street still showed through .
Ridges in the grass marked where curbs had been , with breaks where there had been driveways .
Some stretches in Westwood had a concrete center divider .
The freeway ramps were unchanged and unused .
Someday the city would do something about them .
Jerryberry Jansen lived in what had been a seaside motel halfway between Bakersfield and San Francisco .
On long - ago summer nights the Shady Rest had been packed with transients at ten dollars a head .
Now it made a dandy apartment house , with swimming pool and everything , including a displacement booth outside the manager ’s office .
There was a girl in the booth when Jerryberry left his apartment .
He glimpsed long , wavy brown hair and the shape of her back in the instant before she disappeared .
Janice Wolfe .
Too bad she had n’t waited .
. . but she had n’t even seen him .
Nobody was ever around the booths long enough to say hello to .
You could meet someone by hovering outside the booths , but what would they think ?
Meeting people was for the clubs .
A displacement booth was a glass cylinder with a rounded top .
The machinery that made the magic was invisible , buried beneath the booth .
Coin slots and a telephone dial were set into the glass at sternum level .
Jerryberry inserted his C .B .
A. credit card below the coin slots .
He dialed by punching numbered buttons .
Withdrawing the credit card closed a circuit .
An eye blink later he was in an office in the Central Broadcasting Association building in downtown Los Angeles .
The office was big and empty .
Only once in an aeon was all that empty space ever used , though several score of newstapers saw it for a few seconds each day .
One wall was lined with displacement booths .
A curved desk down at the end was occupied by Jerryberry ’s boss .
George Bailey was fat from too much sitting and darkly tanned by the Nevada sun .
He commuted to work every morning via the long - distance booths at Los Angeles International .
Today he waved at Jerryberry without speaking .
Routine , then .
Jerryberry chose one of several cameras and slung the padded strap over his shoulder .
He studied several lists of numbers posted over the table before picking one .
He turned and moved to avoid three more newstapers stepping out of booths .
They nodded ; he nodded ; they passed .
As he reached for a booth door , a woman flicked in in front of him .
Rush hour .
He smiled at her and stepped over to the next booth , consulted the list , dialed , and was gone .
He had not spoken to anyone that morning .
The east end of Wilshire Boulevard was a most ordinary T - intersection between high , blocky buildings .
Jerryberry looked around even as he was dialing .
Nothing newsworthy ?
No .
He was two blocks away and dialing .
He punched the numbered buttons with a ballpoint pen when he remembered .
Nonetheless , his index finger was calloused .
The streets of the inner city were empty , this early .
In a minute or so Jerryberry was in sight of the freeway .
He stepped out of the booth to watch trucks and bulldozers covering this part of the Pasadena - Harbor Freeway with topsoil .
Old machines find new use - but others were covering the event .
He moved on .
The booths were all identical .
He might have been in a full - vision theater , watching scenes flick around him .
He was used to the way things jerked about .
He flicked west on Wilshire , waiting for something to happen .
It was a cheap , effective way to gather news .
At a chocolate dollar per jump per man , C. B. A. could afford to support a score of wandering newstapers in addition to the regular staff .
They earned low salaries , plus a bonus for each news item , plus a higher bonus per item used .
The turnover was high .
It had been higher before C.B.A. learned not to jumble the numbers at random .
An orderly progression down a single street was easier on the mind and nerves .
Jerryberry Jansen knew every foot of Wilshire .
At twenty - eight he was old enough to remember cars and trucks and traffic lights .
When the city changed , it was the streets that had changed most .
He watched Wilshire change as he dialed .
At the old hat - shaped Brown Derby they were converting the parking lot into a miniature golf course .
About time they did something with all that wasted space .
He queried Bailey , but Bailey was n’t interested .
The Miracle Mile was a landscaped section .
Suddenly there were people : throngs of shoppers , so thick that many preferred to walk a block instead of waiting for a booth .
They seemed stratified , with the older people hugging the curbs and the teens taking the middle of the street .
Jerryberry had noticed it before .
As a child he ’d been trained to cross only in the crosswalks , with the light .
Sometimes his training came back , and he found himself looking both ways before he could step out from the curb .
He moved on , west , following the list of numbers that was his beat .
The mall had been a walkway when displacement booths were no more than a theorem in quantum mechanics .
Dips in the walk showed where streets had crossed , but the Santa Monica Mall had always been a sanctuary for pedestrians and window - shoppers .
Here were several blocks of shops and restaurants and theaters , low buildings that did not block the sky .
Displacement booths were thick here .
People swarmed constantly around and in and out of them .
Some travelers carried fold - up bicycles .
Many wore change purses .
From noon onward there was always the tension of too many people trying to use the same space for the same purpose .
The argument started outside Penney ’s Department Store .
At the time one could see only that the police officer was being firm and the woman - middle - aged , big , and brawny - was screaming at the top of her lungs .
A crowd grew , not because anyone gave a damn but because the two were blocking the walkway .
People had to stream around them .
Some of them stopped to see what was happening .
Many later remembered hearing the policeman repeating , „ Madam , I place you under arrest on suspicion of shoplifting .
Anything you say - “ in a voice that simply did not carry .
If the officer had used his shockstick then , nothing more would have happened .
Maybe .
Then again , he might have been mobbed .
Already the crowd blocked the entire mall , and too many of them were shouting - genial or sarcastic suggestions , random insults , and a thousand variations of „ Get out of my way ! “ and „ I can ’t , you idiot ! “- for any to be heard at all .
At 12:55 Jerryberry Jansen flicked in and looked quickly about him while his hands were reinserting his credit card .
His eyes registered the ancient shops at the end of the mall and lingered a moment on the entrance to Romanoff’s .
Anyone newsworthy ?
Sometimes they came , the big names , for the cuisine or the publicity .
No ?- passed on , jumped to the crowd in front of Penney ’s two blocks down .
There were booths nearer , but he did n’t know the numbers offhand .
Jerryberry picked up his card and stepped out of the booth .
He signaled the studio but did n’t bother to report .
Circumstantial details he could give later .
But he turned on his camera , and the event was now …real .
He jogged the two blocks .
Whatever was happening might end without him .
A young , bemused face turned at Jerryberry ’s hail .
„ Excuse me , sir .
Can you tell me how this started ? “
„ Nope .
Sony .
I just got here , “ said the young man , and he strolled off .
He would be edited from the tape .
But other heads were turning , noticing the arrival of - A lean young man with an open , curious , friendly face , topped by red - blond hair curly as cotton .
A tiny mike at his lips , a small plug in one ear , a coin purse at his belt .
In his hands , a heavy gyrostabilized teevee camera equipped with a directional mike .
A newstaper .
One pair of eyes turned for an instant too long .
The woman swung her purse .
The policeman ’s arm came up too late to block the purse , which bounced solidly off his head .
Something heavy in that purse .
The policeman dropped .
Things happened very fast .
Jerryberry talked rapidly to himself while he panned the camera .
Occasional questions in his earpiece did not interrupt the flow of his report , though they guided it .
The gyrostabilized camera felt like a living thing in his hands .
It followed the woman with the heavy purse as she pushed her way through the crowd , shot Jerryberry a venomous look , and ran for a displacement booth .
It watched someone break a jeweler ’s window , snatch up a handful of random jewelry , and run .
The directional mike picked up the scream of an alarm .
The police officer was still down .
Jerryberry went to help him .
It occurred to him that of those present , the policeman was most likely to know what had been going on .
The voice in his earpiece told him that others were on their way , even as his eye found them leaving the booths : faces he knew on men carrying cameras like his own .
He knelt beside the policeman .
„ Officer , can you tell me what happened ? “
The uniformed man looked up with hurt , bewildered eyes .
He said something that the directional mike picked up , but Jerryberry ’s ears lost it in the crowd noise .
He heard it later on the news .
„ Where ’s my hat ? “
Jerryberry repeated , „ What happened here ? “ while a dozen C.B.A. men around him were interviewing the crowd , and police were pouring out of the displacement booths .
The flow of blue uniforms looked like far more than they were .
They had to use their shock - sticks to get through the crowd .
Some of the spectators - shoppers - strollers had decided to leave .
A wise decision , but impractical .
The nearest booths could not be used at all .
They held passengers cased in glass , each trying to get his door open against the press of the mob .
Every few seconds one would give up and flick out , and another trapped passenger would be pushing at the door .
For blocks around , there was no way to get into a displacement booth .
As fast as anyone left a booth , someone else would flick in .
Most were nondescript citizens who came to gape .
A few carried big cardboard rectangles carelessly printed in fluorescent colors , often with the paint still wet .
A different few , nondescript otherwise , had rocks in their pockets .
For Jerryberry , kneeling above the felled policeman and trying to get audible sense out of him , it all seemed to explode .
He looked up , and it was a riot .
„ It ’s a riot , “ he said , awed .
The directional mike picked it up .
The crowd surged , and he was moving .
He looked back , trying to see if the policeman had gained his feet .
If he had n’t , he could be hurt … but the crowd surged away .
In this mob there was no conservation of matter ; there were sources and sinks in it , and today all the sinks were sources .
The flow had to go somewhere .
A young woman pushed herself close to Jerryberry .
Her eyes were wide ; her hair was wild .
A kind of rage , a kind of joy , made her face a battlefield .
„ Legalize direct - current stimulus ! “ she screamed at him .
She lunged and caught the snout of Jerryberry ’s camera and mike and pulled it around to face her .
„ Legalize wireheading ! “
Jerryberry wrenched the camera free .
He turned it toward the big display window in Penney ’s .
The glass was gone .
Men crawled in the display window , looting .
Jerryberry held the camera high , taking pictures of them over the bobbing heads .
He had the scene for a moment - and then three signs shot up in front of the camera .
One said „ “ TANSTAAFL . “ and one bore a mushroom cloud and the words ‚ POWER CORRUPTS ! “ and Jerryberry never read the third because the crowd surged again and he had to scramble to keep his feet .
There were men and women and children being trampled here .
He could be one of them .
How had it happened ?
He ’d seen it all , but he did n’t understand .
He tried to keep the camera over his head .
He got a big brawny hairy type carrying a stack of teevees under his arm , half a dozen twenty - inch sets almost an inch thick .
The thief saw the camera facing him and the solenm face beneath , and he roared and lunged toward Jerryberry .
Jerryberry abruptly realized that there were people here who would not want to be photographed .
The big man had dropped his teevees and was plowing toward him with murder on his face .
Jerryberry had to drop his camera to get away .
When he looked back , the big man was smashing the camera against a lamp post .
Idiot .
The scene was on tape now , in the C.B.A. buildings in Los Angeles and in Denver .
The riot splashed outward .
Jerryberry perforce went with it .
He concentrated on keeping his feet .

The explosive growth of the mall riot has taken enforcement agencies by surprise .
Police have managed to hold the perimeter and are letting people through the lines , but necessarily in small numbers .
The screen showed people being filtered through a police blockade , one at a time .
They looked tired , stunned .
One had two pockets full of stolen wristwatches .
He did not protest when they confiscated the watches and led him away .
A blank - eyed girl maintained a death grip on a rough wooden stick glued to a cardboard rectangle .
The cardboard was crumpled and torn , the Day - Glo colors smeared .
Meanwhile all displacement booths in the area have been shut down from outside .
The enclosed area includes fourteen city blocks .
Viewers are warned away from the following areas .. . .
These scenes were taken by C .B .A. helicopter .
Most of the street lights were out .
Those left cast monstrous shadows through the mall .
Orange flames flickered in the windows of a furniture store .
Diminutive figures , angered by spotlights in the helicopter , pointed and shouted silently into the camera viewpoint .
The deep , earnest voice went on :
We are getting no transmissions from inside the affected area .
A dozen C.B.A. newsmen and an undisclosed number of police in the area have not been heard from ….
Many of the rioters are armed .
A C.B .A. helicopter was shot down early today but was able to crash - land beyond the perimeter .
Close shot of a helicopter smashed against a brick wall .
Two men being carried out on stretchers , in obvious haste .
The source of weapons is not known .
Police conjecture that they may have been looted from Kerr ’s Sport Shop , which has a branch in the mall .
How did it all start ?
The square brown face looking out of the tridee screen was known throughout the English - speaking world .
When news was good , that wide mouth would smile enormously , the filter cigarette in the middle of it smoldering delicately between white front teeth .
It was not smiling now .
That expression was more earnest ; it was shaken .
Jerryberry Jansen looked back with no expression at all .
He had thrown away his camera and seen it destroyed .
He had dropped his coin purse and ear mike into a trash can .
Not being a newsman was a good idea during the mall riot .
Now , an hour after the police had let him through , he was still wandering aimlessly .
He had no goal .
Almost , he had thrown away his identity .
He stood in front of an appliance - store window , watching teevee .
The deep , precise voice of Wash Evans was audible through the glass - barely .
How did it all start ?
Evans vanished , and Jerryberry watched scenes taken by his own camera .
A milling crowd , mostly trying to get past a disturbance .
. . a blue uniformed man , a brawny woman with a heavy purse … .
The officer was trying to arrest a suspected shoplifter , who has not been identified , when this man appeared on the scene .
Picture of Jerryberry Jansen , camera held high , caught in the view of another C.B.A. camera .
Barry Jerome Jansen , a roving newstaper .
It was he who reported the disturbance ( The woman swung her purse .
The policeman went down , his arms half - raised as if to hide his head . ) and reported it as a riot , to this man .
Bailey , at his desk in the C.B.A. building .
Jerryberry twitched .
Sooner or later he would have to report to Bailey .
And explain where his camera had gone .
He ’d picked up some good footage , and it was being used .
A string of bonuses waiting for him .
. . unless Bailey docked him for the cost of the camera .
George Lincoln Bailey sent in a crew to cover the disturbance .
He also put the report on teevee , practically live , editing it as it came .
At this point anyone with a teevee , anywhere in the United States , could see the violence being filmed by a dozen veteran C.B.A. newstapers .
The square dark face returned .
And then it all blew up .
The population of the mall expanded catastrophically , and they all started breaking things .
Why ?
Wash Evans flashed a white grin with a cigarette in it .
Well , it seems that there are people who like riots .
Jerryberry cocked his head .
He had never heard it put quite like that .
Now , that seems silly .
Who would want to be caught in a riot ?
Wash Evans had long , expressive fingers with pink nails .
He began ticking off items on his fingers .
First , more police , to stop what ’s being reported as a riot .
Second , more newstapers .
Third , anyone who wants publicity .
On the screen behind Wash Evans signs shot out of a sea of moving heads .
A girl ’s face swelled enormously , so close she seemed all mouth , and shrieked , „ Legalize wireheading ! “
Anyone with a cause .
Anyone who wants the ear of the public .
There are newsmen here , man !
And cameras !
And publicity !
Behind Evans the scene jumped .
That was Angela Monk coming out of a displacement booth !
Angela Monk , the semi - porno movie actress , very beautiful in a dress of loose - mesh net made from white braided yarn , very self - possessed in the split second before she saw what she ’d flicked into .
She tried to dodge back inside and to hell with the free coverage .
A yell went up ; hands pulled the door open before she could dial again ; other hands pulled her out .
Then there are people who have never seen a riot in person .
A lot of them came .
What they think about it now is something else again .
Now , all of these might not be a big fat percentage of the public .
How many people would be dumb enough to come watch a riot ?
But that little percentage , they all came at once , from all over the United States and some other places , too .
And the more there were , the bigger the crowd got , the louder it got - the better it looked to the looters .
Evans folded down his remaining finger .
And the looters came from everywhere , too .
These days you can get from anywhere to anywhere in three flicks .
Scenes shifted in Evans ’s background .
Store windows being smashed , a subdued wail of sirens .
A C.B.A. helicopter thrashing bout in midair .
An ape of a man carrying stolen tridees under one ann .
Evans looked soberly out at his audience .
So there you have it .
An unidentified shoplifting suspect , a roving newsman who reported a minor disturbance as a riot - „ Good God ! “ Jerryberry Jansen was jolted completely awake .
„ They ’re blaming me ! “
„ They ’re blaming me , too , ‘ said George Bailey .
He ran his hands through his hair , glossy shoulder - length white hair that grew in a fringe around a dome of suntanned scalp .
„ You ’re second in the chain .
I ’m tired .
If only they could find the woman who hit the cop ! “
„ They have n’t ? “
„ Not a sign of her .
Jansen , you look like hell . “
„ I should have changed suits .
This one ’s been through a riot . “
Jerryberry ’s laugh sounded forced , and was .
„ I ’m glad you waited .
It must be way past your quitting time . “
„ Oh , no .
We ’ve been in conference all night .
We only broke up about twenty minutes ago .
Damn Wash Evans anyway !
Have you heard - “
„ I heard some of it . “
„ A couple of the directors want to fire him .
Not unlike the ancient technique of using gasoline to put out a fire .
There were some even wilder suggestions … .
Have you seen a doctor ? “
„ I ’m not hurt .
Just bruised .
. . and tired , and hungry , come to think of it .
I lost my camera . “
„ You ’re lucky you got out alive . “
„ I know . “
George Bailey seemed to brace himself .
„ I hate to be the one to tell you .
We ’re going to have to let you go , Jansen . “
„ What ?
You mean fire me ? “
„ Yah .
Public pressure .
I wo n’t make it pretty for you .
Wash Evans ’s instant documentary has sort of torn things open .
It seems you caused the mall riot .
It would be nice if we could say we fired you for it . “
„ But - but I did n’t ! “
„ Yes , you did .
Think about it . “
Bailey was n’t looking at him .
„ So did I. C.B.A. may have to fire me too . “
„ Now - “ Jerryberry stopped and started over - „ now wait a minute .
If you ’re saying what I think you ’re saying .
. . . but what about freedom of the press ? “
„ We talked about that , too . “
„ I did n’t exaggerate what was happening .
I reported a - a disturbance .
When it turned into a riot , I called it a riot .
Did I lie about anything ?
Anything ? “
„ Oh , in a way , “ Bailey said in a tired voice .
„ You ’ve got your choice about where to point that camera .
You pointed it where there was fighting , did n’t you ?
And I picked out the most exciting scenes .
When we both finished , it looked like a small riot .
Fighting everywhere !
Then everyone who wanted to be in the middle of a small riot came flicking in , just like Evans said , and in thirty seconds we had a large riot .
„ You know what somebody suggested ?
A time limit on news .
A law against reporting anything until twenty - four hours after it happens .
Can you imagine anything sillier ?
For ten thousand years the human race has been working to send news farther and faster , and now .
. . .
Oh , hell , Jansen , I do n’t know about freedom of the press .
But the riot ’s still going on , and everyone ’s blaming you .
You ’re fired . “
„ Thanks . “
Jerryberry surged out of his chair on what felt like the last of his strength .
Bailey moved just as fast , but by the time he got around the desk , Jerryberry was inside a booth , dialing .
He stepped out into a warm black night .
He felt sick and miserable and very tired .
It was two in the morning .
His paper suit was torn and crumpled and clammy .
George Bailey stepped out of the booth behind him .
„ Thought so .
Now , Jansen , let ’s talk sense . “
„ How did you know I ’d be here ? “
„ I had to guess you ’d come straight home .
Jansen , you wo n’t suffer for this .
You may make money on it .
C .B . A. wants an exclusive interview on the riot , your viewpoint .
Thirty - five hundred bucks . “
„ Screw that . “
„ In addition , there ’s two weeks ‘ severance pay and a stack of bonuses .
We used a lot of your tape .
And when this blows over , I ’m sure we ’ll want you back . “
„ Blows over , huh ? “
„ Oh , it will .
News gets stale awfully fast these days .
I know .
Jansen , why do n’t you want thirty - five hundred bucks ? “
„ You ’d play me up as the man who started the mall riot .
Make me more valuable .. . .
Wait a minute .
Who have you got in mind for the interview ? “
„ Who else ? “
„ Wash Evans ! “
„ He ’s fair .
You ’d get your say . “
Bailey considered him .
„ Let me know if you change your mind .
You ’d have a chance to defend yourself , and you ’d get paid besides . “
„ No chance . “
„ All right . “
Bailey went .

For Eric Jansen and his family , displacement booths came as a disaster .
At first he did n’t see it that way .
He was twenty - eight ( and Barry Jerome Jansen was three ) when JumpShift , Inc. , demonstrated the augmented tunnel diode effect on a lead brick .
He watched it on television .
He found the prospects exciting .
Eric Jansen had never worked for a salary .
He wrote .
Poetry and articles and a few short stories , highly polished , admired by a small circle of readers , sold at infrequent intervals to low - paying markets that he regarded as prestigious .
His money came from inherited stocks .
If he had invested in JumpShift then - but millions could tell that sad story .
It was too risky then .
He was thirty - one when commercial displacement booths began to be sold for cargo transport .
He was not caught napping .
Many did not believe that the magic could work until suddenly the phenomenon was changing their world .
But Eric Jansen looked into the phenomenon very carefully .
He found that there was an inherent limitation on the augmented tunnel diode effect .
Teleportation over a difference in altitude made for drastic temperature changes : a drop of seven degrees Fahrenheit for every mile upward , and vice versa , due to conservation of energy .
Conservation of momentum , plus the rotation of the Earth , put a distance limit on lateral travel .
A passenger flicking east would find himself kicked upward by the difference between his velocity and the Earth’s .
Flicking west , he would be slapped down .
North and south , he would be kicked sideways .
Cargo and passenger displacement booths were springing up in every city in America , but Eric Jansen knew that they would always be restricted to short distances .
Even a ten - mile jump would be bumpy .
A passenger flicking halfway around the equator would have to land running - at half a mile per second .
JumpShift stock was sky - high .
Eric Jansen decided it must be overpriced .
He considered carefully , then made his move .
He sold all of his General Telephone stock .
If anyone wanted to talk to someone , he would just go , would n’t he ?
A displacement booth took no longer than a phone call .
He tried to sell his General Motors , wisely , but everyone else wisely made the same decision , and the price fell like a dead bird .
At least he got something back on the stock he owned in motorcycle and motorscooter companies .
Later he regretted that .
It developed that people rode motorcycles and scooters for fun .
Now , with the streets virtually empty , they were buying more than ever .
Still , he had fluid cash - and the opportunity to make a killing .
Airline stock had dropped with other forms of transportation .
Before the general public could realize its mistake , Eric Jansen invested every dime in airlines and aircraft companies .
The first displacement booths in any city were links to the airport .
That lousy half - hour drive from the center of town , the heavy taxi fare in , were gone forever .
And the booths could n’t compete with the airlines themselves !
Of course you still had to check in early - and the planes took off only at specified times . .
What it amounted to was that plane travel was made easier , but shortdistance travel via displacement booth was infinitely easier ( infinitely - try dividing any ten - minute drive by zero ) .
And planes still crashed .
Cassettes had copped the entertainment market , so that television was mostly news these days ; you did n’t have to go anywhere to find out what was happening .
Just turn on the TV .
A plane flight was n’t worth the hassle .
As for the telephone stock , people still made long - distance calls .
They tended to phone first before they went visiting .
They would give out a phone - booth number , whereas they would not give out a displacement booth number .
The airlines survived , somehow , but they paid rock - bottom dividends .
Barry Jerome Jansen grew up poor in the midst of a boom period .
His father hated the displacement booths but used them , because there was nothing else .
Jerryberry accepted that irrational hatred as part of his father ’s personality .
He did not share it .
He hardly noticed the displacement booths .
They were part of the background .
The displacement booths were the most important part of a newstaper ’s life , and still he hardly noticed their existence .
Until the day they turned on him .
-4 -
In the morning there were messages stored in his phone .
He heard them out over breakfast .
Half a dozen news services and tapezines wanted exclusives on the riot .
One call was from Bailey at C.B.A .
The price had gone up to four thousand .
The others did not mention price , but one was from Playboy .
That gave him furiously to think .
Playboy paid high , and they liked unpopular causes .
Three people wanted to murder him .
On two of them the teevee was blanked .
The third was a graying dowdy woman , all fat and hate and disappointed hopes , who showed him a kitchen knife and started to tell him what she wanted to do with it .
Jerryberry cut her off , shuddering .
He wondered if any of them could possibly get hold of his displacement - booth number .
There was a check in the mail .
Severance pay and bonuses from C .B .A .
So that was that .
He was setting the dishes in the dishwasher when the phone rang .
He hesitated , then decided to answer .
It was Janice Wolfe - a pretty oval face , brown eyes , a crown of long , wavy , soft brown hair - and not an anonymous killer .
She lost her smile as she saw him .
„ You look grim .
Could you use some cheering up ? “
„ Yes ! “ Jerryberry said fervently .
„ Come on over .
Apartment six , booth number - “
„ I live here , remember ? “
He laughed .
He ’d forgotten .
You got used to people living anywhere and everywhere .
George Bailey lived in Nevada ; he commuted to work every morning in three flicks , using the long - distance displacement booths at Las Vegas and Los Angeles International Airports .
Those long - distance booths had saved the airlines - after his father had dribbled away most of his stocks to feed his family .
They had been operating only two years .
And come to think of it - Doorbell .
Over coffee he told Janice about the riot .
She listened sympathetically , asking occasional questions to draw him out .
At first Jerryberry tried to talk entertainingly , until he realized , first , that she was n’t indulging in a spectator sport , and second , that she knew all about the riot already .
She knew he ’d been fired , too .
„ That ’s why I called .
They put it on the morning news , “ she told him .
„ It figures . “
„ What are you going to do now ? “
„ Get drunk .
Alone if have to .
Would you like to spend a lost weekend with me ? “
She hesitated .
„ You ’ll be bitter . “
„ Yah , I probably will .
Not fit to live with .
.. .
Hey , Janice .
Do you know anything about how the long - distance displacement booths work ? “
„ No . Should I ? “
„ The mall riot could n’t have happened without the long - distance booths .
That damn Wash Evans might at least have mentioned the fact .
. . except that I only just thought of it myself .
Funny .
There has n’t ever been a riot that happened that quick . “
„ I ’ll come with you , “ Janice decided .
„ What ?
Good . “
„ You do n’t start drinking this early in the morning , do you ? “
„ I guess not .
Are you free today ? “
„ Every day , during summer .
I teach school . “
„ Oh .
So what ’ll we do ?
San Diego Zoo ? “ he suggested at random .
„ Sounds like fun . “
They made no move to get up .
It felt peaceful in Jerryberry ’s tiny kitchen nook .
There was still coffee .
„ You could get a bad opinion of me this way .
I feel like tearing things up . “
„ Go ahead . “
„ Mean it ? “
„ Me , too , “ she said serenely .
„ You need to tear things up .
Fine , go ahead .
After that you can try to put your life back together . “
„ Just what kind of school do you teach ? “
Janice laughed .
„ Fifth grade . “
There was quiet .
„ You know what the punch line is ?
Wash Evans wants to interview me !
After that speech he made ! “
„ That sounds like a good idea , “ she said surprisingly .
„ Gives you a chance to give your side of the story .
You did n’t really cause the mall riot , did you ? “
„ No !. . . No. Janice , he ’s just too damn good .
He ’d make mincemeat of me .
By the time he got through I ’d be The Man Who Caused the Mall Riot in every English - speaking country in the world , and some others , too , because he gets translations - “
„ He ’s just a commentator . “
Jerryberry started to laugh .
„ He makes it look so easy , “ he said .
„ A hundred million eyes out there , watching him , and he knows it .
Have you ever seen him self - conscious ?
Have you ever heard him at a loss for words ?
My dad used to say it about writing , but it ’s true for Wash Evans .
The hardest trick in the world is to make it look easy , so easy that any clod thinks he can do it just as well .
„ Hell , I know what caused the mall riot .
The news program , yes .
He ’s right , there .
But the long - distance displacement booth did it , too .
Control those , and we could stop that kind of riot from ever happening again .
But what could I tell Wash Evans about it ?
What do I know about displacement booths ? “
„ Well , what do you know ? “
Jerryberry Jansen looked into his coffee cup for a long time .
Presently he said , „ I know how to find out things .
I know how to find out who knows most about what and then go ask .
Legwork .
They hammered at it in the journalism classes .
I know legwork . “
He looked up and met her eyes .
Then he lunged across the table to reach the phone .
„ Hello ?
Oh , hi , Jansen .
Changed your mind ? “
„ Yes , but - “
„ Good , good !
I ’ll put you through to -“
„ Yes , but ! “
„ Oh. Okay , go ahead . “
„ I want some time to do some research . “
„ Now , damn it , Jensen , you know that time is just what we do n’t have !
Old news is no news .
What kind of research ? “
„ Displacement booths . “
„ Why that ?
Never mind ; it ’s your business .
How much time ? “
„ How much can you afford ? “
„ Damn little . “
„ Bailey , C.B.A. upped my price to four thousand this morning .
How come ? “
„ You did n’t see it ?
It ’s on every screen in the country .
The rioters broke through the police line .
They ’ve got a good section of Venice now , and there are about twice as many of them , because the police did n’t shut down the displacement booths in the area until about twenty minutes too late .
Twenty minutes ! “
Bailey seemed actually to be grinding his teeth .
„ We held off reporting the breakthrough until they could do it .
We did .
A.B .S. reported it live on all stations .
That ’s where all the new rioters came from . “
„ Then . . . it looks like the mall riot is going to last a little longer . “
„ That it does .
And you want more time .
Things are working out , are n’t they ? “
Then , „ Sorry .
Those A.B.S. bastards .
How much time do you want ? “
„ As much as I can get .
A week . “
„ You ’ve got to be kidding .
You maybe can get twenty - four hours , only I ca n’t make the decision .
Why do n’t you talk to Evans himself ? “
„ Fine .
Put him on . “
The teevee went on hold .
Pale - blue flow patterns floated upward in what had become a twenty - inch Kaleidoscope .
Waiting , Jerryberry said , „ If this riot gets any bigger , I could be more famous than Hitler . “
Janice set his coffee beside him .
She said , „ Or Mrs. O’Leary ’s cow . “
The screen came on .
„ Jansen , can you get over here right now ?
Wash Evans wants to talk to you in person . “
„ Okay . “ Jerryberry clicked off .
He felt a thrumming inside him .
. . as if he felt the motion of the world , and the world were spinning faster and faster .
Surely things were happening fast … .
Janice said , „ No lost weekend . “
„ Not yet , love .
Have you any idea what you ’ve let me in for ?
I may not sleep for days .
I ’ll have to find out what teleportation is , what it does .
Where do I start ? “
„ Wash Evans .
You ’d better get moving . “
„ Right . “
He bolted his coffee in three swift gulps .
„ Thanks .
Thanks for coming over , thanks for jarring me off the dime .
We ’ll see how it works out . “
He went , pulling on a coat .
Wash Evans was five feet four inches tall .
People sometimes forgot that size was invisible in a teevee close - up .
In the middle of a televised interview , when the camera was flashing back and forth between two angry faces , then the deep , sure voice and the dark , mobile , expressive face of Wash Evans could be devastatingly convincing .
Wash Evans looked up at Jerryberry Jansen and said , „ I ’ve been wondering if I owe you an apology . “
„ Take your time , “ said Jerryberry .
He finished buttoning his coat .
„ I do n’t .
Fact is , I psyched out the mall riot as best I knew how , and I think I did it right .
I did n’t tell the great unwashed public you caused it all .
I just told it like it happened . “
„ You left some things out . “
„ All right , now we ’ve got something to talk about .
Sit down . “
They sat .
Their faces were level now .
Jerryberry said , „ This present conversation is not for publication and is not to be considered an interview .
I have an interview to sell .
I do n’t want to undercut myself . “
„ I accept your terms on behalf of the network .
We ’ll give you a tape of this conversation . “
„ I ’m making my own . “ Jerryberry tapped his inside pocket , which clicked .
Wash Evans grinned .
„ Of course you are , my child .
Now , what did I miss ? “
„ Displacement booths . “
„ Well , sure .
If the booths had been cut off earlier - “
„ If the booths did n’t exist . “
„ You ’re kidding .
No , you ’re not .
Jansen , that ’s a wishing horse .
Displacement booths are here to stay . “
„ I know .
But think about this .
Newstapers have been around longer than displacement booths .
Roving newstapers , like me – we ’ve been using the booths since they were invented . “
„ So ? “
„ Why did n’t the mall riot happen earlier ? “
„ I see what you mean .
Hmm .
The airport booths ? “
„ Jansen , are you actually going to face the great unwashed teevee public and tell them to give up long - distance displacement booths ? “
„ No .
I… do n’t know just what I have in mind .
That ’s why I want some time .
I want to know more . “
„ Uh - huh , “ said Evans , and waited .
Jerryberry said , „ Turn it around .
Are you going to try to talk the public into giving up news programs ? “
„ No .
Maybe to put some restrictions on newstaping practices .
We ’re too fast these days .
A machine wo n’t work without friction .
Neither does a civilization .
. . .
But we ’d ruin the networks , would n’t we ? “
„ You ’d cut your own throat . “
„ Oh , I ’d be out . “
Evans mashed out a cigarette .
„ Take away the news broadcasts , and they would n’t have anything left to sell but educational teevee .
Nothing to sell but toys and breakfast cereal .
Jansen , I do n’t know . “
„ Good , “ said Jerryberry .
„ You question my dispassionate judgment ? “
Evans chuckled in his throat .
„ I ’m on both sides .
Suppose we do an interview live , at ten tonight .
That ’ll give you twelve hours - “
„ Twelve hours ! “
„ That ’s enough , is n’t it ?
You want to research teleportation .
I want to get this in while people are still interested in the riot .
Not just for the ratings , but because we both have something to say . “
Jerryberry tried to interrupt , but Evans overrode him .
„ We ’ll advance you a thousand , and three more if we do the interview .
Nothing if we do n’t .
That ’ll get you back on time . “
Jerryberry accepted it .
„ One thing .
Can you make Bailey forget to cancel my C.B.A. card for a while ?
I may have to do a lot of traveling . “
„ I ’ll tell him .
I do n’t know if he ’ll do it . “

He flicked in at Los Angeles International , off - center in a long curved row of displacement booths : upright glass cylinders with rounded tops , no different from the booths on any street corner .
On the opposite wall , a good distance away , large red letters said „ TWA . “
He stood a moment , thinking .
Then he dialed again .
He was home , at the Shady Rest .
He dialed again .
He was near the end of the row – a different row , with no curve to it .
And the opposite wall bore the emblem of United .
The terminal was empty except for one man in a blue uniform who was waxing the floor .
Jerryberry stepped out .
For upwards of a minute he watched the line of booths .
People flicked in at random .
Generally they did not even look up .
They would dial a long string of digits - sometimes making a mistake , snarling something , and starting over - and be gone .
There were so many that the booths themselves seemed to be flickering .
He took several seconds of it on the Minox .
Beneath the United emblem was a long , long row of empty counters with scales between them , for luggage .
The terminal was spotless - and empty , unused .
Haunted by a constant flow of ghosts .
A voice behind him said , „ You want something ? “
„ Is there a manager ’s office ? “
The uniformed man pointed down an enormous length of corridor .
„ The maintenance section ’s down that way , where the boarding area used to be .
I ’ll call ahead , let them know you ’re coming . “
The corridor was long , unnecessarily long , and it echoed .
The walk was eating up valuable time .
. . and then an open cart came from the other end and silently pulled up alongside him .
A straight - backed old man in a one - button business lounger said , „ Hello .
Want a ride ? “
„ Thanks . “ Jerryberry climbed aboard .
He handed over his C.B.A. credit card .
„ I ’m doing some research for a - a documentary of sorts .
What can you tell me about the long - distance booths ? “
„ Anything you like .
I ’m Nils Kjerulf .
I helped install these booths , and I ’ve been working on them ever since . “
„ How do they work ? “
„ Where do I start ?
Do you know how a normal booth works ? “
„ Sure .
The load is n’t supposed to exist at all between the two endpoints .
Like the electron in a tunnel diode . “
An answer right out of the science section of any tapezine .
Beyond that he could fake it .
This Nils Kjerulf was lean and ancient , with deep smile wrinkles around his eyes and mouth .
His hair was thick and white .
He said , „ They had to give up that theory .
When you ’re sending a load to Mars , say , you have to assume that something exists in the ten minutes or so it takes the load to make the trip .
Conservation of energy . “
„ All right .
What is it ? “
„ For ten minutes it ’s a kind of superneutrino .
That ’s what they tell me .
I ’m not a physicist .
I was in business administration in college .
A few years ago they gave me a year of retraining so I could handle long - distance displacement machinery .
If you ’re really interested in theory , you ought to ask someone at Cape Canaveral .
Here we are . “
Two escalators , one going up , one motionless .
They rode up .
Jerryberry asked , „ Why did n’t they build closer ?
Think of all the walking we ’d save . “
„ You never heard a 707 taking off ? “
„ Sound is only part of it .
If a plane ever crashed here , nobody would want it hitting all the main buildings at once . “
The escalator led to two semicircular chambers .
One was empty but for a maze of chairs and couches and low partitions , all done in old chrome and fading orange .
In the other the couches had been ripped out and replaced with instrument consoles .
Jerryberry counted half a dozen men supervising the displays .
A dim snoring sound began somewhere , like an electric razor going in the next - door apartment .
Jerryberry turned his head , seeking .
It was outside .
Outside , behind a wall of windows , a tiny single - engine plane taxied down a runway .
„ Yes , we still function as an airport , “ said Nils Kjerulf .
„ Skydiving , sport flying , gliding .
I fly some myself .
The jumbo - jet pilots used to hate us ; we use up just as much landing time as a 747 .
Now we ’ve got the runways to ourselves . “
„ I gather you were a manager somewhere . “
„ Right here .
I ran this terminal before anyone had heard of teleportation .
I watched it ruin us .
Thirty years , Mr. Jansen . “
„ With no offense intended whatever , why did they train a professional administrator in quantum displacement physics ?
Why not the other way around ? “
„ There were n’t any experts where the long - distance booths were concerned , Mr. Jansen .
They ’re new . “
„ What have you learned in two years ?
Do you still get many breakdowns ? “
„ We still do .
Every two weeks or so , something goes out of synch .
Then we go out of service for however long it takes to find it and fix it - usually about an hour . “
„ And what happens to the passenger ? “
Kjerulf looked surprised .
„ Nothing .
He stays where he started - or rather , that giant neutrino we were talking about is reflected back to the transmitter if the receiver ca n’t pick it up .
The worst thing that can happen is that the link to the velocity damper could be lost , in which case - but we ’ve developed safeguards against that .
„ No , the passengers just stop coming in , and we go out of service , and the other companies take the overflow .
There is n’t any real competition between the companies anymore .
What ’s the point ?
T.W.A. and United and Eastern and the rest used to advertise that they had better meals in flight , more comfortable seats , prettier hostesses .. . like that .
How long do you spend in a displacement booth ?
So when we converted over , we set the dialing system up so you just dial Los Angeles International or whatever , and the companies get customers at random .
Everyone saves a fortune in advertising . “
„ An antitrust suit - “
„ Would have us dead to rights .
Nobody ’s done it , because there ’s no point .
It works , the way we run it .
Each company has its own velocity shift damper .
We could n’t all get knocked out at once .
In an emergency I think any of the companies could handle all of the long - distance traffic . “
„ Mr. Kjerulf , what is a velocity shift damper ? “
Kjerulf looked startled .
Jerryberry said , „ I took journalism . “
„ Ah . “
„ It ’s not just curiosity .
My dad lost a fortune on airline stock - “
„ So did I , “ said Kjerulf , half - smiling with old pain .
„ Oh ? “
„ Sometimes I feel I ’ve sold out .
The booths could n’t possibly compete with the airlines , could they ?
They would n’t send far enough .
Yet they ruined us . “
„ My dad figured the same way . “
„ And now the booths do send that far , and I ’m working for them , or they ’re working for me .
There was n’t all that much reason to build the long - distance systems at airports .
Lots of room here , of course , and an organization already set up .
. . but they really did it to save the airline companies . “
„ A little late . “
„ Perhaps .
Some day they ’ll turn us into a public utility . “
Kjerulf looked about the room , then called to a man seated near the flat wall of the semicircle .
„ Dan ! “
„ Yo ! “ the man boomed without looking up .
„ Can you spare me twenty minutes for a public - relations job ? “
The man stood up , then climbed up on his chair .
He looked slowly about the room .
Jerryberry guessed that he could see every instrument board from where he was standing .
He called , „ Sure .
No sweat . “
They took the cart back to the terminal .
They entered a booth .
Jerryberry inserted his C. B. A. credit card , then waited while Kjerulf dialed .
They were in a concrete building .
Beyond large square windows a sunlit sea of blue water heaved and splashed , almost at floor level .
Men looked around curiously , recognized Nils Kjerulf , and turned back to their work .
„ Lake Michigan .
And out there - “ Kjerulf pointed .
Jerryberry saw a tremendous white mass , a flattened dome , very regular .
A great softly rounded island .
„ - is the United Air Lines velocity damper .
All of the dampers look about like that , but they float in different lakes or oceans .
Aeroflot uses the Caspian Sea .
The T.W.A. damper is in the Gulf of Mexico . “
„ Just what is it ? “
„ Essentially it ’s a hell of a lot of soft iron surrounded by a hell of a lot more foam plastic , enough to float it , plus a displacement - booth receiver feeding into the iron .
Look , see it surge ? “
The island rose several feet , slowly , then fell back as slowly .
Ripples moved outward and became waves as they reached the station .
„ That must have been a big load .
Now , here ’s how it works .
You know that the rotation of the Earth puts a limit on how far you can send a load .
If you were to shift from here to Rio de Janeiro , say , you ’d flick in moving up and sideways - mainly up , because Rio and L.A. are almost the same distance from the equator .
„ But with the long - distance booths , the receiver picks up the kinetic energy and shunts it to the United Air Lines velocity damper .
That big mass of iron surges up or down or sideways until the water stops it - or someone flicks in from Rio and the damping body stops cold . “
Jerryberry thought about it .
„ What about conservation of rotation ?
It sounds like you ’re slowing down the Earth . “
„ We are .
There ’s nothing sacred about conservation of rotation , except that the energy has to go somewhere .
There are pumps to send water through the damper bodies if they get too hot . “
Jerryberry pulled out the Minox .
„ Mind if I take some pictures ? “
„ No , go ahead . “
The Minox was a movie camera , but it would not have the resolution of a press camera .
No matter .
If he had the time he could comeback .
. . not that he thought he would .
He took shots of the men at work in the station , of Nils Kjerulf with his back to the windows .
He shot almost a minute of the great white island itself .
He was hoping it would surge ; and presently it did , sinking sideways , surging up again .
Waves beat at the station .
A jet of white steam sprayed from the top of the great white mass .
„ Good , “ he said briskly to himself .
He folded the spidery tripod legs and dropped the camera in his pocket .
He turned to Kjerulf , who had been watching the proceedings with some amusement .
„ Mr. Kjerulf , can you tell me anything about traffic control ?
Is there any ? “
„ How do you mean ?
Customs ? “
„ Not exactly .. . but tell me about customs . “
„ The customs terminal in Los Angeles is at T.W.A .
You have n’t been out of the country recently ?
No ?
Well , any big-city airport has a customs terminal .
In a small country there ’s likely to be just one .
If you dial a number outside the country , any country , you wind up in somebody ’s customs terminal .
The booths there do n’t have dials , you see .
You have to cross the customs line to dial out . “
„ Clever .
Are there any restrictions on traffic within the United States ? “
„ No , you just drop your chocolate dollars in and dial .
Unless it ’s a police matter .
If the police know that someone ’s trying to leave the city they may set up a watch in the terminals .
We can put a delay on the terminals to give a detective time to look at a passenger ’s face and see if he ’s who they want . “
„ But nothing to stop passengers from coming in . “
„ No , except that it ’s possible to Kjerulf trailed off oddly , then finished , „ … turn off any booth by remote control , from the nearest JumpShift maintenance system .
What are you thinking of , the mall riot ? “
There was no more to say .
He left Nils Kjerulf in the United terminal in Los Angeles .
He dialed for customs .
For several minutes Jerryberry watched them flicking in .
There were two types :
The tourists came in couples , sometimes with a child or two .
They flicked in looking interested and harried and a little frightened .
Their clothing was outlandish and extraordinary .
Before they left the booths , they would look about them mistrustfully .
Sometimes they formed larger groups .
The businessmen traveled alone .
They wore conservative or old - fashioned clothing and carried one suitcase : large or small , but one .
They were older than the tourists .
They moved with authority , walking straight out of the booths the moment they appeared .
At the barner : four men in identical dark suits with shield - shaped shoulder patches .
Jerryberry was on the wrong side of the barrier to command their attention .
He was thinking of dialing himself to Mexico and back when one of them noticed him and pegged him as a newstaper .
His name was Gregory Scheffer .
Small and round and middle - aged , he perched on the wooden barner and clasped one knee in both hands .
„ Sure , I can talk a while .
This is n’t one of the busy days .
The only time these booths really get a workout is Christmas and New Year and Bastille Day and like that .
Look around you , “ he said , waving a pudgy hand expansively .
„ About four times as many incoming as there was six months ago .
I used to want to search every bag that came through , just to be doing something .
If we keep getting more and more of them this way , we ’ll need twice as many customs people next year . “
„ Why do you suppose - “
„ Did you know that the long - distance booths have been operating for two solid years ?
It ’s only in the last six months or so that we ’ve started to get so many passengers .
They had to get used to traveling again .
Look around you ; look at all this space .
It used to be full before JumpShift came along .
People have got out of the habit of traveling , that ’s all there is to it .
For twenty solid years .
They have to get back into it . “
„ Guess so . “
Jerryberry tried to remember why he was here .
„ Mr. Scheffer - “
„ Greg . “
„ Jerryberry .
Customs ‘ main job is to stop smuggling , is n’t it ? “
„ Well . . . it used to be .
Now we only slow it down , and not very damn much .
Nobody in his right mind would smuggle anything through customs .
There are safer ways . “
„ Oh ? “
„ Diamonds , for instance .
Diamonds are practically indestructible .
You could rig a cargo booth in Kansas to receive from .
. . oh , there ’s a point in the South Pacific to match anyplace in the United States : same longitude , opposite latitude .
You do n’t need a velocity damper if you put the boat in the right place .
Diamonds ?
You could ship in Swiss watches that way .
Though that ’s pretty finicky .
You ’d want to pad them . “
„ Good grief .
You could smuggle anything you pleased , anywhere . “
„ Just about .
You do n’t need the ocean trick .
Say you rig a booth a mile south of the Canadian border , and another booth a mile north .
That ’s not much of a jump .
You can flick further than that just in L.A .
I think we ’re obsolete , “ said Scheffer .
„ I think smuggling laws are obsolete .
You wo n’t publish this ? “
„ I wo n’t use your name . “
„ I guess that ’s okay . “
„ Can you get me over to the incoming booths ?
I want to take some pictures . “
„ What for ? “
„ I ’m not sure yet . “
„ Let ’s see some ID . “ Gregory Scheffer did n’t trust evasive answers .
The incoming booths were in his jurisdiction .
He studied the C.B.A. card for a few seconds and suddenly said , „ Jansen !
Mall riot ! “
„ Right ! “
„ What was it like ? “
Jerryberry invested half a minute telling him .
„ So now I ’m trying to find out how it got started .
If there were some way to stop all of those people from pouring in like that - “
„ You wo n’t find it here .
Look , a dozen passengers and we ’re almost busy .
A thousand people suddenly pour through those booths , and what would we do ?
Hide under something , that ’s what we ’d do . “
„ I still want to see the incoming booths . “
Scheffer thought it over , shrugged , and let him through .
He stood at Jerryberry ’s shoulder while Jerryberry used his eye and his camera .
The booth was just like a street - corner booth , except for the blank metal face where a dial would be .
„ I do n’t know what ’s underneath , “ Scheffer told him .
„ For all of me , it ’s just like any other booth .
How much work would it be to leave off the dial ? “
Which made sense .
But it was no help at all .

They tape the Tonight Show at two in the afternoon .
Twenty minutes into it , the first guest is lolling at his ease , just rapping , talking off the top of his head , ignoring the probable hundred million eyes behind the cameras .
This is a valuable knack , and rare .
Tonight ’s first guest is a series hero in a science - fiction tapezine .
He is saying , „ Have you ever seen a red tide ?
It ’s thick down at Hermosa Beach .
I was there this weekend .
In the daytime it ’s just dirty water , muddy - looking , and it smells .
But at night … “
This enthusiasm that can reach through a teevee screen to touch fifty million minds , this enthusiasm is in no way artificial .
He means it .
He only expresses it better than most men .
He leans forward in his chair ; his eyes blaze ; there is harsh tension in his voice .
„ The breakers glow like churning blue fire !
Those plankton are fluorescent .
And they ’re all through the wet sand .
Walk across it , it flashes blue light under your feet !
Kick it , scuff your feet through it , it lights up .
Throw a handful of sand , it flashes where it hits !
This light is n’t just on the surface .
Stamp your foot , you can see the structure of the sand by the way it flares .
You ’ve got to see it to believe it , “ he says .
They will run the tape starting at eight thirty tonight .

Standard booths : how standardized ?
Who makes them besides JumpShaft ?
Monopoly ?
How extensive ?
Skip spaceflight ?
Space exploration depended utterly on teleportation .
But the subject was likely to be very technical and not very useful .
He could gain time by skipping it entirely .
Jerryberry considered , then turned the question mark into an exclamation point .
His twelve hours had become nine .
Of the half - dozen key clubs to which he belonged , the Cave des Roys was the quietest .
A place of stone and wood , a good place to sit and think .
The wall behind the bar was several hundred wine bottles in a cement matrix .
Jerryberry looked into the strange lights in the glass , sipped occasionally at a silver fizz , and jotted down whatever occurred to him .
Sociology .
What has teleportation done to society ?
Cars .
Oil companies .
Oil stocks .
See back issues Wall Street Journal .
Watts riot ?
Chicago riot ?
He crossed that last one out .
The Chicago riot had been political , had n’t it ?
Then he could n’t remember any other riots .
They were too far in the past .
He wrote :
Riot control .
Police procedure .
Crime ?
The crime rate should have soared after displacement booths provided the instant getaway .
Had it ?
Sooner or later he was going to have to drop in at police headquarters .
He ’d hate that , but he might learn something .
Likewise the library , for several hours of dull research .
Then ?
He certainly was n’t going to persuade everybody to give up displacement booths :
He wrote : OBJECTIVE : Demonstrate that displacement booths imply instant riot .
It ’s a social problem .
Solve it on that basis .
For the sake of honesty he added , Get ‚em off my back .
CROWDS .
In minutes the mall had become a milling mass of men .
But he ’d seen crowds form almost as fast .
It might happen regularly in certain places .
After a moment ’s thought he wrote .
Tahiti .
Jerusalem .
Mecca .
Easter Island .
Stonehenge .
Olduvai Gorge .
He stood up .
Start with the phone calls .
„ Doctor Robin Whyte , “ Jerryberry said to the phone screen .
„ Please . “
The receptionist at Seven Sixes was no sex symbol .
She was old enough to be Jerryberry ’s aunt , and handsome rather than beautiful .
She heard him out with a noncommittal dignity that , he sensed , could turn glacial in an instant .
„ Barry Jerome Jansen , “ he said carefully .
He waited on hold , watching dark - red patterns flow upward in the phone screen .
Key clubs were neither new nor rare .
Some were small and local ; others were chains , existing in a dozen or a hundred locations .
Everyone belonged to a club ; most people belonged to several .
But Seven Sixes was something else .
Its telephone number was known universally .
Its membership , large in absolute terms , was small for an organization so worldwide .
It included presidents , kings , winners of various brands of Nobel prize .
Its location was - unknown .
Somewhere in Earth ’s temperate zones .
Jerryberry had never heard of its displacement booth number being leaked to anyone .
It took a special kind of gall for one of Jerryberry ’s social standing to dial 666-6666 .
He had learned that gall in journalism class .
Go to the source - no matter how highly placed ; be polite , be prepared to wait , but keep trying , and never , never worry about wasting the great man ’s time .
Funny :
They still called it journalism , though newspapers had died .
And the Constitution that had protected newspapers still protected „ the press . “
For a while .
But laws could change .
The screen cleared .
Robin
Whyte the physicist had been a mature man of formidable reputation back when JumpShift first demonstrated teleportation .
Today , twenty - five years later , he was the last living member of the team that had formed JumpShift .
His scalp was pink and bare .
His face was round and soft , almost without wrinkles , but slack , as if the muscles were tired .
He looked like somebody ’s favorite grandfather .
He looked Jerryberry Jansen up and down very thoroughly .
He said , „ I wanted to see what you looked like . “
He reached for the cutoff switch .
„ I did n’t do it , “ Jerryberry said quickly .
Whyte stopped with his finger on the cutoff .
„ No ? “
„ I am not responsible for the mall riot .
I hope to prove it . “
The old man thought it over .
„ And you propose to involve me ?
How ? “
Jerryberry took a chance .
„ I think I can demonstrate that displacement booths and the mall riot are intimately connected .
My problem is that I do n’t know enough about displacement - booth technology . “
„ And you want my help ? “
„ You invented the displacement booths practically single - handed , “ Jerryberry said straight - faced .
„ Instant riots , instant getaways , instant smuggling .
Are you going to just walk away from the problem ? “
Robin
Whyte laughed in a high - pitched voice , his head thrown way back , his teeth white and perfect and clearly false .
Jerryberry waited , wondering if it would work .
„ All right , “ Whyte said .
„ Come on over .
Wait a minute , what am I thinking ?
You ca n’t come to Seven Sixes .
I ’ll meet you somewhere .
L’Orangerie , New York City .
At the bar . “
The screen cleared before Jerryberry could answer .
That was quick , he thought .
And , Move , idiot .
Get there before he changes his mind .
In New York it was just approaching cocktail hour .
L’Orangerie was polished wood and dim lighting and chafing dishes of Swedish meatballs on toothpicks .
Jerryberry captured a few to go with his drink .
He had not had lunch yet .
Robin
Whyte wore a long - sleeved gray one - piece with a collar that draped into a short cape , and the cape was all the shifting rainbow colors of an oil film .
The height of fashion , except that it should have been skin - tight .
It was loose all over , bagging where Whyte bagged , and it looked very comfortable .
Whyte sipped at a glass of milk .
„ One by one I give up my sins , “ he said .
„ Drinking was the last , and I have n’t really turned loose of it yet .
But almost .
That ’s why your reverse salesmanship hooked me in .
I ’ll talk to anyone .
What do I call you ? “
„ Barry Jerome Jansen . “
„ Let me put it this way .
I ’m Robbie .
What do I call you ? “
„ Oh. Jerryberry . “
Whyte laughed .
„ I ca n’t call anyone Jerryberry .
Make it Barry . “
„ God bless you , sir . “
„ What do you want to know ? “
„ How big is JumpShift ? “
„ Ooohhh , pretty big .
What ’s your standard of measurement ? “
Jerryberry , who had wondered if he was being laughed at , stopped wondering .
„ How many kinds of booth do you make ? “
„ Hard to say .
Three , for general use .
Maybe a dozen more for the space industry .
Those are still experimental .
We lose money on the space industry .
We ’d make it back if we could start producing drop - ships in quantity .
We ’ve got a ship on the drawing boards that would transmit itself to any drop - ship receiver . “
Jerryberry prompted him .
„ And three for general use , you said . “
„ Yes .
We ’ve made over three hundred million passenger booths in the past twenty years .
Then there ’s a general - use cargo booth .
The third model is a tremendous portable booth for shipping really big , fragile cargoes .
Like a prefab house or a rocket booster or a live sperm whale .
You can set the thing in place almost anywhere , using three strap - on helicopter setups .
I did n’t believe it when I saw it . “
Whyte sipped at his milk .
„ You ’ve got to remember that I ’m not in the business anymore .
I ’m still chairman of the board , but a bunch of younger people give most of the orders , and I hardly ever get into the factories . “
„ Does JumpShift have a monopoly on displacement booths ? “
He saw the Newstaper !
reaction , a tightening at Whyte ’s eyes and lips .
„ Wrong word , “ Jerryberry said quickly .
„ Sotty .
What I meant was , who makes displacement booths ?
I ’m sure you make most of the passenger booths in the United States . “
„ All of them .
It ’s not a question of monopoly .
Anyone could make his own booths .
Any community could .
But it would be hideously expensive .
The cost does n’t drop until you ’re making millions of them .
So suppose . . .
Chile , for instance .
Chile has less than a million passenger booths , all JumpShift model .
Suppose they had gone ahead and made their own .
They ’d have only their own network , unless they built a direct copy of some other model .
All the booths in a network have to have the same volume . “
„ Naturally . “
„ In practice there are about ten networks worldwide .
The U.S.S.R. network is the biggest by far .
I think the smallest is Brazil - “
„ What happens to the air in a receiver ? “
Whyte burst out laughing .
„ I knew that was coming !
It never fails . “
He sobered .
„ We tried a lot of things .
It turns out the only practical solution is to send the air in the receiver back to the transmitter , which means that every transmitter has to be a receiver , too . “
„ Then you could get a free ride if you knew who was about to flick in from where , when . “
„ Of course you could , but would you want to bet on it ? “
„ I might , if I had something to smuggle past customs . “
„ How do you mean ? “
„ I ’m just playing with ideas .
The incoming booths at customs are incoming because there ’s no way to dial out - “
„ I remember .
Type
Is with the dials removed . “
„ Okay .
Say you wanted to smuggle something into the country .
You flick to customs in Argentina .
Then a friend flicks from California to Argentina , into your booth .
You wind up in his booth , in California , and not behind the customs barrier . “
„ Brilliant , “ said Whyte .
„ Unfortunately there ’s a fail - safe to stop anyone from flicking into an occupied booth . “
„ Sorry , “ Whyte said , grinning .
„ What do you care ?
There are easier ways to smuggle .
Too many .
I ’m not really sorry .
I ’m a laissez - faire man myself . “
„ I wondered if you could do something with dials to stop another mall riot . “
Whyte thought about it .
„ Not by taking the dials off .
If you wanted to stop a riot , you ’d have to stop people from coming in .
Counters on the booths , maybe . “
„ What was it like , Barry ? “
„ Crowded .
Like a dam broke .
The law did shut the booths down from outside , but not fast enough .
Maybe that ’s the answer .
Cut out the booths at the first sign of trouble . “
„ We ’d get a lot of people mad at us . “
„ You would , would n’t you ? “
„ Like the power brownouts in the seventies and eighties .
Or like obscene telephone calls .
You could n’t do anything about them , except get more and more uptight .
. . readier to smash things .
. . .
That ’s why riots happen , Barry .
People who are a little bit angry all the time . “
„ Oh ? “
„ All the riots I remember . “
Whyte smiled .
„ There have n’t been any for a long time .
Give JumpShift some credit for that .
We stopped some of the things that kept everyone a little bit angry all the time .
Smog .
Traffic jams .
Slow mail .
Slum landlords ; you do n’t have to live near your job or your welfare office or whatever .
Job hunting .
Crowding .
Have you ever been in a traffic jam ? “
„ Maybe when I was a little boy . “
„ Friend of mine was a college professor for a while .
His problem was he lived in the wrong place .
Five days a week he would spend an hour driving to work - you do n’t believe me ?- and an hour and a quarter driving home , because traffic was heavier then .
Eventually he gave it up to be a writer . “
„ Gawd , I should hope so ! “
„ It was n’t even that rare , “ Whyte said seriously .
„ It was rough if you owned a car , and rougher if you did n’t .
JumpShift did n’t cause riots ; we cured them . “
And he seemed to wait for Jerryberry ‘ s agreement .
Silence stretched long enough to become embarrassing … yet the only thing Jerryberry might have said to break it was „ But what about the mall riot ? “
He held his peace .
„ Drain that thing , “ Whyte said abruptly .
„ I ’ll show you . “
„ Show me ? “
„ Finish that drink .
We ’re going places . “
Whyte drank half a glass of milk in three gulps , his Adam ’s apple bobbing .
He lowered the glass .
„ Well ? “
„ Ready . “
On Madison Avenue the sunset shadows ran almost horizontally along the glass faces of buildings .
Robin
Whyte stepped out of L’Orangerie and turned right .
Four feet away , a displacement booth .
In the booth he blocked the hand Jerryberry would have used to insert his C.B.A. card .
„ My treat .
This was my idea .
. . .
Anyway , some of these numbers are secret . “
He inserted his own card and dialed three numbers .
Twice they saw rows of long - distance booths .
Then it was bright sunlight and sea breeze .
Far out beyond a sandy beach and white waves , a great cylinder with a rounded top rose high out of the water .
Orange letters on the curved metal flank read : „ JUMPSHIP FRESHWATER TRANSPORT . “
„ I could take you out in a boat , “ said Whyte .
„ But it would be a waste of time .
You would n’t see much .
Nothing but vacuum inside .
You know how it works ? “
„ Sure . “
„ Teleportation was like laser technology .
One big breakthrough and then a thousand ways to follow up on it .
We spent twelve solid years building continuous teleport pumps for various municipalities to ship fresh water in various directions .
When all the time the real problem was getting the fresh water , not moving it .
„ Do you know how we developed this gimmick ?
My secretary dreamed it up one night at an office party .
She was about half smashed , but she wrote it down , and the next morning we all took turns trying to read her handwriting .
. . . Well , never mind .
It ’s a simple idea .
You build a tank more put the teleport pump in the top .
You teleport the air out .
When the air goes , the seawater boils .
From then on you ’re teleporting cold water - vapor .
It condenses wherever you ship it , and you get fresh water .
Want to take pictures ? “
„ I do . “
„ Then let ’s look at the results , “ Whyte said , and dialed .
Now it was even brighter .
The booth was backed up against a long wooden building .
Far away was a white glare of salt flats , backed by blue ghosts of mountains .
Jerryberry blinked and squinted .
Whyte opened the door .
Jerryberry said , „ Whoooff ! “
„ Death Valley .
Hot , is n’t it ? “
„ Words fail me at a time like this , but I suggest you look up the dictionary definition of blast furnace . “
Jerryberry felt perspiration start as a rippling itch all over him .
„ I ’m going to pretend I ’m in a sauna .
Why does n’t anyone ever put displacement booths inside ? “
„ They did for a while .
There were too many burglaries .
Let ’s go around back . “
They walked around the dry wooden building … and into an oasis .
Jerryberry was jarred .
On one side of the building , the austere beauty of a barren desert .
On the other was a manicured forest : rows and rows of trees .
„ We can grow damn near anything out here .
We started with date palms , went to orange and grapefuit trees , pineapples , a lot of rice paddies , mangoes - anything that grows in tropic climates will grow here , as long as you give it enough water . “
Jerryberry had already noticed the water tower .
It looked just like the transmitter .
He said , „ And the right soil . “
„ Well , yes .
Soil is n’t that good in Death Valley .
We have to haul in too much fertilizer . “
Rivulets of perspiration ran down
Whyte ’s cheeks .
His soft face looked almost stern .
„ But the principle holds .
With teleportation , men can live practically anywhere .
We gave people room .
A man can work in Manhattan or Central Los Angeles or Central Anywhere and live in - in - “
„ Nevada . “
„ Or Hawaii !
Or the Grand Canyon !
Crowding caused riots .
We ’ve eliminated crowding - for a while , anyway .
At the rate we ’re going we ’ll still wind up shoulder to shoulder , but not until you and I are both dead . “
Jerryberry considered keeping his mouth shut but decided he did n’t have the willpower .
„ What about pollution ? “
„ What ? “
„ Death Valley used to have an ecology as unique as its climate .
What ’s your unlimited water doing to that ? “
„ Ruining it , I guess . “
„ Hawaii , you said .
Grand Canyon .
There are laws against putting up apartment buildings in national monuments , thank God.
Hawaii probably has the population density of New York by now .
Your displacement booths can put men anywhere , right ?
Even places they do n’t belong . “
„ Well , maybe they can , “ Whyte said slowly .
„ Pollution .
Hmm .
What do you know about Death Valley ? “ .
„ It ’s hot . “ Jerryberry was wet through .
„ Death Valley used to be an inland sea .
A salt sea .
Then the climate changed , and all the water went away .
What did that do to the ecology ? “
Jerryberry scratched his head .
„ A sea ? “
„ Yes , a sea !
And drying it up ruined one ecology and started another , just like we ’re doing .
But never mind that .
I want to show you some things .
Pollution , huh ? “
Whyte ’s grip on Jerryberry ’s arm was stronger than it had any right to be .
Whyte was angry .
In the booth he froze , with his brow furrowed and his forefinger extended .
Trying to remember a number .
Then he dialed in trembling haste .
He dialed two sequences .
Jerryberry saw the interior of an airline terminal , then - dark .
„ Oh , damn .
I forgot it would be night here . “
„ Where are we ? “
„ Sahara Desert .
Rudolph Hill Reclamation Project .
No , do n’t go out there ; there ’s nothing to see at night .
Do you know anything about the project ? “
„ You ’re trying to grow a forest in the middle of the Sahara : trees , leaf - eating molds , animals , the whole ecology . “
Jerryberry tried to see out through the glass .
Nothing .
„ How ’s it working ? “
„ Well enough .
If we can keep it going another thirty years , this part of the Sahara should stay a forest .
Do you think we ’re wiping out another ecology ? “
„ Well , it ’s probably worth it here . “
„ The Sahara used to be a lush , green land .
It was men who turned it into a desert , over thousands of years , mainly through overgrazing .
We ’re trying to put it back . “
„ Okay , “ said Jerryberry .
He heard Whyte dialing .
Through the glass he could now see stars and a horizon etched with treetop shadows .
He squinted against airport - terminal lights .
He asked , „ How did we get through customs ? “
„ Oh , the Hill project is officially United States territory . “
Whyte swung the local directory out from the wall and leafed through it before dialing a second time .
„ Some day you ’ll make any journey by dialing two numbers , “ he was saying .
„ Why should you have to dial your local airport first ?
Just dial a long - distance booth near your destination .
Of course the change - over will cost us considerable .
Here we are . “
Bright sunlight , sandy beach , blue sea stretching to infinity .
The booth was backed up against a seaside hotel .
Jerryberry followed
Whyte , whose careful , determined stride took him straight toward the water .
They stopped at the edge .
Tiny waves brushed just to the tips of their shoes .
„ Carpintena .
They advertise this beach as the safest beach in the world .
It ’s also the dullest , of course .
No waves .
Remember anything about Carpinteria , Barry ? “
„ I do n’t think so . “
„ Oil - slick disaster .
A tanker broke up out there , opposite Santa Barbara , which is up the coast a little .
All of these beaches were black with oil .
I was one of the volunteers working here to save the birds , to get the oil off their feathers .
They died anyway .
Almost fifty years ago , Barry . “
Part of a history lesson floated to the top of his mind .
„ I thought that happened in England . “
„ There were several oil - slick disasters .
Almost I might say , there were many .
These days we ship oil by displacement booths , and we do n’t use anything like as much oil . “
„ No cars . “
„ No oil wells , practically . “
They shifted .
From an underwater dome they gazed out at an artificial reef made from old car bodies .
The shapes seemed to blend , their outlines obscured by mud and time and swarming fish .
Bent and twisted metal bodies had long since rusted away , but their outlines remained , held by shellfish living and dead .
Ghosts of cars , the dashboards and upholstery showing through .
An occasional fiber - glass wreck showed as if it had been placed yesterday .
The reef went on and on , disappearing into gray distance .
All those cars .
„ People used to joke about the East River catching fire and burning to the ground .
It was that dirty , “ said Whyte .
„ Now look at it . “
Things floated by : wide patches of scum , with plastic and metal objects embedded in them .
Jerryberry said , „ It ’s pretty grubby . “
„ Maybe , but it ’s not an open sewer .
Teleportation made it easier to get rid of garbage . “
„ I guess my trouble is I never saw anything as dirty as you claim it was .
Oil slicks .
Lake Michigan .
The Mississippi . “
Maybe you ’re exaggerating .
„ Just what has teleportation done for garbage collection ? “
„ There are records .
Pictures . “
„ But even with your wonderful bottomless garbage cans , it must be easier just to dump it in the river . “
„ Ahh , I guess so . “
„ And you still have to put the gupp somewhere after you collect it . “
Whyte was looking at him oddly .
„ Very shrewd , Barry .
Let me show you the next step . “
* * *
Whyte kept his hand covered as he dialed .
„ Secret , “ he said .
„ JumpShift experimental laboratory .
We do n’t need a lot of room , because experiments with teleportation are n’t particularly dangerous . … “
but there was room , lots of it .
The building was a huge inflated Quonset hut .
Through the transparent panels Jerryberry could see other buildings , set wide apart on bare dirt .
The sun was 45 degrees up .
If he had known which way was north , he could have guessed longitude and latitude .
A very tall , very black woman in a lab smock greeted Whyte with glad cries .
Whyte introduced her as „ Gemini Jones , Phd . “
„ Gem , where do you handle disposal of radioactive waste ? “
„ Building Four . “
The physicist ’s hair exploded around her head like a black dandelion , adding unnecessary inches to her height .
She looked down at Jerryberry with genial curiosity .
„ Newstaper ? “
„ Do n’t ever try to fool anyone .
The eyes give you away . “
They took the booth to Building Four .
Presently they were looking down through several densities of leaded glass into a cylindrical metal chamber .
„ We get a package every twenty minutes or so , “ said Gem Jones .
„ There ’s a transmitter linked to this receiver in every major power plant in the United States .
We keep the receiver on all the time .
If a package gets reflected back , we have to find out what ’s wrong , and that can get hairy , because it ’s usually wrong at the drop - ship . “
Jerryberry said , „ Drop - ship ? “
Gemini Jones showed surprise at his ignorance .
Whyte said , „ Backup a bit , Barry .
What ’s the most dangerous garbage ever ? “
„ Give me a hint . “
„ Radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants .
Most dangerous per pound , anyway .
They send those wastes here , and we send them to a drop - ship .
You ’ve got to know what a drop - ship is . “
„ Of course I - “
„ A drop - ship is a moving teleport receiver with one end open .
Generally it ’s attached to a space probe .
The payload flicks in with a velocity different from that of the drop - ship .
Of course it ’s supposed to come tearing out the open end , which means somebody has to keep it turned right .
And of course the drop - ship only operates in vacuum . “
„ Package , “ Gem Jones said softly .
Something had appeared in the metal chamber below .
It was gone before Jerryberry could quite see what it was .
„ Just where is your drop - ship ? “
„ Circling Venus , “ said Whyte .
„ Originally it was part of the second Venus expedition .
You can send anything through a drop - ship : fuel , oxygen , food , water , even small vehicles .
There are drop - ships circling every planet in the solar system , except Neptune .
„ When the Venus expedition came home , they left the drop - ship in orbit .
We thought at first that we might send another expedition through it , but - face it , Venus just is n’t worth it .
We ’re using the planet as a garbage dump , which is about all it ’s good for .
„ Now , there ’s no theoretical reason we can’t send unlimited garbage through the Venus drop - ship , as long as we keep the drop - ship oriented right .
Many transmitters , one receiver .
The payload does n’t stay in the receiver more than a fraction of a second .
If it did get overloaded , why , some of the garbage would be reflected back to the transmitter , and we ’d send it again .
No problem . “
„ What about cost ? “
„ Stupendous .
Horrible .
Too high for any kind of garbage less dangerous than this radioactive stuff .
But maybe we can bring it down someday . “
Whyte stopped ; he looked puzzled .
„ Mind if I sit down ? “
There were fold - up chairs around a card table with empty pop bulbs on it .
Whyte sat down rather disturbingly hard , even with Gem Jones trying to support his weight .
She asked , „ Can I get Doctor Janesko ? “
„ No , Gem , just tired .
Is there a pop machine ? “
Jerryberry found the pop machine .
He paid a chocolate dollar for a clear plastic bulb of cola .
He turned and almost bumped into Gemini Jones .
She spoke low , but there was harsh intensity in her voice .
„ You ’re running him ragged .
Will you lay off of him ? “
„ He ’s been running me ! “ Jerryberry whispered .
„ I believe it .
Well , do n’t let him run you so fast .
Remember , he ’s an old man . “
Whyte pulled the cola bulb open and drank .
„ Better . “
He sighed .
. . and was back in high gear .
„ Now , you see ?
We ’re cleaning up the world .
We are n’t polluters . “
„ Right . “
„ Thank you . “
„ I never should have raised the subject .
What have you got for the mall riot ? “
Whyte looked confused .
„ The mall riot is still going on , and they ’re still blaming me . “
„ And you still blame JumpShift . “
„ It ’s a matter of access , “ Jerryberry said patiently .
„ Even if only ten men in a million , say , would loot a store , given the opportunity , that ’s still about four thousand people in the United States .
And all four thousand can get to the Santa Monica Mall in the time it takes to dial twenty - one digits . “
When Whyte spoke again , he sounded bitter .
„ What are we supposed to do , stop inventing things ? “
„ No , of course not . “ Jerryberry pulled open another bulb of cola .
„ What , then ? “
„ I do n’t know .
Just . . . keep working things out . “
He drank .
„ There ’s always another problem behind the one you just solved .
Does that mean you should stop solving problems ? “
„ Well , let ’s solve this one . “
They sat sipping cola .
It was good to sit down .
The old man ’s running me ragged , thought Jerryberry .
„ Crowds , “ he said .
„ Right . “
„ You can make one receiver for many transmitters .
In fact . . . every booth in a city receives from any other booth .
Can you make a booth that transmits only ? “
Whyte looked up .
„ Sure .
Give it an unlisted number .
Potentially it would still be a receiver , of course . “
„ Because you have to flick the air back to the transmitter . “
„ How ’s this sound ?
You can put an E on the booth number .
The only dials with E’s in them are at police stations and fire stations .
E for Emergency . “
„ All right .
Now , you put a lot of these escape booths wherever a crowd might gather - “
„ That could be anywhere .
You said so yourself . “
Yah .
„ We ’d have to double the number of booths in the country .. . or cut the number of incoming booths in half .
You ’d have to walk twice as far to get where you ’re going from any given booth .
Would it be worth it ? “
„ I do n’t think this is the last riot , “ said Jerryberry .
„ It ’s growing .
Like tourism .
Your short - hop booths cut tourism way down .
The long - distance booths are bringing it back , but slowly .
Would you believe a permanent floating riot ?
A mob that travels from crowd to crowd , carrying coin purses , looting where they can . “
„ I hate that idea . “
Jerryberry put his hand on the old man ’s shoulder .
„ Do n’t worry about it .
You ’re a hero .
You made a miracle .
What people do with it is n’t your fault .
Maybe you even saved the world .
The pollution was getting very rough before JumpShift came along . “
„ By God , it was . “
„ I ’ve got to be going .
There are things I want to see before I run out of time . “
-8-
Tahiti .
Jerusalem .
Mecca .
Easter Island .
Stonehenge .
The famous places of the world .
Places a man might dial almost on impulse .
Names that came unbidden to the mind .
Mecca .
Vast numbers of Muslims ( a number he could look up later ) bowed toward Mecca five times a day .
The Koran called for every Muslim to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime .
The city ’s only industry was the making of religious articles .
And you could get there just by dialing ….
Jerusalem .
Sacred to three major religions .
Jews still toasted each other at Passover : „ Next year in Jerusalem . “
Still a forming ground of history after thousands of years .
And you could get there just by dialing ….
Stonehenge .
An ancient mystery .
What race erected those stones , and when and why ?
These would never be known with certainty .
From the avenue at the northeast entrance a path forked and ran up a hill between burial mounds .
. . and there was a long - distance displacement booth on the hill .
It would be eleven at night in Stonehenge .
One in the morning in Mecca and Jerusalem .
No action there .
Jerryberry crossed them out .
Eiffel Tower , the pyramids , the Sphinx , the Vatican . . . dammit , the most memorable places on Earth were all in the same general area .
What could he see at midnight ?
Well - Tahiti .
Say „ tropical paradise , “ and every stranger in earshot will murmur , „ Tahiti . “
Once Hawaii had had the same reputation , but Hawaii was too close to civilization .
Hawaii had been civilized .
Tahiti , isolated in the southern hemisphere , might have escaped that fate .
Everything lurched as he finished dialing .
Jerryberry stumbled against the booth wall .
Briefly he was terrified .
But he’d be dead if the velocity transfer had failed .
It must be a little out of synch .
He knew too much , that was all .
There were six booths of different makes this side of customs .
The single official had a hopeless look .
He waved through a constant stream of passengers without seeming to see them .
Jerryberry moved with the stream .
They were mostly men .
Many had cameras ; few had luggage .
English , American , French , German , some Spanish and U.S.S.R .
Most were dressed lightly - and poorly , in cheap clothes ready to come apart .
They swarmed toward the outgoing booths , the rectangular Common Market booths with one glass side .
Jerryberry saw unease and dismay on many faces .
Perhaps it was the new , clean , modem building that bothered them .
This was an island paradise ?
Air conditioning .
Fluorescent lighting .
Jerryberry stood in line for the phone .
Then he found that it would n’t take his coin or his credit card .
On his way to the change counter he thought to examine the displacement booths .
They took only French money .
He bought a heavy double handful of coins , then got back in line for the phone .
They have to get used to traveling again .
Right on .
The computerized directory spoke English .
He used it to get a string of booth numbers in downtown Papeete .
* * *
He was a roving newstaper again .
Dial , watch the scene flick over , look around while inserting a coin and dialing .
The coin slot was in the wrong place , and the coins felt wrong - too big , too thin - and the dial was a disk with holes in it .
A little practice had him in the routine .
There was beach front lined with partly built hotels in crazily original shapes .
Of all the crowds he saw in Papeete , the thickest were on the beaches and in the water .
Later he could not remember the color of the sand ; he had n’t seen enough of it .
Downtown he found huge blocks of buildings faced in glass , some completed , some half built .
He found old slums and old mansions .
But wherever the streets ran , past mansions or slums or new skyscrapers , he found tents and leantos and board shacks hastily nailed together .
They filled the streets , leaving small clear areas around displacement booths and public rest rooms and far more basic portable toilets .
An open - air market ran for several blocks and was closed at both ends by crowds of tents .
The only way in or out was by booth .
They ’re ahead of us , thought Jerryberry .
When you ’ve got booths , who needs streets ?
He was not amused .
He was appalled .
There were beggars .
At first he was moving too fast ; he did n’t realize what they were doing .
But wherever he flicked in , one or two habitants immediately came toward his booth .
He stopped under a vertical glass cliff of a building , where the tents of the squatters ran just to the uppermost of a flight of stone steps , and waited .
Beggars .
Some were natives , men and women and children , uniform in their dark - bronze color and in their dress and their speech and the way they moved .
They were a thin minority .
Most were men and white and foreign .
They came with their hands out , mournful or smiling ; they spoke rapidly in what they guessed to be his language , and were right about half the time .
He tried several other numbers .
They were everywhere .
Tahiti was a white man ’s daydream .
Suddenly he ’d had enough .
On his list of jotted numbers was one that would take him out of the city .
Jerryberry dialed it .
Air puffed out of the booth when he opened the door .
Jerryberry opened his jaws wide to pop his ears .
The view !
He was near the peak of a granite mountain .
Other mountains marched away before him , and the valleys between were green and lush .
Greens and yellows and white clouds , the blue - gray of distant peaks , and beyond everything else , the sea .
It was a bus terminal .
An ancient Greyhound was just pulling out .
The driver stopped alongside him and shouted something amiable in French .
Jerryberry smiled and shook his head violently .
The driver shrugged and pulled away .
This could not have been the original terminal .
Before displacement booths it could have been reached only after hours of driving .
In moving the terminal up here , the touring company had saved the best for first and last .
The bus had looked full .
Business was good .
Jerryberry stood for a long time , drinking in the view .
This was the beauty that had made Tahiti famous .
It was good to know that Tahiti ’s population explosion had left something intact .
In good time he remembered that he was running on a time limit .
He walked around to the ticket window .
The young man in the booth laid a paperback book face down .
He smiled agreeably .
„ Yes ? “
„ Do you speak English ? “
„ Certainly . “
He wore a kind of uniform , but his features and color were those of a Tahitian .
His English was good , the accent not quite French .
„ Would you like to buy a tour ticket ? “
„ No , thanks .
I ’d like to talk , if you have a minute . “
„ What would you like to talk about ? “
„ Tahiti .
I ’m a newstaper . “
The man ’s smile drooped a bit .
„ And you wish to give us free publicity . “
„ Something like that . “
The smile was gone .
„ You may return to your country and tell them that Tahiti is full . “
„ I noticed that .
I have just come from Papeete . “
„ I have the honor to own a house in Papeete , a good property .
We , my family and myself , we have been forced to move out !
There was no - no paysage - “ he was too angry to talk as fast as he wanted -„ no passage from the house to anyplace .
We were surrounded by the tents of the -“ He used a word Jerryberry did not recognize .
„ We could not buy an instant motion booth for the house .
I had not the money .
We could not have moved the booth to the house because the -„ that word again - „ blocked the streets .
The police can do nothing .
Nothing . “
„ Why not ? “
„ There are too many .
We are not monsters ; we can not simply shoot them .
It would be the only way to stop them .
They come without money or clothing or a place to stay .
And they are not the worst .
You will tell them this when you return ? “
„ I ’m recording , “ said Jerryberry .
„ Tell them that the worst are those with much money , those who build hotels .
They would turn our island into an enormous hotel !
See ! “
He pointed where Jerryberry could not have seen himself , down the slope of the mountain .
„ The Playboy Club builds a new hotel below us . “
Jerryberry looked down to temporary buildings and a great steel box with helicopter rotors on it .
He filmed it on the Minox , then filmed a panoramic sweep of the mountains beyond , and finished with the scowling man in the ticket booth .
„ Squatters , “ the ticket - taker said suddenly .
„ The word I wanted .
The squatters are in my house now , l am sure of it , in my house since we moved out .
Tell them we want no more squatters . “
„ I ’ll tell them , “ said Jerryberry .
Before he left , he took one more long look about him .
Green valleys , gray - blue mountains , distant line of sea… but his eyes kept dropping to the endless stream of supplies that poured from the Playboy Club ’s Type of cargo booth .
Easter Island .
Tremendous , long - faced , solemn stone statues with topknots of red volcanic tuff .
Cartoons of the statues were even more common than pictures ( „ Shut up until those archaeologists leave , “ one statue whispers to another ) , and even pictures can only hint at their massive solemnity .
But you could get there just by dialing .
Except that the directory would n’t give him a booth number for Easter Island .
Surely there must be booth travel to Easter Island .
Must n’t there ?
But how eager would the Peruvian government be to see a million tourists on Easter Island ?
The other side of the coin .
Displacement booths made any place infinitely accessible , but only if you moved a booth in .
Jerryberry was grinning with delight as he dialed Los Angeles International .
There was a defense .
-9 -
At the police station on Purdue Avenue he could n’t get anyone to talk to him .
The patience of a newstaper was unique in a world of instant transportation .
He kept at it .
Eventually a deskman stopped long enough to tell him , „ Look , we do n’t have time .
Everybody ’s out cleaning up the mall riot . “
„ Cleaning up ?
Is it over ? “
„ Just about .
We had to move in old riot vehicles from Chicago .
I guess we ’ll have to start building them again .
But it ’s over . “
„ Good ! “
„ Too right .
I do n’t mean to say we got them all .
Some looters managed to jury - rig a cargo booth in the basement of Penney’s .
They moved their loot out that way and then got out that way themselves .
We ’re going to hate it the next time they show up .
They ’ve got guns now . “
„ A permanent floating riot ? “
„ Something like that .
Look , I do n’t have time to talk . “
And he was back on the phone .
The next man Jerryberry stopped recognized him at once .
„ You ’re the man who started it all !
Will you get out of my way ? “
Jerryberry left .
* * *
Sunset on a summer evening .
It was cocktail hour again . . . three and a half hours later .
Jerryberry felt unaccountably dizzy outside the police station .
He rested against the wall .
Too much change .
Over and over again he had changed place and time and climate .
From evening in New York to a humid seacoast to the dry furnace of Death Valley to night in the Sahara .
It was hard to remember where he was .
He had lost direction .
When he felt better , he shifted to the Cave des Roys .
For each human being there is an optimum ratio between change and stasis .
Too little change , he grows bored .
Too little stability , he panics and loses his ability to adapt .
One who marries six times in ten years will not change jobs .
One who moves often to serve his company will maintain a stable marriage .
A woman chained to one home and family may redecorate frantically or take a lover or go to many costume parties .
Displacement booths make novelty easy .
Stability comes hard .
For many the clubs were an element of stability .
Many key clubs were chains ; a man could leave his home in Wyoming and find his club again in Denver .
Members tended to resemble one another .
A man changing roles would change clubs .
Clubs were places to meet people , as buses and airports and even neighborhoods no longer were .
Some clubs were good for pickups ( „ This card gets me laid “ ) , others for heavy conversation .
At the Beach Club you could always find a paddle - tennis game .
The Cave was for quiet and stability .
A quick drink and the cool darkness of the Cave ’s bar were just what Jerryberry needed .
He looked into the lights in the wall of bottles and tried to remember a name .
When it came , he jotted it down , then finished his drink at leisure .
Harry McCord had been police chief in Los Angeles for twelve years and had been on the force for far longer .
He had retired only last year .
The computer - directory took some time to find him .
He was living in Oregon .
He was living in a small house in the middle of a pine forest .
From McCord ’s porch Jerryberry could see the dirt road that joined him to civilization .
It seemed to be fading away in weeds .
But the displacement booth was new .
They drank beer on the porch .
„ Crime is a pretty general subject , “ said Harry McCord .
„ Crime and displacement booths , “ said Jerryberry .
„ I want to know how your job was affected by the instant getaway . “
Jerryberry waited .
„ Pretty drastically , I guess .
The booths came in .
. . when ?
Nineteen ninety ?
But they came slowly .
We had a chance to get used to them .
Let ’s see ; there were people who put displacement booths in their living rooms , and when they got robbed , they blamed us “ .
McCord talked haltingly at first , then gaining speed .
He had always been something of a public figure .
He talked well .
Burglary :
The honors were even there .
If the house or apartment had an alarm , the police could be on the scene almost instantly .
If the burglar moved fast enough to get away , he certainly would n’t have time to rob his target .
There were sophisticated alarms now that would lock the displacement booth door from the inside .
Often that held the burglar up just long enough for the police to shift in .
At opposite extremes of professionalism , there were men who could get through an alarm system without setting it off - in which case there was n’t a hope in hell of catching them after they ’d left - and men who had been caught robbing apartment houses because they ’d forgotten to take corns for the booth in the lobby .
„ Then there was Lon Willis .
His MO was to prop the booth door open before he went to work on the house .
If he set the alarm off , he ’d run next door and use that booth .
Worked pretty well - it slowed us up just enough that we never did catch him .
But one night he set off an alarm , and when he ran next door , the next - door neighbor blew a small but adequate hole in him . “
Murder :
The alibi was an extinct species .
A man attending a party in Hawaii could shoot a man in Paris in the time it would take him to use the bathroom .
„ Like George Clayton Larkin did .
Except that he used his credit card , and we got him , “ said McCord , „ and we got Lucille Downey because she ran out of coins and had to ask at the magazine stand for change .
With blood all over her sleeves ! “
Pickpockets :
“ Do you have a lock pocket ? “
„ Sure , “ said Jerryberry .
It was an inside pocket lined with tough plastic .
The zipper lock took two hands to open .
„ They ’re tough to get into , but not impossible . “
„ What ’s in it ?
Credit cards ? “
„ Right . “
„ And you can cancel them in three minutes .
Picking pockets is n’t profitable any more .
If it was , they would have mobbed the mall riot . “
Smuggling : Nobody even tried to stop it .
Drugs : „ There ’s no way to keep them from getting in .
Anyone who wants drugs can get them .
We make arrests where we can , and so what ?
Me , I ’m betting on Darwin . “
„ How do you mean ? “
„ The next generation wo n’t use drugs because they ’ll be descended from people who had better sense .
I ’d legalize wireheading if it were up to me .
With a wire in your pleasure center , you ’re getting what all the drugs are supposed to give you , and no dope peddler can hold out on you . “
Riots :
The mall riot was the first successful riot in twenty years .
„ The police can get to a riot before it ’s a riot , “ said McCord .
„ We call them flash crowds , and we watch for them .
We ’ve been doing it ever since … well , ever since it became possible . “
He hesitated and evidently decided to
go on .
„ See , the coin booths usually went into the shopping centers first and then the residential areas .
It was n’t till JumpShift put them in the slum areas that we stopped having riots . “
„ Makes sense . “
McCord laughed .
„ Even that ’s a half - truth .
When the booths went into the slums , we pretty near stopped having slums .

[ Python - Dev ] Mercurial migration : progress report ( PEP 385 )
In response to some rumblings on python - committers and just to request more feedback , a progress report .
I know it 's long , I 've tried to put to keep it concise and chunked , though .
- First of all , I 've got the basic conversion down , I 've done it a few times now , with progressively better results .
You can view some results at http://hg.python.org/, which has a preliminary cpython repository .
***
The changeset hashes for that repo will change , so you wo n't be able to commit or pull from it in the future .*** -
Second of all , some planning .
I 've thought about it a bit , and I think we should aim for going live with hg on August 1 .
Given that I 'm on vacation from 8 - 18 July ( and I 'm not sure whether I 'll be able to actually work on it during that time , though I imagine I 'll be able to spend some time on it at least ) , that 's quite ambitious , so I 'm going to say it 's okay if it slips by a few days .
Putting a deadline out there is a good thing , anyway .
-
Third of all , to make this possible , it would be helpful if I got more feedback on the PEP .
Last time I raised it , there was virtually nothing .
This time , I 'll include it inline so there 's hopefully less of a barrier to reviewing it .
- Fourth , Mercurial 1.3 was just released !
Bet you did n't see that coming .
It 's looking like a pretty good release , with an experimental version of the much - coveted subrepository support ( like svn:externals ) .
This also means that the latest version of hgsubversion , the tool I used for the conversion , will be more accessible for converting other projects .
You know you want to !
- Fifth , here 's a list of things , off the top of my head , that still need doing : * Get agreement on branch strategy and branch processing ( list of branches + proposed handling at http://hg.python.org/pymigr/file/tip/all-branches.txt)
<--- PLEASE REVIEW * Get agreement on tag processing ( first come up with a list ) *
Set up hg - ssh infra ( should be easy ) *
Set up hooks ( should be mostly straightforward ) *
Set up roundup integration ( should be made easier by quick revision map hgweb extension ) * Write docs - Sixth ( this is the good part ) , less obvious things that have been done or do n't need doing : * .hgignore generation ( I 've been convinced it 's too hard , the current version will do ) * revlog reordering ( it 's painless and a big win ) I 'll get through all of these myself , but obviously any help would be welcome .
For any hg users , writing docs should be an easy start .
For others , please review the PEP ( below ) , the branch map in http://hg.python.org/pymigr/file/tip/all-branches.txt and the author map at http://hg.python.org/pymigr/file/tip/author-map
( not that much has changed since the start , so if you 've looked at it already , feel free to skip this part ) .
Right now I 'm a little stuck on branch processing , because it 's a long running script that needs a bunch of debugging , but I 'll get going on that again .
I think that 's all I can think of for now , I 'll update the PEP with new bits soon .
Here it is , ready for your review : ==============================================================
Motivation After having decided to switch to the Mercurial DVCS , the actual migration still has to be performed .
In the case of an important piece of infrastructure like the version control system for a large , distributed project like Python , this is a significant effort .
This PEP is an attempt to describe the steps that must be taken for further discussion .
It 's somewhat similar to PEP 347 [ 1 ] , which discussed the migration to SVN .
To make the most of hg , I ( Dirkjan ) would like to make a high - fidelity conversion , such that ( a ) as much of the svn metadata as possible is retained , and ( b ) all metadata is converted to formats that are common in Mercurial .
This way , tools written for Mercurial can be optimally used .
In order to do this , I want to use the hgsubversion [ 2 ] software to do an initial conversion .
This hg extension is focused on providing high - quality conversion from Subversion to Mercurial for use in two - way correspondence , meaning it does n't throw away as much available metadata as other solutions .
Such a conversion also seems like a good time to reconsider the contents of the repository and determine if some things are still valuable .
In this spirit , the following sections also propose discarding some of the older metadata .
Timeline TBD ; needs fully working hgsubversion and consensus on this document .
Transition plan Branch strategy Mercurial has two basic ways of using branches : cloned branches , where each branch is kept in a separate repository , and named branches , where each revision keeps metadata to note on which branch it belongs .
The former makes it easier to distinguish branches , at the expense of requiring more disk space on the client .
The latter makes it a little easier to switch between branches , but often has somewhat unintuitive results for people ( though this has been getting better in recent versions of Mercurial ) .
I 'm still a bit on the fence about whether Python should adopt cloned branches and named branches .
Since it usually makes more sense to tag releases on the maintenance branch , for example , mainline history would not contain release tags if we used cloned branches .
Also , Mercurial 1.2 and 1.3 have the necessary tools to make named branches less painful ( because they can be properly closed and closed heads are no longer considered in relevant cases ) .
A disadvantage might be that the used clones will be a good bit larger ( since they essentially contain all other branches as well ) .
This can me mitigated by keeping non-release ( feature ) branches in separate clones .
Also note that it 's still possible to clone a single named branch from a combined clone , by specifying the branch as in hg clone http://hg.python.org/main/#2.6-maint.
Keeping the py3 k history in a separate clone problably also makes sense .
XXX
To do : size comparison for selected separation scenarios .
Converting branches
There are quite a lot of branches in SVN 's branches directory .
I propose to clean this up a bit , by employing the following the strategy : * Keep all release ( maintenance ) branches * Discard branches that have n't been touched in 18 months , unless somone indicates there 's still interest in such a branch * Keep branches that have been touched in the last 18 months , unless someone indicates the branch can be deprecated Converting tags
The SVN tags directory contains a lot of old stuff .
Some of these are not , in fact , full tags , but contain only a smaller subset of the repository .
I think we should keep all release tags , and consider other tags for inclusion based on requests from the developer community .
I 'd like to consider unifying the release tag naming scheme to make some things more consistent , if people feel that wo n't create too many problems .
For example , Mercurial itself just uses ' 1.2.1 ' as a tag , where CPython would currently use r121 .
Author map
In order to provide user names the way they are common in hg ( in the ' First Last < user at example.org >' format ) , we need an author map to map cvs and svn user names to real names and their email addresses .
I have a complete version of such a map in my migration tools repository [ 3 ] .
The email addresses in it might be out of date ; that 's bound to happen , although it would be nice to try and have as many people as possible review it for addresses that are out of date .
The current version also still seems to contain some encoding problems .
Generating .hgignore
The .hgignore file can be used in Mercurial repositories to help ignore files that are not eligible for version control .
It does this by employing several possible forms of pattern matching .
The current Python repository already includes a rudimentary .hgignore file to help with using the hg mirrors .
It might be useful to have the .hgignore be generated automatically from svn:ignore properties .
This would make sure all historic revisions also have useful ignore information ( though one could argue ignoring is n't really relevant to just checking out an old revision ) .
Revlog reordering
As an optional optimization technique , we should consider trying a reordering pass on the revlogs ( internal Mercurial files ) resulting from the conversion .
In some cases this results in dramatic decreases in on - disk repository size .
Other repositories Richard Tew has indicated that he'd like the Stackless repository to also be converted .
What other projects in the svn .
python.org repository should be converted ?
Do we want to convert the peps repository ?
distutils ?
others ?
Infrastructure hg - ssh Developers should access the repositories through ssh , similar to the current setup .
Public keys can be used to grant people access to a shared hg@ account .
A hgwebdir instance should also be set up for easy browsing and read - only access .
If we 're using ssh , developers should trivially be able to start new clones ( for longer - term features that profit from a separate branch ) .
Hooks A number of hooks is currently in use .
The hg equivalents for these should be developed and deployed .
The following hooks are being used : * check whitespace : a hook to reject commits in case the whitespace does n't match the rules for the Python codebase .
Should be straightforward to re-implement from the current version .
We can also offer a whitespace hook for use with client - side repositories that people can use ; it could either warn about whitespace issues and / or truncate trailing whitespace from changed lines .
Open issue : do we check only the tip after each push , or do we check every commit in a changegroup ?
* commit mails : we can leverage the notify extension for this * buildbots : both the regular and the community build masters must be notified .
Fortunately buildbot includes support for hg .
I 've also implemented this for Mercurial itself , so I do n't expect problems here .
* check contributors : in the current setup , all changesets bear the username of committers , who must have signed the contributor agreement .
In a DVCS , the committers are not necessarily the same people who push , and so we can't check if the committer is a contributor .
We could use a hook to check if the committer is a contributor if we keep a list of registered contributors .
hgwebdir A more or less stock hgwebdir installation should be set up .
We might want to come up with a style to match the Python website .
It may also be useful to build a quick extension to augment the URL rev parser so that it can also take r[ 0 - 9 ] + args and come up with the matching hg revision .
After migration
Where to get code
It needs to be decided where the hg repositories will live .
I 'd like to propose to keep the hgwebdir instance at hg.python.org .
This is an accepted standard for many organizations , and an easy parallel to svn. python.org .
The 2.7 ( trunk ) repo might live at http://hg.python.org/main/, for example , with py3 k at http://hg.python.org/py3k/.
For write access , developers will have to use ssh , which could be ssh://hg@hg.python.org /main/.
A demo installation will be set up with a preliminary conversion so people can experiment and review ; it can live at http://hg.python.org/example/.
code.
python.org was also proposed as the hostname .
Personally , I think that using the VCS name in the hostname is good because it prevents confusion : it should be clear that you can't use svn or bzr for hg.
python.org .
hgwebdir can already provide tarballs for every changeset .
I think this obviates the need for daily snapshots ; we can just point users to tip.tar.gz instead , meaning they will get the latest .
If desired , we could even use buildbot results to point to the last good changeset .
Python - specific documentation hg comes with good built - in documentation ( available through hg help ) and a wiki [ 4 ] that 's full of useful information and recipes .
In addition to that , the parts of the developer FAQ [ 5 ] concerning version control will gain a section on using hg for Python development .
Some of the text will be dependent on the outcome of debate about this PEP ( for example , the branching strategy ) .
Think first , commit later ?
In recent history , old versions of Python have been maintained by a select group of people backporting patches from trunk to release branches .
While this may not scale so well as the development pace grows , it also runs into some problems with the current crop of distributed versioning tools .
These tools ( I believe similar problems would exist for either git , bzr , or hg , though some may cope better than others ) are based on the idea of a Directed Acyclic Graph ( or DAG ) , meaning they keep track of relations of changesets .
Mercurial itself has a stable branch which is a ' ' strict ' ' subset of the unstable branch .
This means that generally all fixes for the stable branch get committed against the tip of the stable branch , then they get merged into the unstable branch ( which already contains the parent of the new cset ) .
This provides a largely frictionless environment for moving changes from stable to unstable branches .
Mistakes , where a change that should go on stable goes on unstable first , do happen , but they 're usually easy to fix .
That can be done by copying the change over to the stable branch , then trivial - merging with unstable -- meaning the merge in fact ignores the parent from the stable branch ) .
This strategy means a little more work for regular committers , because they have to think about whether their change should go on stable or unstable ; they may even have to ask someone else ( the RM ) before committing .
But it also relieves a dedicated group of committers of regular backporting duty , in addition to making it easier to work with the tool .
Now would be a good time to consider changing strategies in this regard , although it would be relatively easy to switch to such a model later on .
The future of Subversion What happens to the Subversion repositories after the migration ?
Since the svn server contains a bunch of repositories , not just the CPython one , it will probably live on for a bit as not every project may want to migrate or it takes longer for other projects to migrate .
To prevent people from staying behind , we may want to remove migrated projects from the repository .
Build identification Python currently provides the sys.subversion tuple to allow Python code to find out exactly what version of Python it 's running against .
The current version looks something like this : * ( ' CPython ' , ' tags /r262 ' , ' 71600 ' ) * ( ' CPython ' , ' trunk ' , ' 73128 M ' )
Another value is returned from Py_GetBuildInfo( ) in the C API , and available to Python code as part of sys.version : * 'r262:71600 , Jun 2 2009 , 09:58:33 ' * ' trunk :73128 M , Jun 2 2009 , 01:24:14 '
I propose that the revision identifier will be the short version of hg's revision hash , for example ' dd3ebf81af43 ' , augmented with '+' ( instead of ' M ' ) if the working directory from which it was built was modified .
This mirrors the output of the hg id command , which is intended for this kind of usage .
For the tag / branch identifier , I propose that hg will check for tags on the currently checked out revision , use the tag if there is one ( ' tip ' does n't count ) , and uses the branch name otherwise .
sys.subversion becomes * ( ' CPython ' , ' 2.6.2 ' , ' dd3ebf81af43 ' ) * ( ' CPython ' , ' default ' , ' af694c6a888 c + ' ) and the build info string becomes * ' 2.6.2:dd3ebf81af43 , Jun 2 2009 , 09:58:33 ' * ' default:af694c6a888 c+ , Jun 2 2009 , 01:24:14 '
This reflects that the default branch in hg is called ' default ' instead of Subversion 's ' trunk ' , and reflects the proposed new tag format .

Cheers , Dirkjan
Pick your own fruit .
Looking for jobs can be… well boring .
So , though I do not promote mindless procrastination in place of finding a job , sometimes you just need a break .
I ’ve decided to compile a list ( over time ) of fun things to do to fill your time .
I found yet another bootleg but helpful website that you should check out .
This site shows you were you can find a “ pick - your - own ” farm near you .
The site also has info on how to can and freeze fruit , make jams , picking tips , and harvest dates .
Jackpot .
I just went to a farm and picked blackberries and peaches for my birthday .
Going there was seriously like taking a mini vacation since the drive to the farm was absolutely beautiful and plus it was convenient 45 minutes away .
At the farm near me you only pay for what you pick and you can eat the fruit right from the bush / tree !
Take a break , pick some fruit , make a pie , and call it a day .
* Pie suggestions below !*
MUST USE PIE RECIPE :
Blueberry Pie with Cornmeal Crust and Lemon Cream
A friend and I found this at Bon Appetit and we just made it for a dinner party .
It was picture perfect and it was the best pie I ’ve had in a while ( the lemon cream is amazing ! ) and the entire party agreed .
I think the blueberries could be replaced with any other fruit depending on the season .
So go on , go crazy .
A couple of weeks ago , Apple introduced Snow Leopard , an OS release that left many users cold , but got developers very warm .
Snow Leopard has a few new under - the - hood changes that are designed to make the life of a programmer that much easier in the heterogeneous , multi- core society that we now live in .
To begin with there is OpenCL .
OpenCL is a technology for computing with heterogenous hardware such as GPUs and CPUs .
It is being covered on MacResearch in David Gohara ’s excellent series of screencasts .
The other big technology is Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) , and that ’s what I want to look at in this tutorial .
Grand Central is a new approach to parallelism .
It does away with the old threaded models , and replaces it with a packet - based approach .
In this tutorial , we ’ll take a look at how it works , contrast it to other approaches to concurrency , and get our hands dirty in some GCD code .
Multi-Threading
Traditionally , concurrency on shared memory computers like today ’s multicore systems was achieved via multithreading .
A developer could create extra threads of execution , which would share the same memory space , but could be run on separate logical CPUs ( eg cores ) .
If the developer split the work up between these different threads , a genuine performance boost could be achieved .
But there are some serious drawbacks to multithreading in this way .
First , because threads are spawned in the application space , there is generally no way of knowing how many threads should be created for optimal performance .
An application does not know the state of the system or other processes running on the system , so has no way of knowing what the optimal number of threads should be .
A second problem with multithreading is that threads are expensive to start and stop , and swap in and out .
An application may start and stop many threads while it is running , and the operating system has to swap these threads so that processes can share the available CPUs .
This wastes time .
It would be better if the OS could regulate the number of threads to avoid excessive swapping and spawning .
Lastly , threading is particularly susceptible to so - called race conditions .
Because threads tend to share data , it is very easy for one thread to corrupt the data of another , or for a particular sequence of events to lead to an unexpected results .
In short , the outcome is determined by a race between threads , and avoiding race conditions is not as easy as it may seem .
Packet - Based Concurrency
Since Intel hit the MHz wall and turned to multi-core for salvation , software engineers have been looking for ways of utilizing those extra cores without over - complicating their code .
Multithreading frankly scares the wits out of most software developers , so another approach was needed .
Apple too went looking for solutions , and found inspiration in an unexpected area : telephony .
Originally , in order to call someone , you needed a direct line running from your telephone to the telephone of the person you were calling .
This involved making contact with an operator , who would physically plug in a jack so that you could make the call , just like in those old movies .
Telephony hit its
MHz wall many years ago : directly connecting telephones simply does not scale well .
The solution they found was to split conversations into small packets of data .
The advantage of doing this was that the packets could all travel down a single wire , and be reassembled at the end into the sound you hear .
Packets could even travel different routes to get to the final destination .
It was no longer necessary to have a dedicated line between caller and callee .
The approach of Grand Central is analogous to the revolution in telephony .
Developers no longer have their dedicated threads , nor do they spawn or destroy threads .
All of that has been moved down into the operating system .
Instead , the developer delivers packets of computation , which can then be scheduled to execute by the operating system .
Threads are still used — just like wires are still used in telephony — but they are used in a different way : they do n’t perform a single dedicated task in a single application , but instead run packets of work from many different sources in the application .
Another useful analogy is the one right in front of your nose , the name ‘ Grand Central ’ itself .
The name is very apt , and the railway is a good way to explain how GCD works .
Imagine the tracks are threads , and the trains are packets of work to be executed .
The operating system puts in place the railway network , with its tracks and signals .
The developer supplies the trains , and the OS ensures they get to where they are going .
Before GCD , you had to build the whole railway network yourself !
Threading Example
We ’ll get to GCD itself in a minute , but first let ’s consider how a traditional multithreading technology like OpenMP — which is quite widely used in science — would be used .
We ’ll morph this threaded example to use GCD and see where the similarities and differences lie .
OpenMP is an approach to multithreading that uses compiler directives to parallelize serial code , usually at the level of loops .
Here is some C code that takes some image data , and applies a primitive blurring algorithm to it .
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < math.h > # define MAX ( a , b ) ( ( a ) > ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) # define MIN ( a , b ) ( ( a ) < ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) int main ( int argc , const char * argv [ ] ) { const int N = 1000 ; const int BLURRADIUS = 7 ; float original Image [ N*N ] , blurred Image [ N*N ] ; int row , col , i , j ; # pragma omp parallel for private ( col , i , j ) for ( row = 0 ; row < N ; ++row ) { for ( col = 0 ; col < N ; ++col ) { int pixIndex = row * N + col ; blurredImage[ pixIndex ] = 0.0f ; for ( i = MAX ( 0 , row - BLURRADIUS ) ; i < MIN ( row+BLURRADIUS , N ) ; ++i ) { for ( j = MAX ( 0 , col - BLURRADIUS ) ; j < MIN ( col+BLURRADIUS , N ) ; ++j ) { int blurPixIndex = i * N + j ; float distance = ( i - row ) * ( i - row ) + ( j - col ) * ( j - col ) ; distance = sqrt( distance ) ; blurredImage [ pixIndex ] += exp ( - distance * distance ) * originalImage [ blurPixIndex ] ; } } } } return 0 ; }
It is interesting to note , aside from the fact that this code wo n’t win any awards , that it only takes a single directive , in the form of a C pragma , to parallelize this algorithm , and get close to linear speedup .
# pragma omp parallel for private ( col , i , j ) for ( row = 0 ; row < N ; ++row ) {
This OpenMP directive tells the compiler that the for loop that follows can be executed concurrently ; that the iterations of the loop are fully independent of one another .
What the compiler will do is inject code just before the loop to spawn threads , and code after the loop to clean them up again .
It will then distribute the iterations of the loop as evenly as possible across the spawned threads .
The code generated would be conceptually like this
// Spawn threads here int rowsPerThread = N / numThreads ; int row ; for ( row = threadId * rowsPerThread ; row < ( threadId +1 ) * rowsPerThread ; ++row ) { InnerLoop( parentStack ) ; } //
Tear down threads here
The content of the main loop is moved to a function , which has been called InnerLoop here .
Any variables that are shared between threads are passed to the function in the parentStack argument .
Variables that should be kept private to each thread , such as the variables col , i , and j from the original code , are made stack variables inside the function .
void InnerLoop ( void * parentStack ) { int col , i , j ;
All of this occurs during code compilation .
You could write the exact same code using the pthreads library , but with OpenMP , it is easier , with the compiler handling the gritty details .
Grand Central Dispatch
So how much does GCD differ from the approach used in OpenMP ?
Actually , surprisingly little .
In both cases the spawning and tearing down of threads is hidden from the programmer .
Each technology is based on a language extension , with OpenMP using preprocessor directives , and GCD adopting blocks ( sometimes called ‘ closures ’ ) .
From a technological point of view , what GCD is doing is very similar to OpenMP .
The differences lie in the flexibility of GCD ’s block - based approach , and in the fact that threads are managed at the system level , rather than by the application developer .
The similarities between GCD and OpenMP are also evident when you look at the source code .
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < math.h > # include < dispatch / dispatch.h > # define MAX ( a , b ) ( ( a ) > ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) # define MIN ( a , b ) ( ( a ) < ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) int main ( int argc , const char * argv [ ] ) { const int N = 1000 ; const int BLURRADIUS = 7 ; float original Image [ N*N ] , blurred Image [ N*N ] ; dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT , 0 ) ; dispatch_apply ( N , queue , ^( size_t row ) { int col , i , j ; for ( col = 0 ; col < N ; ++col ) { int pixIndex = row * N + col ; blurredImage[ pixIndex ] = 0.0f ; for ( i = MAX ( 0 , row - BLURRADIUS ) ; i < MIN ( row+BLURRADIUS , N ) ; ++i ) { for ( j = MAX ( 0 , col - BLURRADIUS ) ; j < MIN ( col+BLURRADIUS , N ) ; ++j ) { int blurPixIndex = i * N + j ; float distance = ( i - row ) * ( i - row ) + ( j - col ) * ( j - col ) ; distance = sqrt( distance ) ; blurredImage [ pixIndex ] += exp ( - distance * distance ) * originalImage [ blurPixIndex ] ; } } } } ) ; return 0 ; }
GCD replaces the for loop with a function call : dispatch_apply .
This function basically performs the same task as the #omp directive in the previous example : it dispatches the iterations of the loop to different threads for execution .
The first argument to dispatch_apply is just the number of iterations in the loop .
The second is a dispatch queue , in this case the default queue .
Dispatch queues are used to submit work to GCD .
You can create your own queues , or just use the default as in this example .
The third argument to dispatch_apply probably looks very strange if you have never seen a C block .
A block is basically an anonymous function .
It has a return value ( optional ) , and an argument list .
It has no name , but a caret ( ^ ) is used where a function name would be expected .
What makes a block special , and different from a function , is that it can access variables in its enclosing ( parent ) scope .
In that sense , it is similar to the InnerLoop function from the OpenMP example , which , if you recall , was passed an argument containing stack variables .
With a block , you can achieve the same thing , but without having to explicitly pass stack variables via the argument list , or even write a separate function .
The dispatch_apply function will dispatch one block instance to the queue for each iteration of the loop .
The system will then execute the blocks from the queue across the available threads .
When all blocks have run , dispatch_apply will return .
It should be noted that GCD has many functions , and that dispatch_apply is but one .
A more general function , that allows you to submit a single block for asynchronous execution is dispatch_async .
If you only learn one GCD method , make it dispatch_async .
Performance
So how fast is it ?
I have n’t performed any extensive comparisons , but here are some timings for this example using the Debug compile options .
Technology Number of Processors Time ( s ) OpenMP 1 11.363 OpenMP 2 6.199 Grand Central – 5.561
The scaling of this example is quite good , at least going from one to two cores on my MacBook Pro. With OpenMP , you can set the number of threads used , because threading is handled by the developer .
With GCD , you do n’t tell it how many threads you want ; it dynamically adjusts depending on system load and other variables .
Also , GCD will generally limit the number of threads to avoid swapping , which is wasteful .
It is interesting that GCD is slightly faster in this case than OpenMP with 2 threads .
GCD is very lightweight .
In any case , it is encouraging to see the new technology working well in practice as well as theory .
For a more thorough benchmarking tool , take a look at Apple ’s Dispatch_Compared code sample .
Update
Changed some terminology which implied that the thread pool was system wide .
The pool is controlled by the system , but is actually still an application local pool .
Also added the link to the dispatch benchmark tool .

Although Tamiflu has shown to not work against some strains of influenza , it has shown to be effective against the current H1N1 strand .
It is mostly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of Influenzavirus - A and Influenzavirus - B. Like Zanamivir , Tamiflu is a neuraminidase inhibitor .
It acts as a transition - state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase , preventing progeny virions from detaching from infected cells .
First and foremost , always consult with your doctor before taking Tamiflu
Do Not Take Tamiflu If The Following Is True :
if you are allergic to any ingredient in Tamiflu
if you are going to have an intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine within the next 2 days or you have had such a vaccine within the past 2 weeks
Before You Take Tamiflu Consider The Following :
if you are pregnant , planning to become pregnant , or are breast - feeding
if you are taking any prescription or nonprescription medicine , herbal preparation , or dietary supplement
if you have allergies to medicines , foods , or other substances
if you have kidney problems , liver problems , or mood or mental problems
Intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine because its effectiveness may be decreased by Tamiflu
Tamiflu also comes with a plethora of severe side effects that if happen to you , consult your doctor right away ... I mean double time !
severe allergic reactions like rashes , itches and hives
tightness in the chest
swelling of the face , mouth lips etc
hallucinations both audible and visual
abnormal behavior
mood or mental changes
reddened , peeling or blistered skin
seizures
!
There are certain health issues that Tamiflu can cause to flare up and react in a very bad way , it is also wise to go over the medications you 're currently on to make sure there is no adverse problems there .
Tamiflu is n't the worlds most tested chemical in humans and we 're still going to learn about new problems with the drug in the future .
Possible Tamiflu Side Effects : Keep in mind that there are most likely going to be more unknown side effects with Tamiflu .
Knowing the ingredients of the product you can see that the pill is a chemical concoction .
Again I strongly urge you to consult with your doctor before ingesting the pill .
Tamiflu is known to have the usual " fun " side effect such as extreme nausea , diarrhea , violent vomiting and general upset stomach pleasentries .
Some of those side effects are ; If you think you may have overdosed on Tamiflu then get on the phone and call 1-800- 222-1222 ( the American Association of Poison Control Centers ) , your local poison control center , or emergency room immediately !
May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart make Dawkins and Hitchens burn in Hell , O Lord my Rock and my Redeemer .
Amen .
Much of what we say about God these days is facile .
The concept of God is meant to be hard .
Too often we get lost in what Greeks called logos ( reason ) rather than interpreting him through mythoi - those things we know to be eternally true but can't prove .
Like Santa Claus .
Religion is not about belief or faith ; it is a skill .
Self - deceit does not always come easily , so we have to work at it .
Our ancestors , who were obviously right , would have been surprised by the crude empiricism that reduces faith to fundamentalism or atheism .
I have no intention of rubbishing anyone 's beliefs , so help me God , but Dawkins 's critique of God is unbelievably shallow .
God is transcendent , clever clogs .
So we obviously can't understand him .
Duh !
I 'm going to spend the next 250 pages on a quick trawl of comparative religion from the pre-modern to the present day .
It wo n't help make the case for God , but it will make me look clever and keep the publishers happy , so let 's hope no one notices !
The desire to explain the unknowable has always been with us and the most cursory glance at the cave paintings at Lascaux makes it clear these early Frenchies did n't intend us to take their drawings literally .
Their representations of God are symbolic ; their religion a therapy , a sublimation of the self .
Something that fat bastard Hitchens should think about .
Much the same is true of the Bible .
Astonishingly , the Eden story is not a historical account , nor is everything else in the Bible true .
The Deuteronomists were quick to shift the goalposts of the meaning of the Divine when problems of interpretation and meaning were revealed .
So should we be .
Rationalism is not antagonistic to religion .
Baby Jesus did n't want us to believe in his divinity .
That is a misrepresentation of the Greek pistis .
He wanted everyone to give God their best shot and have a singalong Kumbaya .
We 'll pass over Augustine and Original Sin , because that was a bit of a Christian own goal , and move on to Thomas Aquinas , in whom we can see that God 's best hope is apophatic silence .
We ca n't say God either exists or does n't exist , because he transcends existence .
This not knowing is proof of his existence .
QED .
A leap of faith is in fact a leap of rationality .
Obviously .
Skipping through the Kabbalah , introduced by the Madonna of Lourdes and Mercy ( 1459 - ) , through Erasmus and Copernicus , we come to the Age of Reason .
It was unfortunate that the church rejected Galileo , but that was more of a post - Tridentine Catholic spat than a serious error and it did n't help that a dim French theologian , Mersenne , conflated the complexities of science with intelligent design , but we 'll skip over that .
Things came right with Darwin .
Many assume he was an atheist ; in reality he was an agnostic who , despite being a lot cleverer than Dawkins , could not refute the possibility of a God .
Therefore God must exist , or we drift into the terrible nihilism of Sartre where we realise everything is pointless .
Especially this book .
The modern drift to atheism has been balanced by an equally lamentable rise in fundamentalism .
Both beliefs are compromised and misconceived .
The only logical position is apophatic relativism , as stated in the Jeff Beck ( 1887 - ) lyric , " You 're everywhere and nowhere , Baby .
That 's where you 're at . "
I have n't had time to deal with the tricky issues of the after - life that some who believe in God seem to think are fairly important .
But silence is often the best policy - geddit , Hitchens ?
And the lesson of my historical overview is that the only tenable religious belief is one where you have the humility to constantly change your mind in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
God is the desire beyond this desire , who exists because I say so , and the negation of whose existence confirms his transcendence .
Or something like that .
And if you believe this , you 'll believe anything .
The digested read , digested :
The case dismissed .

General Motors has cast doubt over the long - term future of the Chevrolet Volt by claiming it may not be commercially viable and other rivals may overtake it with superior and more advanced technology .
GM submitted a regulatory filing report to the US Treasury yesterday and CEO Fritz Henderson claimed its “ disclosures are consistent with our commitment to remain transparent and to keep the public informed of our progress ” .
See the Chevrolet Volt picture gallery
The Volt is scheduled for a November 2010 launch , but the GM report claimed that the range - extender hybrid technology may not be fully developed in time to meet this target date .
Pre-production Volt models began testing in June .
GM has marketed the Volt as the model to turn the company around , but the report claimed it “ has not yet proven to be commercially viable ” .
GM is likely to sell each Volt at a large loss , although it would hope to recoup the development costs in future - generation models as Toyota has done with its Prius .
GM , which is majority - owned by the US Treasury , has based its entire business plan around securing US Department for Energy loans to help it develop advanced fuel technology vehicles .
So far , despite three applications for a $ 5.7 billion ( £ 3.4 bn ) share of the $ 25 bn ( £ 15 bn ) fund , GM has not been accepted and is due to make a fourth application this month .
“ There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any remaining loans or receive any such loans even if we qualify , ” said the GM report .
It added that the US Treasury “ is able to exercise significant influence and control over our business if it elects to do so ” , but so far this has not been the case .
GM is also fearful that wealthier competitors will come up with similar technology to the Volt and it will be left behind .
“ Our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies , in some cases with more money available , ” said GM .
“ There can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do . ”
GM ’s monthly sales have been declining since October 2007 and it will release its first financial results since exiting Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of September .
It plans to start offering shares to the public from 10 July 2010 , the one - year anniversary of its exit from bankruptcy protection .

効果がない育毛シャンプー
せっかく育毛シャンプーを購入しても全く効果がないように感じる、こういった場合は、本当に効果が出ていないのでしょうか。
まずそんなことはありません。
効果が出ていないように感じるだけです。
目に見えて効果を感じるようになるまで育毛シャンプーは最低でも数ヵ月かかります。
生えてくれという気持ちが強いだけに、変わっていないことにいらだちを覚えるかもしれませんが、ポイントは忍耐力です。
諦めずに使い続けることが何よりも大切です。
実際に、半年以上使って全く変わりがないのであれば、考えることができるのが、自分に合っているかという点です。
これは、購入前にしておきたいチェックですが、自分の頭皮の状態を少なからず理解しておく必要があります。
カゼ薬と一言で言いますが、鼻水に効くもの、のどに効くもの、頭痛に効くもの、様々な種類がありまよね。
育毛シャンプーも同じです。
まず自分の頭皮の状況を理解しなければなりません。
脂症でしょうか、赤くなっていますか、フケが出ますが、こういった点を理解してからピンポイントでその症状を治す面で特化したものを利用すれば、当然、より一層の効果を期待できます。
今使っているものが効果がないなら、相性が悪いのかもしれません。
もう一度自分の頭皮を見つめてみましょう。
Well you see Flash , you and I have been together over a decade now .
We ’ve had good times and bad times , we ’ve tried just about everything together .
Not many people know you like I do .
We ’ve gone from as1 to as2 and now to AS3 .
We started out making interactive content and websites way back when , but I grew restless and bored , always looking for the next big challenge and pushing the envelope and my skills .
Several years ago we decided to focus our relationship on one purpose , to make games together .
We implemented collision detection , physics together and even brought back blitting .
Things were going really good for a while .
3D even started to become possible and then you upgraded yourself to CS4 , I was giddy with excitement with your new changes .
A new animation system , a z axis , pixel bender … I though I had it all , and then one night … I met Unity .
I had seen Unity around before , but was a little intimated to talk at first .
You see , I ’d spent my whole life in 2D and on occasion I could fake 3D pretty well too , but this was a whole new ball game .
When you and I built a game , we did it one hack at a time .
You know Flash , you can do just about anything for me , if I ’m patient , persistent and just do n’t take no for an answer .
With Unity it ’s a completely different experience .
When I want to try something with Unity , I do n’t need to hack it , Unity has APIs and tools that know what I want and how to get the job done .
I just think about the kind of game I want to build and things just seem to flow and fall into place .
If I have a hunch on how to do something in Unity , more often then not my intuition is correct .
Need collision detection , no problem , want physics , just ask for it .
I ’m so used to fighting for every inch of ground when I build games with you Flash and because we have been together so long , I know how to bend you , I know how when you ’ll break .
We always win the war , but I takes a lot out of us .
With I ’m with Unity , I just do n’t have to fight to get things done all the time .
Flash , I still remember when you and I first fell in love , and I still have strong feelings for you , but I feel alive again when I ’m with Unity … like the good old days with you .
I ’m not giving up on you Flash .
I am not saying goodbye , but I need to be honest with you , I think I ’m falling in love again , but with someone else .
I hope you ’ll understand and I hope we can stay friends .
Kohana is a PHP 5 framework that uses the Model View Controller ( MVC ) architectural pattern .
There are several reasons why you should choose Kohana but the main ones are security , weightlessness and simplicity .
In this tutorial , I 'll introduce its main features , and , with a simple demonstration , I 'll show you how much time Kohana can potentially save you .
Step 1 : What is Kohana ?
Kohana is a PHP5 framework that uses the Model View Controller architectural pattern .
MVC keeps application logic
separate from the presentation .
This allows us to create cleaner code and save time for bug searching .
In unfamiliar with this pattern :
A Model represents data on which the application operates .
Usually a database .
represents data on which the application operates .
Usually a database .
A View contains presentation code such as HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
contains presentation code such as HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
A Controller interprets input from the user and sends to the model and / or view .
Kohana was originally a fork of CodeIgniter ( CI ) , which is an open - source product from EllisLab .
There are many similarities between CI and Kohana , but all of the code is either new or completely rewritten .
As you can read on the official Kohana web site , the main features are :
Highly secure
Extremely lightweight
Short learning curve
Uses the MVC pattern
100 % UTF - 8 compatible
Loosely coupled architecture
Extremely easy to extend
Step 2 : Downloading Kohana
Let 's get started .
Visit Kohana 's official web site http://kohanaphp.com and click on the green box in the right corner to download the latest version .
All Kohana libraries , helpers , and views are included in the default download package , but you may select extra modules , vendor tools , and languages if you want .
For the purpose of this tutorial , the default package can be enough .
Click on " Download Kohana ! " to begin the download .
Step 3 : Installing Kohana
Once you 've finished downloading it :
Unzip Rename the " Kohana_vx .x.x " folder to " kohana " and upload it to your web server document root Edit the global configuration file application / config / config.php as follows
If you are using a unix - like system , the installation 's subdirs may have lost their permissions during zip extraction .
Chmod them all to 755 by running find .
- type d -exec chmod 755 {} \ ; from the root of your Kohana installation .
Make sure the application / logs and application / cache directories are writeable .
Chmod to 666 .
Now , point your browser to http://localhost/kohana/.
Automatically , the framework will call the install .
php script and check for your server requirements .
Kohana will run in nearly any environment with minimal configuration .
There are a few minimum server requirements :
Server with Unicode support
PHP version >= 5.2.3
An HTTP server .
I suggest you use XAMPP .
XAMPP is an easy all - in - one tool to install MySQL , PHP and Perl .
Database ( MsSQL , MySQL , MySQLi , PostgreSQL , PDOSqlite )
There are also some required extensions .
PCRE
iconv
mcrypt
SPL
If your installation completes successfully , you will be redirected to this test page :
If any of the tests fail , you must correct them before moving forward .
If all tests have passed , go to the Kohana directory and remove or rename the install .
php script .
Refresh , and you will see a welcome page like this :
Step 4 : Configuring Kohana
Kohana is ready to go .
No other configuration is needed .
This framework is amazing .
Is n't it ?
Let 's review some code .
Follow me .
Step 5 : Your first Kohana Project
Canonical programming tutorials start with the " Hello world " example .
I think , instead , that a simple application can give you a clear idea how the framework works .
So , we will build a CD collection manager -- just for a fun demonstration .
Before we start coding , a brief introduction to Kohana file system is required .
Our application will be placed in the application folder .
In this folder there are several sub folders but we need the following for our project :
config folder hosts all the configuration files coded as simple static arrays .
folder hosts all the configuration files coded as simple static arrays .
controllers folder hosts our custom controllers class
folder hosts our custom controllers class models folder hosts our custom models class
folder hosts our custom models class views folder hosts our custom files written in HTML ( or any markup language or script needed to display data and interface controls to the user )
The remaining sub folders are not required for this tutorial , so I invite you to learn more on the Kohana web site .
The system folder host the Kohana core and the Kohana tools like libraries , helpers and predefined configuration files .
In this project we will use some libraries and some helpers - good tools to speed up your work .
The assets folder is not a predefined Kohana folder .
I have created it for media files like CSS , JS , and images .
I 'll show you how to include these files in the project .
The modules folder is the place to put reusable collections of related files that together add a particular functionality to an application .
The authentication module , provided by the Kohana team , is an example of module .
This is a very brief introduction to the Kohana file system , but it 's enough for the purposes of this tutorial .
I do n't want to bore you more with theory .
Step 6 : Project Database
I have chosen MySQL as my DBMS , but remember that Kohana also supports MsSQL , MySQLi , PostgreSQL , PDOSqlite .
Create a database called " cd_collection " or choose the name you prefer , and run the following SQL through phpMyAdmin or any tool to handle the administration of MySQL .
As you can see , the SQL creates two tables , albums and genres , and populates them with some data .
The last SQL statement adds a constraint for the foreign key " genre_id " .
The database structure is very simple and does n't need much explanation .
Now , you have to tell Kohana where your database is located and how to access it .
Edit the global configuration file system / config/database.php as follows
This code tells Kohana to connect to a MySQL database called " cd_collection " on localhost with the username " root " and the password " root " .
You have to change these settings according to your database server configuration .
Step 7 : Create the Controller
Let 's now create our first controller .
Remember these conventions .
controller filename must be lowercase , e.g. album.
php
controller class must map to filename and capitalized , and must be appended with _ Controller , e.g. Album_Controller
must have the Controller class as ( grand ) parent
Also , remember how Kohana structures its URLs and how you can call a controller method ; e.g http://hostname/kohana_directory/index.php/controller/function .
Let 's take a look at this simple controller .
PHP5 OOP is a prerequisite .
So if you are n't well - versed , you can learn more here .
The constructor function , called __construct , initializes the class and calls the parent constructor .
The index function is the default function , so it will be called if we call the controller without
specifying any function ( e.g . http://localhost/index.php/kohana/album .
After the name controller
there is n't any function , the default index function will be called . )
Given these basic rules , let 's focus on our application .
The album controller implements all the actions for
the albums collection management .
This controller allows us to create a new album , to show the albums stored in our database ,
to update an album , and to delete an album .
So , let 's change the class as follows .
Create a file called album . php in application / controllers / and paste the following .
Let me explain what this code does .
Five members variables are declared at the top of the class :
These members are private because I want to limit visibility only to this class .
In the construct method the model and view objects are created using the five members :
To create a model object use this syntax :
To create a view object , use this syntax :
Now there are two objects to access the album and genre model , and three objects to access the views needed to render the presentation .
The index method call the show_albums_list method that lists all albums stored in the database .
In this method you can see how the model and view object are used to access relative methods .
" get_list " is a model method ( we will see it later ) that returns all the albums stored in the database .
The result is saved in the " $ album_list " array .
To pass the result array from the controller to the view , the " set " method is called on the view object .
This method requires two parameters : a new empty variable ( album_list ) to contain data of an existing variable ( $ album_list ) .
Now the new variable " album_list " contains the $ album_list array ( we will see later how to show the content in the view ) .
The method " render " , with the TRUE parameter , is necessary to output data to the browser .
The show_create_editor method shows the user interface to insert a new album .
The list of the genres is passed to the view .
The show_update_editor method shows the user interface to update an existing album .
" read " is a model method ( we will see it later ) that returns data ( $ album_data ) of the album with an id equal to $ id .
Then , every single element of the returned data album is passed to the view .
The create method receives data , for a new album , from the view and data are stored in the database .
$ album_data is an array that contains the POST data from the view .
To save the album , the array is passed to the create model method .
The last line is a call to a helper method .
Helpers are simply functions that assist you with development .
The helper classes are automatically loaded by the framework .
Helpers are declared as static methods of a class , so there is no need to instantiate the class .
In this case the method " redirect " of the helper " url " is called and tells Kohana to redirect the browser to the album controller .
This avoids a new insert ( for example pressing F5 ) .
" Helpers are simply functions that assist you with development . "
The update and delete methods work in the same manner as the create method above .
The last method get_genres_list gets the genres list from the model ( $ db_genres_list ) and builds a new array ( $ genres_list ) for the select box in the views .
Step 8 : Create Project Model
Let 's now create models for our web application .
Remember these conventions .
model filename must be lowercase , e.g. album.
php
model class must map to filename and be capitalized , and must be appended with _ Model , e.g. Album_Model
must have the Model class as ( grand ) parent
Here is the album model code .
Create a file called album .
php in application / models / and paste the code below on it .
All the methods in the models make use of the Query builder syntax .
This Kohana tool speeds up database development times and simplify the queries creation .
Two members variables are declared at the top of the class :
These members are private because I want to limit the visibility only to this class .
They are the containers for the database tables names .
The first line in the constructor method loads the Kohana database library into $ this ->db .
In the second and third lines the two class members are initialized .
The query in the read method retrieves album records that have a certain identifier ( " $id " ) .
The query in the delete method deletes the albums table row that have a certain identifier ( " $id " ) .
The query in the update method updates the albums table row that has a certain identifier ( " $id " ) with new values from the " $ data " array .
The " $ data " array must contain record names as keys of the array , and value as values of the array .
The " $ data " array must have this form :
The query in the create method inserts a new record with values of the " $ data " array .
The " $ data " array must have this form :
The query in the get_list method retrieves all the albums rows .
Now , the genre model .
Create a file called genre. php in application / models / and paste the code below it :
This model is very simple so I 'll waste no further time to comment upon it .
The Models and the controller are ready to go .
Let 's now work on the Views .
Step 9 : Create the Project View
Views are files that contain the presentation layer for your application .
The purpose is to keep this information separate from your application logic for easy reusability and cleaner code .
For this project , three views are required : a view to list the album collection , a view to create a new album , and a view to edit an existing album .
Create a file called list .
php in application / views / and paste the following code in :
This view shows an html page containing a list of all albums .
This list has been created using foreach loop that prints the information in an html table .
For each album row , there are two images : a " red cross " and a " pocketbook " .
They link respectively the controller delete method and the update method .
Both pass the album id to the album controller using a get request .
Above the list there is a button to create new albums .
In this code we also make use of an html helper provided by Kohana that speeds up operations to write html pages .
Let 's now create a file called create .
php in application / views / .
The last but not the least is the update view .
Let 's create a file called update .
php in application / views / .
The first one is a simple editor that enables the user to insert information about a new album .
The fields like author and name will be inserted using an html input and genre using a
combo box .
Once the user clicks on the create button , all information is passed ,
as a POST request , to the create / update method in the album controller .
When the controller receives these posted
variables , it calls the model that inserts a new album into the database .
The forms , in both views , makes use of Kohana form helper .
To give a bit of style to our application , create the assets folder in the Kohana root at the same level of the application folder .
Now , open it and create two new folders : css and images .
In the css folder create a new file called style.css and paste this :
Now copy the following images to the images folder :
That 's all .
Point your browser to http://localhost/kohana/index.php/album and you should see something similar to this :
If you try to create a new album or to edit an existing one you should see something similar to this :
Step 10 : Final Thoughts
Of course , some improvements are required for this application but with a small amount of code , you 've created a little web application .
Now , you know how to use the MVC pattern with Kohana , and how to use database libraries and helpers .
To learn more , read the official documentation .
Thanks to Kohana , code maintenance is an easy task , and adding new features is a cinch .
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial .

It 's undeniable that the going rate for information on the internet is " free . "
That 's meant big trouble for newspapers , which have seen nearly all of their traditional roles usurped by better , faster , free online services over the past few years .
If a newspaper does n't make its content available gratis on the Web , it 's irrelevant .
If it does , it 's got nothing left to sell but fishwrap and inkstains .
The Wall Street Journal 's publisher Les Hinton has called Google a " digital vampire , " but even his paper , one of the last holdouts of subscription - based online content , has made its articles ' full text accessible via Google searches .
Using free content as bait for paying customers does n't work for newspapers .
And the revenue from internet advertising is less a stream than a dribble – nowhere near enough to support a robust paper ( or paperless paper ) on its own .
Still , there 's a crucial distinction that might yet save news organizations .
Users are pretty clearly uninterested in paying for content on the open internet , but what they are , in practice , willing to pay for is mobile content .
IPhone apps are already a billion - dollar business .
Juniper Research recently reported that mobile music revenues ( for downloads , ringtones , ringback tones and the like ) were over $ 11 billion in 2008 .
And the success of Amazon 's Kindle – on which newspaper subscriptions cost anywhere from $ 6 to $ 14 a month – points toward a potential lifeline for news organizations .
Silicon Alley Insider 's Nicholas Carlson has noted that The New York Times could give each subscriber a free Kindle for a few months ' worth of printing costs .
In fact , the Times , The Washington Post and The Boston Globe recently made a deal with Amazon to sell Kindles at a discount to electronic subscribers outside their print delivery areas .
Meanwhile , Hearst Corp. is preparing to launch an e-reader of its own , and Fortune has reported that it will probably have a screen larger than the Kindle 's , to approximate the reading experience associated with magazines and newspapers .
The ultimate form factor of mobile news might be bigger still : Microsoft recently released a video speculating on the technology of 2019 , including an electronic newspaper transmitted onto foldable , touch - sensitive " paper . "
Of course , any Kindle - like gizmo's web browser makes it capable of getting old - fashioned news for free .
But mobile devices can also do one thing that other computers can't – pinpoint their users ' location .
That means that the wireless news subscribers of the future may be able to get information tailored not just to their interests but to where they 're physically standing .
" We 're finding that an increasing number of young people are getting their news from smartphones , " says Geeta Dayal , a Ford Foundation Fellow who teaches a class on mobile phones and journalism at University of California , Berkeley 's Graduate School of Journalism .
" And the more people use their phones to access information , the more they want to know what 's happening where they are right now . "
One possible future of news as a commodity is hyperlocal information – the sort of thing that 's already becoming popularized by services like Yelp , whose incarnation as an iPhone app offers directions to nearby restaurants and services , complete with with user reviews .
A subscriber to a location - based news service might , for instance , be able to point a mobile phone at a building and instantly have access to its news history , its architectural background , profiles and political donation records of the people who live or work there .
Imagine hearing a jackhammer and being able to determine at the touch of a button what 's being built or demolished , who owns the property , and how long the noise is going to go on .
All that information is still going to be free on the Web , of course – but what hyperlocal news subscribers would be paying for is having the information know where they are .
Within a few years , the economics of mobile news could mean that you can find out what 's happening on the other side of the world for free , but pay to understand what 's happening just around the corner .
Yesterday , Monitor environment blogger Eoin O'Carroll posted on forgeries by coal industry lobbyists .
There 's a related phenomenon observable on discussion boards hosted by news organizations across the country .
You might call it " climate spam . "
As any regular visitor to the environment section of the Monitor website may note , stories about climate change and climate science tend to garner many comments from both sides of the " climate change is " or " is n't happening " spectrum .
Some are vituperative , some thoughtful , some informative , some humorous .
And some are , for lack of a better description , strangely aloof .
They stand out for not directly addressing the topic at hand .
Aware of these comments for some time , I 've conducted a very informal and hardly scientifically rigorous experiment .
I began Googling , between quotation marks , long sentences from these somewhat generic - seeming comments .
Sure enough , I found several instances where the same comments appear verbatim on other news organizations ' websites .
One such comment begins :
The root of the climate change problem ?
We ’re letting the United Nations decide what is best for America .
And they ’re failing us .
The premise that CO2 drives global warming is based on United Nations ’ climate reports that are tainted by politics and an agenda .
It shows up at news organization websites across the country , including the Orlando Sentinel and The New York Times .
The commenter left a link to a website , so I e-mailed to ask what his intent was .
Robert Moen 's response , by e-mail : " Sometimes I re-use comments , sometimes I write a comment from scratch and sometimes I post a combination of the two ....
The purpose of my comments are two - fold : I try to educate readers directly through the comment process and also drive traffic to my site so people can educate themselves in energy policy . "
So sometimes there is a little self - promotion .
Here 's another comment that has appeared on the Monitor 's site and elsewhere .
It starts :
The US government has spent over $ 79 billion since 1989 on policies related to climate change , including science and technology research , administration , education campaigns , foreign aid , and tax breaks .
It shows up verbatim in too many places to count , and seems to originate on the Science and Public Policy website .
" Proved : There Is No Climate Crisis , " reads one of the site 's more popular headlines .
Again , the poster includes a link to the site , so the comment is not entirely unsourced .
Here 's another comment that shows up in several places verbatim , followed by a bulleted list , also verbatim , of " global warming is not happening " talking points :
The main cause of global warming appears to be change in solar activity and change in the earth ’s orbit and tilt .
Recent reductions in sunspots on the solar surface suggest that we may be entering into a cooling period .
So what to make of any of this ?
Are these commenters using news organizations ' discussion space for free advertising ?
Or are they simply individuals who are quoting here – and in many other places – an argument they find particularly well - formulated ?
Perhaps it 's not a single commenter but many — a coincidence .
Perhaps many different people across the Web all happened to very much like and quote , verbatim , the same block of text .
Or maybe it's one person with a point to make , but who finds it easier to take the copy - and - paste approach .
Impossible to say .
And yet , one might reasonably conclude that whatever the motives of these commenters , real discussion between real people — a primary purpose of these comment forums — is not primary among them .
And there 's some history here .
It 's been fairly well - documented that , when it comes to the public discussion around climate , a strategy of those opposed to action on climate matters has been to inject as much doubt into public discourse as possible .
In a memo leaked in 2003 [ PDF ] , Republican strategist Frank Luntz lays it out — uncertainty as a political tactic :
Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community ....
Therefore , you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate , and defer to scientists and other experts in the field .
He also says : " The scientific debate is closing [ against us ] but not yet closed .
There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science . "
In a box called " words that work " he outlines what 's become a central " global warming can't be happening " talking point :
You can't look back a million years and say that proves we 're heating the globe now hotter than it 's ever been .
After all , just 20 years ago scientists were worried about a new Ice Age .
See the Bright Green Blog 's post – Were they really predicting an ice age in the 1970s ?
– on that , by the way .
Mr. Luntz has since said that he thinks humans are probably changing Earth 's climate .
But the strategies he put forth continue to be employed en force .
The bloggers over at RealClimate – they 're also real scientists — call it the " deniosphere . "
In 2007 , Newsweek 's Sharon Begley called it the " denial machine . "
An academic at Stanford University coined a term to describe the " cultural production of ignorance " — agnatology .
And agnatology as a political strategy begins long before the current era of worry over global warming .
Big Tobacco quite successfully " agnatologized " during its more than 40 years battling against regulation .
Indeed , Naomi Oreskes of the University of California at San Diego has documented that many of the same scientists involved in the pro-tobacco lobby now argue that global warming is n't happening .
In an essay entitled " Challenging Knowledge : How Climate Science Became a Victim of the Cold War " she writes :
On first glance , it seems just plain weird that several of the same
individuals — all retired physicists — were involved in denying that cancer causes
smoking , that pollution causes acid rain , that CFCs destroy ozone , and that
greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming .
But when you put these
things together — tobacco regulation , the banning of CFCs , the delay of controls on
CO2 emissions — then they do add up , summing to a radical free market ideology
that opposes any action restricting the pursuit of market capitalism , no matter the
justification .
Dr. Oreskes herself received some criticism for an article last year in The Times of London in which she incorrectly said that President Ronald Reagan had commissioned a report about global warming from physicist William Nierenberg .
( Congress commissioned it . )
Here 's the correction .
And here 's a response from Dr. Nierenberg 's son .
And that brings us back to the " climate spam " that somehow ends up on discussion boards .
Even those arguing that global warming is happening sometimes employ this " copy and paste " tactic — although with less frequency , according to my very informal analysis , than those who argue that global warming is n't occurring .
Below is a comment that shows up on the Monitor 's site and – in duplicate , triplicate , and quadruplicate – across cyberspace .
The commenter includes a link to this paper [ PDF ] , which contains much of the comment 's material verbatim .
The comment begins :
The denialists cannot be reached using logic .
The five elements are conspiracy , cherry - picking , fake experts , moving goalposts , and logical fallacies .
Whatever the motivation , it is important to recognize denialism when confronted with it .
The normal academic response to an opposing argument is to engage with it , testing the strengths and weaknesses of the differing views , in the expectations that the truth will emerge through a process of debate .
However , this requires that both parties obey certain ground rules , such as a willingness to look at the evidence as a whole , to reject deliberate distortions and to accept principles of logic .
As always , readers are invited to comment .
I use reference images to make the textures that I put on objects in Overgrowth .
It 's easy to get texture reference images from websites like CGTextures , but that can be limiting .
Taking your own photos is also really easy !
This image is a normal reference photo I took while on my trip to the mountains .
I thought it looked like something we might have in Overgrowth , so with this picture I can more realistically reproduce something like it in the game .
As a texture reference though , this image has some problems : all the detail is far away , and there are a lot of shadows from the direct sunlight .
Here 's a picture of some plants that I took on an overcast day .
It 's nice and bright , so I got really good colors and soft shadows .
I try to take all my reference photos on overcast days , or if that is n't possible , I shoot in the shadows .
Ideally your light source should be bright but diffuse .
If you do n't have enough light your images can get grainy , which is really bad for texture reference images .
It 's still possible to shoot images at dusk or dawn by increasing the exposure on the camera , but you will also need a tripod so the images do n't come out blurry .
Using a flash usually produces a lot of specular highlights , which makes the images unusable .
I do n't have a fancy camera .
Even a cheap point and shoot model is good enough .
If you 're doing a lot of 3D there really is n't any excuse not to collect your own reference photos .
There are also a lot of good reasons to take your own .
Since it 's illegal to use photos as textures without permission , finding good reference images is sometimes tricky .
One last good reason to take your own photos is so that your textures do n't end up looking like every other game .
Many of the coolest texture images , from CGTextures for example , are already used in lots of different games .
What do you think about using photos as textures , instead of painting them by hand ?

Reformat your Gmail address with dots
You can reformat your existing Gmail address by inserting dots ( periods ) anywhere within your Gmail Read more
We 've mentioned before that you can use the " + " sign in your Gmail address to generate an unlimited number of email address variations for your same account , but some online services wo n't accept the " + " symbol , or ignore it entirely .
Instead , you can use the period " . " character anywhere within your email address and Gmail will ignore it , but most online services will consider it a separate address .

This way you can sign up for more than one account with the same online provider , but get your email in a single inbox .
It 's a brilliantly simple solution , just the way we like them .
Use One Email Address with Multiple Twitter Accounts [ Digital Inspiration ]
We all know what “ spam ” is — the bulk email that fills our inbox with crap .
Well , it looks like someone is doing the same thing to the New York Times bestseller list , using something called “ bulk orders ” .
Let ’s say you write a book and you really want it to be on the bestseller lists , but sales are sluggish .
If you have enough money , you can just buy lots of copies of your own book , to artificially inflate sales numbers .
Since it is your book , you can even send the books you buy in bulk back to the booksellers and resell them again ( and again ) , so it only costs you the retailer ’s markup for each sale .
If you ’re lucky , increased ( real ) sales from being on bestseller lists might even make up for the cost of buying your way onto the lists .
For example , a former manager of a B .
Dalton ’s bookstore reports that people would come in and ( paying cash ) buy large quantities of books by L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology .
Later , new books would arrive from Hubbard ’s publishing house , with B. Dalton price stickers already on the books .
Hmmm .
When this practice became widespread , some bestseller lists started checking for bulk orders .
If you look on the NY Times ’ bestseller list , you will see a small “ dagger ” ( † ) following some of the titles , and in the fine print at the bottom of the list it says
A dagger ( † ) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders .
As a sign of how widespread this practice is , five of the top ten books on the current list have daggers !
What makes this both political and ironic is which books have daggers :
Book number two on this week ’s list is “ The Obama Nation ” , by Jerome Corsi , who helped “ swiftboat ” John Kerry .
It was number one last week .
Number five is “ The Case Against Barack Obama ” , which calls Obama a “ calculating extreme leftist ” .
At seven is “ Fleeced : How Barack Obama , Media Mockery of Terrorist Threats , Liberals Who Want To Kill Talk Radio , The Do-Nothing Congress , Companies That Help Iran , And Washington Lobbyists For Foreign Governments Are Scamming Us… And What To Do About It ” .
Number eight is “ The Limits of Power ” that “ argues that Americans are responsible for the country ’s woes ” and that you should n’t blame Bush .
The only book with a dagger that is not political is a memoir by actress Tori Spelling — daughter of Aaron Spelling , who left his kids $ 500 million when he died .
That ’s right ( in more ways than one ) — all but one of the books that have been spammed onto the bestseller lists are right - wing partisan books .
Interestingly , there are two political books in the NY Times ’ top ten that do not have daggers :
“ The Way of the World ” about “ how the Bush administration manipulated evidence about Iraq ” .
“ The Wrecking Crew ” about “ the deliberate mismanagement of Republican rule ” .
All the right - wing books have daggers .
None of the left - wing books have daggers ( meaning that they actually earned their way legitimately onto the bestseller list ) .
You can make your own conclusions about who is placing bulk orders for right - wing books .
Unfortunately , not all bestseller lists check for bulk orders .
Even the NY Times list , which does check , gets reprinted in other newspapers and all over the Web , but without the daggers , so readers who buy a book because it has “ been on the bestseller list for 5 weeks ” are probably getting spammed without knowing it .
For example , the largest bookseller in the world , Amazon.com , shows the NY Times bestseller list , but without any daggers or other indication of bulk orders .
Discworld author Terry Pratchett has spoken out against new guidelines on assisted suicide which were issued last week .
The guidelines do not provide immunity from prosecution – assisting suicide carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years – but are intended to offer clear advice to the relatives of people wishing to kill themselves about whether they would face prosecution .
Pratchett , who revealed in 2007 he was suffering from early - onset Alzheimer 's , said yesterday the new guidelines had him " a little more angry " .
" No one is really happy with them , " he told the BBC Politics Show West .
" It would appear they are suggesting that people could help you kill yourself , and then the police would investigate as an act of murder and decide whether or not this was really the case , which seems a very lame way of doing things . "
The bestselling fantasy author suggested instead " that there should be possibly some kind of non-aggressive tribunal system where someone who , for whatever reasons , wishes to end their life – and I would only really accept medical reasons , I must say – can make their points to a magistrate or a coroner , along with the medical evidence on which they wish to end their life " .
This , Pratchett felt , would " protect the vulnerable " , and " could weed out the hypothetical granny who is being urged by her heirs to commit suicide , so they can get their hands on her money " .
Pratchett said that he himself was " feeling fine " , and that although he can no longer drive a car or use a typewriter , he is continuing to write using a speech - to - text programme .
" I can now talk to the typewriter and get the work done , " he said .
Pratchett 's new Discworld novel , Unseen Academicals , is published in October .
" The reason I wish to end my life is because of a medical condition – it's not bad yet and I 'm full of the joys of spring , but it will eventually get very bad and Alzheimer 's is the most feared disease among the over - 60s .
It is not nice .
I do not wish to be there for the endgame , " Pratchett said .
" I spoke to a doctor who told me when he was a young doctor he walked through a ward of terminal Alzheimer 's patents who effectively were not there any more , and he wondered why they were being kept alive , when there was very little there to keep alive . "
A 12 - week consultation on the new guidelines is currently ongoing , with the finalised policy to be announced next spring .

Advertisement One of Aesop 's fables may have been based on fact , scientists report .
In the tale , written more than 2,000 years ago , a crow uses stones to raise the water level in a pitcher so it can reach the liquid to quench its thirst .
Now a study published in Current Biology reveals that rooks , a relative of crows , do just the same when presented with a similar situation .
The team says the study shows rooks are innovative tool - users , even though they do not use tools in the wild .
Another paper , published in the journal Plos One , shows that New Caledonian crows - which like rooks , are a member of the corvid group , along with ravens , jackdaws , magpies and jays - can use three tools in succession to reach a treat .
Floating feast
The crow and the pitcher fable was used by Aesop to illustrate that necessity is the mother of invention .
But until now , the morality tale was not thought to have a grounding in fact .
Nowadays , we 've had so many startling findings that the rooks just do n't surprise me that much any more .
You almost expect them to do the cleverest thing
Nathan Emery , QMUL
To investigate further , a team from the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary , University of London ( QMUL ) presented four captive rooks with a set - up analogous to the fable .
The birds were shown a clear tube containing a small amount of water .
Floating upon it was an out - of - reach worm .
And a pile of stones was positioned nearby .
Dr Nathan Emery , co-author of the paper , from QMUL , said : " The rooks have to put multiple stones in the tube until the worm floats to the top . "
And the four birds did just that .
Two , called Cook and Fry , raised the water - level enough to grab the floating feast the very first time that they were presented with the test , while Connelly and Monroe were successful on their second attempt .
Footage of the experiments shows the rooks first assessing the water level by peering at the tube from above and from the side , before picking up and dropping the stones into the water .
The birds were extremely accurate , using the exact number of stones needed to raise the worm to a height where they could reach it .

In another experiment , the rooks were presented with a similar scenario .
This time they were given a combination of small and large stones .
Rooks are a member of the corvid family of birds Overall , Dr Emery told BBC News , the rooks opted for the larger ones , raising the worm to the top of the tube more quickly .
He said : " They are being as efficient as possible . "
And when given a choice between a tube filled with water and another filled with sawdust , the birds were more likely to opt for the liquid - filled tube .
The researchers say their findings suggest that Aesop 's ancient fable may have been based on fact .
They said : " In folklore , it is rarely possible to know with certainty which corvid is being referred to .
" Hence , Aesop 's crow might have easily been Aesop 's rook . "
' No surprise ' Earlier this year , the same team revealed that rooks were able to use different tools to solve a variety of complex problems .
Meet the brains of the animal world Dr Emery told BBC News : " I used to say , maybe two or three years ago , that everything they did surprised me .
" But nowadays , we 've had so many startling findings that the rooks just do n't surprise me that much any more .
You almost expect them to do the cleverest thing . "
The only other animals reported to have solved an Aesop - like problem are orangutans .
Christopher Bird , co-author on the paper , added : " Corvids are remarkably intelligent , and in many ways rival the great apes in their physical intelligence and ability to solve problems . "

Advertisement A different study published this week has also shed light on corvid intelligence .
A team at the University of Oxford found that New Caledonian crows were able to use three tools in succession to reach a reward .
These birds , which are found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia , use tools in the wild , crafting them from branches to pluck grubs from holes and crevices .
But this study builds on their tool - using repertoire .
Captive crows were presented with several horizontal tubes .
One of the tubes contained some out - of - reach food .
The others contained long and medium - length hooks - but , again , these were all out of beak 's reach .
And a shorter hook - like tool was positioned nearby .
The researchers found that the birds picked up the short tool , then used this to grasp the medium - length tool , which they then employed to retrieve the longest tool from the tube .
Finally , they were able to use this to drag out the tasty morsel .
New Caledonian crows use tools in the wild Four out of seven of the birds tested were able to use three tools in the right order , the team said .
Professor Alex Kacelnik , an author on the paper from Oxford 's Behavioural Ecology Group , said : " The essence of our paper is to try to understand the mental processes used by the animals to actually achieve their goals . "
He said that the complexity of the task made it unlikely that the crows were solving the problem using trial and error .
He added : " We are aware that the animals probably do it by putting together , in creative ways , things that they have learned individually . "
Researchers believe that an ancient ancestor of the corvids might have evolved the capacity to use tools , and that all members of the corvid family may have this innate ability .
However , only New Caledonian crows draw upon it in the wild , potentially because of ecological pressures .

Sometimes the most random everyday encounters force us to stop and rethink the truths and perceptions we have ingrained in our minds .
These encounters are educationally priceless .
They spawn moments of deep thought and self - reflection that challenge the status quo and help us evolve as sensible individuals .
On our new sister site , Makes Me Think , we call these thought - provoking life experiences ‘ MMTs ’ .
Makes Me
Think is an online community where people share daily life stories that provoke deep thought and inspire positive change .
Here ’s a sample of 32 MMT stories that were recently submitted to the site :

On December 22 , 2001 , a 28 - year - old minor thug and former gang member from South London climbed onto a Boeing 767 bound for Miami .
On the sparsely booked flight , he settled into a window seat in an otherwise empty row .
Ninety minutes into the flight , with the plane well out over the Atlantic , a flight attendant noticed smoke coming from his area .
She informed him that as the flight was an American flight , no smoking was allowed .
A few minutes later , he was hunched over in his seat when the attendant saw that he was n't trying to light a cigarette .
He was trying to light his shoe .
The flight attendant , aided by passengers , acted quickly .
Richard Reid never got another chance to light his shoe bomb .
Thanks to the immediate action of the the those on board , there was no damage to the plane .
No injuries or loss of life .
Since that day in 2001 , every passenger entering a commercial airliner has been required to remove their shoes for inspection and X -ray .
A precaution that is ... massively , even breathtakingly idiotic .
Why ?
Well , first off the volume of a shoe sole is not all that great .
Reid managed to cram about 100 grams of high explosive into his shoe .
Had he been successful in setting off the explosion , it 's unlikely that the plane would have been so damaged as to crash , but almost certain that there would have been deaths in the passenger cabin .
If the bomb had worked , it would have been a serious problem .
So why is making people take off their shoes before entering a plane a crowning bit of stupidity ?
Because that 100 grams might have fit almost anywhere .
Anything that will fit in a shoe sole will also fit in a back pocket , or under a shirt , or in a pair of extra comfy undershorts , or in a bra ( as a comparison , the average breast implant weighs three times as much as much as Reid 's shoe bomb -- and that 's just on one side ) .
There is absolutely nothing magic about shoes .
In fact , as a place to store explosives like the ones that Reid carried -- which can be quite shock sensitive -- packing them into your shoes has to rate at the bottom of the list .
But here we are years later , still showing off our holey socks to the world and making business for the folks at Tinactin .
Assume that each airline traveller spends an additional minute in line because of removing , scanning , and replacing their shoes .
Just one minute .
In the United States , there are about 830 million domestic airline passengers a year .
That 's about 1,600 man years of time spent each year on removing shoes that are no more threat than any other piece of clothing .
If you put a $ 10 / hr value on the time of the average air traveller , that 's about $ 33 million / year worth of shoe time .
Better than $ 300 million worth since Reid got tackled in business class .
Which has to make Reid and those like him very , very happy .
So why do we go through the shoe ritual ?
First the fear factor around shoes was bolstered by other events .
Only a few months after Reid 's failed attempt , an airliner went down in Queens .
Immediately , the rumor circulated that the plane had been the victim of another shoe bomber -- a theory that seemed to be confirmed by " cooperating " terror suspect , Mohammed Jabarah who was feeding information to the CIA from inside an al - Qaeda cell .
Jabrah claimed that the plane had been destroyed by an unnamed " 12th hijacker " using a shoe bomb , as part of a " second wave " of airliner attacks .
Thing is , Jabarah was lying .
The flight that came down in Queens failed because of problems with the plane 's rudder , and Jabarah was later rearrested after it turned out he was giving plenty of real information to al - Qaeda while feeding fairy tales to the US .
This came after a period in which Jabarah was the " subject of some interrogation which was improper " while a prisoner in Oman ( i.e. torture does n't work , and it's a really bad way to start your relationship with your new double agent ) .
Similar suggestions of other shoe bombings made by imprisoned terror suspects have never turned out to have any basis in fact .
The bigger reason we did something is because the response of politicians is always to do something .
Even if that something makes no sense -- even if that something is actually counterproductive .
The reason you 're tiptoeing along the concourse in your Hanes ( and tossing that Coke in the trash ) has more to do with why jails are overpopulated than it does with stopping terrorists .
When politicians see something on the news , and when pundits are screaming for action , the inclination is to provide that action .
If that means a million gallons of Head n' Shoulders in airport trash cans or a life sentence for stealing a pizza , so what ?
What counts is that action was taken .
Dave Kilchen in his new book The Accidental Guerrilla describes terrorism in the terms of an auto - immune disorder .
Like lupus , where the systems of the body designed to protect against infection turn on healthy tissue , our response to problems can often result in far more damage than the problem itself .
It 's not the terrorists that do the real damage -- it 's how you respond to the terrorists .
Certainly , if you look at all the ways that the United States has responded to the threat of terrorism since 9/11 we 've damaged our overseas relationships and reputation , tossed much of our own constitution in the dumpster , and spent millions for every dollar that our enemies have spent .
The self - inflicted wounds have been deeper , more serious , and more lingering than anything that was done from the outside .
The extent of the damage is often hard to judge .
Since 9 - 11 , self - inflicted wounds have turned up almost everywhere , even in subjects as distantly related as environmental law .
In 2008 , the failure of a containment area released about 300 million gallons of water and coal ash mixed in a slurry .
This is just the latest and largest of several huge spills which have flooded communities , ruined rivers , destroyed homes , taken lives , and all the other fun stuff that happens when a wall of black goop goes raging through a valley .
While the physical damage caused by the floods is clear , the long term damage from the heavy metals and other chemicals in the slurry is less clear .
Some agencies said fly ash slurries were serious problems .
A draft report last year by the federal Environmental Protection Agency found ... that the concentrations of arsenic to which people might be exposed through drinking water contaminated by fly ash could increase cancer risks several hundredfold .
Similarly , a 2006 study by the federally chartered National Research Council found that these coal - burning byproducts “ often contain a mixture of metals and other constituents in sufficient quantities that they may pose public health and environmental concerns if improperly managed . ”
The study said “ risks to human health and ecosystems ” might occur when these contaminants entered drinking water supplies or surface water bodies .
Other agencies did n't agree .
The Tennessee Valley Authority has issued no warnings about the potential chemical dangers of the spill , saying there was as yet no evidence of toxic substances .
“ Most of that material is inert , ” said Gilbert Francis Jr. , a spokesman for the authority .
“ It does have some heavy metals within it , but it ’s not toxic or anything . ”
Attempts to more strictly regulate the storage of ash were met with opposition from coal companies and utilities .
Which , as anyone watching the current health care debate might predict , squashed any thought of changing the regulations .
Senator Barbara
Boxer has led an effort to at least put together a public database of ash storage sites so that people can judge the risk to the areas where they live .
However , even this effort has been blocked not by coal companies or utilities , but by the DHS .
How could it possibly be a national security interest to cover up the location of material that 's " not toxic or anything ? "
It 's not .
In fact , even if the ash turns out to be as bad as its worst critics fear , blocking the database is far more dangerous than revealing the location of these sites .
Not only has there not been any threat against these sites by terrorists , and no workable scenario by which they might cause a problem , coal slurry impoundments are already failing with regularity , dousing parts of America with millions of gallons of this material .
It does n't take terrorists to make this happen .
Blocking the release of this information does n't protect the citizens of the United States in any way .
It 's just another example of the same creeping secrecy that makes cities more difficult to manage because of secrecy over facilities .
The same creeping secrecy that " blurs " national monuments from images and puts intentional gaps in public information .
The same creeping secrecy that increasingly elevates the most unlikely attack -- the shoe bombers of the world -- above our right to know what 's going on around us so that we can make informed decisions .
The same secrecy that defends torturers .
It 's worth remembering that the United States made it more than 170 years without any recognized need for a " national security " argument that acted as a trump card over any law .
It was n't until a Supreme Court ruling in 1953 that national security was enshrined as an all - purpose reason to deny access to information .
After the B - 29 Superfortress crashed near Waycross , Ga. , in 1948 , killing nine of the 13 men aboard , the widows of the Philadelphia - area engineers sought damages against the Air Force in federal court .
...
Arguing that the widows ' claim that Air Force negligence was responsible for the crash was unsupported -- and that the release of any information on the aircraft or its mission would pose a threat to national security -- the government appealed .
Though the government 's appeal was defeated in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , the Supreme Court overturned the district court 's verdict , ruling in United States v. Reynolds that even federal judges were not necessarily entitled to access sensitive information if national security could consequently suffer .
That ruling established the pattern that we 've seen so often of late -- the use of " national security " to crush any other concern .
It was not until decades later that the crash report on the B - 29 became available .
When it did , the results went unnoticed for years longer .
It took the children of one of those dead engineers to discover that ... the government was lying .
The crash report revealed no national security concerns , but it did reveal a long history of maintenance issues , mechanical problems and pilot error .
It revealed exactly what the widows of the dead engineers had said it would reveal .
In that very first example of national security being used to deny information to the public , the government was doing nothing less than protecting itself and military contractors from legitimate scrutiny .
Which makes it a very good example of the vast majority of such assertions of national security since then .
A medical billing company may be blowing smoke , but could reimbursing patients for medical marijuana lower drug costs for employers ?
By Jeremy Smerd , Workforce Management Online , July 2009
In mid-June , Rhode Island became the third state to legalize the sale of marijuana for medical use , giving momentum to advocates who believe the legalization of the drug offers a dose of sanity for the nation ’s costly health care system .
Now that more states are legalizing the sale of the marijuana used solely as a medicine , the next hurdle for reformers who say the drug is more cost - effective than pharmaceuticals is getting those who pay for health care — insurers and employers — to reimburse patients for its use .
“ It ’s going to take an employer that says , ‘ We ’re not interested in marijuana as a gateway drug or any of that reefer madness .
We want to talk about dollars and cents , ’ ” says Allen St. Pierre , executive director of NORML ( the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) .
“ If the idea here is saving money , then there ’s no question that medical marijuana should be part of the ambit of choices that doctors , patients and employers can have . ”
The effort to legalize the sale of medical marijuana has focused mainly on whether the medical effectiveness of the drug justifies making it legal to obtain in plant form .
The medical benefits have been most closely tied to treating weight loss , nausea , pain , inflammation , spasticity and other symptoms associated with cancer , AIDS , cerebral palsy , muscular dystrophy and arthritis .
Advocates for its legalization say its medical benefits should be made available to ease the suffering of patients .
In a nod to the plant ’s medicinal powers , pharmaceutical companies have produced synthetic forms of some of its active chemicals .
Less attention , though , has been focused on whether paying for patients ’ medical marijuana is a cost - effective way to manage certain illnesses .
Advocates argue that marijuana is an effective medicine that can also be a cost - effective alternative to pharmaceuticals .
Reimbursing patients who use it could push them away from otherwise costly drugs that some advocates say are not as effective .
Employers , as payers of health care , should champion the legalization of medical marijuana as a potential cost - saving tool , advocates say .
Despite the recent legislative victories , however , even employers that want to reimburse patients who use medical marijuana cannot .
Stephen DeAngelo , chief executive of Harborside Health Center , a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland , California , has tried to provide a medical marijuana benefit through the health plan he provides to his 67 full - time employees .
“ Blue Cross Blue Shield will not reimburse for medical marijuana ; we checked , ” he says .
“ It ’s illegal under federal law and they ca n’t do anything that will break federal law . ”
Instead , he provides his employees , all of whom are medical marijuana patients , with a free gram of marijuana for every shift they work , a policy he says has lowered his company ’s health insurance costs .
“ Many of these patients had drug bills of several hundred dollars a week before they began using medical marijuana , ” he says .
“ Now they are about $ 40 or $ 50 a week . ”
A week before Rhode Island legalized the sale of medical marijuana , a medical billing company in Los Angeles said it had successfully enabled medical marijuana patients to get reimbursed by major health insurance companies .
GE Medical Billing , which is not affiliated with General Electric Corp. , says it contracts with California marijuana dispensaries , where patients with “ recommendations ” from doctors are allowed , under state law , to purchase the cannabis plant in forms smokeable , edible and generally ingestible , then helps the dispensaries ’ patients get reimbursed from insurance companies for the money they spend on marijuana .
Patients can pay dispensaries around $ 60 for marijuana with names like Purple Flo and Hindu Kush , or — for patients not wanting to inhale — Bomb Brownies that are the specialty of one Los Angeles dispensary called Bakedery .
Dispensaries that contract with GE Medical Billing send expense claims of customers to insurers via the billing company .
The company ’s medical director , a licensed obstetrician and gynecologist named Gil Mintz , says he has helped patients get reimbursed by such insurers as Aetna , Cigna , UnitedHealth , and that at least one union , the Field Ironworkers Union in Arizona , Nevada and California , uses its services .
But health insurers dispute this .
They say they cannot and do not reimburse patients for drugs , including medical marijuana , that are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
A spokesman for Cigna cited this fact when explaining that the Philadelphia health insurer has no business relationship with GE Medical Billing .
“ We do n’t provide reimbursement for the medical use of marijuana , ” said spokesman Mark Slitt .
“ We do n’t have a business relationship with GE Medical Billing nor did we give them permission to use our logo on their Web site . ”
An Aetna spokeswoman also said the insurer does not cover medical marijuana either as a pharmacy or medical benefit .
Neither UnitedHealth nor the ironworkers union responded to several requests for comment .
Cigna says it does reimburse patients for the use of a generic version of a drug , Marinol , which is a synthetic version of one of the marijuana plant ’s active chemicals , tetrahydrocannabinol , more commonly known as THC .
Indeed , it appears that GE Medical Billing uses an insurance code for what appears to be a synthetic marijuana substitute called “ cannarettes , ” says Harborside ’s DeAngelo , who asked his insurance broker to investigate GE Medical Billing ’s assertions .
DeAngelo and other marijuana reform advocates say that until a federal agency says there is a use for medical cannabis , no insurance company will reimburse patients who use it .
While it is unlikely to happen anytime soon , the stance of both state and federal governments appears to be softening .
Thirteen states have legalized the use of medical marijuana , and the Obama administration , in a reversal of Bush administration policy , has said it will not prosecute citizens who comply with states marijuana laws .
On June 18 , Reps. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , and Ron Paul , R - Texas , introduced legislation that would eliminate federal penalties for the personal possession of cannabis and the not - for - profit transfer of up to one ounce of pot .
The next step , advocates say , is to study whether medical marijuana does indeed reduce health care costs .
No formal , peer - reviewed study of the cost - effectiveness of medical marijuana has been conducted , says Jeffrey Miron , an economist at Harvard University who has written about the cost of the federal prohibition against marijuana .
And while $ 1.1 billion has been budgeted to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition , there is no plan to research the effectiveness of medical marijuana , says a spokeswoman for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality .
One informal study on the cost - effectiveness of using marijuana for medical purposes was conducted in 2006 and published in O’Shaughnessy ’s , a non-academic journal that examines how cannabis is used in doctors ’ practices .
In it , many doctors said the use of marijuana led their patients to cut back on more expensive pharmaceutical drugs to treat the same symptom .
Until then , politicians and voters should not be the ones to decide which drugs are safe for patients , says one opponent of medical marijuana , Robert L. DuPont , a former drug czar under Presidents Nixon and Ford and currently the president of the Institute for Behavior and Health , a drug policy group in Washington .
“ The idea of approving drugs through ballot initiative and legislative action is a scary precedent for any medicine , ” he says , though he agrees that buying whole - leaf marijuana is probably cheaper than buying pharmaceuticals .
While studies have shown marijuana to have medical benefits , it also has potential hazards , not least of which comes from smoking .
An article in May in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology said carcinogens in marijuana made smoking three joints equal to 20 or more tobacco cigarettes .
“ I do n’t know when the last time you went to a doctor and he said go out and get some weeds and burn them and that ’s a medicine , ” DuPont says .
“ Because smoke is toxic . ”
Advocates , who are hoping that the FDA will recognize the plant ’s benefits and allow patients to get reimbursed for ingesting the drug , say the push will have to come from the people who pay for health care — not just patients , but health insurers and employers too .
“ Health care costs would go down , I assure you , ” says Lester Grinspoon , associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of Marijuana : The Forbidden Medicine .
“ The argument it should be legal is not just a medical point of view , but also from a point of view that … it will be less expensive than modern pharmaceuticals are .
Those are two powerful arguments for making it legal . ”

A team of NOAA - supported scientists from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , Louisiana State University , and the University of Michigan is forecasting that the " dead zone " off the coast of Louisiana and Texas in the Gulf of Mexico this summer could be one of the largest on record .
The dead zone is an area in the Gulf of Mexico where seasonal oxygen levels drop too low to support most life in bottom and near - bottom waters .
Scientists are predicting the area could measure between 7,450 and 8,456 square miles , or an area roughly the size of New Jersey .
However , additional flooding of the Mississippi River since May may result in a larger dead zone .
The largest one on record occurred in 2002 , measuring 8,484 square miles .
Dead zones are caused by nutrient runoff , principally from agricultural activity , which stimulates an overgrowth of algae that sinks , decomposes , and consumes most of the life - giving oxygen supply in the water .
The dead zone size was predicted after researchers observed large amounts of nitrogen feeding into the Gulf from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers .
The rivers experienced heavy water flows in April and May that were 11 percent above average .
" The high water volume flows coupled with nearly triple the nitrogen concentrations in these rivers over the past 50 years from human activities has led to a dramatic increase in the size of the dead zone , " said Gene Turner , Ph.D. , a lead forecast modeler from Louisiana State University .
This forecast helps coastal managers , policy makers , and the public better understand and combat the sources of the dead zones .
For example , the models that generate this forecast have been used to determine nutrient reduction targets required to reduce the size of the dead zone .
This hypoxic , or low - to - no oxygen area , is of particular concern because it threatens valuable commercial and recreational Gulf fisheries by destroying critical habitat .
" As with weather forecasts , this forecast uses multiple models to predict the range of the expected size of the dead zone .
The strong track record of these models reinforces our confidence in the link between excess nutrients from the Mississippi River and the dead zone , " said Robert Magnien , Ph.D. , director of NOAA 's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research .
" This advanced warning is just one example of NOAA 's growing ecological forecasting capabilities that allow managers to protect valuable resources and coastal economies in a proactive manner . "
NOAA has been funding investigations and forecast development for the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico since 1990 and currently oversees the two national hypoxia programs authorized by the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act.
Data from the U.S. Geological Survey on river flow and nutrient concentrations this spring was critical information required by the models to produce the forecasts .
An announcement of the official size of the 2009 hypoxic zone , which is an annual requirement of the Gulf of Mexico Task Force Action Plan , will follow a NOAA - supported monitoring survey led by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium on July 18 - 26 .
In addition , NOAA 's Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program currently is providing near real - time data on the hypoxic zone during a five - week NOAA Fisheries Service summer fish survey in the northern Gulf of Mexico between June 8 and July 18 .
The information is available on the NOAA 's Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Watch Web page .
The objective of Hypoxia Watch is to develop new near - real - time data and map products using shipboard measurements of bottom - dissolved oxygen and to disseminate them over the Internet .
These products form the basis for summertime advisories to fishermen in the North - central Gulf of Mexico , indicating where fish and other living marine resources may not be found due to low or non-existent oxygen levels .

Israeli police deliver East Jerusalem demolition orders Ma'an News August 5 , 2009
Jerusalem � Ma�an � Eight Palestinians were injured when they were assaulted by Israeli forces who delivered demolition orders in the Al - Bustan neighborhood of East Jerusalem on Wednesday .
Jerusalem Police used tear gas to disperse residents who confronted the Israeli officers serving five demolition orders in the densely populated neighborhood , where there are already 90 standing demolition orders .
Israeli police also seized the ID card of Musa Odeh , a member of the Al - Bustan Committee , a popular organization dedicated to peacefully opposing the demolitions .
Al - Bustan is part of the Silwan area , in a valley next to Jerusalem�s Old City .
The Israeli - controlled Jerusalem municipal government says it intends to level the neighborhood and build a park .
Israeli authorities contend the Palestinian houses were built without construction permits , which are rarely issued to Palestinians .
Some of the structures , however , were built before Israel occupied and annexed East Jerusalem in 1967 .
The international community does not recognize Israeli control over East Jerusalem , which is part of the West Bank .

Spaniard Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara gave birth to twin boys in 2006 , at age 66 , said Jacob Appel in The Huffington Post , controversially becoming the oldest confirmed mother in the world .
Her recent death , before her sons ’ third birthday , will likely renew debate on the “ ethics of offering in vitro fertilization to women in their 60s and 70s . ”
But if we have no trouble accepting octogenarian fathers , why a double standard for women ?
For one thing , giving birth puts women ’s health at risk , said Cassandra Jardine in Britain ’s Telegraph , and high - estrogen fertilization treatments might well increase the incidence of some types of cancer .
Bousada de Lara ’s fatal cancer may not have been related to her “ late , hormonally - induced motherhood , ” but even cancer - free it 's unlikely she would have survived to see her boys grow up .
She gambled on living to 101 , she lost , and someone else " will now have to care for her 2 - year - old twins . ”
It ’s “ a terrible shame that two children have lost their mother , ” said Sarah Vine in The Times of London , “ but that does not mean they should never have been born . ”
Presumably , Bousada de Lara was a better mom than a younger woman who is a child molester would be .
And if you cut off a woman from giving birth at 66 , “ where do you stop ? ” Smokers ?
Female soldiers ?
Policewomen ?
This “ wave of moral outrage ” could take us to some pretty uncomfortable places .
Without words , cameras show us the world , with an emphasis not on " where , " but on " what 's there . "
It begins with morning , natural landscapes and people at prayer : volcanoes , water falls , veldts , and forests ; several hundred Balinese Hindu men perform kecak , the monkey chant .
Indigenous peoples apply body paint ; whole villages dance .
The film moves to destruction of nature via logging , blasting , and strip mining .
Images of poverty , rapid urban life , and factories give way to war , concentration camps , and mass graves .
Ancient ruins come into view , and then a sacred river where pilgrims bathe and funeral pyres burn .
Prayer and nature return .
A monk rings a huge bell ; stars wheel across the sky .

Cain diagnoses the woman 's problem as " Oh My God , I'm Gonna Puke " ( O.M.G.I.G.P ) syndrome .
The type of content on the computer is not detailed but , due to the nature of the woman 's reaction , some have interpreted the ad as alluding to child pornography .
Taken to the extreme , the ad could be seen by some as Microsoft offering tips on how to browse such material without getting caught by a spouse .
The ad , which only ran online and was described by one veteran technology commentator as the " worst tech commercial ever " , was directed by comedian Bob Goldthwait , who starred in the Police Academy series of films .
Goldthwait made three other IE8 commercials for Microsoft , all featuring Cain as public service announcer , including " S.H.Y.N.E.S.S. " ( Sharing Heavily Yet Not Enough Sharing Still ) , " F.O.M.S " ( Fear Of Missing Something ) and " G.R.I.P.E.S " ( Gripping Rage Internet Pathetically Extra Slow ' ) .
In an interview with the TechFlash website , Goldthwait said the series of ads were the first commercials he had ever directed .
" I think they were trying to do something that was a little less mainstream , and I think that 's ( what led to ) my involvement , " Goldthwait said .
In a statement , Microsoft said the OMGIGP ad was intended to be a " tongue - in- cheek " look at IE8's InPrivate Browsing feature using " irreverent humour " .
" While much of the feedback to this particular piece of creative was positive , some of our customers found it offensive , so we have removed it , " the company said .
Microsoft has removed the ad from its official YouTube channel , its own website and its ad agency 's website , but it has already been re-published by other YouTube users .
Microsoft , after incurring significant damage to its brand from Apple 's " I'm a Mac , I 'm a PC " ad campaign , has attempted to retaliate in recent months with edgy but bizarre commercials .
Loading
Last last year it launched a $ US300 million ad campaign to spruce up Windows Vista 's image , which featured comedian Jerry Seinfeld , actress Eva Longoria , singer Pharrell Williams and even the author Deepak Chopra .
Those ads received significant media coverage but they were heavily criticised for being too abstract and not funny enough .
Ignorance about Laissez - Faire Persists
After writing a cathartic piece on misuse of the term laissez - faire , I did n’t expect to return to this topic for a while .
But then William Pesek wrote this Bloomberg editorial .
So I resume my effort to correct the anti-free - market crowd .
Let ’s start with a basic definition :
Laissez Faire :
To allow events to take their own course , or to let people do what they choose .
The term is a French phrase literally meaning “ let do ” or “ leave it to be ” .
[ link ]
Mr. Pesek describes Alan Greenspan ’s policies as both free - market and laissez - faire :
It ’s to show that central bankers are full of bunk when they say bubbles ca n’t be identified .
This is blasphemy to free - market fundamentalists .
Yet why did Yale University ’s Robert Shiller see what the Greenspans of the world either could n’t or refused to ?
The world could learn from Singapore ’s speculation - management efforts .
The U.S. can learn the most .
This suggestion may raise blood pressures in the laissez - faire crowd .
Laissez - faire means NOT interfering with markets .
How does he reconcile this with Greenspan ’s actions ?
It ’s hard to know where to start .
First , free - market economists ( Austrian mostly ) are among the few who predicted this bubble .
Go look at the archives of Mises.org , you ’ll find hundreds of warnings .
Heck , they go back to Mises ’ warnings before the Great Depression .
Second , Greenspan was a monetarist , the polar opposite of free or Austrian economists .
The Greenspan Put
I refer Mr. Pesek and others to a concept known as the Greenspan Put .
The fact that Greenspan would bail out banks and others was so well - known on Wall St that it got its own phrase .
What effect does this assurance have on the markets ?
It encourages speculation and recklessness , of course .
This knowledge , combined with low interest rates led to many bubbles .
More on the put from wiki :
The Fed ’s pattern of providing ample liquidity resulted in the investor perception of put protection on asset prices .
Investors increasingly believed that when things go bad , the Fed would step in and inject liquidity until the problem got better .
Invariably , the Fed did so each time , and the perception became firmly embedded in asset pricing in the form of higher valuation , narrower credit spreads , and excess risk taking .
[ 1]
It has been criticized as a form of privatizing profits and socializing losses , and as inflating a speculative bubble in the lead - up to the 2008 financial crisis .
[ link ]
In a free market , companies would fail .
Cheap money would not be shoveled to banks when the economy sours ( most likely due to previous interventions ) , leading to reckless lending and malinvestment .
So why on earth do people think Greenspan practiced laissez - faire policies ?
He grossly interfered with free - market function .
Yes , Greenspan did fail at regulation .
But that does not mean he favors free markets .
Greenspan was pretty “ free - market ” , in 1968
At one point in his life , Greenspan fought against inflationary Federal Reserve policies .
His 1968 essay “ Gold and Economic Freedom ” is a must - read .
But something changed .
He went in a truly opposite direction .
You ca n’t call the drastic government interventional policies he practiced “ free ” in any way , shape , or form .
This concept keyboard plays on our love of , or at least interest in , marketing by replacing all the letters with logos of corporations whose name begins with said letter .
I seriously just spend five minutes picking them all out .

The idea is that brands are so recognizable that we can exchange them with letters , probably the most recognizable symbols we know .
It works , too , if you give it a second , although some of them are tricky ( The Rolling Stones is only a corporation in the most cynical of senses ) .
It does n't actually exist , but it 's a fun little experiment .

Iran says Britain has been stoking unrest since the elections
Three more Iranian British embassy staff have been released by the authorities in Tehran , Iran 's state - run Press TV reports .
Nine embassy employees were detained at the weekend and Press TV said all but one had now been freed .
However , the UK Foreign Office said two people had been freed and it was seeking confirmation on the third .
Iran said the staff had had a role in protests against the disputed presidential election result .
In a statement , the British Foreign Office said it could confirm that two of its staff had been released over the last two days " We are also seeking confirmation following Iranian reports that a further member of staff has been released today . "
The statement said its top priority was ensuring the release of all staff and that said it was continuing " intensive discussions with the Iranian authorities and our international partners to resolve this issue " .
' Remarkable role ' Earlier , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown had again expressed " deep disappointment " at the Iranian authorities ' conduct .
There is a deep - rooted belief in Iran that Britain is always up to something , is never passive and always devious

UK and Iran 's fraught history
He told a news conference at Downing Street on Wednesday that Iran was trying to blame its post-election protests on Britain .
" This action is unjustified and it is unacceptable and some people in Iran are trying to seek to use Britain as an explanation for the legitimate Iranian voices calling for greater openness and democracy , " he said .
The state media 's announcement that three more staff had been released comes after five of their colleagues were freed Monday .
Iran 's semi-official
Fars television station reported that one of the detainees had played a " remarkable role during the recent unrest in managing it behind the scenes " .
Britain had strongly protested against the arrests , with Foreign Secretary David Miliband saying they were " completely contrary to the sort of good political engagement that Iran says that it wants " .
There was no immediate response from Britain to the latest reports of releases .
Questions remains Tehran has repeatedly accused foreign powers - especially Britain and the US - of meddling after the election .
Maj Gen Hassan Firouzabadi , Iran 's top military officer , said on Wednesday that until Europe apologised for what he called this " huge mistake " it could no longer participate in talks on Iran 's controversial nuclear programme .
The BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says the release of the staff will go some way to repairing damaged ties between Iran and the European Union .
But many questions still remain over how the West should deal with Iran in the post- election unrest which left at least 17 people dead , says our correspondent .
EU governments have considered temporarily withdrawing their ambassadors to Iran in protest and will be seeking to ensure the remaining embassy staff member is released .
The problem is that western countries must continue to talk to Iran about its nuclear programme , and Iran would also use any external pressure as proof of interference in its affairs , our correspondent adds .

Where Google Loses
Besides a cloud of smoke , sticky keyboards , and the incessant sound of noodle - slurping , nearly every Internet cafe in China has one thing in common :
All home pages are set to Baidu.com , China ’s dominant search engine .
It ’s not a coincidence , or even a matter of preference .
Back in 2005 , when Baidu was just a start - up , company representatives traveled through China persuading Internet cafe owners from Beijing to Kunming to install its toolbar and home page .
In addition , it set up alliances with dozens of Internet directory sites , where most first - time Internet users in China start surfing .
Now , the vast majority of the online population uses Internet cafes — and the vast majority of searches go through Baidu .
Simply put , Baidu knows China .
And Google can’t seem to catch up or catch on .
Baidu ’s overwhelming dominance comes down to Google ’s woeful ineptness at adjusting to Chinese market realities .
Google entered the Chinese market and treated it like any other .
But , from the beginning , Baidu operated as a Chinese company , using Chinese strategies and tailoring itself for Chinese needs .
Thus , in terms of dealing with the government , popularizing the brand , making sales , and offering the masses what they want , Baidu bests Google .
The Beijing - based search engine ( whose name means " hundreds of times , " after a line in an 800 - year - old poem ) maintains an astounding 70 percent market share .
California - based Google trails far behind , with only about 25 percent .
As China now has the world ’s largest ( and fastest - growing ) Internet community , with 338 million users , market dominance means a whole lot of profit , both now and in the future .
The business world has cottoned on .
Baidu ’s price - to - earnings ratio , a good way to gauge investors ’ expectations for growth , is double Google ’s .
( Baidu has been listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange since August 2005 . )
This is in part because China ’s Internet saturation is only about 25 percent , compared with more than 75 percent on average in OECD countries , like the United States .
Meanwhile , Baidu ’s net income is increasing wildly : 40 percent year - on - year , compared with 18 percent for Google .
Every indication points to fast growth and lucrative profit .
The secret to Baidu ’s success — and Google ’s failure — is largely positioning .
First , Baidu has managed to win Beijing ’s favor , a trump card in this command economy .
The government controls the Internet and appreciates loyal partners .
Baidu understands that it operates under the good graces of the Chinese Communist Party , and continues to show it .
As Robin Li , the company ’s chief executive , said in an interview with the Guardian , " As a locally operated company we need to obey the Chinese law .
If the law determines that certain information is illegal , we need to remove it from our index . "
Google also allows its content to be censored .
But it does so reluctantly and poorly , compared with Baidu and its army of Chinese programmers .
From a Chinese Internet cafe , a search for " Tiananmen June 4 " written in Chinese characters — perhaps the most taboo combination one could create — yields 915,000 results on Google China .
It gets just 11,300 results , 99 percent less , on Baidu .
Type in " harmonious society , " a government catchphrase , and Google gets just over 10 million results .
Baidu gets 18 million .
Deference has certainly helped Baidu .
Earlier this year , Chinese authorities temporarily blocked Google because it allowed through some pornographic search results .
But many of these same results were also available on Baidu — and in fact an industry insider told me that the large majority of traffic to Baidu ’s new Japan site comes from mainland users searching for pornography .
The implication is that the government has Baidu ’s back .
" You definitely get a feeling that the government would give Baidu a bit more time to fix a problem than they would give Google , " explained Ian McGuinn , director at leading Chinese market research firm JLM Pacific Epoch .
" It would be very interesting to see whether the government would try to keep Google from ever getting a majority of the market share .
They ’ve messed with Google before when they forbid it from having its servers in China .
Searching on Google was incredibly slow , so nobody wanted to use it . "
On one of the most contentious issues for search engines — intellectual property rights and illegal downloading — the government and Baidu are on the same page as well .
Baidu connects users with sites through which they can illegally obtain music .
It also allows users to search directly for and illicitly download MP3s .
The Chinese government sometimes gestures toward stopping the practice , but never really does .
Recently , for instance , the Ministry of Culture released a circular on illegal downloading .
But the document focused on regulations for music itself , requiring posted songs to receive approval and foreign lyrics to be translated into Chinese , for instance .
Plus , the Ministry of Culture does n’t even deal with intellectual property protection .
May - seey Leong , Asia regional director for the worldwide music industry trade group International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , explained .
" It ’s not even a regulation , " she said .
" It ’s just a lower - level circular and it principally seems to be trying to control content on digital platforms , " i.e. , so that the government can censor that content .
Simple hometown favoritism seems to have protected Baidu from copyright infringement lawsuits thus far .
In 2005 , several U.S. - based music companies sued Baidu , but inexplicably lost .
In 2006 , they sued Yahoo China , an American - based company , and won .
( The verdicts were released on the same day . )
And the record companies ’ current lawsuit against Baidu seems to be going nowhere .
Leong complained that after nearly two years of legal battles , no verdict has been returned .
Even if the lawsuit is somehow successful , the record companies are seeking only $ 9.7 million in damages , a drop in the bucket for Baidu .
Not that a shutdown of Baidu ’s MP3 search engine would make a big difference anyway — it ’s not driving the company ’s revenue .
Baidu puts banner ads only on its MP3 search , whereas according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings , 99.8 percent of its advertising revenue comes from pay - for - placement ads , where advertisers bid for the right to present an advertisement next to specifically searched keywords .
The government allowed Baidu to operate its illegal music search just long enough to attract a huge user base .
Now even if the MP3 search disappears , the users are likely to stay , along with the advertisers .
" Very early on , when Baidu was just starting as a search engine , they used music as a tool to gain market share , " said T.R. Harrington , a partner at Darwin Marketing , a China - based firm that helps companies optimize their search engine marketing .
" Now , they are making next to nothing on their music searches because advertisers realize that users are going only to download music , so not many people want to advertise on that part of the site .
They are making almost all their money on keyword advertising , which is also the case for Google . "
Also , Baidu is continually rolling out products that focus on creating a social community .
Its new Baidu Zhidao ( " Baidu Knows " ) service allows users to answer each other ’s questions about everything from restaurants to when track superstar Liu Xiang will finally recover from his injury .
And Baidu Tieba , a kind of chat room , now accounts for 14 percent of the site ’s traffic .
Creating a social community is a way of ensuring Baidu ’s long - term dominance .
Unlike in the United States , where people primarily use the Internet for gathering information , in China people first and foremost use the Internet as a social device .
" Two years ago , [ music search ] was where the business was , a lot more than where it is today , " explained McGuinn at JLM Pacific Epoch .
" In the past two years , Baidu has added a lot of products .
People go to Baidu for a lot of other reasons than just music , and I doubt that is going to change anytime soon . "
Indeed , Baidu ’s entire business strategy is tailored to Chinese governmental , legal , business , and social culture — and that is what has set it apart from Google .
Take , for instance , advertising .
" Once Baidu went public , they invested in brand advertising , something that Google has just been arrogant in their reluctance in a growing market to invest in any kind of advertising to increase their brand awareness , " explained Harrington .
" Baidu went into all the smaller cities and put up billboards , bus ads , and even commercials on [ state television ] . "
In fact , analysts think that in smaller cities , Baidu ’s market share could be more than 90 percent .
Although Google might be one of the most well - known brand names in the world , most people outside big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have never heard of it , let alone know how to spell it .
( Google is apparently catching on — it recently purchased www.g.cn and starting placing advertisements . )
The same goes for Baidu ’s sales force .
The company has employed thousands of people throughout China to entice small and medium - sized companies to buy keywords .
Google has only about 500 people doing the same in the entire billion - person country , and the Chinese sales force has little autonomy , despite many proclamations to the contrary .
" The Google model has historically relied more on technology for sales .
Having a large sales force has definitely helped Baidu a lot .
They are getting people online for the first time , " McGuinn said .
The combination of a great market strategy and government favoritism means that Baidu will likely not fall from the top , despite the potential loss of its music search site .
This is especially true if Google keeps on quarterbacking from California , which is now even more likely since the surprise resignation of its powerful China president , Lee Kai - Fu .
Google might dominate almost everywhere else , but in China , Baidu is set to stay king .
NEW YORK -- Andy Kessler , a trailblazer during New York
City 's nascent 1970s skateboarding scene and a designer of skate
parks who was admired by boarders on both coasts , died Monday .
He
was 48 .
Kessler died after suffering a heart attack following an
allergic reaction to a wasp sting , Moose Huerta , a close friend and
fellow skateboarder , said Thursday .
He was dismantling old wood on a shack in Montauk , Long Island ,
when he was stung , said Tony Farmer , a skateboarding friend and
West Coast native who now lives in Brooklyn .
Andy Kessler was an early pioneer in the New York skateboard scene .

Kessler got his start in the 1970s with a loose - knit group of
skateboarders and graffiti artists known as the Soul Artists of Zoo
York .
They skated all over Manhattan 's Upper West Side , where
Kessler lived .
Central Park 's Bandshell was a favorite spot .
In the 1990s , Kessler persuaded the city 's Parks Department to
build a skateboard facility in Riverside Park .
He went on to design
other skate parks in Manhattan , Brooklyn and Montauk .
Huerta said Kessler also developed a zeal for surfing in the
past decade .
" The two groups are completely different from each other , " he
said .
" But the level of friends , and how he transcended age and
demographics with the people he touched , was amazing . "
Kessler had no health insurance in 2005 when he took a spill on
his board and dislocated his femur .
When he was unable to pay a
$ 51,000 medical bill , several dozen surfers , skaters and artists --
Julian Schnabel , Mickey Eskimo , Zephyr and Wes Humpston reportedly
among them -- helped raise the money with a benefit party , Farmer
said .
When he healed from the injury , he hopped back on his board ,
Farmer said .
" Flowing through traffic , timing lights , shooting reds , dodging
pedestrians ... dude just had the streets so wired , " Farmer said .
" Suffice to say , he was an amazing cat . "
Huerta , who was too young to have skated with Kessler during the
early days , said the sport started as " a counterculture activity "
but never carried the cache that California skateboarding did .
But
Kessler did n't care .
" He did it out of love , " he said .
" He did n't receive anything
out of it .
It spoke to him . "
In 2008 , Kessler was featured in a documentary , " From Deathbowl
to Downtown : The Evolution of Skateboarding in New York . "
The
producers , NCP Films , described it as " an anthropological overview
of skating 's epochal shift from the parks and pools of the 70's , to
ramp skating in the 80's , to the street ascendancy of the 1990's as
seen from a New York - centric perspective .
It is scheduled for international release on DVD on Sept. 15 .
In addition to his love for the sport , Huerta said Kessler's
first big success was orchestrating the building of the city 's
first skate park , near the Hudson River .
At the time of his death ,
he was trying to update the Montauk skate park he had designed
about a decade earlier , Huerta said .
On Friday evening , surfers planned to paddle out together and
circle around Ditch Plains Beach in Montauk in remembrance of
Kessler , Huerta said .
Friends also planned a get - together Saturday
at the Autumn Bowl , a semiprivate warehouse facility in Brooklyn
that was one of Kessler 's favorite hangouts .
Kessler 's burial is scheduled for Sunday at Cedar Park Cemetery
in Paramus , N.J .
The second officer on the scene , Trooper Michael McKeon , then tried to remove Jackson through the driver side door of the car , but Jackson , who had just been Tasered , jumped into the back seat , fled out a rear door and ran into the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge , the affidavit said .
Fetim Sallem .
A documentary on Western Sahara refugees marks a low point , Kamal Fadel writes .
July 1 , 2009 -- Last month in Sydney , the notion of democracy took a pounding .
The launch of the documentary Stolen at the Sydney Film Festival marked a low point in local film culture , and signified the tenuous grip on truth we now have in contemporary society .
That such a film should be financed with about A$ 350,000 of public money –- through Screen Australia -– and accepted by the prestigious festival raises questions about the nature of reality and on how it is depicted in mainstream media , such as through the medium of the film documentary .
The film purports , in a sensationalistic way , to reveal widespread evidence of racially based slavery in the Saharawi refugee camps on the Western Sahara - Algeria border .
Central to the apparent scoop is an interview with Fetim Sallem , a 36 - year - old mother of four .
She was in Australia to explain her story , which is significantly at odds with the film 's take on it ( so much so that Fetim requested unsuccessfully to have her interviews removed from the film ) .
Rather than verifying shaky claims of slavery and then seeking out the source of this possible ill ( say in the repressive environment the Saharawi people have endured since the illegal invasion by Moroccan forces in 1975 , an event that sent many into the camps that still exist today ) , the filmmakers of Stolen chose to conflate a few ill - gotten and misunderstood accusations into a tabloid expose .
The approach of the film - makers challenges the very basis of the documentary genre and undermines its value as a means of serious scrutiny .
In an age when reality TV is nothing of the sort and when celebrity gossip is considered hard news , this is perhaps not surprising .
But it is disappointing and very distressing for those who , like Fetim , are vilified in the process .
There are fundamental flaws in the film - makers ' storyboard .
Fetim is not a slave and widespread slavery simply does not exist in the Saharawi refugee camps .
This fact has been confirmed by numerous visits by independent journalists and human rights reporters over the years .
A member of a delegation sent by Human Rights Watch to investigate the film - makers ' claims said the delegation ‘‘ did not find evidence of forced labour , certainly not of slavery of the kind ’’ in 19th century America .
The Saharawi live under great strain and considerable duress , brought about by decades of foreign occupation .
A generation has grown up in a refugee environment .
Our society is not perfect , our situation not Utopian .
None is .
But , slavery is something Polisario abhors and is on the record as opposing .
The practice is an unacceptable cultural anachronism and we have outlawed it completely since the inception of our independence movement in 1973 .
Polisario has worked hard to address whatever human rights issues we find in our midst and we continue to undermine all forms of abuse and restrictions on liberty .
This year , Polisario openly lobbied hard for the United Nations mandate to include a human rights monitoring process in its mission in Western Sahara .
This was quashed by France , an erstwhile supporter of the Moroccan occupiers in Western Sahara , using its veto power in the Security Council .
The biggest threat to human rights in Western Sahara is the illegal Moroccan occupation and the failure of the international system –- epitomised by France 's blocking actions .
These weaknesses ensure the Saharawi remain trapped in a nightmare of Realpolitik , driven to some extent by Morocco 's vast propaganda machine .
The simple desire , backed by UN resolutions , to allow the Saharawi the right to decide their fate ( independence or autonomy under Moroccan administration ) in a free and fair referendum remains , inexplicably , unrealised .
Reality is clearly a fungible commodity in the eyes of the makers of this film , for its backers and for the festival organisers .
They are reflective of a wider crisis in the ability to discern truth from fiction .
They are not alone .
There has been a negative impact on the life of Fetim Sallem by the actions of the film - makers and also on the cause of independence in Western Sahara .
That ’s a reality no one can challenge .

Fetim Sellami : ‘ I am not a slave ’
By Tony Iltis
June 21 , 2009 -- Saharawi refugee and preschool teacher Fetim Sellami is a central character in the Australian - made documentary Stolen , a film set in the refugee camps in south - west Algeria that have been home to 165,000 Saharawi refugees since their country , Western Sahara , was invaded by Morocco in 1975 .
However , when she and her husband , Baba Hocine Mahfoud , attended its June 11 premiere at the Sydney Film Festival , they did not receive red carpet treatment , despite the long distance they had travelled .
Stolen alleges that slavery is widespread in the camps and that Sellami and her family are slaves .
She came to Australia to expose the film as a fraud .
“ The film - makers were surprised , but not happy , to see me because they knew I ’d tell the truth ” , she told Green Left Weekly .
She said she felt personally betrayed .
“ I believed the film - makers ’ good intentions and I treated them well … I opened my house and my heart to them … I felt very bad [ that ] my dignity was attacked with baseless allegations . ”
Moreover , she was concerned the film undermined the cause of the Saharawi people ’s struggle against the Moroccan occupation .
“ Morocco has taken advantage of the film ’s allegations [ which are ] the first time ever allegations of slavery in the camps have been made . ”
She said that the film ’s co-directors , Violetta Ayala and Dan Fallshaw , had led her to believe they were making “ a documentary on family separation , a film about the story of my [ UN - facilitated ] reunion with my mother , which would help the cause of Western Sahara , highlighting the suffering caused by the Moroccan occupation ” .
However , “ on their second visit I began to realise they ’d changed course .
They started asking questions about slavery …
I ’m not sure whether they came up with the idea themselves or had external influence ” .
She sent a signed statement to the film - makers , withdrawing her consent to be featured in the documentary .
The film - makers ignored her wishes , claiming she was being manipulated by the Saharawi independence movement , Polisario , which runs the camps .
She then sent a video statement to Screen Australia , which funded the film a A$ 300,000 public grant .
But again her statement was ignored .
The true story of Sellami ’s separation from her mother is typical of the Saharawi experience .
She was three years old and at a neighbour ’s house when the brutal Moroccan invasion occurred .
Her mother was out of town and the neighbour , a woman called Deido , took Sellami with her when she fled the invaders , effectively becoming her foster mother .
Deido left behind her own three - year - old daughter who happened to be with Deido ’s mother at the time of the invasion .
However , in a synopsis posted on the Documentary Australia Foundation ’s website in September 2008 , Ayala and Fallshaw claimed “ it was n’t the territorial conflict that separated Fetim from her mother .
Fetim was born a slave . ”
They claimed black Saharawi are held as slaves by their lighter - skinned compatriots who “ made the decision to flee to the refugee camps in Algeria taking their slaves with them , separating the black families once again ” .
Ayala and Fallshaw ’s cinematographer , Carlos Gonzalez disputed the allegations .
“ During the three weeks I spent there with them I saw absolutely no indication of slavery ” , he told the 7.30 Report on June 15 .
He returned to the camps by himself and spoke to members of Sellami ’s family who said they had been misquoted and mistranslated .
Some black Saharawi men said the film - makers had paid them to say they were slaves on camera .
“ No , we did n’t pay them any money ” , Ayala told the 7.30 Report , but then conceded : “ Like , we gave them money when they came to Mauritania , we gave them money to go back to the camps . ”
She gave no explanation as to why slaves would want money to return to their cruel masters .
She also denied dialogue in the film had been mistranslated .
However , the 7.30 Report had sequences of the film translated by Al Jazeera television .
In one scene , in which the film - makers ’ subtitles show Sellami ’s mother and sister confirming that she is a slave , the Al Jazeera translation shows that they were in fact discussing the film - makers ’ misconceptions on the issue .
How involved the Moroccan dictatorship was in making the film is unclear .
However , Ayala and Fallshaw admit that some of the footage was transported in Moroccan diplomatic bags .
The film ’s co-directors , and producer Tom Zubrycki , accused the film ’s critics — including Sellami , Mahfoud and Gonzalez — of being manipulated by Polisario .
They imply Polisario is complicit in slavery .
GLW journalist Margarita Windisch visited the camps in 2008 as part of a delegation to the congress of the Saharawi trade union confederation , UGTSARIO .
She told GLW : “ I certainly saw no evidence of slavery .
If they wanted to make a film about slavery perhaps they should have investigated conditions of phosphate workers in the Moroccan - occupied zone .
Australian companies are involved in this . ”
Sellami and Mahfoud ’s real lives give credence to Polisario ’s claim to have the best - run refugee camps in the world .
Mahfoud studied electronic engineering in Cuba and now works in Madrid .
One of their four children has studied in Spain .
The family spend their holidays together , either in Spain or in the camps .
Their level of international travel should dispel any notion that they are slaves .
When Sellami and Mahfoud confronted Ayala and Fallshaw during the question - and - answer session at the premiere , they were jeered and heckled by the film - makers ’ supporters .
“ This film is the worst thing that ’s ever been made on Western Sahara , a big lie ” , Sellami told GLW .
“ If the film - makers wanted fame or money they should have tried in an honourable way . ”

The London Paper is given to commuters without charge and is an example of the " free economy " , but it is closing .
Is this the death knell for the idea that we are entering a world where time and recommendations are traded instead of notes and coins ?
On James O'Malley 's personal blog , you 'll see an unusual plea : " Enjoy my blog ?
Then stop freeloading and help me pay my rent . "
We tend to take for granted the notion that we do n't pay for what we consume on the web .
The idea that one day everything will become free , in money terms at least , was started by Lawrence Lessig in 2005 , with his book Free Culture .
This year , an online debate began between what the Times has labelled two heavyweight " pop - thinkers " about the future of getting the internet for nothing .
In the New Yorker Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame has been laying into the ideas expressed by the editor of Wired , Chris Anderson , in his book Free : The Future of a Radical Price .
The idea in Anderson 's book is that the money economy is on its way out as technology allows many things to be produced for almost nothing , leading to a flood of free goods .
Gladwell took exception to this , citing YouTube : a free service which makes hardly any money for Google who bought it in 2006 for $ 1.65 bn .
Gladwell says Anderson has not taken into account that although technology is almost free per user , when 75 million people use it , that pushes up the cost of almost free quite a bit .
This has caused an internet furore , with Seth Godin on Anderson 's side and , as Slashdot puts it , the Times awarding the prize to Gladwell on points .
The last word in this debate could go to Amazon - £ 8.54 is the price of Anderson 's book Free .
Then again , Gladwell 's article arguing that we could n't consume everything without paying for it directly , was free to look at on the New Yorker 's website .
PAYING FOR THE WEB
Many are used to using websites free - of - charge
A perfect example of changing morals can be seen in attitudes towards downloading music and films , and more generally what we 're prepared to pay for online - a topic discussed in Phil Gyford 's blog .
Mr Gyford ( he of Pepys ' Diary ) seriously considers which websites he would be prepared to pay for and lists just three - Daring Fireball , which puts together articles about Apple , Kottke , and David Smith 's Preoccupations .
The snarkmarket blog has been looking specifically at what the prospect of " free " would mean to people working in the liberal arts .
Guest writer Matt Penniman thinks eventually people will do fun jobs for nothing :
Now , in the previous economic paradigm , it was possible to do work that you would have done for less or for free and still be paid well for it , because it was too much trouble for your employers / clients to find someone who could do the work as well and for free .
But the internet drastically reduces that barrier .
Imagine trying to find people to write a computer operating system and all the associated applications without expecting payment before the internet - now look at Linux .
I wonder if we 're heading toward an economy where , to put it bluntly , people do n't get paid for doing fun things .
If something is fun - for someone in the world who finds it fun enough to become good at it , and to do it without expecting pay - it will no longer pay .
In the New York Times , a senior editor at Harper 's and author of And Then There 's This : How Stories Live and Die in Viral Culture , Bill Wasik backs up the idea of free work .
Wasik says that the annual migration of people aspiring to work in the creative industries to New York is no longer necessary .
Technology keeps the costs down , allowing people to work free :
" Wherever young creatives physically reside today , in their endeavors they are increasingly moving online : posting their photos , writing , videos and music , building a ' presence ' in the hope of winning an audience .
Monetary rewards on the Internet are still scarce , it is true , but the cost of living is cheap and , more important , the opportunities for attention are plentiful "
HIDDEN COSTS
Many news websites intend to start charging a subscription fee
Cory Doctorow , formerly of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and writing in the Guardian , disagrees with Gladwell 's reasoning but agrees with the conclusion - free is impossible - when considering future costs in combatting piracy , since it is so cheap for members of the public to copy material .
Where there 's change you 're likely to find resistance .
As the Guardian 's Polly Curtis has noted , the work - for - nothing trend has been highlighted by industry watchdogs .
Curtis has accused employers and MPs of exploiting work - for - free interns .
And as the Guardian 's FAQs explain , the nature of the work given to interns could mean that some employers should be paying them the minimum wage .
One point of view must be older than the idea itself - that the problem with offering labour free is that it leads to class discrimination in professions .
Jonn Elledge in The First Post gives his personal view on the issue :
I am a journalist .
I live in Islington .
I listen to Radio 4 .
I have even , in my darker moments , been known to talk about house prices .
I am , in fact , a symptom of the problem I am about to discuss , and what follows is quite appallingly hypocritical .
But I am going to say it anyway : the media is too middle class .
The rise of the unpaid internship is to blame .
And no - one seems willing to admit it .
The industries that are already offering free stuff are becoming reluctant to give away their goods for nothing .
The latest in the list is the London Paper .
Rupert Murdoch 's loss - making free evening newspaper is given out on street corners and outside train stations free - of - charge to commuters on their way home but has announced its closure .
Murdoch 's News International previously announced its intention to introduce charging to all his news websites , including those for The Times , The Sunday Times , The Sun and the News of the World , by next summer .
This casts a shadow on the prediction that we will stop paying directly for our products .
Tracing the inauspicious history of the global gag rule can
feel like watching a game of high - stakes Ping - Pong .
In 1984 , Republican President Reagan instates
the rule , which forbids family planning organizations who receive US
foreign aid from performing abortions , discussing safe abortion as an option
with patients , or advocating for abortion law liberalization or reform in their
own countries – even if they use other funds for those activities .
Republican President Bush the First keeps it on the books ; Democratic
President Bill Clinton rescinds it on his first day in office .
Republican President Bush the Second
immediately reinstates the rule ; Democratic President Obama scraps it .
Women ’s health advocates were delighted when
Obama got rid of the global gag rule , but a nagging – and none too
insignificant – concern remained : what about four , or eight , years from now ,
when Obama is no longer be in office and his successor sees fit to bring the
gag rule back ?
During the Senate Appropriations Committee mark - up
yesterday , Senator Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) proposed an amendment to the foreign
aid appropriations bill that would permanently negate the global gag rule by
stipulating that foreign NGOs should not be disqualified from receiving US
family planning assistance based on their providing services that are
permissible in their own countries and legal here .
The amendment passed the committee , 17 to 11 ,
with one member voting present .
In
introducing the amendment , Sen. Lautenberg argued that the gag rule forces NGOs
abroad to " lose out on badly needed funds , or take the money and sacrifice
their responsibility to their patients . "
And , he added , it " creates no choice for the women who are forced to go
without the care they need to be healthy . "
" This is not something that should flip - flop depending on
who ’s president , " says Susan Cohen , Director of Government Affairs for the
Guttmacher Institute .
" It so affects family planning that we need to provide
stability and predictability to be most efficient and effective .
And since this is the policy of the President
and Congress , we should write it into law . "
In debate over the amendment , Senator Sam Brownback ( R-KS )
predictably implied that the amendment would provide taxpayer funding for
abortion abroad , when in fact the Helms Amendment , which is unaffected by this
legislation , has long banned foreign aid funding for abortion .

Cohen believes that the full Senate has the votes to pass
the amendment , citing the resounding defeat that greeted Sen .
Mel Martinez ’s ( R - FL ) attempt to reinstate legislatively the global gag
rule after Obama rescinded it in late January , when 60 senators voted to keep
the gag rule off foreign aid funding .
The appropriations bill itself also allocates an increase in
family planning funding , to $ 628 million , of which $ 50 million would fund
UNFPA , the UN family planning agency .
The House allocates slightly higher levels , and the two amounts will be
reconciled in conference committee .
Speaking of conference committee – the House ’s version of
the bill does not address the global gag rule .
Will that pose a problem for Lautenberg ’s amendment ?
Advocates are hopeful that Chair of State and Foreign
Operations Subcommittee Rep. Nita Lowey ( D - NY ) will protect this amendment , and
cite Lowey ’s co-sponsorship of a previous , parallel bill , the Global Democracy
Promotion Act , on which Lautenberg ’s amendment was based .
Remember the odd rumor from yesterday regarding a new Nikon pocket camera with a built - in projector ?
It turns out that it was spot on .
Today Nikon has announced the S1000pj , and along with a nice , big 2.7 ” screen , a 12.1 megapixel sensor , there ’s a VGA projector inside .
The camera looks to be a solid picture - taker , with a top ISO setting of 6400 ( at three megapixels ) , a 5 x zoom and both optical and electronic image stabilization , but the projector is the real story here , the first that we know of in a consumer camera .
It ’ll throw images of up to 40 - inches onto a wall up to two meters away , and comes with a remote control and stand to help .
Useful for impromptu slideshows , and quite excellent for playing back movies of , say , requests for intergalactic help .

This can be a little frustrating for melees in game , but the button does wear in well .
The scroll wheel also functions to look around .
Scrolling up , down as well as pivoting left and right will move the reticule accordingly .
A function button can be pressed and held while the scroll wheel is rotated to adjust the hardware sensitivity .
Making things too sensitive causes the mouse to lose some aim fidelity and becomes “ jumpy ” if taken to an extreme .
Experimenting with this feature as well as in game look sensitivity is a surefire way to boost the effectiveness .

A man has been diagnosed with clinical depression caused by his girlfriend constantly dragging him round on shopping trips .
Psychiatrists are treating Wu Cheng , 28 , who told them : " I ca n't even look at a shop now .
" Every time she tries to drag me to a mall my heart starts to pound , I 'm short of breath and I feel sick .
We have been going out for two years and at least 12 months of that time have been spent in shops .
She is obsessed . "
Wu 's girlfriend Zhang Keyi said from her home in Chongqing , central China : " When he 's better I promise we 'll only go to the shops once a week .
Except when the sales are on . "
Cycle of Justice UW Student Turns Craigslist Against Bike Thief
It 's not uncommon for bicycles to go missing on the University of Washington campus .
Fancy $ 5,000 road bikes , busted $ 50 beaters — all of them end up in the hands of thieves , and usually at a faster clip during the summer months , when more people ride instead of drive and bike lifters have plentiful prey .
Snipping through cable locks and snatching untended cycles , they make off with about 125 bikes annually , according to UW police .
What is incredibly uncommon is for one of these stolen bikes to be recovered — and even more uncommon is for such a bike to be recovered by a 25 - year - old bioengineering grad student who has taken the law into her own hands , stalked her stolen property on Craigslist , jawboned authorities in two states into action , and even tried to set up a Wal - Mart parking - lot sting operation , all to recover a Redline Conquest Pro ( a cyclo- cross bike ) that she bought used last fall for $ 850 .
" I 'm not one to give up easily , " explained the student , Michelle McCully .
When her ride disappeared on March 5 , McCully scoured local Craigslist postings , looking for the telltale signs that made her black road bike different from all the rest : white handlebar tape , black fenders , special pedals .
No luck .
She 'd already filed a report with the UW police ( " They basically told me I was out of luck and probably not going to find it " ) and passed on the bicycle 's serial number just in case ( " Gotta have a serial number , " said UW police sergeant Doug Schulz .
" It 's really tough to track down bikes without a serial number " ) .
No luck with that , either .
After a couple weeks , McCully felt she 'd probably hit a dead end .
It was a bummer for her .
" It 's hard to find a good bike for a price I 'm willing to pay , " she said .
McCully started looking for a replacement bike , including Craigslist bike - sale postings in the Portland area , hoping to find the perfect fit .
On March 26 , cruising the Portland Craigslist postings , she randomly stumbled across what she believed to be her stolen bike .
" I kind of started shaking and probably did n't stop for another 24 hours , " she said .
" I knew it was the bike .
I have no idea how I fell asleep that night . "
She called back the UW police , who recommended she ask the seller for high - resolution photos .
She called the Portland police , who told her nothing could be done unless she had the name of the seller and a location for an intended sale .
She e-mailed the seller from an address that masked her real identity , but she did n't hear back and grew increasingly antsy and frustrated .
Friends were enlisted to make offers .
Finally , in the late afternoon of the following day , the seller started replying .
It turned out he was planning to show the bike to a likely buyer at 8:00 p.m. that evening in Portland , but could be persuaded by the offer of an additional $ 50 to delay that meeting .
" I left work , grabbed a bus , went home , picked up my car , and grabbed a friend , " McCully said .
The sting was set for a Wal - Mart parking lot in Southeast Portland .
The two had about three and a half hours to get down there ( in rush hour ) , and McCully did n't even know if the Portland police would be there at the parking lot to back her up .
Racing down I - 5 , she and her friend used a cell phone to dial the Portland police and eventually convinced an officer to meet them .
It took a lot of doing , however , and ultimately McCully did n't make it to the sting at the appointed time .
When she reached the parking lot , the seller was nowhere to be found .
Undeterred , she set up a base of operations at a friend 's apartment and used the web to dig up information on the seller .
Using Google and reverse white pages against his e-mail address and phone number , she figured out enough information to entice the police into another sting .
" That would have been really cool , " she said .
" They would have put me in a bulletproof vest and all if I 'd gone and ID'd him . "
But when she finally made contact with him to set it up , still masking her real identity , it turned out he'd sold the bike the previous night .
No matter .
She 'd already posted all over Portland 's Craigslist pages warning people about the seller , and those posts lured him into contacting her , demanding she take down her warnings .
She played hardball and ended up with contact information for the person he'd sold the bike to .
That was all Portland police needed to find the bike , match it to McCully 's serial number , and open an investigation into whether the seller , now a " person of interest " according to Portland police spokesperson Mary Wheat , will face any charges .
A district attorney in Portland suggested McCully might belong on a detective squad rather than in a bioengineering lab .
Sergeant Schulz marveled at her " very resourceful " freelance police work .
And McCully , now satisfied that justice has been served , is back on her Conquest Pro .
Though it took quite a bit of time and gas money to get it back , she believes it was well worth the cost and effort .
" I mean , I like the bike , " she said .
" It fits me , it 's comfortable , and it 's exactly what I want . "
Britain 's leading fashion retailers are threatening to boycott Australian wool from sheep farmers who use the controversial practice of " mulesing " amid animal cruelty concerns .
The move follows an announcement that Australian wool producers have abandoned a promise to phase out the procedure by next year .
Next and Marks & Spencer are among major chains to condemn the decision as " totally unacceptable , " and have pledged to seek wool from non-mulesed Australian sheep , or from other countries .
Mulesing involves cutting off the skin around the buttocks of merino lambs , often without anaesthetic , to prevent " flystrike " , the infestation of blowfly maggots , which thrive in the folds of the sheep and eat into its flesh .
Wool farmers promised six years ago to phase out mulesing by December 2010 after threats of a global boycott , following a campaign by animal rights activists Peta , the US - based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
Now , Australian Wool Innovation ( AWI ) , the research and development body for the country 's wool industry , has said it is " unlikely " farmers will meet the target because alternatives to mulesing are not yet viable or cost - effective .
According to latest figures , around three - quarters of merino lambs – prized for their soft fleece – are mulesed at a few weeks old , about 20 million animals .
Traditionally , this is conducted without pain relief , though the industry is now introducing local anaesthesia amid fears of a worldwide movement against it .
The British Retail Consortium said it was " disappointed " at the announcement .
" Following consultation with the RSPCA ( UK ) , BRC members will , until the end of 2010 , seek wool from suppliers who provide flocks with pain relief when mulesing .
After this date , they will seek to use suppliers who do n't use mulesing – even if pain relief is provided . "
The Australian National Farmers ' Federation said mulesing remains the most " effective practical way to eliminate the risk of flystrike " .
Without it " up to three million sheep a year could die a slow and agonising death " .
The Australian RSPCA has accepted it as a necessary procedure , and the AWI said research showed without mulesing the risk of flystrike was 40 - 100 % , while mulesing reduced it to 1 - 3 % .
Clip mulesing has recently been introduced , where tight plastic clips cut off the blood supply to the sheep 's skin around the buttocks causing the flesh to eventually fall off .
But this , while said to be less painful , is still not acceptable to retailers .
" Next has expressed a preference for using non-mulesed and non-clip mulesed merino wool , " said a spokeswoman .
" As a result , Next will continue to source wool from Australia and other countries providing the welfare of the livestock is managed in line with our position statement . "
Its 2009 autumn collection has been sourced outside Australia , she added .
The industry is looking at a genetic solution , breeding wrinkles out of the sheep to produce lambs with a smooth , wool - free backside , known as " bare breech " .
Marks & Spencer has pledged to use only non-mulesed merino wool for suits in its menswear range after 2010 .
In a letter to Australian wool industry leaders , the high street store is said to have stressed the " 2010 deadline is not negotiable and loss of confidence in M&S wool products could well lead to widespread customer boycotting and loss of revenue for the whole supply chain " .
Other retailers to have voiced concerns include H&M , Hugo Boss , Nike , Gap and Liz Claiborne .
Australia is the world 's largest wool producer , with about 80 % of exports going to China .
Italy is Europe 's leading importer .
One major Chinese importer , the Sunshine Group , has now demanded an end to mulesing , threatening Australia 's status and offering opportunities to wool producers in South Africa , South America and New Zealand , – where the practise is not used .
" AWI have had six years to stop this horrific practice .
If it does not meet the 2010 deadline retailers around the world can be expected to take action by sourcing wool elsewhere , " said Poorva Joshipura , Peta 's European director of special projects .
AWI has said it has no power to impose the deadline , which was unlikely to be reached for " welfare reasons , based on scientific grounds " , and that sheep would suffer as a result .
The industry remained " committed " , however , to phasing out mulesing .
In the meantime , significant welfare advances had been made to lessen discomfort for the lambs , with clips , anaesthesia and in the surgical practise of mulesing , it said .
Mulesing : the horror behind the high street
Mulesing was devised by Australian farmer John Mules in the 1930s and is widespread in the country .
Sheep are susceptible to the Lucilia cuprina blowfly , attracted to urine and faeces caught in the fleece around the buttocks .
Heavily wrinkled Merino sheep are particularly vulnerable .
The larvae thrive in the sheep 's skin folds and burrow into the flesh of the animal , causing death in some cases .
Lambs are usually mulesed when a few weeks old .
The procedure involves slicing off skin in a crescent shape from each side of the buttocks .
Animal rights activists claim it takes four weeks for wounds to heal , causing pain and distress to the sheep .
Animal rights campaigners also claim mulesing would be unnecessary with improved animal husbandry .
Research is being carried out into intradermal injections , the injection of a compound which causes necrosis of the skin , leaving a scab which eventually falls off to reveal smooth , wool - free skin .
Research is also under way into new blowfly controls and genome mapping of the sheep blowfly .
Seeing anger where it does not exist can lead to trouble Teenage boys who get into trouble with the law may find it hard to interpret social cues in others , say researchers .
A Japanese study of 24 young offenders found they mistook facial expressions of disgust for anger more often than their peers .
In Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal , the researchers said this might lead them to see a situation as more hostile than it was .
One UK expert said the ability to read facial expressions was " fundamental " .
The team showed photos of faces expressing six basic emotions to 24 incarcerated young men and the same number of youths who had not been in trouble with the law .
Misrecognising an expression may lead to incorrectly feeling threatened and even to antisocial behaviour
Professor Karen Pine , University of Hertfordshire
The participants were asked to match each face with an emotion - anger , disgust , fear , happiness , sadness , or surprise .
Analysis showed the delinquent youths were more likely to mistake disgust for anger than their peers .
The researchers said it was the first real evidence that young offenders may have trouble distinguishing between disgust and anger .
But it supports previous work that showed children with conduct problems tend to perceive other emotions as anger .
And it has also been shown that juvenile delinquents often have short tempers and experience more intense anger than other children .
Hostility Study leader Wataru Sato from Kyoto University said : " This bias towards misrecognising other emotions as anger is particularly significant because anger appears to play an important role in delinquency .
" Taken together the data suggest that delinquents might be projecting their own heightened angry emotions onto others when they misperceive others ' negative , but not hostile , emotional states as anger . "
Professor Karen Pine , an expert in developmental psychology at the University of Hertfordshire , said the ability to " read " a person 's emotions from their facial expressions " is fundamental to us as social beings " .
Failure to understand an expression could lead to one feeling threatened without due cause , and even to antisocial behaviour , she added .
" This is consistent with previous evidence and has been shown to account for some conduct problems in children . "
But she stressed the latest findings should be interpreted with caution because errors were also made by the young men who had not been in trouble , albeit less frequently .
" The delinquents also had significantly lower IQs than the control group and this alone may have accounted for their poor performance on the task , " she added .

If Sonia Sotomayor , Obama 's nominee for the United States Supreme Court , is confirmed this summer , she will be the first Hispanic to serve on the court in the country 's history .
So obviously , conservatives are panicking .
Sotomayor is a 54 - year - old , self - described " Nuyorican " , a child of Puerto Rican immigrants who grew up in the Bronx .
Her father , a factory worker , died when she was nine ; her mother was a nurse who brought up Sonia and her younger brother by herself .
Sotomayor did n't speak fluent English until she was 10 , yet she went on to Princeton and Yale .
Now she may become the first woman of colour on the highest court in the land .
So far , so American Dream .
Or is it ?
Because she spent many years on the board of the Puerto Rican Legal Defence Fund , because one of her most prominent cases involved affirmative action , and because of some remarks she made about her Latina heritage at a university conference in 2001 , Sotomayor is being attacked as a " reverse racist " ( thanks to talk - show host Rush Limbaugh ) and as a " racist " plain and simple ( Newt Gingrich ) .
A former Republican congressman described the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza as a " Latino KKK " , and a writer at the conservative publication the National Review argued that Sotomayor was not fully assimilated because she pronounced her surname with the stress on the last syllable .
As I read these things , I wept .
I moved to New York six years ago .
I am half - Mexican , half - British , and while growing up in Mexico and England I had no direct experience of racism .
Yet suddenly , in America , I was one of a racially abused minority .
Most days , the people I speak to in Spanish are part of an underclass and that 's never been true in my life before .
If I speak English , people here think I 'm posh , like the Queen , and if I speak Spanish , they can't believe how Mexican my accent is .
There are millions of bilingual people here , but that particular mix is unusual .
And only in America could it be viewed as such a clash of classes .
I 've had people tell me not to go to certain places because they are full of Mexicans .
On the more politically correct end of the scale , I 've been chastised for referring to Latinos who were Mexican as " Mexicans " .
Somehow , my nationality has become a dirty word .
If you say " Mexican " in America , you are not referring to the citizens of a specific country , you are using a blanket derogatory term for " people who came out of nowhere and took our jobs " .
The attacks on Sonia Sotomayor are unconscionable , yet even more worryingly , Obama has been cited as proof that we are now colour blind and therefore anyone who has shown direct support for the racial underdog is too biased to be considered as a Supreme Court justice .
In other words , now we 've elected Obama , we have a licence to get on with being as racist as we were before .
Also , blacks are one thing ( they 've always been here ) but these invaders are a real problem .
We need n't worry that Sonia Sotomayor will be judged on the wrong terms : there is a Democratic majority in the Senate and she has many Republican admirers .
But what about the rest of the country ?
In the heady first days of this year , many warned that the word " post - racial " was dangerous ; we may already be just where they feared we 'd find ourselves .
Liz Cheney looks nothing like her father , but it is clear who he is .
She was introduced as “ our favorite vice president ’s daughter ” at a recent gathering of conservative women here .
She kept invoking him in her speech , conveying his best regards , and likes to share cute stories about Dad trying to master his new BlackBerry .
Like her father , Ms. Cheney speaks in understated , almost academic cadences , head veering down into her notes .
She also shares his willingness to pummel President Obama in stark , disdainful tones , not so much criticizing as taunting him .
“ Mr. President , in a ticking time - bomb scenario , with American lives at stake , ” she said , “ are you really unwilling to subject a terrorist to enhanced interrogation to get information that would prevent an attack ? ”
By speech ’s end , the crowd was standing , and the former vice president ’s daughter was being mobbed for photos and hounded to run for office .
Liz Cheney is “ a red state rock star , ” declared Rebecca Wales , one of the organizers of this event , the “ Smart Girls Summit . ”
“ The future of the Cheney message , ” added a conservative blogger who goes by the name of Fingers Malloy ( a rare man in this crowd , and even rarer , one with a Mohawk ) .
He also called her “ one of the fresh faces of our movement . ”
Who are the Republicans going to run for President in 2012 ?
With Mark Sanford having fallen from grace , and Newt Gingrich not catching on because too many people DO remember 1994 , and Tim Pawlenty trying to paint himself as Jefferson Davis along with Rick Perry , and Sarah Palin proving to be every bit the train wreck we knew she was , the Republicans are left with Mitt Romney , who will give the Christofascist Zombie Brigade fits , or -- whom ?
The Wall Street Journal thought that Dick Cheney should run , but since The Dickster 's health is questionable ( especially without a regular supply of freshly dead human souls to feed him ) perhaps another Cheney , equally adept at lying and fabricating and bellicose rhetoric against everyone east of Greenwich Mean Time would fit the bill The Republicans are desperate , and only when they 're desperate do they bring out the women .
The continued adoration of Sarah Palin by so many Republican men even after she 's proven herself to be nothing more than the aging beauty queen and aspiring stylista on other people 's money that the sane among us always knew she was shows just how clueless they are .
Put something with tits out there , their thinking goes , and we 'll get the women and show how with - it we are at the same time .
But I think we underestimate the money machine behind the right wing , and how much the military - industrial complex has to gain from a return to a Cheney foreign policy .
Liz Cheney may look like her mother , with that blonde sunniness that hides an appallingly empty heart , but her worldview is decidedly that of her father .
She both literally and figuratively is Cheney - in - a - dress .

British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford ( Image credit : Shane Stokes )
Team
Sky has made the biggest indication that it will be a major force in international cycling by announcing 10 more riders for the 2010 season .
It comes a day after team principal Dave Brailsford revealed the first six British riders .
The new signings are Edvald Boasson Hagen , Thomas Lövkvist , Kurt Asle Arvesen , Simon Gerrans , Juan Antonio Flecha , Kjell Calström , John Lee Augustyn , Greg Henderson , Las Petter Nordhaug and Morris Possoni .
" Today we ’ve brought ten more riders into our team , " Brailsford said .
" It ’s another big step in building Team Sky , and it ’s very exciting to see the team take shape .
These international riders join a British contingent - a fundamental part of the team - that we announced yesterday .
They bring huge experience from the Classics and Tours , real talent that we can develop , and key elements for a high performance team . "
Boasson Hagen has had his most successful year to date in 2009 , winning Gent - Wevelgem as well as a stage in the Giro d’Italia and overall at Eneco Tour .
Signed from Columbia - HTC along with Lövkvist , Henderson and Possoni , he ’s set to have his chance at leading a team .
However with riders of the calibre of Gerrans , Flecha and Lövkvist , Team Sky looks more than capable of competing on an array of fronts .
The new signings follow Geraint Thomas , Steve Cummings , Pete Kennaugh , Chris Froome , Ian Stannard and Russell Downing onto the roster .
Over the following months these riders will be joined by up to ten more .
The new riders
Thomas Lövkvist
Signed from Columbia , the Swede has had a breakthrough year , wearing the Maglia Rosa in the Giro .
Sky believes him to an all rounder with potential in the Grand Tours and Classics .
Lövkvist says : " After two good years with Stapleton 's team I felt that I reached the highest level of my possible growth there .
The team 's primary focus on the sprints in the Grand Tours was quite limiting for me .
After talking to Scott Sunderland I got an idea of what Team Sky would be about it and it felt like the right road to future progression .
When I heard about the structure and way of working I felt that this is something I want to be a part of .
My personal goals will be the Ardennes Classics and the Tour . "
Scott Sunderland ( Sports Manager ) says : " Thomas is 100 per cent professional and I identified him as such after watching his progress at FdJ and Columbia .
After long conversations with his trainer , I really believe in Thomas 's talent .
In my opinion , he is poied to take the podium as one of the Grand Tour contenders one day ; he 's a magnificent bike rider .
Thomas has not reached his full potential as yet and we 'll do our very best to help him find those few extra percent in different areas . ”
Juan Antonio Flecha
The Spaniard is leaving Team Rabobank to join the new British squad .
The Classics specialist has stage wins in Paris - Nice and Dauphine , as well as two podium finishes in Paris - Roubaix .
He is expected to play an important role in sharing his wealth of knowledge with the young riders .
Flecha says : " I decided to move from Rabobank because after four years in the team I needed a new challenge .
For the coming years I expect to have a lot of fun in the team before , during and after the races and as a personal goal I´d like to improve my time trial skills for the one - week races , to perform well in the cobbled classics , and I´d love to be on the top step of the podium at the velodrome of Roubaix . ”
Sunderland says : " Juan Antonio will be one of the cornerstones of the Team Sky foundation .
He is brilliant in leading and motivating the team ; he is a very complete rider .
Juan is always there from the start of the season till the end . "
Edvald Boasson Hagen
The 22 - year - old exploded on the scene this year .
Currently third in the UCI 's overall rankings , the Columbia - HTC rider has won a stage in the Giro d'Italia and also won the Eneco Tour and Gent - Wevelgem .
Boasson Hagen says : " After a very rewarding start to my career with Columbia - HTC I felt it was time for me to try something new and see if I can reach further in my ambitions as a rider .
I have had a great time in Bob Stapleton 's team and want to credit all the people there for their help and guidance but fact is that I 'm ready for new challenges .
My main goals for the coming season are going to be the classics .
I want to have a go at riding the Tour de France too . "
Sunderland says : " I first heard about Edvald in 2005 when I was talking to Norwegian Joker - Bianchi team director Gino Van Oudenhove .
Edvald really caught my attention as being a potential up - and - coming star .
I 've attempted to recruit Edvald for the teams I have been part of ever since .
Now , thanks to the efforts Dave Brailsford has made in securing the sponsorship for the first British Pro Cycling Team , Edvald will be coming to Team Sky . "
Greg Henderson
The New Zealand also joins from Columbia - HTC .
The former World Champion and Commonwealth Games medal winner , 31 , has nine victories this season , including a recent stage win in the Vuelta a Espana .
Henderson says : " The main reason why I have decided to move to Sky is because I like the guys involved in producing what will be a world - beating team .
Shane Sutton is a great man to have your back and I know Scott Sunderland personally too .
There is n't anything Scott has n't done in the cycling scene - he has competed at the top for many years himself and has successfully moved into cycling management .
And of course , it 's kinda cool to be racing for a team that has the Union Jack on their flag just like the Kiwi flag . ”
Sunderland says : " He brings a lot to the team as he has been competing at the top of track and road cycling for quite some years now .
There will be no hiding the fact that Greg is on board to win bike races for Team Sky in the sprints and he had a terrific sprint victory himself in the Vuelta just recently and is now totally ready to finish off the sprints for himself . "
Simmon Gerrans
The Aussie has won a stage in the Vuelta a Espana , to join the ranks of those who has won a stage in all three Grand Tours .
The 29 - year - old , known as a team player , turned pro in 2005 .
He won the Tour Down Under in 2006 .
Gerrans says : " My goal for next season is to try and improve on my performances in the Ardennes Classics .
I love riding these races and I know they are within my reach , especially after having another year of experience under the belt .
I believe I can be a real contender in those races .
Besides that , I would like to have solid results in the shorter stage races . "
Sunderland says : " Simon is an outstanding athlete ; he rides his races very intelligently and reads them very well ; his planning is meticulous and during competition he doses his efforts precisely .
He will undoubtedly be one of the protected riders for these races .
I 'm really looking forward to working with him over the coming seasons . "
Kjell Carlström
Carlström of Finland turned pro in 2002 and has ridden for Liquigas the last four seasons .
He is a climbing specialist who is reliable in three - week tours , having ridden all three Grand Tours for Liquigas .
The 32 - year - old has a stage win in Paris - Nice .
John Lee Augustyn
At 23 - years - old he is still developing , and showing the potential to be a great climber .
He rode the Tour de France last year for Barloworld , and was involved in a dramatic crash 30 metres down a rocky slope which miraculously left him uninjured .
Lars Petter Nordhaug
The 25 - year - old started out as a mountain biker , but later turned to the road and was Norwegian national road champion in 2006 .
Currently riding for Joker Bianchi , he recently won a stage of the Tour of Ireland and finished second overall , behind future Sky teammate Russell Downing .
Kurt Asle Arvesen
The Norwegian has been with Saxo Bank since 2004 .
The 34 - year - old is a sprinter and Classics rider , who has won stages in both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia .
One of the older riders on the new Sky squad , the 12 - year - pro will have lots of experience to share with the younger riders .
Morris Possoni
The Italian has ridden professionally for four years , two each with Lampre and Columbia - HTC .
He is a strong team worker who is often invovled in breakaways .
His career highlight to date is wearing the best young rider jersey in the 2008 Giro d'Italia .

Glenn Beck 's not on Fox News this week , leaving everyone to wonder why not and , more importantly , where he went .
Forced off the air by an advertiser boycott ?
The Hamptons ?
An Obama re-education camp ?
We know where , but not why .
The folks who think really hard about the machinations behind cable news — that 'd include us — are wondering :
Was Glenn Beck forced off the air this week by contrite Fox News executives in the wake of an advertiser boycott over his increasingly insane meltdowns ?
Or does
Fox just want you to think that ?
TVNewser reported today , citing " several sources inside " Fox News , that Glenn Beck was pulled off the air and sent on a forced , unscheduled vacation this week after executives became increasingly alarmed over the advertiser exodus from his show and wanted to " let some of the heat surrounding him die down . "
If true , that would be an almost unprecedented instance of the network backing down — rather than its preferred tactic of attacking viciously — in the face of criticism .
Aside from the firing of E.D.
Hill after her " terrorist fist jab " remark and an oblique apology after a graphic referred to Michelle Obama as " Obama 's Babymama , " it 's hard to recall a case where the famously truculent network acknowledged criticism or reacted defensively .
Fortunately for fans of Fox 's unrestrained dickishiness , it 's not true :
Not long after the TVNewser posted the item , Beck 's personal publicist Matthew Hiltzik provided evidence to Politico that Beck 's vacation was long - planned :
An e-mail from an employee of his production company , dated July 14 , saying , " All : Glenn will be off of radio & TV the week of August 17th , returning to air August 24th . "
Beck did n't start getting into serious trouble until July 28 , when he said Barack Obama hates white people .
So if it 's authentic , the e-mail is fairly solid proof that Beck was planning to be out long before his latest psychotic episode began .
For what it 's worth , a tipster tells us that she spotted Beck with his family and a bodyguard — so much for that " just us folks " image — leaving the Museum of Natural History today in Manhattan at about 12:30 p.m .
So whether the vacation was planned or not , there was no travel involved .
So what gives ?
The strange thing about the TVNewser report was the response from Fox 's flack : " A Fox News spokesperson denied our accounts and simply told us , ' Glenn Beck will back on Monday . ' "
That 's awful weak stuff considering how easy it would have been to simply knock down the story from the start by , say , providing the e-mail proving that Beck 's vacation was long - planned .
And the fact that it was Beck 's personal publicist , who 's paid to look out for Beck 's image and not Fox 's , who eventually got that e-mail out there leads us to the following highly improbable - and - yet - irresistible conspiracy theory :
Fox deliberately planted the forced - vacation story , knowing it was false .
The network generally has no interest in placating critics , but it is highly motivated to placate advertisers , who have moved their spots off Beck 's show in droves .
Beck 's sudden absence from the air presented an opportunity to appear to be sensitive to criticism without actually doing anything :
By spreading word that he was taken off the air , advertisers see that Fox has gotten the message .
But by not actually taking Beck off the air , they do n't have to deal with the blowback from Beck .
That would explain the difference between the two flacks ' responses .
Fox 's flack remained deliberately vague enough to keep the story alive , while Beck 's flack provided the proof that would have killed it from the get - go .
If you think that 's a preposterous theory , you 're right .
But you 've also never worked with the Fox News ' dedicated public relations team .
Hebrews 6:4- 6 is a passage which has puzzled many people .
On the surface , it appears to contradict other teachings in the Bible such as grace and forgiveness .
Since the Bible plainly teaches that forgiveness is available to everyone who asks ( see , for example , 1 John 1:9 ) , we know that there must be something more to this text .
Furthermore , this passage raises questions about whether it is possible to lose one ’s salvation .
Losing Salvation
In order to understand Hebrews 6:4 - 6 , we must first determine whether someone who is saved can lose his or her salvation .
There are sincere Christians on both sides of this debate ; however , what ’s most important is what the Bible says .
Let ’s let the Bible answer that question .
First , it ’s important to remember that salvation is by God ’s grace , not our works ( Ephesians 2:8 , 9 ) .
We do n’t earn salvation by our obedience ; rather , when we accept Him , Jesus gives us His righteousness ( Romans 3:22 - 25 ) .
Acts 16 tells about when Paul and Silas were doing missionary work in Philippi and were falsely accused and thrown in jail .
When God miraculously opened the jail doors , Paul and Silas did n’t leave ; instead , they saved the jailer ’s life .
The jailer “ asked , ‘ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ’
They replied , ‘ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved ’ ” ( verses 30 , 31 ) .
Belief is a function of the will .
No one can force a person to believe .
He or she must choose to believe ( John 3:16 ) .
And the same will that can choose to believe can also choose to stop believing .
Several texts illustrate this .
Hebrews 3:12 - 14 cautions against turning away from God and urges the need to hold firmly to the confidence we had at first until the end .
In Matthew 24:13 , Jesus says that “ he who stands firm to the end will be saved . ”
That suggests that those who do n’t stand firm to the end wo n’t be saved .
Verse 10 makes it clear that Jesus is talking about Christians when He says that those who stand firm to the end will be saved .
One of the clearest passages on this subject is 1 Corinthians 15:1 , 2 .
Notice how verse 2 says that if we do n’t hold firmly to the gospel , we ’ve believed in vain .
Clearly , such a person was saved at one time .
This passage tells us as much .
But equally clearly , it ’s possible for that belief to become in vain , or worthless .
In other words , Paul is talking about those who lose their salvation .
There are several other texts that confirm what 1 Corinthians 15:1 , 2 tells us .
The Bible in 2 Peter 2:20 - 22 tells us that those who turn away from knowing Jesus and become entangled in the world ’s corruption are worse off than they were at the beginning .
According to Revelation 3:5 , those who wo n’t have their names blotted out of the book of life are those who overcome .
And in 1 Corinthians 9:27 , Paul says he takes care so that he does n’t become disqualified for eternal life .
Because of what we ’ve just discovered , some people wonder , “ If it ’s possible to lose my salvation , can I really be sure that I ’m saved ? ”
The Bible is clear that we can have confidence in our salvation .
Acts 16:31 is a promise that if we believe in Jesus , we ’ll be saved .
And God ’s promises are trustworthy .
In John 10:28 , Jesus promises , “ I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; no one can snatch them out of my hand . ”
In other words , when we trust Jesus , we need not fear .
No adversary can take the gift of salvation from us .
( Some people argue that this verse means that it ’s impossible for someone to lose their salvation .
But it does n’t say , “ No one can leave my hand . ”
We need to avoid reading more into a text than is there , and consider each text in the context of all the other Bible verses on the subject . )
In reality , the view that salvation ca n’t be lost can easily lead to doubting one ’s salvation .
When I was a teenager and learning to drive , one of my instructors was a seminary student preparing to become a pastor .
One day when we were out driving , we fell into a discussion about whether it ’s possible to lose one ’s salvation .
I asked my instructor about those who are converted and whose lives show every indication of conversion , but who nevertheless turn their backs on God and reject Him .
“ Have n’t they lost their salvation ? ” I asked .
In reply , he told me that such people had never been saved in the first place .
If that reasoning is true in every such case , then it ’s easy to see why some people are unsure of their salvation .
After all , anyone who has decided that they want to follow Christ and then falls back into their old way of life could wonder , after they return to Christ , “ Was I really saved before ?
What if I fall again ?
Am I really saved now ? ”
How much better to live by the Bible truth , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved ” ( Acts 16:31 ) !
Another objection some raise against the possibility of losing one ’s salvation is the issue of works .
Some people believe that whenever you commit a sin , you lose your salvation .
However , since we ’re saved by grace , not works ( Ephesians 2:8 , 9 ) , such a belief is clearly unbiblical .
If you lose your salvation by committing a sin , that ’s works .
But that ’s not what scripture says .
The Bible talks about enduring to the end ( Matthew 24:13 ) and holding firmly to the gospel ( 1 Corinthians 15:1 , 2 ) .
That is n’t works , it ’s a choice — a state of mind — just as accepting the gift of salvation and believing in Jesus is a choice and a state of mind .
In other words , we lose our salvation only when we choose to stop believing .
We ca n’t be unborn , but we can die .
Hebrews 6:4-6
With this background in mind , let ’s consider Hebrews 6:4 - 6 .
As we read the text , something jumps out at us :
This passage is clearly referring to those who at one time were saved .
Only the saved share in the Holy Spirit , for example ( see Acts 2:38 ; Ephesians 1:13 , 14 ) .
The real problem is in verse 6 .
It says that it is impossible for those who have been saved , “ if they fall away , to be brought back to repentance , because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace . ”
We ’ll consider two possible interpretations .
Option One
Some commentators see this verse as a reference to the unpardonable sin ( see Matthew 12:31 , 32 ) .
Since 1 John 1:9 promises that God will forgive our sins if we confess them , then the unpardonable sin must be the sin we refuse to confess .
An example of this is the life of King Saul .
Shortly after Samuel anointed him king , the Holy Spirit came on him and worked mightily in him ( see 1 Samuel 10:9 , 10 , and surrounding verses ) .
Yet Saul grew proud and began to defy God. First , God decreed that Saul ’s royal line would n’t endure ( 1 Samuel 13:14 ) .
After Saul continued to reject God , God rejected Saul ( 1 Samuel 15:26 ) and directed Samuel to anoint David king .
Eventually , Saul had rejected God so consistently that God stopped answering him ( see 1 Samuel 28:6 ) .
In this last occasion in which Saul tried to inquire of the Lord , it was n’t out of a heart of repentance ; Saul was simply trying to save himself from the Philistines .
Like Saul , if we persistently reject God — even if we once were saved — there will come a time when God respects our freedom of choice and the Holy Spirit stops drawing us .
That is the unpardonable sin .
It is n’t that God refuses to forgive it , it ’s that we refuse to repent .
( By the way , anyone who wonders whether they ’ve committed the unpardonable sin has n’t done so .
Those who have have no desire or concern for the things of God since the Holy Spirit has left them . )
So according to this view , when the writer of Hebrews refers to falling away in Hebrews 6:6 , he ’s referring to those who have persistently turned their backs on God , thus committing the unpardonable sin .
Option Two
Another angle on this passage is illustrated by the alternate translation of the word “ because ” in verse 6 as given in the NIV ’s footnote on that verse .
If we used the alternate reading and swapped “ while ” for “ because , ” then the verse would read , “ if they fall away , to be brought back to repentance , while to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace . ”
So we ca n’t be brought back to repentance while we ’re crucifying Jesus all over again .
Neither “ because ” nor “ while ” is present in the original Greek .
Those words were supplied by the translators in order to make the verse more understandable to English - speaking readers .
Young ’s Literal Translation ( YLT ) renders the phrase this way : “ Having crucified again to themselves the Son of God . ”
The Greek word that YLT renders as “ having crucified again ” is anastaurountas ( ἀνασταυ ροῦντα ς ) .
It ’s a present ( continuous ) participle .
In English , our verb tenses describe time .
If I say , “ I will come , ” then you know that I ’m referring to the future .
If I say , “ I come , ” you know that I ’m referring to right now .
And if I say , “ I came , ” you know that the action already happened .
Greek is different .
Instead of describing time , Greek tenses describe the type of action .
In the case of the present tense , the action is described as continuous ; any time significance is secondary .
And since anastaurountas is in the present tense , we know that it ’s describing a continuous action .
In other words , our text is describing those who are continually crucifying Christ by their falling away .
According to the unpardonable sin view , this makes sense .
Those who have persistently rejected Christ are obviously crucifying Him again and subjecting Him to disgrace .
However , when we realize the continuous nature of anastaurountas , another option for interpreting this verse presents itself .
As long as we insist on a fallen away life , we ’re crucifying Christ and we ca n’t repent because repentance requires submission to God .
But if we truly submit to God , then we ’re no longer crucifying Christ and so repentance is possible .
In the parable of the prodigal son ( Luke 15:11 - 32 ) , the younger son started out with his father .
Because this is a parable , it should be understood in a symbolic sense .
The father is clearly a symbol for God the Father , and the father ’s house refers to heaven or a life in fellowship with God .
So we can safely argue that the son was saved at the beginning of this story .
But the prodigal son fell away ; he took his inheritance and traveled to a far country where he lived a wild life .
Eventually , he hit rock bottom and decided to return home .
But he had to leave his old life before he could return home .
He did n’t return home with a prostitute on each arm !
In other words , while the son was living his wild life , he was crucifying Christ .
But in order to return home , he stopped crucifying Christ .
Conclusion
I ’m not sure which of these two interpretations ( option one or option two ) is best .
They both have merit .
In either case , it ’s clear that the situation is n’t hopeless for those who have a sincere desire to repent .
Remember , David committed adultery then killed a man to hide his previous sin .
Yet when he repented , God forgave him .
In the end , “ if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness ” ( 1 John 1:9 ) .

ABOUT GROUP HEALTH COOPERATIVE ABOUT GROUP HEALTH COOPERATIVE
Non-profit founded in 1947 .
Provides care to more than 566,000 people in Washington state and northern Idaho .
Operates 26 medical centers , five specialty units and seven behavioral clinics .
Contracts with 41 community hospitals .
Provides two - thirds of medical services through Group Health , a 900 - physician medical group , and one - third through a contracted network of independent physicians .
Offers coverage to employer groups , individuals and those enrolled in public insurance programs , including Medicare , Medicaid and the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
Employs 9,000 .
Generates $ 2.8 billion in annual revenue .
Invested $ 40 million to create an electronic health record system .
Ranked first in the nation by Consumer Reports among health care plans with an HMO .
Sources : Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner , Commonwealth Fund , Consumer Reports , Group Health Cooperative SEATTLE 
After 30 years of punishing caseloads and never - ending stacks of paperwork , Harry Shriver was getting ready to hang up his doctor 's coat and retire when he tried something new .
Shriver 's practice , part of a health care cooperative in Washington state , launched a program that allowed him to cut his appointments from 24 to 12 a day , leaving him more time for each patient .
He also now handles routine requests such as prescription refills through e-mail and relies more on electronic medical records to track test results and coordinate care .
" For the first time in my career I have the time to think ahead , " said Shriver , chief doctor at a clinic run by Group Health Cooperative , one of the nation 's last remaining health care co-ops .
" I 'm doing things that really are making a difference — and it's fun . "
After months of stalled debate in Congress over a proposed government - run health insurance plan , or so - called public plan , some lawmakers are eyeing cooperatives such as Group Health as a model that could drive down costs and improve the quality of care through innovative programs and technology .
Co-ops , which would be run by their patients instead of the government , have been under discussion in Congress for months but gained renewed attention this week when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius signaled the administration might support the idea .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs later said President Obama still prefers a government - run program , but he is " willing to listen " to other ideas — as long as they foster competition with private insurers and drive down the spiraling cost of health care .
Overall , health care in the United States is expected to cost $ 2.6 trillion this year , or 17 % of the nation 's economy .
Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are concerned that a taxpayer - subsidized government insurance plan would have an unfair advantage and would eventually take in millions of Americans with private coverage .
Because they would be run by members , co-ops could offer a political compromise .
Some Republicans , including Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , have suggested the insurance cooperatives are worth considering .
" I do n't know if it will do everything people want , " Shelby said on Fox News Sunday , " but we ought to look at it . "
Co-op works like private insurance Group Health was created in 1947 by farmers and loggers who were already pooling resources to pay for basic primary care on a small scale , said Aubrey Davis , an original founder of the co-op .
Today , the non-profit has 566,000 members , making it the third - largest health insurer in Washington , state insurance records show .
For patients , co-ops work just like private insurance :
There are premiums and co-pays and , like an HMO , most enrollees see doctors within a network .
Premiums for individual insurance have increased by an average of 12.3 % a year since 2000 , less than the largest private insurers in Washington , according to the state 's Office of the Insurance Commissioner .
By comparison , individual rates for a popular BlueCross plan in Washington rose an average of 18 % , state records show .
More than two years ago , the co-op sharpened its focus on primary care and invested $ 40 million in an electronic medical records system that allows patients to check their charts online and helps doctors coordinate care .
In its first year , the program reduced emergency room costs by 29 % , Group Health says .
Gertrude McKellar , 91 , has been a member of the co-op since 1980 and said she appreciates how Shriver takes time to review her medications at each visit .
Nurses follow up regularly and call before appointments to discuss symptoms so doctors are prepared when she arrives .
" I do n't feel like I 'm just a number , " she said .
Behind the scenes , Group Health is structured differently than much of the nation 's medical system .
Doctors work directly for the company and are paid a salary .
Because they do n't receive a fee for each visit or test they schedule , Group Health 's physicians have no financial incentive to cram their schedules with dozens of patients a day and order unnecessary tests .
Instead , the group 's 26 medical centers find ways to reduce costs by improving quality .
Doctors receive automatic e-mail alerts when patients wind up in the emergency room so they are prepared when that patient returns for follow - up care .
Because doctors have fewer appointments , they have more time for phone consultations , which further reduce the number of people scheduling office visits .
Group Health CEO Scott Armstrong acknowledges the company 's innovation has less to do with its co-op structure than with the close relationship it has with its employee - doctors .
Still , Armstrong said co-ops could improve care on a broad scale if for no other reason than they force executives to consider patients when making decisions about everything from what procedures should be covered to how late clinics will stay open .
" There 's a kind of accountability to the patient that makes an enormous difference , " he said .
Mamatha Palanati , a primary care doctor at a Group Health clinic in Bellevue , Wash . , said the focus on patient accountability has changed how she practices medicine .
Rather than spending five to seven minutes with patients addressing only acute symptoms , she says she can now talk about long - term , chronic issues as well .
That kind of preventive care , she said , makes it less likely patients will return with more costly problems down the road .
" I 'm doing different work , " Palanati said .
" I feel like I 'm giving a kind of total care to my patients . "
Enrolled patients would elect boards Expanded nationwide , co-ops could cover as many as 12 million people in state , regional or national plans , said Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , the lead advocate for the idea and a member of a bipartisan group of senators drafting a compromise health care bill .
To get the co-ops started , taxpayers would kick in as much as $ 6 billion , Conrad said .
Initially , co-ops would be run by boards appointed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
After that , the patients enrolled in the plan would elect boards that would then appoint the management .
That structure , Conrad said , would foster innovative , patient - focused care .
" When you 've got the membership owning it , it gives people a sense of involvement , " he said .
But as the idea gains momentum as a potential political compromise it has also attracted criticism .
On the left , Andrew Stern , head of the 2 million - member Service Employees ' International Union , said there is " no way " a co-op could ever provide adequate competition to a private insurance company .
The conservative Cato Institute counters that co-ops will " still give the federal government control over one - sixth of the U.S. economy . "
Independent experts predict co-ops could take years if not decades to reach the critical mass of enrollment needed to ensure there are enough people paying into the system to cover the cost of medical claims .
Conrad said individual cooperatives would need at least 500,000 members to stay afloat .
" We 've tried this before , and it did n't work , " said Timothy Jost , a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington , Va. , who said hundreds of health care co-ops born out of the Great Depression folded when the federal government pulled its funding .
" I just do n't see it as a viable strategy . "
Although health co-ops largely disappeared , the model is still around in other industries .
There are more than 900 rural electrical co-ops in the country , according to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association .
REI , a popular sporting goods company with more than 80 stores , operates as a cooperative .
A nationwide health care co-op , rather than state or regional plans , has " promise , " Jost said , but that approach might also prompt opposition from Republicans and some Democrats who fear a national co-op would too closely resemble public insurance .
" Group Health is a city on a hill , " he said .
" The problem is replicating it throughout the country . "

A study published this week in the open access journal PLoS Medicine has found that of six interventions promoting exercise in adults in Australia , encouraging the use of pedometers - simple step counting devices that can be used as a motivational tool - and promoting physical activity through mass media campaigns are the most cost - effective in terms of the money spent for the health benefits they result in .
Considered as a package , researchers at the University of Queensland also conclude that these six interventions could reduce death and illness from heart disease , stroke , cancer and diabetes in Australia , with an overall cost saving for the health sector .
Despite its image as a sporting nation , physical inactivity in Australia , in common with many countries in the developed world and an increasing number of developing countries , is a major public health problem .
The World Health Organisation recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity - which could just be brisk walking - five times per week , but at least 60 % of Australia 's population does not even do this modest amount .
In Australia , physical inactivity leads to 10 % of all deaths , largely as a result of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , and globally it is thought to cause 1.9 million deaths per year .
Linda Cobiac and colleagues at the University of Queensland reviewed the medical literature to identify a range of interventions to promote physical activity and transport use in adults , which had evidence of effectiveness and which were suitable programs to implement in Australia .
They then calculated the cost - effectiveness of six interventions .
These included TravelSmart - a program that targeted households in Australia with information about walking paths , bus timetables , and offered incentives to reduce reliance on the car .
The six interventions also included two that involved general practitioners ( GPs ) : the standard practice amongst GPs in Australia to screen and prescribe physical activity to inactive patients who visit them , as well as the practice of GPs referring patients to counselling sessions with an exercise physiologist at their local general practice .
Internet advice on physical activity , the promotion of pedo meters in the community , and a mass media campaign that promoted physical activity and community events and activities , were also assessed .
A standardized approach has been developed to assess cost - effectiveness of different physical activity programs that are suitable in an Australian context , so the researchers were able to compare these six interventions .
They calculated the health outcomes of each intervention in terms of disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) - the number of healthy years of life lost as a result of premature death or illness - through already published data on how physical activity causes heart disease , stroke , colon and breast cancer , and diabetes .
Offsetting the financial cost of each intervention against the number of years of death or injury ( or DALYs ) that the intervention averted , they concluded that the program promoting the pedometer as a motivational tool for physical exercise and the mass media campaign were the most cost - effective .
The GP practice of referring patients to an exercise physiologist was the least cost - effective , especia lly if time and travel costs were considered .
Only the pedometer program and the mass media campaign of the six interventions resulted in an overall cost - saving , but the researchers stress that if the six interventions are considered together " it is likely that the package of interventions would not only be cost - effective by very likely cost - saving to the health sector . "
The researchers point out that questions remain about the long - term effectiveness of these programs , and that the quality of the evidence in the literature they reviewed varied .
But importantly , the standardized approach to cost - effectiveness offers a model to guide policy - makers in other countries to identify approaches to decrease the burden of disease caused by cardiovascular disease , cancer and diabetes as a result of physical inactivity .

Shocked gamekeeper runs for his life from three ton hippo
If there 's one thing a hippo does n't like it 's being interrupted while having lunch .
This gamekeeper in Uganda runs for his life after disturbing a hungry beast having its favourite meal of grass .
1 : The man saunters casually past the hippo as it chomps through the long grass
He fled as the angry three - ton beast - which can outrun a man - charged at him .
2 : Look out !
The hippo turns on the gamekeeper after being disturbed while eating grass
The keeper , armed only with a walkie - talkie at the Murchison Falls National Park , somehow managed to escape on this occasion .
The hippopotamus is one of the most aggressive creatures in the world and is often regarded as the most ferocious animal in Africa .
Hippo jaws are capable of biting a 10 - foot crocodile in two .
3 : Running for his life :
The gamekeeper flees as the hungry hippo charges at him .
Hippos are some of the most aggressive creatures on Earth
They regularly attack humans and boats .
Despite their stocky shape and short legs , they can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour and can easily outrun a human .
They are the third - heaviest land mammal .
Males can weigh up to 4,000 lbs and measure 17 - feet long .
Adults think nothing of taking on crocodiles , which often live in the same pools and rivers .
4 : Faster than Usain Bolt :
At 30 mph , hippos have a more impressive top speed than the fastest man in the world .
Bolt can only reach 29 mph
BIG TROUBLE
Hippos have killed more people in Africa than any other wild animal
Their gaping yawn is actually a threat , displaying long , thick canine teeth that can bite a boat in half
They are the second heaviest land mammal after elephants , at up to 4,000 lb and as much as 17ft long
The creatures , whose name is Greek for ' river horse ' , can stay under water for five minutes
The day before we do a top 10 list Shaun and I have lunch in a local diner and go over ideas for something timely but interesting .
Last week the big news was Michael Jackson so we did the thrilling list , but after we finished lunch , someone ( in the interests of collective responsibility ) made a comment about another Michael Jackson list we could have done – the strangest people in IT .
Jackson may have been keen on the title King of Pop but his life can hardly be considered normal .
But let he who is without sin cast the first stone .
Techies are by nature a little different from the rest of the population .
Some of the people on this list are successful billionaires , Some Nobel prize winners or high - tech nomads .
However , some individuals are weird even by geek standards .
Those who made this week 's top 10 list have managed to not only be hugely successful in the business , but also generate some great stories of oddball behaviour .
Honourable mention : Thomas Dolby
Shaun Nichols :
Not too many tech executives can also lay claim to a hit song and landmark video .
Most people know Thomas Dolby only as the man behind the early 80s new wave hit " She Blinded Me With Science . "
When not creating or producing fodder for MTV , however , Dolby has in fact been a very influential character .
In 1993 , Dolby started a small digital music outfit called Headspace .
As the web took off , the company developed the RMF music format and the Beatnik browser plug - in .
The company now known as Beatnik Inc. is an established developer of music software for PCs and mobile phones .
Dolby has proven to be both a musical and technological visionary .
Certainly an odd , if not wonderful combination .
Iain Thomson : I 'll give you this one Shaun , but not for the horr ifyingly bad " She Blinded Me With Science . "
I 've a soft spot for Mr Dolby because he did a lot of good work on Def Leppard 's seminal 1983 album Pyromania , under the name Booker T. Boffin .
He did get sued by Ray Dolby , inventor of Dolby noise reduction and co-inventor of the video tape , who coincidentally has a son called Thomas .
I can't help thinking that the internet needs more rock stars , especially those who care enough about music to create their own format .
Honourable mention : Steve Ballmer
Iain Thomson : I can't decide if Ballmer 's genuinely weird or it's all just an Uncle Fester impression , put on to freak people out .
His conference exhortations have gained him an amused following and there were moves at the UK launch of Windows XP to get the crowd chanting “ Do the dance monkeyboy ! ” but sadly people chickened out .
There have been reports that the wild Man of Microsoft dismembers office furniture in fits of temper and he is apparently a very tough man to face over a board room negotiation .
This is what makes me think that he 's acting up – when he starts to sweat and get bulgy eyed there 's still plenty of people who are n't willing to take the risk that he wo n't vault over the table and sink his teeth into their throats .
Shaun Nichols :
One can never accuse Steve Ballmer of lacking passion .
From the aforementioned " Monkeyboy " dance to the enraged " developers developers developers " mantra , Ballmer has given us some classic YouTube clips .
When you get down to it , however , there are few people I would rather have running a large tech firm than Ballmer .
He may seem a bit like Uncle Fester on a three day speed binge , but he also runs a pretty tight and well - oiled ship at Microsoft .
It is said that Windows Vista was Bill Gates baby , but Windows 7 is Steve Ballmers ' baby .
Given how smoothly Windows 7 development and rollout has gone , and given what a disaster Vista turned out to be , one has to give a tip of the hat to the Ballmer way of doing things .
Yes , Microsoft has had some clunkers as of late , but that is more due to years of sloppy practice and bloated software that had little to do with the CEO .
Even with the company in the worst situation it has seen in years , it seems a great many Microsoft employees still hold a firm belief in the company , and a lot of that has to do with Ballmer .
10 . John Perry Barlow
Shaun Nichols : Okay , so I guess Thomas Dolby is n't the only one who can claim a hit song and a major IT outfit .
Alternately described as a lyricist , activist , anarchist and libertarian , John Perry Barlow has done a great many things in his quest to bring freedom and openness to the world .
The one project that endears him in our hearts , however , is his work for online freedom .
In 1990 , Barlow was one of three activists that helped to establish the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Since the early days of the internet , the EFF has been on the forefront of the battle for user rights .
The group has launched extensive legal campaigns against everything from DRM to heavy - handed use of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Not bad for a guy best - known for co-writing Grateful Dead hits .
Iain Thomson : John Perry Barlow was a nightmare for people whose default conversational gambit is “ So what do you do ? ”
His career spanned animal husbandry , Grateful Dead writer , rancher and social activist .
Steve Jobs once reportedly said that Bill Gates would be a broader person if he 'd dropped acid .
Barlow seems to have got that out of the way first , along with heroic doses of Wild Turkey with fellow Grateful Dead members for over a decade before discovering the Well in 1986 , the very dawn of the internet community movement .
He brought a little rebel attitude to the web , and left a lasting mark .
Since then his co-invention , the EFF , has been in the vanguard of protecting our online freedoms .
It keeps companies and governments honest and is willing to fight for the rights of computer users everywhere .
9. William Shockley
Iain Thomson :
The co-inventor of the transistor was a difficult man to work for , and had some distinctly odd ideas about the human race .
Shockley was one of the three men behind the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs , work for which they shared a Nobel Prize .
But he was reputedly so abrasive to work for that he passed over fro promotion and left to use his skills to set up Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory , America 's first semiconductor firm based in Mountain View , California .
The new company did n't change his management style and he annoyed staff due to paranoid fears that his inventions were being stolen .
At one point everyone in the company had to take a lie detector test to prove their loyalty .
This riled many staff and the so called ' Traitorous Eight ' left and started Fairchild Semiconductor , which begot Intel .
Later in life he became devoted to the subject of genetics .
He believed that humanity was doomed if people of low intelligence reproduced more than clever people and advocated paid sterilisation for anyone with an IQ lower than 100 .
When he sued for libel after the accusation that he was ' Hitlerite ' he won , but was awarded just one dollar in damages .
He even donated sperm to a Noble Prize sperm bank so his genes could be passed on .
In the end he died a lonely , embittered man , estranged from most of his family , a sad end for one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley .
Shaun Nichols :
One thinks that Shockley and Steve Jobs might have hit it off rather well .
Many of the people on our list either overcame or leveraged their oddball status to become very successful in business and happy in life .
This was not the case with Shockley .
His controlling ways and paranoid point of view drove away many of his employees .
One can only imagine how huge Shockley Semiconductor would have been had he not alienated his most talented engineers .
Even Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison have the good sense to keep their best talent happy , and so within company walls .
In the end , Shockley 's eccentricity was his greatest liability , not his greatest asset .
On another note , his views on stupid people reproducing sound a lot like the plot for the Mike Judge film " Idiocracy , " perhaps someone at the Shockley Estate should give the lawyers a call ...
8. Charles Simonyi
Shaun Nichols :
So who among us did n't at one time or another dream of becoming an astronaut ?
Hungarian - born software icon Charles Simonyi got to live that dream , even if it was a little later in life than he had imagined .
Simonyi emerged from Eastern Europe to attend college in California and later join the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the late 70s .
In 1981 he was hired by Microsoft and helped lead the development of Word and Excel .
This of course endowed Simonyi with enough money to buy and sell all of us several hundred times over .
But that 's not all .
In 2006 , Simonyi decided to leave his sizeable bank account , ground - breaking software firm and 28 year - old Swedish millionaire wife behind here on Earth and hitch a ride to the International Space Station .
Okay , so maybe it's not " strange " so much as " really , really cool , " but there 's no doubt that Simonyi is very much a one - of - a - kind person .
Iain Thomson :
By the Pratchett definition Charles Simonyi is not strange ; he 's eccentric .
It 's like strange , but with a lot more money .
As a programmer he developed the idea of a master infrastructure to code development .
A central designer would show the goal and coders could noodle around so long as they achieved it in the most efficient manner possible .
Also , by developing a central architecture , Simonyi made applications development much more efficient .
But he has his moments .
He 's the only time return visitor to the International Space Station , spends much of the year on his custom - built yacht and threw over a fifteen year relationship with Martha Stewart of a Swedish girl under half his age .
That said , he 's also founded the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University ( first holder : Richard Dawkins ) , so maybe a little oddness is n't too bad .
7. Seymour Cray
Iain Thomson : Silicon Valley is a wonderful place to live and do business , or so millions of people seem to think .
However , for Seymour Cray , it was just too full so the father of supercomputing was happier in to Chippewa Falls , Wisconsin .
He spent the Second World War in Europe and supporting the Philippino Guerilla army in the Far East .
He then came back , got a degree and set about changing the way we build and design computers .
For decades later in life the name Cray would be synonymous with high performance computing .
He was by all accounts an odd person to work for .
He was brilliantly inspired , but insisted on an absolutely quiet workplace and part of his move to Wisconsin was to get away from customers who kept disturbing his work .
The other was reputed to be a fear of nuclear war .
Cray was also something of a loveable oddball .
He claimed once that his skills were given to him by the elves , he dug tunnels to relax and was a talented windsurfer .
But what makes him special for me is his single - minded purpose and his willingness to walk away so he could do things his way .
Shaun Nichols :
Some people spend their downtime at work cruising Fark.com or catching up on the latest celebrity gossip .
Seymour Cray used to sit at his desk and design logic circuits .
He was so focused that as soon as he was able to run his own facility , he promptly moved the entire operation from the hustle and bustle of Minneapolis , Minnesota and into the frozen forests far outside of town so that he would be able to work free from the reach of those pesky management types and get some peace and quiet .
The results speak for themselves .
Cray was one of the driving forces behind the development of the supercomputing field , and many of his designs remained in use for decades .
His Cray I and Cray II supercomputers both sent shockwaves throughout the industry , the later holding the top speed ranking for five years .
Personally he was also rather remarkable .
An electronics genius since early childhood , he also possessed business savvy and an uncanny knack for setting off on his own when he first formed Cray Research and Cray Computer Corporation ( though the latter went bankrupt after the end of the Cold War deflated the supercomputer industry . )
6.Gary McKinnon
Shaun Nichols : Okay , not to disparage Mr. McKinnon or make light of his legal struggle , but the guy is a little weird .
It 's one thing to believe in UFO 's and government conspiracies .
It 's another to actively seek out government documents which prove it .
And it 's a completely different level to then hack into NASA computers in order to obtain evidence that aliens have landed on Earth .
That 's not to say we are n't huge fans of Gary McKinnon and strong supporters of his cause .
That the US government would put so much effort and malice into charging McKinnon for his actions is completely absurd .
For those who would preach about bringing a criminal to justice , I say that as an American citizen I am far less concerned about charging a non-destructive computer criminal than I am about the fact that the US military had dozens of its systems compromised by a systems administrator from Glasgow looking for photos of little green men .
Perhaps rather than sending McKinnon to jail , the government should put him to work teaching network security to its own IT admins .
Iain Thomson : Despite attempts to portray McKinnon as a master hacker the facts show that this was simply an odd character who got lucky .
By some accounts McKinnon got into highly classified US military accounts just by typing admin into the password box .
The admission that the US Navy was still using Windows NT4 was even more shocking .
I 've met McKinnon and he 's nothing more than a skilled script kiddie .
By all accounts he entered these networks just to search for evidence of ETs .
The fact he had any damage seems down to ineptitude rather than ill - will .
5. Mark Cuban
Iain Thomson : Plenty of people who made it big in the software industry and cashed out at the right time .
Some of them even bought sports teams .
But Mark Cuban has taken things to another level .
The man behind Broadcast.com is every inch the rough diamond .
He owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and to date has been fined over $ 1,665,000 for improper behavior at games .
That still has n't stopped him screaming from the sidelines , wearing his ' I 'd rather be fighting the man ' tshirt .
He 's funded the legal fight by file sharing service Grokster , distributed a film highly critical of US conduct in Iraq and has started his own stimulus plan looking for good business ideas .
Cuban is certainly one of the stranger characters in the industry .
Shaun Nichols : Like Simonyi , Cuban is one of the rare individuals who did not get consumed by his business success and , rather than become an obsessive boardroom zombie , he went back to living like a regular person would ... if they had billions of dollars .
Cuban 's life is a bit like one of those movies where an average Joe ( usually Tom Hanks or Adam Sandler ) falls into a huge pot of money and proceeds to cause utter chaos amongst the moneyed elite .
One of the first things he did after cashing out Broadcast.com to Yahoo was to buy a lifetime ticket on American Airlines and spend months travelling the world .
He then came home and did what any American sports fan would do ; buy your favourite team and run it better than those stuffed - shirt bozos that had it before you ever could .
Rather than sit up in the box wining and dining clients , Cuban is down on the floor , usually in a team jersey , cheering on the players and screaming at the officials .
Though he is a bit irritating to some people , I find it very hard not to like and respect Marc Cuban the individual .
He is a shrewd businessman , but he is not defined by it .
He 's able to have a great time and still contribute to some very noble causes .
4. Peter Thiel
Shaun Nichols : Peter
Thiel comes off to me as something of a cross between Larry Ellison , William Randolph Hearst and Ayn Rand .
He made a boatload of money as the founder of PayPal , and then moved into the venture capital industry with investments in the likes of Facebook , Linked In , Yelp and Friendster .
Not a bad record at all .
But it 's
Thiel 's actions outside of the board room that are the most interesting .
A hardened Libertarian , Thiel was a big supporter of 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul and earlier this year he wrote an article for the Cato Institute that was a bit contentious , to say the least .
Among the main points of the article was the suggestion that women 's suffrage was partly to blame for the decline of capitalism .
Thiel has also put his backing behind several major research projects , including anti-aging studies and artificial intelligence development .
Do n't be surprised if 30 years from now Thiel emerges as some sort of cryogenically - preserved computer - aided politically fanatical financial genius James Bond villain .
Iain Thomson :
Thiel really worries me .
He 's surfed the technological wave for fun and profit but there 's something about him that makes me think of Ross Perot .
Thiel is gaining a certain ideological following in Silicon Valley and the wider world beyond .
While some of his ideas are good a lot are simple bull - headed stupidity .
However , he has a fleeting bully pulpit to push them .
Technologists should stay out of politics .
Human beings are n't bits and bytes , no matter what market researchers will tell you .
Getting good at software does n't make you a world leader .
3. Ada Lovelace
Iain Thomson : Ada Lovelace had a rather unusual upbringing .
Her father , the poet Lord Byron , spent most of her early years organising revolution in foreign climes and her mother was that most unusual person of the 1800s , so meone who believed a woman should be educated too .
The notion that women could do just as well as men if given the same opportunities was a radical one but Ada repaid it in full , by excelling in science and mathematics .
She became a close friend of Charles Babbage , then building the first non-digital computer - the Difference Engine .
In 1843 she translated a book on the engine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea and included , in notes three times longer than the original book , that the engine could be used to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers .
It was the first computer program .
Babbage called her " The Enchantress of Numbers " and society was wowed by the woman .
She married the Earl of Lovelace and bore him three children before carrying on her work in the fields of mathematics .
But by the standards of the time she was even more outrageous .
She pawned her jewellery to cover gambling losses , drank prodigious amounts , smoked opium regularly and there were rumours of many infidelities .
Certainly not a woman Jane Austen would have approved of .
Shaun Nichols :
A hard - drinking , fun - loving empowered woman that also happens to be a computer genius is pretty rare today .
But in the early 19th century it is downright amazing .
As Iain mentioned , Lovelace was rare for her time in that she was a highly educated woman , but she also had an immense natural intellect .
When Babbage was designing his Difference Engine , it is said that Ada Lovelace wrote a series of instructions for manipulating the machine and creating an intended result .
Thus , she is widely regarded as the first computer programmer .
That she managed to do it all while living in aristocratic 1830 's England is absolutely mind - blowing .
2. Steve Jobs
Shaun Nichols : Iain , we really have to stop putting Jobs or Woz at the top of every list we make .
That said , Saint Steve most certainly deserves a spot on this list .
The Apple chief executive may be a marketing genius and technological visionary , but he 's also more than a little weird .
How many consumer electronics companies can trace their entire design philosophy back to a college calligraphy course ?
It is said that much of Jobs ' tastes for the simple yet elegant style of Apple 's products comes from a calligraphy he took in his days before Apple .
After founding Apple , it got even stranger .
As it grew from a garage operation to a major tech firm , Steve Jobs took a very hands - on approach to running things .
He was said to have recruited one engineer by simply unplugging his computer and carrying over to the Macintosh project office , all while the stunned engineer was sitting in front of his desk .
Then , he became chief executive of the company , and it got even worse .
Jobs strict management style and unpredictable nature have become legendary , and many who have worked at the company speak of his micromanagement .
Tech columnist Dan Lyons once likened Apple as " the church of Scientology goes into the computer business , " and he was n't far off in my opinion .
Iain Thomson : Silicon Valley historian Robert X. Cringely once told a tale about Steve Jobs that rings strangely true .
In Apple 's early days Jobs would wander the corridors , find an employee and ask them “ I thinks xxx is an asshole ; do you agree ? ”
If the employee said no he would walk on , but if they said yes he'd walk with them to someone else and say “ We think xxx is an asshole ; do you agree ? ”
With bosses like that who needs an excuse for an evening with a high tower and a rifle .
The problem is that Jobs has really good ideas .
You can put up with a lot so long as you 're surfing the winning wave and Jobs is so good for Apple .
Seeing how the company languished when he was away shows how Apple is dependent on strangeness .
It helps that Jobs at his best is the consummate salesman .
Want a computer you can't modify ?
Do n't like having removable batteries ?
Want an iPod without a screen ?
Apple 's got the brand for you .
1. Richard Stallman
Iain Thomson : Bill Gates once said that he'd be stunned if there were more than 50 people in the world with as much programming experience in the world as him when he started Microsoft .
Stallman was one of these but rather than become the richest men in the world he has devoted himself to a vision of how computing should be .
In many ways he shares a lot of attributes with Steve Jobs in his self - belief , but peppers his life with such oddity he had to make the number one spot .
After a knee injury forced him to abandon folk dancing ( I 'm not making this up ) Stallman devoted his time at MIT to polishing his software skills .
When DARPA introduced a password system at the computing centre he hacked the system to give unlimited access to those that wanted it .
His trailblazing work at the GNU project has made a world of free software available to all but Stallman retains his odd side , living a nomadic existence without the trophy house or even a mobile phone to his name .
He looks the part of the hairy hacker down to a tee too .
One wonders what government leaders think when Stallman bears down on them , but it certainly works .
He also inspires strangeness in others .
Stallman was presented with a Japanese fighting sword after the popular XKCD started publishing strips with him wielding one , or two .
As Hunter S. Thompson put it : “ When the going gets weird , the weird turn pro . ”
Shaun Nichols :
Not only can Stallman program better than Gates , but he can dance better than Woz .
He may look like an Appalachian hermit , and be as hard for journalists to contact as one ( the pre-conditions one must meet before interviewing him are quite extensive , ) but Richard Stallman is also a very admirable person .
As Iain mentioned , Stallman 's was such a brilliant programmer that had he gone commercial , he would likely have made himself a billionaire several times over .
Instead , he went completely the other way and devoted his efforts to creating and maintaining free software .
One has to admire the person who can turn down millions of guaranteed dollars and instead opt to give out his work for free , because almost none of us would have done the same thing in Stallman 's position .
His vision may also be a bit impractical , however .
While Stallman himself enjoys a more or less lifelong appointment at MIT , there are only so many Universities in the world , and while many developers have made a nice living writing Linux applications , the GNU licenses have also proven to be difficult for developers to work with , particularly when trying to interact with closed - source outfits such as Microsoft that do n't especially enjoying opening up their code to the outside world .
But I digress .
Stallman has for the last four decades been an unconventional and highly influential force in the computing world .
It 's safe to say there is no one like him in the world .
This is a weird one : Google has just slapped Cyanogen , maker of the biggest and most successful Android ROM mod around , with a cease - and - desist letter .
But Google 's reasoning does n't make any sense , and we 're wondering what their game is .
Advertisement
See , Google 's cease - and - desist specifically states that Cyanogen should stop passing around Google 's closed - source apps like Google Maps , Google Talk and Gmail , because those are only supposed to be used on Google Experience Android devices like the G1 and MyTouch 3G .
That makes sense , except for one thing : Cyanogen only works on the exact devices those closed - source apps were designed for , like , well , the G1 and MyTouch 3G .
So what 's the point of trying to stop Cyanogen ?
Engadget suggests that maybe Google just wants to discourage rooting of their devices in general , which seems awfully contrary to the Android open - source philosophy .
Truth is , we have no idea why Google would want to stop a thriving and well - received modder , but Cyanogen says he 's trying to open up some communication with the big G , so hopefully we 'll get an explanation soon .

Gillian Anderson is giving hope to The X - Files fanatics everywhere that she and David Duchnovy may reunite for a third installment in the film series .
“ There is n’t any reason not to do it , ” the actress said during an appearance at the Sarajevo Film Festival .
“ I feel a certain commitment to that group of people that I worked with and we still enjoy doing it , when we do it .
There is no reason why not to come together and do it again .
If they can pull it off , we ’ll find some reason to make it . ”
The film could be out in 2012 , Anderson said .
Anderson and Duchnovy starred in The X - Files on TV all through the 1990s .
The two films came out in 1998 and 2008 .
The least credible full - throated denial in recent memory may finally be coming to an end .
John Edwards is reportedly finally ready to admit that he 's the daddy .
Neil Lewis , NYT : [ A ] federal grand jury in nearby Raleigh is investigating whether any crimes were committed in connection with campaign laws in an effort to conceal his extramarital affair with a woman named Rielle Hunter .
At the same time , Mr. Edwards is moving toward an abrupt reversal in his public posture ; associates said in interviews that he is considering declaring that he is the father of Ms. Hunter ’s 19 - month - old daughter , something that he once flatly asserted in a television interview was not possible .
Friends and other associates of Mr. Edwards and his wife of 32 years , Elizabeth , say she has resisted the idea of her husband ’s claiming paternity .
Mrs. Edwards , who is battling cancer , “ has yet to be brought around , ” said one family friend , who like others spoke about the situation on the condition of anonymity , pointing to the complicated and delicate nature of the issue .
The situation may become more fraught , as people who know Ms. Hunter said she was planning to move with her daughter , Frances , from New Jersey to North Carolina in coming months .
Keep reading >
The admission appears to be the result of :
the grand jury investigation , in which prosecutors are pressing forward with a flimsy legal claim ( hush - money paid to Hunter should have been declared as campaign donations ) .
Edwards is likely hopeful that if he comes completely clean , prosecutors will abandon their claims .
a book proposal circulated by the Edwards aide who originally took the fall , Andrew Young , in which he says Edwards has always known everything and orchestrated the cover - up ( selling the book , of course , is pretty sleazy , too )
the fact that there likely is n't a soul left on earth who has seen the pictures of the baby who still believes that Edwards is n't the father .
The only question now , it seems , is whether Edwards will eventually also admit that he loves Hunter , which is clearly what she has been hanging around for all along .
There 's no other reason to endure the fury Elizabeth Edwards has wrought as the woman scorned .
If Edwards does eventually admit that , Hunter will have played the whole thing perfectly .

( CNN ) -- President Obama has ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA - backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001 .
In an exclusive , CNN talked with President Obama in Ghana about his order to review alleged deaths of Taliban .
" The indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention , " Obama told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview during the president 's visit to Ghana .
The full interview will air 10 p.m. Monday .
" So what I 've asked my national security team to do is to collect the facts for me that are known , and we 'll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up , " Obama said .
The inquiry stems from the deaths of at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners who had surrendered to the U.S. - backed Northern Alliance in late 2001 .
The fighters were in the custody of troops led by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum , a prominent Afghan warlord who has served as chief of staff of the country 's post - Taliban army .
Dostum , a former communist union boss and militia leader who fought against the U.S. - backed mujahedeen in the 1980s , is known for switching sides as Afghanistan 's political conflict has evolved .
When the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington , Dostum sided with the Americans and received military and CIA support to battle the Taliban .
The allegations against him first surfaced in a 2002 Newsweek report , which cited a confidential U.N. memo saying the prisoners died in cramped container trucks while being transported from their Konduz stronghold in northern Afghanistan to Sheberghan prison , west of Dostum 's stronghold at Mazar-e Sharif .
At the time , the Boston , Massachusetts - based group Physicians for Human Rights said it found a mass grave in nearby Dasht-e Leili , where witnesses said the bodies of Taliban prisoners were buried .
The finding prompted U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks , who led the invasion of Afghanistan , to support an investigation into the allegations .
But The New York Times , citing government officials and human rights organizations , reported Friday that the Bush administration " repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode . "
State Department officials recently have tried to derail Dostum 's reappointment as military chief of staff to Afghan President Hamid Karzai , the newspaper reported , citing several senior officials who suggested the administration " might not be hostile to an inquiry . "
Dostum , a key ally of Karzai , was reportedly living in exile in Turkey until last month , when he was reinstated to his post as defense minister .
He had left Afghanistan over allegations that he had kidnapped Akbar Bai , a former ally turned political rival .
When asked by CNN about whether Obama would support an investigation , the president replied , " I think that , you know , there are responsibilities that all nations have , even in war .
And if it appears that our conduct in some way supported violations of laws of war , then I think that , you know , we have to know about that . "
Watch part of CNN 's exclusive interview with the president »
Susannah Sirkin , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights , on Sunday praised Obama " for ordering his national security team to collect all the facts in the Dasht - e - Leili massacre and apparent U.S. cover -up . "
" U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating jointly and accepted the surrender of the prisoners jointly with General Dostum 's forces in northern Afghanistan , " Sirkin said earlier in the week .
" The Obama administration has a legal obligation to determine what U.S. officials knew , where U.S. personnel were , what involvement they had , and the actions of US allies during and after the massacre .
These questions , nearly eight years later , remain unanswered . "

Entire villages of people in north Yemen are being forced to flee by bands of Shia rebels as a sharp escalation of violence in the region prompts warnings that the conflict could become as bitter as that in Darfur .
Fighting in the unstable Arab country , where weapons outnumber people and 50 per cent are illiterate , has already displaced about 150,000 souls .
In the past month the conflict has worsened , leaving tens of thousands without access to water and sanitation .
And in the past 48 hours , sources reported that two of the largest tribes have begun to polarise behind opposing sides , with one amassing behind the Yemeni president 's " popular army " and another falling in behind the Shia rebels , known as al - Houthi .
Aid agencies are concerned that a tribal element to the fighting could add immeasurably to its ferocity .
The Yemeni government has accused the Iranians and Muqtada al - Sadr , the Iraqi radical Shia leader , of helping the rebels who , in turn , claim that they have come under regular attacks from Saudi warplanes .
The Shia rebels , Zaidis , were accused by the Yemeni government of carrying out the recent kidnapping of a group of foreigners including a Briton .
Critics say that while waging its campaign against the Shias , President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's administration has done little to combat Sunni al - Qa'ida .

Sources on the ground said yesterday that rebel gunmen fighting government forces in the Saada region , the area isolated by the conflict , are forcing civilians to join them in fighting or face torture or death .
One who visited a camp in Haradh spoke to villagers at the centre of the violence who were given ultimatums by al - Houthi troops .
The source said : " They are told to join the rebels or leave or be killed .
The population of one village refused to join the rebellion and has fled to Haradh or Saada town .
Two families were killed and many others have been tortured . "
Last Thursday , the government in the capital , Sanaa , ordered air strikes directed at the rebels but which were reported to have killed 87 refugees sheltering in camps , prompting outrage from aid agencies .
Following the air raid on Thursday , the al - Houthi rebels issued a statement condemning the " bloodthirsty " authorities for perpetrating a " massacre " .
It was claimed that many of the 87 killed were women and children .
But there were counterclaims that the rebels had infiltrated the camps , forcing refugees to flee .
Yesterday , the government offered a conditional ceasefire to mark the three - day Eid al - Fitr holiday that ends Ramadan , but the rebels were not quick to seize on it .
They said they would monitor the situation on the ground before responding formally .
Ceasefires do not have a good record in the country .
The last one , two weeks ago , fell apart within hours , and the conditions set by the government this time – which include removal of roadblocks and withdrawal of rebel forces – do not bode well .
Rebels and government troops have been fighting for years , but the violence has worsened in the past month .
The UN issued a " flash " appeal for emergency aid earlier this month but received little response .
Aid agencies are unable to get access to a large area of the Saada governorate .
Roads are blocked ; there are frequent blackouts and mobile phone signals are jammed .
Water supply and sanitation services are virtually non-existent , and about 25,000 people are trapped in Saada town and have not received any assistance by any humanitarian agency for weeks .
The World Food Programme is trying to gain access through Saudi Arabia .
There are several thousand refugees living in tents at the camp at Haradh , in the south of Saada region and 12 miles from the frontline .
The camp has been accessed by aid agencies but roads further north remained blocked .
" There is very little access to water [ in the area of fighting ] .
People are living in very poor conditions , " said the local source .
Oxfam and other aid agencies were providing clean water and sanitation at the camps .
A spokesman for Oxfam said : " Tens of thousands of lives hang in the balance , caught in the crossfire .
Saada in particular has been virtually cut off from the outside world and countless civilians there are undoubtedly suffering abominable conditions .
The situation is deteriorating for people who 've had to go another day without food , water , or protection from violence .
It is nearly impossible to know what the exact conditions are for 60 per cent of people who have been forced to flee their homes . "
There is a long - standing rivalry between al - Houthis , who are Shia Muslims , and government forces accused of using extremist Sunni forces .
Besides the sectarian divide , reports were emerging of a " dangerous polarisation " between various tribes , with the Hashed tribe rallying itself behind the government while the Bakil , the second largest in the region , has aligned itself to al - Houthi rebels .

Sources stopped short of warning that the situation was on the verge of ethnic cleansing on the scale of Darfur or Rwanda , but said there were " worrying parallels " and that the situation could worsen .
The government in Sanaa claims the rebels want to restore a Shia state that fell in the 1960s and accuse Shia power Iran of waging a proxy conflict .
The rebels say they want autonomy and accuse President Saleh of despotism and corruption , as well as introducing Sunni fundamentalism via his alliance with Riyadh .
Instability in Yemen has alarmed Washington , London and neighbouring Saudi Arabia .
An aid source added : " There is a real risk that the Yemen will collapse to levels of insecurity seen in Somalia and Afghanistan . "
Following the air strike , Foreign Secretary David Miliband called on both sides to avoid harming civilians and to allow humanitarian access to the victims .
He added : " Continued fighting will only bring about further suffering for civilians in a region which has witnessed years of violent unrest .
Both sides have a responsibility urgently to reach a settlement which protects the safety and security of the Yemeni people . "
The current conflict , which began on 12 August , is the sixth in Saada since 2004 and follows a ceasefire in July 2008 .
The 22 million population of Yemen – 30 per cent of whom are Shia – is the poorest in the Middle East .
Analysts claim economic reasons are fuelling the fighting .
Yemen is set to run out of oil within a few years , while al - Houthis have been disproportionately denied resources .
The country has long been a breeding ground for Islamist militants , and Osama bin Laden 's family migrated from there to Saudi Arabia .
A group claiming to represent al - Qa'ida announced recently that it had merged with its Saudi counterpart to form " al - Qa'ida in the Arab peninsula " , AQAP .
According to Yemeni estimates , which the US maintains is too conservative , about 1,500 Islamist fighters are based there .
The tensions are not overly evident in the capital , Sanaa , where the slow pace of life becomes soporific in the afternoon when large numbers of the male population retire to chew the narcotic khat .
But beneath the surface there are signs of the growing presence of international Islamists and militant preachers , followed by the arrival of Western counterterrorist officials .
Both sides are seemingly preparing for Yemen to provide the next episode in the " war on terror " .
The shadow chancellor wants a tougher regulatory system A Conservative government would seek to stop the payment of large bonuses across the banking system , shadow chancellor George Osborne has said .
He told the Guardian that handing out big awards backed by state guarantees was " unacceptable " , even for banks that were not part - owned by the taxpayer .
Such guarantees were meant to allow banks to rebuild balance sheets and aid lending , not reward bankers , he said .
Mr Osborne also renewed his calls for a new financial regulatory system .
" It is totally unacceptable for bank bonuses to be paid on the back of taxpayer guarantees , " he told the paper .
" It must stop . "
" These banks need to live in the real world , where the country 's in a deep recession , and where the taxpayer has spent billions of pounds , not just bailing out some failed banks , but also underpinning the rest of the banking system , " he continued .
You cannot privatise the gains and socialise the loss in the way that has happened
George Osborne
Shadow chancellor
The hundreds of billions of pounds of state guarantees , such as those provided through the Bank of England special liquidity scheme , were supporting all banks , he argued , and therefore they should be prevented from using them to pay staff huge rewards .
He said : " If it 's the case that banks are using those guarantees and actually engaging in pretty low - risk activity and making huge profits on the back of it , and then paying huge bonuses , I think action needs to be taken . "
Powerful regulator
The Conservatives have pledged , in effect , to scrap the current regulator , the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , and hand its powers to a strengthened Bank of England .
Mr Osborne argued a strong regulator would not have allowed bonuses recently awarded to staff at Barclays - a bank that did not receive a direct injection of taxpayers ' cash .
" In the end , the regulator has to have the power to tell banks to stop doing things that they think are detrimental to the health not just of that bank , but the broader banking system .
And I think they should exercise that power , " he said .
If there 's an issue , MPs should change the existing law or the mandate given to the regulator
Financial Services Authority
But a spokesman for the FSA said it could only operate within the powers given to it by law .
" If more is needed by politicians then governments need to act through a further act of parliament .
" We are not a moral regulator .
If there 's an issue , MPs should change the existing law or the mandate given to the regulator . "
He added that during the FSA 's five - month consultation on bankers pay earlier in the year , the Conservatives never expressed an opinion .
Following that consultation , the FSA announced this week that bankers ' pay deals were to be linked more closely with long - term profitability under new rules .
It said bonuses should not be guaranteed for more than a year , and that senior employees should have their bonuses spread over three years .
The shadow chancellor went on to argue that short - term profits in the banking system should not " come at the expense of long - term costs for the rest of society " .
The Tories are not alone in calling for changes to the way bank staff are rewarded .
On Thursday , Lord Mandelson said excessive pay and bonuses for bankers should not be allowed to drive risk - taking in the City .

Animal Odd Couples : Unlikely Duos Find Friendship
Odd animal bonds show us how friendships forms in the most curious places .
Sept. 25 , 2009  --
You 'd have to see it to believe it .
A kitten and a crow .
A primate and a pup .
Even a predator and its prey .
Defying the laws of nature itself , animal odd couples forge friendships under the most peculiar circumstances .
But in the process , they show us that humans are n't the only members of the animal kingdom to demonstrate complex emotions and traits .
" To know that these animals are capable of emotions like love and understanding and caring , like we are , is quite an eye - opener , " Tony Fitzjohn , a conservationist with Wildlife Now , says on a National Geographic program airing Saturday .
" Unlikely Animal Friends " features six of the most curious couples the animal kingdom has ever seen .
Here are a few of our favorites .
Orangutan and Hound Dog Become Best Buds
One was an outgoing orangutan , the other an underfed stray dog .
But since the moment they met , Suryia and Roscoe have been inseparable .
Bhagavan " Doc " Antle , founder of The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species ( TIGERS ) in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , said Roscoe , a Bluetick Coonhound , followed him and Suryia , one of TIGERS ' orangutans , through the park 's gate one day in 2006 .
As soon as Suryia saw Roscoe , he ran over to him and started playing , Antle said .
After a few unsuccessful phone calls to find an owner , Antle decided to let Roscoe stay .
Now , the pair has a ball frolicking around the park .
For a few hours each day , they swim or roll around in the grass .
Suryia will even grab Roscoe 's leash and take him for walks around the enclosure , Antle said .
" To me , they seem like long - lost friends .
They would make you believe in reincarnation , " he said .
Aging Tortoise Nurtures Abandoned Hippo
After a tsunami washed away his herd and stranded him , a young hippo found himself a most unusual ally : a 130 - year - old tortoise .
The 2004 tsunami that devastated Indonesia also hit the eastern shores of Kenya .
And after the storm left Owen , a small hippo , all alone , conservationists found a home for him in Haller Park , an animal sanctuary in Mombasa , Kenya .
They hoped that he could be a companion for a female hippo whose previous companion had died .
But before they could introduce him to the other adult hippos ( which can be aggressive and territorial ) , they wanted to give him a quiet place of his own to adjust .
And it was there that he met his buddy Mzee , an Aldabra giant tortoise whose name means " old man " in Swahili .
" He ran straight for the tortoise , " said Sabine Baer , of Lafarge Eco Systems , which manages Haller Park .
" The color is somehow similar like a hippo color .
It was somehow round - shaped , so he must have associated it with an adult hippo and with his mother and his family . "
At first , it was Owen who made the friendly overtures .
But after a while , Mzee appeared to warm up to the heavyset hippo .
They slept together and ate together and even appeared to cuddle together .
Owen would nuzzle Mzee 's foot when he wanted to eat and Mzee would nibble Owen 's tail to steer him .
" [ Mzee ] taught him to eat the cut leaves , he taught him to eat carrots , so for us , it was an absolute blessing to have that relationship to help us raise Owen , " said Baer .
But though the pair became even closer and quite famous , inspiring a Web site and children 's books , Baer and others worried that as Owen grew , he would put his smaller friend at risk .
So they decided it was time to move Owen into an enclosure with Cleo , the female hippo who had been waiting for him .
At first , the two eyed each other with suspicion .
But it was n't long before it seemed as though Cleo slowly replaced Mzee in Owen 's heart .
And , occupied with a new tortoise companion of his own , Mzee did n't seem to mind at all .
" They became inseparable like Owen used to be with Mzee , and now they are together , living together happily ever after , " said Baer .
Lion Recognizes Owners After Separation
Christian was just a 30 - pound cub when Ace Bourke and John Rendall found him in a cage at Harrod 's department store in London .
But since that moment in 1969 , Christian the lion has become a media sensation , capturing the imagination of people all over the world with his story of unlikely love .
Although he made for a peculiar pet , Bourke and Rendall brought him home and cared for him until he grew to a strapping 130 pounds .
They kept him in their furniture store and bonded with him as they would a more traditional house pet .
" They just loved each other , " said Wildlife Now 's Fitzjohn .
" Christian adored them .
Ace and John basically were surrogate parents to Christian .
They fed him and groomed him and made sure he was safe , and did n't get in trouble , and just wanted the best for him in life . "
But as Christian grew , the friends knew that their urban accommodations would soon become an insufficient home .
So , with the help of actor Bill Travers , they contacted George Adamson , a conservationist in Kenya , who agreed to reintroduce Christian to his natural habitat .
Bourke and Rendall flew with Christian to the Kora National Reserve in Kenya .
When it was clear that Christian would blend with the lions already there , the friends said their goodbyes .
Although the transition was difficult , Christian eventually lived and thrived with a group of lionesses in the wild .
But his first owners missed him terribly and one year later returned to Kenya .
They did n't know what to expect or if Christian would remember them .
But the lion 's greeting said it all .
Immediately , the 300 - pound creature raced to the pair and leapt up to embrace them .
" Once they 've given you that trust and their affection , they do n't forget who you are and what your relationship was any more than a kid forgets who his mother is , however long , " Fitzjohn said .
African Predator Adopts Her Prey
In one of the most extreme examples of odd animal pairings , a lioness in Kenya adopted a baby antelope in 2001 .
Conservationists were dumbfounded as to why the lion , a top African predator , would care for its own prey .
" I could n't believe my ears when I first heard about the adoption .
I just thought that 's absolute nonsense .
Give it a few hours and that lioness will definitely eat the calf , " said Saba Douglas - Hamilton , a conservationist with Nairobi , Kenya - based Save the Elephants .
The lioness was dubbed Kamuniak , which means " blessed one " in the local Samburu language .
She would n't let the young oryx out of her sight .
" It was very moving to watch , " said Douglas - Hamilton .
But the situation was deadly for both .
Caught at opposite ends of the food chain , neither would eat while they were together .
The lion would n't hunt and the young calf had no way to get milk .
Douglas - Hamilton said she and others thought the lion had experienced some sort of trauma that " clicked a switch " in her brain , and caused her to see " baby " instead of " food " when she looked at the oryx .
For weeks , the pair traveled the wilderness together .
But the relationship was not meant to last .
One day while drinking by the river , Kamuniak let the oryx out of her sight for a few seconds – and another lion leapt out of the bushes and attacked the baby .
" [ Kamuniak ] was clearly terrified of the male lion but she acted exactly like a mother losing her cub , she could n't leave the scene , " said Douglas - Hamilton .
But the very next day the lioness went out and killed an impala and fed herself .
She went on to adopt five more oryx calves , though none of the relationships lasted as long as the first , she said .
" It was really charming to see them together .
It was like something out of a fairy tale and there was a real sort of intimacy between them .
It was really strange .
But then again , we develop strong intimate relationships with our pets which are different species , " said Douglas - Hamilton .
" We do it ?
Why can't lions ? "
Elephant and Dog Become Best Buddies
If bonds were based on size , these two would n't even be acquaintances .
But somehow Bella , a 30 - pound dog , and Tara , a 4 - ton Asian elephant , have become the best of friends since meeting in 2005 .
" They are close .
They are always together .
They play together , they talk .
They sleep , they eat – everything together , " said Carol Buckley , founder of The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald , Tennessee .
One day , while exploring property near their sanctuary , Buckley and her partner , Scott Blais , came across a white chow mix that appeared to have a bizarre fascination with big pieces of equipment , such as tractors .
The two brought her home and watched as that attraction extended to the hulking creatures at their park , including one in particular : Tara the elephant .
" Elephants are incredibly careful around their young .
Even when they 're running and a baby is running around in and around their legs , family members never trip up over a baby .
They never nick the baby , they never step on the baby , so I never was concerned for Tara and Bella , " said Buckley .
In 2007 , when an injury partially paralyzed Bella and forced her indoors , Tara held a vigil outside her window and called to her until caretakers brought her outside .
Bella's injury eventually healed and the two now roam the refuge together again .
" It 's 24/7 .
It is a very loving and compassionate relationship they have , " said Buckley .
" They play together and they never want to be separated . "
" Unlikely Animal Friends " will air Saturday , Sept. 26 at 8 p.m. ET on the National Geographic channel .

How human eyes could detect quantum entanglement :
A single - photon qubit is amplified through cloning via stimulated emission in a nonlinear crystal ( red box ) .
The clones are split into two orthogonal polarization modes , with the polarization basis varied with the help of a wave plate ( green box ) .
Each mode is then detected by a naked human eye .
Image credit : Pavel Sekatski , et al .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
By greatly amplifying one photon from an entangled photon pair , physicists have theoretically shown that human eyes can be used as detectors to observe quantum effects .
Usually , detecting quantum phenomena requires sensitive photon detectors or similar technology , keeping the quantum world far removed from our everyday experience .
By showing that it ’s possible to perform quantum optics experiments with human eyes as detectors , the physicists can bring quantum phenomena closer to the macroscopic level and to everyday life .
The group of physicists is from the University of Geneva , and includes Pavel Sekatski , Nicolas Brunner ( also from the University of Bristol ) , Cyril Branciard , Nicolas Gisin , and Christoph Simon .
In their study published in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters , the scientists theoretically show how human eyes can be used to detect a large Bell inequality violation , which proves the existence of quantum entanglement .
As the physicists explain , the key to achieving human - eye detection of quantum effects is to use the process of quantum cloning by stimulated emission .
Recently , using quantum cloning , researchers in Rome have experimentally created tens of thousands of clones starting from a single - photon .
Then , by amplifying one photon of an entangled pair , the researchers managed to demonstrate entanglement .
In order to do this , specific detectors are required , which can distinguish two orthogonal amplified states with a high success rate .
Now , what Sekatski and co-workers have shown is that the human eye performs extremely well at the task of distinguishing between orthogonal amplified states .
This is a consequence of the eye 's main characteristic , namely as a detection threshold .
Below a certain threshold number of incoming photons , the eye remains blind ( no light is seen ) , whereas above the threshold the efficiency ( i.e. the probability of seeing ) is close to one .
In their calculations , the authors also considered the influence of experimental imperfections , such as photon losses , which are inevitable in a real experiment .
They found that the setup is surprisingly robust .
A strong Bell violation can be obtained even in case of high losses , demonstrating the presence of entanglement .
This is a very astonishing feature since entanglement is generally an extremely fragile property , highly sensitive to experimental imperfections such as losses .
To solve this apparent paradox , the scientists uncovered a loophole in the system .
They showed that a specific multi-photon state could actually behave exactly as the entangled state .
Therefore , the high Bell violation actually witnesses the entanglement of the original photon pair , i.e. before the amplification occurs , but not the entanglement between the amplified state and the single photon .
Still , the authors show that the amplified state and the single photon are nevertheless entangled , but revealing this entanglement would require more sophisticated measurements .
This subtle issue provides a much better understanding of the quantum nature of amplified states , which were recently the subject of a controversy among the scientific community .
As the researchers finally note , using human eyes as detectors in actual quantum experiments will face significant technical challenges .
However , the possibility of observing quantum effects directly with our own eyes is fascinating .
Naked eye observation would bring the observer one step closer to the quantum world .
“ From our theoretical study , the experimental perspectives appear very promising , ” Brunner told PhysOrg.com .
He added that , although there will be many technical challenges , Nicolas Gisin ’s research group in Geneva has already started working on experiments .

Lou Dobbs is upset that a Latin television station wants to make people less afraid of census workers by including a plot line in one of their soap operas titled " Do n't be afraid to be counted . "
DON BROWNE , PRESIDENT , TELEMUNDO :
This character will live in the novella and basically be entertaining but educational , because education , empowering people with good , accurate information is really critical to the success of the Census .
INES FERRE , CNN CORRESPONDENT :
When it comes to Latin television , no other genre is more popular with more viewers than steamy , plot - driven telenovellas , or soap operas .
For the first time , a telenovella will include a plot line surrounding a U.S. Census message .
" Do n't be afraid to be counted . "
Telemundo's top soap opera " Mas Sabe el Diablo " or " The Devil Knows Best , " will soon feature Michelle Vargas playing the role of a young Census Bureau recruiter .
DOBBS : Well , fans -- if you like that , you 're going to love this .
Fans of telenovellas on Spanish - language television could soon be seeing more than they tuned in for as well .
The Telemundo network , owned by NBC , will incorporate a story line in a popular soap opera to promote the U.S. Census .
That 's right .
They 're going to put that into a storyline .
It is part of an Obama administration plan to make sure the Latino population is fully counted next year .
Ines Ferre with our report .
FERRE : This is the first time that Telemundo and its Spanish - language competitors have partnered on a national level with the Census Bureau .
Univision set up a toll - free number for questions and is planning a special program and heavy news coverage .
Government messages have aired on network programs before .
Nancy Reagan appeared on " Diff'rent Strokes " to promote the " just say no to drugs " campaign .
Michelle Obama recently taped a PSA for " Sesame Street . "
But one media critic says putting a government message in a telenovella is less transparent .
HOWARD KURTZ , HOST , " RELIABLE SOURCES " :
If Barack Obama or Michelle Obama or anybody else in the government wants to go on an entertainment show -- Leno , Letterman , even a soap opera -- and deliver a message , that 's fine , because you know what you 're getting .
But if you 're tuning into Telemundo and you 're watching some soap opera that has a plot about a Census worker , you probably do n't know that the U.S. government has had a hand in crafting that particular drama .
FERRE : Telemundo says it has total independent control of its program .
With nearly 47 million Hispanics in the U.S. , the Census has big political implications .
Recently , Hispanics have tended to vote Democrat .
The Census , as mandated by the Constitution , determines how many seats each state will get in the House , and how states draw up congressional districts .
Every year , more than $ 400 billion are doled out based on Census data .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
FERRE : And the Census numbers are also important for the way TV households are sampled .
The bigger the audience , the more ad revenue the networks can generate .
Now , the Census Bureau says it plans to make ad buys on media outlets to get its message across , but as far as a telenovella character is concerned , the Census Bureau says it did not pay Telemundo any money , Lou , to put that character in there .
DOBBS : Well , it 's an interesting business proposition .
Why Telemundo -- they are a small , they are a relatively small player compared to , say , Univision .
FERRE : Right .
Well , actually , Univision , they get their telenovellas canned from Mexico , from Telavisa .
So they say they do not have any editorial control over ...
DOBBS : They have no editorial control .
They 're just a distributor .
FERRE : ... the telenovellas .
DOBBS : All right .
And how much money is this worth ?
Does anybody have an estimate for Telemundo ?
FERRE : No , we do not have any estimate as far as how much money it could be worth .
DOBBS : All right , we will find out .
Why not ?
The government is everywhere else , why not in a soap opera ?
That 's -- he asked rhetorically .
Andriy Shevchenko's ineffective and anti-climatic career at Chelsea came to an end last night after the Ukrainian forward signed a two - year deal at his former club Dynamo Kyiv , with Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti's blessing , after mustering nine league goals during his time at the Premier League club .
The 33 - year - old , who cost a then English record £ 30 m when he signed from Milan in 2006 , is to be presented at a press conference in Kiev today and has been appointed Dynamo 's new captain .
After talks with the Chelsea owner , Roman Abramovich , Shevchenko , right , has been released from the remaining 11 months of his £ 121,000 - a- week contract at Stamford Bridge having accepted he would play a limited part in the first team following amicable talks with Ancelotti .
' Roman Abramovich and everyone at Chelsea have been very kind to me , ' the striker said .

As Pam Spaulding puts it -- it 's like a broken record .
Yet another member of the pious set proves the far - right judgmental conservative set is populated with a boatload of deviants .
In a Virginia Beach Circuit Courtroom in separate hearings , Stephen Lee McPherson , 40 , and Melina Ann McPherson , 37 pled guity of taking indecent liberties with a minor -- not one incident , mind you , but several between 1996 and 2000 involving three sisters .
It occurred while the McPhersons were house parents at Hope Haven Children ’s Home .
It makes you sick .
Read on ...
Pat Robertson must be proud .
I wonder if he knew how sick these people were ?
I 've lost count of all the Republicans and so called " good christians " who 've been caught doing despicable things to children .
This was some sick stuff , and they used bible passages to justify it all :
Here 's another portion of Michael Moore 's interview with Wolf Blitzer from Sept. 24 , 2009 .
Michael is exactly right about one thing here .
You 're not seeing the passion on the left in support of the President because he started from a compromised position instead of starting with single payer and compromising from there if need be .
He is also correct that if , not when , the President ever came out for single payer , you would see massive amounts of people coming out and supporting him .
You 're not going to see that passion on the left for a watered down giveaway to the insurance industry .
BLITZER : That 's what President Obama said back in 2003 .
But now he 's backed away from that as president of the United States and he seems to be backing away even from the so - called public option , which would allow the government -- a government - run health insurance company to compete with the private insurance companies .
Is this what you wanted ?
MOORE : Well , here 's the -- here 's the problem with President Obama on the health insurance proposal .
He 's a nice guy .
You know , I mean , really , I believe he came into the White House with an olive branch to the people on the other side of the aisle .
He believed in bipartisanship .
I mean you 've got to give the guy credit .
He really -- he did not come in wanting to fight .
He came in saying , you know , we 're all Americans here and we need to fix this and we need to put aside this partisan stuff .
The other side did n't want to put it aside .
The other side wanted to fight him tooth and nail .
And -- and as part of his nice guy thing , he -- he backs a half measure , a public option .
BLITZER : But that might not even ...
MOORE : And we ( INAUDIBLE ) ...
BLITZER : That might not even make the final bill that he signs .
MOORE : And that may not .
Well , of course not , because any time you do n't fight for the thing you want , any time that you start off compromising , you 're never going to get what you want .
He started off with a compromise position -- let the private insurance companies still sit at the table , have a public option .
He should have started with what he truly believes in , what he believed in , what he said in 2003 , a single payer , national health care system , like all other Western countries have .
We should have the same thing .
I know he believes in that , but he was trying to reach out and say , you know what , I 'm not just going to come in here and ram this , so I 'm willing to work with you and listen to your concerns .
They do n't want to listen to him .
When the folks at Square Enix throw a party , they really throw a party .
Tonight in Tokyo , Square Enix put together a private press event known simply as the Final Fantasy XIII Premiere Party .
Focused almost entirely on the upcoming RPG that will usher the legendary franchise onto current - gen consoles , the event was a somewhat unusual mix of a standard press conference and a launch party .
Several stage presentations ( hosted by TV personality Mona Yamamoto ) were given to announce some major news regarding the game , while playable demos were available off to the sides for attendees to enjoy .
There were also , of course , many yummy drinks to go around and flashy lights to get lost in .
If you want to get a better sense of the event as it happened , feel free to check my live blog that was tragically cut short by a dead battery and less - than - ideal blogging conditions .
Below is a brief overview of the event for those who are Final Fantasy obsessed ( like me ) .
I encourage the reader to remember that the entire party was hosted in Japanese , so a number of details were unfortunately lost .
However , all the major announcements should be covered .
Arguably the biggest announcement to spring forth from the ritzy affair , Square Enix officially announced the release date and price point for the Japanese version of Final Fantasy XIII PS3 BundleKaz Hirai made a brief appearance in order to comment on the recent successes of the Final Fantasy games on the PlayStation family of platforms .
His presence also corresponded with the announcement of a new PS3 bundle , which will include a copy of the game .
This is the only detail available right now , as pricing and launch dates were not discussed .
This is not confirmed for a U.S. launch , but a western version of the bundle seems plausible .
Final Fantasy XIII ElixirWhile not entirely videogame related , Square Enix took this opportunity to unveil the Final Fantasy XIII branded elixir , which was served at the party to the sea of eager Japanese press and the occasionally befuddled U.S. journalist ( see : Clements ) .
The elixir is scheduled for launch this winter in Japan and the logo for the drink marks one of the first times the font for the words " Final Fantasy " was allowed to be changed ( it looks a bit curvier ) .
A marvelous Square Enix PR representative allowed me to sample her glass of elixir .
I was not a fan .
The hands - on demo of the game was arguably the " main course " of the evening , as stations were set up along the sides of the venue for everyone to play -- in very short bursts .
The demo boasted two different missions to experience : one that followed Lightning and Hope and another that followed Snow and his crew .
Both were entirely new and featured new environments and mid-battle summons .
This was the first time these summons were available in a hands - on demo .
Although my time with the game was short , I 'm still amazed at Final Fantasy XIII 's character models .
It 's a really pretty game .
As I covered in my hands - on article , Square Enix ended the night by debuting a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy XIII , which was a great way to complement the playable demo .
Although it was being shown on a particularly pleasing system ( massive HD screen and ear - shattering speakers ) , I found the trailer itself to be of special quality .
There were some stunning CG sequences in there , including a bittersweet kiss between Snow and newly announced Serah .
The trailer also reveals that Sazh 's summon will be the one and only Ifrit ( if looks are anything to go by ) , which transforms into a hotrod with machine guns .
Yes , that 's what actually happens .
Cocoon SymphonicsParty guests were treated to an incredible performance by the Cocoon Symphonics group -- a terribly talented , full orchestra -- which played three songs from the Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack composed by Masashi Hamauzu .
Each piece was stunning and hearing the performance in person really was a wonderful experience .
The first piece actually started with a beautiful piano solo which , upon completion , queued the curtains behind the stage to rise up and reveal the rest of the orchestra in all its glory .
Special Performance by Sayuri SugawaraOne of the highlights for me was the performance that followed Cocoon Symphonic 's three - piece set .
Square Enix revealed the title track artist for Final Fantasy XIII , Sayuri Sugawara , who then came on stage and performed the game 's Japanese title track , " Kimiga Irukara , " with the orchestra as backup .
To say that the performance was " mesmerizing " would be an understatement .
Sugawara 's powerful , skilled voice was only matched by her humble grace on stage , and the end of the song was greeted with a wave of applause .
My only regret is that I was n't given the opportunity to get her autograph ...
OlyPMR member Brendan Maslauskas Dunn said in an interview Monday that he received a copy of the e-mail from the city of Olympia in response to a public records request asking for any information the city had about " anarchists , anarchy , anarchism , SDS ( Students for a Democratic Society ) , or Industrial Workers of the World . "
( Jeremy Pawloski , " Fort Lewis investigates claims employee infiltrated Olympia peace group , " The Olympian , July 27 , 2009 )
The WJAC is a clearinghouse of sorts of anti-terrorism information and sensitive intelligence that is gathered and disseminated to law enforcement agencies across the state .
The WJAC receives money from the federal government .
The substance of nearly all of the WJAC 's e-mails to Olympia police officials had been blacked out in the copies provided to The Olympian .

There has been extensive political debate in the United States on how safe it would be to move Guantanamo 's detainees to US soil -- but what about their interrogators ?
One intelligence officer , Kia Grapham , is hawked by her contracting company to the Washington State Patrol .
Grapham 's confidential resume boasts of assisting in over 100 interrogations of " high value human intelligence targets " at Guantanamo .
She goes on , saying how she is trained and certified to employ Restricted Interrogation Technique : Separation as specified by FM 2 - 22.3 Appendix M .
Others , like , Neoma Syke , managed to repeatedly flip between the military and contractor intelligence work - - without even leaving the building .
The file details the placement of six intelligence contractors inside the Washington Joint Analytical Center ( WAJAC ) on behalf of the Washington State Patrol at a cost of around $ 110,000 per year each .
Such intelligence " fusion " centers , which combine the military , the FBI , state police , and others , have been internally promoted by the US Army as means to avoid restrictions preventing the military from spying on the domestic population .
( Julian Assange , " The spy who billed me twice , " Wikileaks , July 29 , 2009 )
Sound familiar ?
Call it standard operating procedure in post - constitutional America where high - level officials and senior officers walk away scott - free while grunts bear the burden , and do hard time , for the crimes of their superiors .
Another case which is emblematic of the close cooperation among fusion centers and military intelligence is the case of John J. Towery , a Ft. Lewis , Washington civilian contractor who worked for the Army 's Fort Lewis Force Protection Unit .
In July , andbroke the story of how Towery had infiltrated and spied on the Olympia Port Militarization Resistance ( OlyPMR ) , an antiwar group , and shared this information with police .
Since 2006 , the group has staged protests at Washington ports and has sought to block military cargo from being shipped to Iraq .
According to What Dunn discovered was highly disturbing to say the least .
Towery , who posed as an anarchist under the name " John Jacob , " had infiltrated OlyPMR and was one of several listserv administrators that had control over the group 's electronic communications .
The civilian intelligence agent admitted to Dunn that he had spied on the group but claimed that no one paid him and that he did n't report to the military ; a statement that turned out to be false .
Joseph Piek , a Fort Lewis spokesperson confirmed tothat Towery was a contract employee and that the infiltrator " performs sensitive work within the installation law enforcement community , " but " it would not be appropriate for him to discuss his duties with the media .
"
In September , obtained thousands of pages of emails from the City of Olympia in response to that publication 's public - records requests .
The newspaper revealed that the Washington Joint Analytical Center ( WJAC ) , a fusion center , had copied messages to Towery on the activities of OlyPMR in the run-up to the group 's November 2007 port protests .
According to the paper , Also in July , the whistleblowing web site published a 1525 page file on WJAC 's activities .
Housed at the Seattle Field Office of the FBI , one document described WJAC as an agency that " builds on existing intelligence efforts by local , regional , and federal agencies by organizing and disseminating threat information and other intelligence efforts to law enforcement agencies , first responders , and key decision makers throughout the state .
" Fusion centers are also lucrative cash cows for enterprising security grifters .
investigations editor Julian Assange described the revolving - door that exists among Pentagon spy agencies and the private security firms who reap millions by placing interrogators and analysts inside outfits such as WJAC .
Assange wrote , Thedocuments provide startling details on how firms such as Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) , The Sytex Group and Operational Applications Inc. routinely place operatives within military intelligence and civilian fusion centers at a premium price .
Assange wonders whether these job placements are not simply evidence of corruption but rather , are " designed to evade a raft of hard won oversight laws which apply to the military and the police but not to contractors ?
Is it to keep selected personnel out of the Inspector General 's eye ? "
The available evidence strongly suggests that it is .
As the American Civil Liberties Union documented in their 2007 and 2008 reports on fusion center abuses , one motivation isto subvert oversight laws which do not apply to private mercenary contractors .
The civil liberties ' watchdog characterized the rapid expansion of fusion centers as a threat to our constitutional rights and cited specific areas of concern : " their ambiguous lines of authority , the troubling role of private corporations , the participation of the military , the use of data mining and their excessive secrecy .
" And speaking of private security contractors outsourced to a gaggle on intelligence agencies , investigative journalist Tim Shorrock revealed in his essential book , that since 9/11 " the Central Intelligence Agency has been spending 50 to 60 percent of its budget on for - profit contractors , or about $ 2.5 billion a year , and its number of contract employees now exceeds the agency 's full - time workforce of 17,500 .
" Indeed , Shorrock learned that . "
However , the sharp spike in intelligence outsourcing to well - heeled security corporations comes with very little in the way of effective oversight .
The House Intelligence Committee reported in 2007 that the Bush , and now , the Obama administrations have failed to develop a " clear definition of what functions are ' inherently governmental ' ; " meaning in practice , that much in the way of systematic abuses can be concealed behind veils of " proprietary commercial information .
"
As we have seen when the Abu Ghraib torture scandal broke in 2004 , andbelatedly blew the whistle on widespread illegal surveillance of the private electronic communications of Americans in 2005 , cosy government relationships with security contractors , including those embedded within secretive fusion centers , will continue to serve as a " safe harbor " for concealing and facilitating state crimes against the American people .
After all , $ 75 billion buys a lot of silence .
Going Open Source
Virgil Dupras
2009-08-05
Free Software and proprietary software are seldom seen as compatible .
Free Software proponents are telling us that users should have the " freedom to run , copy , distribute , study , change and improve the software " , and proprietary software developers are arguing that it 's very hard to earn money from producing Free Software .
Both sides have good arguments , but a consensus can never seem to be reached .
Recently , the author of E Text Editor [ dead link ] , Alexander Stigsen , has made a very bold move [ dead link ] by opening the source of his proprietary software .
Although I 'm not convinced by the Trust Metric system he proposes , I think it is a very interesting move , a move that could potentially , finally , reconcile shareware and open source .
Update 2015 -01 -02 : I noticed that , unfortunately , E Text Editor 's website became unavailable .
That removes a lot of context from this article now , sorry about that .
What The Customer Is Entitled To
While the proprietary software model allows shareware developers like me to earn money from their work , it 's important to realize that the customer is being screwed in the process .
The customer who commits money and time to proprietary software takes the risk of getting stuck with an unsupported and buggy software .
This can happen with both big software developers and small software developers .
With big software shops , it 's usually greed that drives customer screwage .
For example , Intuit ( Quicken developers ) seems to want to take the lead in the race for being the dirtiest customer screwer ever .
What often happens is that these developers force the customer into an upgrade cycle .
Or sometimes , it 's that they wo n't fix a bug until it's " cost effective " ( until some manager looking at his maximization chart decides it 's worth it ) .
While this is probably all sound behavior , profit - wise , the end result is still that customers are the ones suffering from all this .
But there 's the small developer to the rescue !
We sure are a fine bunch .
A vast majority of us actually care about our customers .
So even if we 're releasing our software as proprietary , it does n't really affect the customer because he gets adequate support from the developer .
However , despite the best intentions from those small developers , there 's always the risk that they get bought by a large company .
When that happens , the large company will of course want to " leverage " ( screw ) their newly acquired customer base for better profits .
Who will suffer ?
The customer .
For very small companies ( one man shows ) , an additional risk is the risk of the developer getting hit by a bus .
If that happens , the source code of the application can either be unrecoverable , or unmaintainable .
For someone who never worked on a codebase before , it can be very , very hard for them to figure it out without help from the original author ( private code is often poorly documented ) .
When it is , there 's a good chance that the code will fade into oblivion , leaving the customers in the dust .
Moreover , as a developer who's also a customer of some proprietary applications , I 'd sure like to have access to the code of the applications I bought .
If not for fixing minor annoyances or helping the developer with a bug that affects me , I 'd also like to know if the application I 'm running has a future .
Too often , applications look all neat and cute , but it turns out that the code is an unmaintainable mess .
Unless you do n't want to improve the application , an unmaintainable codebase is worthless .
We can say whatever we want about Free Software , there 's no denying that it delivers something very valuable , something that the proprietary software world has a hard time delivering , something I 'd like to deliver to my customers .
Earning Money With Free Software
If you ever read or heard an apology for Free Software , you know that it 's very important to make the distinction between " free as in beer " and " free as in speech " .
We are constantly being told that Free Software is not about working for free .
We 're told that it 's perfectly OK -- and possible ! -- to make money from Free Software .
Here 's the examples we 're commonly given :
Custom development .
Someone has a problem to solve , then you customize an already existing codebase to that person 's need .
This is actually the most obvious way to earn money with Free Software .
Were I in the custom software business , I would most certainly produce Free Software all the time , as it's what makes the most sense in that situation .
Dual licensing .
Release your software as GPL , but at the same time , distribute a proprietary version of the same software and charge for the latter .
This is also a great way to earn money with Free Software ( Trolltech was rather successful with Qt before they got bought by Nokia ) , but it only works with libraries .
For software made for an end user , dual licensing does n't make any sense .
Donations .
Create a good Free Software , be popular , and collect donations .
The first problem with this solution is that it does n't seem to work .
I am pretty much certain that , had I released my applications under Free Software to then rely on a " Donate " button , I would have earned a tiny fraction of what I earned by releasing them as proprietary .
The consequence of that is that I would have had to find a day job that was not Hardcoded Software , keeping its development as a hobby and thus decreasing the quality of those applications .
One other problem with donations is that Free Software typically have a lot of contributors .
Who exactly do you donate that money to ?
Just the head guy ?
What about the " unsung hero " who wrote that obscure driver that allows your mouse to work ?
Does he get anything ?
Collect some fame and get a nice job at Google .
I guess it 's a good reason to contribute to Free Software , although I personally find it a little sick to parade in front of big corporations , begging " choose me ! choose me ! " with credentials of past unpaid work in your hands .
Of course , if you happen to have had lots of fun while doing that Free Software project that landed you that nice job , then you can just ignore my contempt and laugh all the way to the bank ( but you do n't laugh anymore because that bank had your money placed in CDOs ... oops ! ) .
Charge for support .
This is actually the way of earning money with Free Software that I dislike the most .
In proprietary software businesses , the better your software is , the less it needs support and the more profit you make because you do n't have to provide that support .
With a business based on supporting Free Software , the more confusing and buggy the software is , the more support it needs and the more money it makes .
Making money from keeping the quality of a software low is a bad thing .
Free As In Beer
While it 's obvious that in certain areas , producing Free Software is a good way to earn money , in some other areas , like with generic software ( software that is not custom software or a library ) , " free as in speech " usually implies " free as in beer " .
I am very lucky to be in a situation where I work on projects that I chose to work on ( using languages and technologies that I chose as well ! ) while getting a comfortable income from it .
Unfortunately , I have n't managed to find a way to do so while producing Free Software .
The Free Software model just does n't seem to fit with the shareware model .
If I have a good idea for a software application that I think a lot of people would use , what should I do , convince thousands of people to invest 10 $ in me so that I develop this application as GPL ?
Yeah , right , maybe in Wonderland .
What happens in real life is that you have to risk months ( if not years ) of development time , and then convince people to give you money for what you created .
If the application is released as GPL , it 's impossible to get that money ( except maybe crumbles of bread from a " Donate " button ) .
Because of that difficulty to earn money from producing generic Free Software , there is generally a gap in quality between shareware and Free Software .
This is because developers who are n't paid will usually develop those Free applications because it 's fun for them .
However , some aspects of software development are less fun than others , like improving user friendliness .
Hobbyists tend to neglect that kind of work , whereas developers who sell their applications tend to focus on that kind of work .
Narrowing The Gap
What if users of those generic Free Software applications pooled together to pay themselves some developers to work on the boring but necessary parts ?
That would be great , would n't it ?
Unfortunately , it 's unlikely to happen .
First , there 's the chicken - and - egg problem .
If your application is not user friendly , only those who can cope with it will use it , the others will buy a proprietary application .
Second , there 's the trust problem .
Even if some users were willing to pool their money together , they need to find a developer that they trust enough to give him money upfront .
It 's not impossible , of course , but it 's not something that 's easy to coordinate .
Besides , why pay now for something you 'll maybe get later , when you get instant gratification from the proprietary world ?
We cannot expect generic software users to pay upfront .
I think it cannot work .
This is where a move like Alexander 's is interesting .
He published his application 's source under a modified BSD license that says that the licensing code cannot be tampered with .
It means that although the source is public , its users still have to pay to use the application .
This way , the author gets paid and his customers have access to the source code , as well as the instant gratification from the proprietary world .
Thus , the chicken - and - egg problem is resolved because the developer expects that the people who are interested in using his application will pay him .
Therefore , it makes sense for him to risk some of his development time and to make sure that his application is user friendly so that a lot of people will want to use that application , exactly like what happens in the proprietary software world .
However now , the customers have the source code , like what happen in the Free Software world !
It 's not perfect , but although this type of " open source " ( Some would say that I can't call that " open source " , but it 's not as if the Open Source Initiative had a trademark on the term ( like , for example , " organic " ) .
If I want to call that " open source " , it 's my choice ) software is n't in the same ballpark , " freedom " - wise , as Free Software , I think it narrows a painful gap .
That is why it is the direction that I 'm taking with Hardcoded Software today .
Selling Development Time
I tend to agree with Free Software proponents when they tell us that code should n't have owners .
While I certainly do n't agree with everything M. Stallman says , it does n't mean that all his claims are baseless .
The extra clause that has been added to the BSD license in E Text Editor prevents people who did n't purchase the application from using it as long as the copyright lasts .
Therefore , even though the code is public , the company 's revenue stream is still based on code ownership .
What I want to do , rather than sitting on intellectual property , is to sell my development time to a large audience and this , after the work is done .
Therefore , the license I use for my software is similar to E Text Editor 's , but with an additional clause that causes the code to become licensed under the general BSD license 2 years after the commit .
What it means is that the code you checkout today will be entirely free after 2 years , even if I stop publishing the source ( you still have the licensed copy you check out 2 years ago ) .
Although the copyright law is still used to encourage payments from users , there 's a shift in what is actually bought by the customer ( maybe not legally , but in principle , yes ) .
Rather than buying the right to use my " intellectual property " , the customer is buying a share of the last 2 years of work invested in the product .
Selling development time rather than licenses affects more than just users , it also affects external contributors .
With E Text Editor 's model , developers give away their time to a codebase that is owned by the Open Company .
They are then promised a fair share of the profits , a share that will be determined by their peers through the Trust Metric system .
There 's no problem with that as long as you believe in the fairness of the system .
For people who do n't believe in it , there are very few incentives for them to contribute to such a codebase .
Because I do n't want to limit potential contributors to people who believe in an eventual Trust Metric system , my intent is to pay them myself an amount of money we both agree on before the work is done ( I'm thinking about a bounty system here ) .
I think it 's fairer than a promise of a fair share of future profits .
Moreover , I do n't want to tie external contributors to my development decisions .
I certainly do n't intend for the development of HS 's applications to become a free - for - all playground where tons of features are added by tons of people without a clear direction of where the development is going .
Because of that , it is very possible that I will end up refusing some suggestions .
If that happens , because the codebase becomes completely free after 2 years , a fork is always possible .
Potential contributors can thus confidently invest the time necessary to learn how to work within that codebase , knowing that this investment can't be destroyed by an arbitrary decision .
" Piracy "
Among the comments following E Text Editor 's move , several of them mentioned the problem of " piracy " ( copyright infringement ) .
With the code openly available , would n't it be trivial for someone to just strip the code limiting the application when in demo mode , then just run it for free ?
It turns out that Alexander chose to keep the core of the application closed , thus making such modification harder to make .
However , in HS 's case , there is no such limitation .
All the code is open , including the code limiting applications in demo mode .
So , am I doomed to failure , my beloved code being greedily " stolen " from me by the web mob ?
I do n't believe so .
I think that most people are honest .
HS applications ' demo limitations are trivial to circumvent , yet I still sell them and have been for years .
Sure , there are dishonest people .
There are also broke ( students ) people .
Those people do n't pay , sure , but I much prefer to forego this revenue than to invade the privacy of the honest customers .
With the code open and the demo limitations being trivial to remove , the situation is the same as it was before , and I 'm confident that honest people will continue to buy HS 's applications .
Why bother with demo limitations at all then ?
Although I believe that most people are honest , I also believe that most people are lazy ( yeah , we all know we are ) , and will do whatever is the easiest .
If there are no limitations , it 's much easier to download the application , use it , and never pay ( you have to get your credit card out and everything ... ) .
If there are demo limitations , you have the choice between buying the application , or checking out the code yourself , know Python , locate the demo limitation code , disable it , then build the thing .
On top of that , while the code is building , you have the time to tell yourself " I 'm being dishonest " , because you are actively doing the thing ( rather than just telling yourself " I 'll pay them later " and then forgetting about it ) .
Of course , all of this is based on the assumption that most people are honest .
However , if this assumption is wrong , I 'll be more sad about being revealed the true nature of people than about losing revenue ( I do n't think I 'd have problems finding a job if that happened , so it 's not as if I 'll starve or anything ) .
The Plan
I 'm making this move with the hope that more developers decide to do the same .
I think it would be awesome .
With an approach like this , software development would normally have two distinct phases :
Active Development .
A developer has a good idea , starts working on it , and when usable , publishes it under the license I have just described .
If the application is any good , the author will attract some customers , who will give the author enough money for him to continue the development of the application .
With some luck , some other developers will be interested in working on the application , and the author will have enough revenue from sales to pay those developers ( using a bounty system on tickets being the easiest way I can think of ) .
Even after 2 years , if the application is still in active development , the users will still pay for the application because the current version will be much better than the 2 years old version .
At any time , if another developer disagrees strongly with the direction the development of the main branch is taking , he can fork the project .
He can either fork from 2 years old code , or fork from the latest code .
If he forks from the latest code however , he 'll limit his customer base to a subset of the original author 's customer base for a period of 2 years .
Because of the effort required to fork a project and invest time and money in making your product known , it should , most of the time , make more sense for a developer wanting to work on the project to collect bounties rather than to start a fork .
Of course , this requires that the original author is fair and honest about the way he handles bounties .
Mature Project .
After a while , there will be less and less improvements needing to be made on the application .
The price of the current version would then start to lower , as the difference with the free version narrows .
Eventually , the application will either be free or be sold for a low price ( to keep fueling the bounty system and to pay whoever maintains the builds ) .
It wo n't matter either way , as the original author will have started new projects and wo n't financially depend on his mature projects .
The bounty system would still be in place , so there would still be incentives to improve the application , if there 's a demand for it .
With this development process , normally , developers will be paid ( maybe not for small patches , but for significant work , yes ) fairly for their work .
This way , there will be soon - to - be - free code that will be produced that would not have been produced otherwise .
Therefore , although I 'm sure that hardcore GPL proponents will have contempt for this approach , I think that in the end , it helps the Free Software movement by bringing some more code and money into it .
Hardcoded Software Is Stepping In

This license is used for every HS 's application .
For libraries however ( hsutil , hsfs , hsmedia and cocoalib ) , plain BSD is used because the more this code is used , the more chances I have to get patches back .
There 's also an issue with the PyQt dependent part of HS 's applications .
Although this part of the code is licensed under the same license as the rest , it is dependent on PyQt , which is dual licensed .
If you do n't possess a commercial license to PyQt , you must use HS 's applications with the GPL version of PyQt .
This does n't cause any problem , unless you start re-distributing the code .
To have the right to re-distribute the code , you need it to be GPL compliant , and the HS license is not GPL compliant .
This means that unless you possess a commercial license to PyQt , you can't send any PyQt - dependent - HS - licensed code to anyone , including Hardcoded Software .
It 's unfortunate for potential contributors to be restricted like this , but then , it only affects the GUI layer of the Windows versions of HS 's application .
Moreover , I have faith that PyQt will end up being re-licensed as LGPL .
As for external contributions , I 'm certainly open to it , although I 'm not even sure there 's any interest from external developers to work on HS 's applications .
This is why I prefer to wait a little bit before beginning to design a bounty system for HS tickets .
If you 're interested in working ( not for free !
if you offer something I need , I 'll pay for it ) on this code , please let me know about it
That 's it !
It 's a risky move , but I think it might be the beginning of something pretty nice .
If more software were released under such a license , it would create a lot of freelancing opportunities in the generic software development field , as well as create a lot of free codebases to build new projects upon .
In any case , do n't hesitate to let me know of what you think .
In May 1981 , Henry Louis Gates , Jr. was browsing the shelves in University Place Bookshop — a New York City store ( no longer in operation ) that specialized in African and African - American literature — when he came across an 1859 book with the startling and unnerving title Our Nig .
At first Gates assumed the book was an early example of white - authored racist plantation literature ( a genre later made famous by Gone with the Wind ) but it turned out to be something quite different .
Our Nig , published 150 years ago today on September 5 , 1859 , was written by a black woman named Harriet Wilson ( 1825 – 1900 ) , and the book is now commonly regarded as the first novel by an African - American author to be published in North America .
That somewhat qualified " first " requires some explanation : Prior to this time , most of the books published by black authors were slave narratives , that is , memoirs written by former slaves who had escaped bondage .
The most famous of these are the first two of the three autobiographies written by Frederick Douglas and published in the United States in 1845 and 1855 .
Some volumes of poetry by black authors had also been published prior to 1859 .
But Our Nig is a novel — albeit an autobiographical novel — and the earliest novels written by African - American authors had been published not in America but in England .
( The first of these was by William Wells Brown , an ex-slave whose 1853 novel Clotel ; or , The President 's Daughter is about a daughter of Thomas Jefferson . )
It can be said that Harriet Wilson was the first black woman to publish a novel , but only with the qualification " in English . "
( Also in 1859 the novel Ursula by Maria Firmina dos Reis was published in Brazil . )
Prior to Henry Louis Gates ' rediscovery of Our Nig , the novel and its author had fallen through the cracks of history and scholarship , completely unmentioned in major surveys of African - American literature .
Copies are rare : Only 42 copies of the original edition are now known to exist .
( Boggis , 18 - 19 )
Our Nig is not about slavery in the Deep South but about the plight of a " free black " child in the state of New Hampshire .
Yet the title page ( in all its 19th - century splendor ) provided only the barest of hints of the origin of this book and its author :
Our Nig ;
Or ,
Sketches from the Life of a Free Black ,
In a Two - Story White House , North .
Showing that Slavery 's Shadows Fall Even There .
By “ Our Nig . ”
Although the author remained pseudonymous on the title page of the novel , the next page indicated that the book was registered for copyright by " Mrs. H. E. Wilson . " and a short Preface on the page that followed is signed " H. E. W . "
This was enough information to initiate an astonishing level of detective work by Henry Louis Gates and his students at Yale that identifed a black woman named Harriet E. Wilson née Adams as the author of this novel .
By the time Our Nig was republished in facsimile in 1983 ( with an introduction and notes by Professor Gates ) , initial research had concluded that Harriet Wilson was born in Milford , New Hamshire in 1827 or 1828 .
She had disappeared from public records ( and was presumed to have died ) around 1860 .
In the quarter century since , a considerable amount of additional information has been unearthed , as a comparison of Gates ' 1983 edition with the 2009 " 150th - Anniversary Edition " by Penguin reveals .
Harriet Wilson 's death certificate has been found as well as her burial site — she actually died in 1900 at the age of 75 — and many of the real people fictionalized in Our Nig have been identified .
Our Nig is the story of a spirited mixed - race girl named Frado ( short for Alfrado ) , who is abandoned by her mother at the age of six to become a child indentured servant to a white farming family for the next 12 years , where she is victimized by the sadistic " she - devil " head of the household , Mrs. Bellmont .
Beyond that story , Our Nig is a rare glimpse into the lives of black people in antebellum New England .
It is as powerful an indictment of racism as the more common slave narratives of this period , and in a sense it is more shocking , because the novel takes place in Milford , New Hampshire ( fictionalized as " Singleton " ) , which was a " hotbed of abolitionism " ( Ellis , p. 53 ) in the years leading up to the Civil War .
It is this sub - text — the persistent cruelty of racism far away from the horrors of the South among the supposedly more enlightened North — that gives Our Nig its special compelling power .
Read over that peculiar sub - title again .
Several scholars have seen the " Two - Story " part as also indicating two stories in the novel :
The personal story of Frado and the sociological story of New England racism .
Or perhaps , as R. J. Ellis hypothesizes ,
one is the story of a well - connected , reasonably affluent New England farm family , a story of outside respectability ; the other is an inside story — a portrait of the sadistic treatment of Alfrado .
( Ellis , 15 )
Curiously enough , although the novel is written entirely in third person , the titles of the first three chapters are in first person : " Mag Smith , My Mother " tells of a poor white woman , orphaned , disconnected , lonely , and a black man named Jim who has both pity and love for her .
He proposes marriage :
" You 's had trial of white folks , any how .
They run off and left ye , and now none of 'em come near ye to see if you 's dead or alive .
I 's black outside , I know , but I 's got a white heart inside .
Which you rather have , a black heart in a white skin , or a white heart in a black one ? " ( p. 12 — all page references are to the first edition )
They marry , have two children , and enjoy a few years of happiness .
But as the title of the second chapter ( " My Father 's Death " ) indicates , Jim dies of consumption , and Mag decides that she cannot afford to continue raising two children .
Frado , as they called one of Mag 's children , was a beautiful mulatto , with long , curly black hair , and handsome , roguish eyes , sparkling with an exuberance of spirit almost beyond restraint .
( p. 17 )
In the third chapter , " A New Home for Me , " Frado is abandoned at the age of six at the Bellmont 's home , and two of the Bellmont children discuss what to do with her :
" Keep her , " said Jack .
" She 's real handsome and bright , and not very black , either . "
" Yes , " rejoined Mary ; " that 's just like you , Jack .
She 'll be of no use at all these three years , right under foot all the time . "
" Poh !
Miss Mary ; if she should stay , it would n't be two days before you would be telling the girls about our nig , our nig ! " retorted Jack . ( p. 25 - 26 )
After this point , there are no more first - person chapter titles — and only one other use of first - person at the beginning of the last chapter after Frado has left the Bellmonts .
She has become the Bellmont 's property , to be over - worked and abused .
It becomes very clear to the reader that the crude name of " our nig " is not some bizarre term of affection , but a claim of ownership , and as ugly and hateful then as it would be today .
Harriet Wilson 's use of this term as the title of her novel — and repeating the same term in quotation marks as the author on the title page — was a brilliant tactic of defiance and re-appropriation of her life story .
Gates describes this " audacious act of titling " like this :
That Wilson dared to name her text with the most feared and hated epithet under which the very humanity of black people had been demeaned both adds to the list of ironies in her endeavor and attests to an intelligence that turned racist epithet into irony , subverting a received definition by inverting its common usage .
( Gates , Figures in Black , 128 )
The mention of " three years " in the dialogue between Jack and Mary alludes to the age of ten being the normal age for child indentured servants to begin work .
But Frado is put to work right away .
Frado was called early in the morning by her new mistress .
Her first work was to feed the hens .
She was shown how it was always to be done , and in no other way ; any departure from this rule to be punished by a whipping .
She was then accompanied by Jack to drive the cows to pasture , so she might learn the way .
Upon her return she was allowed to eat her breakfast , consisting of a bowl of skimmed milk , with brown bread crusts , which she was told to eat , standing , by the kitchen table , and must not be over ten minutes about it .
Meanwhile the family were taking their morning meal in the dining - room .
This over , she was placed on a cricket to wash the common dishes ; she was to be in waiting always to bring wood and chips , to run hither and thither from room to room .
( p. 29 )
In general , the male Bellmonts , and some of the women also , are kind to Frado .
The daughter Mary is cruel , but the real villain of the novel is Mrs.
Bellmont herself , who often uses a " rawhide " for whipping , and sometimes " propping her mouth open with a piece of wood , shut her up in a dark room , without any supper . " ( p. 35 ) Propping a mouth open was a common way to prevent screams from being heard when slaves were whipped in private .
Mrs. Bellmont felt that her [ Frado's ] time and person belonged solely to her .
She was under her in every sense of the word .
What an opportunity to indulge her vixen nature !
No matter what occurred to ruffle her , or from what source provocation came , real or fancied , a few blows on Nig seemed to relieve her of a portion of ill - will .
( p. 41 )
It was her favorite exercise to enter the apartment noisily , vociferate orders , give a few sudden blows to quicken Nig 's pace , then return to the sitting room with such a satisfied expression , congratulating herself upon her thorough house - keeping qualities .
( p. 66 )
The overwork and beatings take a severe toll on Frado 's health .
Her mistress entered one day , and finding her seated , commanded her to go to work .
" I am sick , " replied Frado , rising and walking slowly to her unfinished task , " and can not stand long , I feel so bad . "
Angry that she should venture a reply to her command , she suddenly inflicted a blow which lay the tottering girl prostrate on the floor .
Excited by so much indulgence of a dangerous passion , she seemed left to unrestrained malice ; and snatching a towel , stuffed the mouth of the sufferer , and beat her cruelly .
Frado hoped she should end her misery by beating her to death .
She bore it with the hope of a martyr , that her misery would soon close .
( p. 82-3 )
Other members of the household are more sympathetic to Frado , and try to introduce her to schooling and religious services , despite Mrs. Bellmont 's belief that " prayer was for whites , not for blacks . " ( p. 94 ) One of the more humorous moments comes when Mrs. Bellmont believes her treatment of Frado has been exposed :
Mrs. Reed called and informed Mrs. B that her colored girl " related her experience the other night at the meeting . "
" What experience ? " asked she , quickly , as if she expected to hear the number of times she had whipped Frado , and the number of lashes set forth in plain Arabic numbers .
Our Nig disappeared from public consciousness soon after it was published , and it 's not hard to see why .
The novel is — we might say today — off - message .
In progressive circles in New England , the need to abolish slavery was a given , but no abolitionist wanted to hear about racism in the North .
Abolitionists had a variety of ideological motives :
Some wanted to end slavery solely because it allowed the South unfair economic advantage over the North ; others thought slavery was an evil but nonetheless did not wish for any assimilation with people of color .
Frado 's plight was not relevant to their cause .
Even from the perspective of black abolitionists and their white sympathizers , Our Nig was sending a message that could easily be used against them .
Following the publication of Harriet Beecher Stowe 's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852 , many novels — both for and against abolition — tried to imitate it .
By 1861 ( the first year of the Civil War ) , at least 18 " negative pastiches " of Uncle Tom 's Cabin had been published .
( Gates , Figures in Black , p. 134 )
The gist of these novels was that slavery provided paternalistic protection of blacks , whereas blacks were left to fend for themselves in the crueler North .
A novel like Our Nig played right into this perverse ideology .
Even the opening chapter of Our Nig was problematic :
The novel begins by portraying a happy mixed marriage !
Almost no one in either the North or South wanted to read about anything like that !
Harriet Wilson was obviously aware of potential problems , for in the brief Preface to the novel she wrote :
I would not from these motives [ of writing the novel ] even palliate slavery at the South , by disclosures of its appurtenances North .
My mistress was wholly imbued with southern principles .
I do not pretend to divulge every transaction in my own life , which the unprejudiced would declare unfavorable in comparison with treatment of legal bondmen ; I have purposely omitted what would most provoke shame in our good anti-slavery friends at home .
It 's hard to imagine what she left out !
( One of the essays in Harriet Wilson 's New England , Cassandra Jackson 's " Beyond the Page : Rape and the Failure of Genre , " finds suggestions of sexual abuse in the novel . )
In the penultimate chapter of Our Nig , Frado is counting the days until she turns 18 , whe her indenture will be over and she can legally leave the Bellmonts , but she then spends several years recovering from the brutal treatment she had received there .
The last chapter of Our Nig seems rushed , and it's assumed that Harriet Wilson was trying to get the book finished quickly .
Some passages are tantalizing glimpses of what more the book could have been had she spent more time with it :
She passed into the various towns of the State she lived in , then into Massachusetts .
Strange were some of her adventures .
Watched by kidnappers , maltreated by professed abolitionists , who did n't want slaves at the South , nor niggers in their own houses , North .
Faugh ! to lodge one ; to eat with one ; to admit one through the front door ; to sit next [ to ] one ; awful !
The " kidnappers " mentioned here are bounty hunters ready to snatch escaped slaves and bring them back to the South under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act ( 1850 ) .
But the chapter begins with a description of the man Frado was to marry :
A few years ago , within the compass of my narrative , there appeared often in some of our New England villages , professed fugitives from slavery , who recounted their personal experience in homely phrase , and awakened the indignation of non-slaveholders against brother Pro .
Such a one appeared in the new home of Frado ; and as people of color were rare there , was it strange she should attract her dark brother ; that he should inquire her out ; succeed in seeing her ; feel a strange sensation in his heart towards her ; that he should toy with her shining curls , feel proud to provoke her to smile and expose the ivory concealed by thin , ruby lips ; that her sparkling eyes should fascinate ; that he should propose ; that they should marry ?
A short acquaintance was indeed an objection , but she saw him often , and thought she knew him .
He never spoke of his enslavement to her when alone , but she felt that , like her own oppression , it was painful to disturb oftener than was needful .
He was a fine , straight negro , whose back showed no marks of the lash , erect as if it never crouched beneath a burden .
There was a silent sympathy which Frado felt attracted her , and she opened her heart to the presence of love — that arbitrary and inexorable tyrant .
( 126-7 )
Harriet Wilson has dropped a couple hints here — the word " professed " in the first sentence , the absence of the scars of slavery on her husband 's back or in his spine — and soon he leaves her :
He left her to her fate — embarked at sea , with the disclosure that he had never seen the South , and that his illiterate harangues were humbugs for hungry abolitionists .
( 127-8 )
It was probably that sentence more than any other passage that condemned Our Nig to near oblivion .
The testimony of escaped slaves to the brutality of slavery was one of the most powerful weapons in the abolitionist 's arsenal , and the mere suggestion that some of these men may have been imposters was simply intolerable .
In the last chapter of Our Nig , the author speaks of Frado 's son .
It is really to " aid me in maintaining myself and child " ( as the Preface states ) that Harriet Wilson wrote this book , so it 's sad to learn that her son George Mason Wilson died of " fever " in Milford early in 1860 at the age of seven .
The last chapter also mentions that " Providence favored her with a friend who , pitying her cheerless lot , kindly provided her with a valuable recipe , from which she might herself manufacture a useful article for her maintenance . "
It is known that this " recipe " was a lotion for darkening gray hair , and that Harriet Wilson advertised and sold this product beginning in the late 1850s while she was writing her novel .
There exist antique glass bottles imprinted with her name , and period advertisements for " Mrs. Wilson 's Hair Regenerator " and " Mrs. Wilson 's Cocoa - Nut Oil Hair Dressing . "
In the 1860 's Harriet Wilson got involved with the Spiritualist movement in which she was known for decades as a trance speaker and " the colored medium . "
By the time Our Nig was published in 1859 , Rebecca Hutchinson Hayward — the real - life woman fictionalized as " Mrs. Bellmont " — had been dead for almost nine years .
But notice the maiden name of Hutchinson :
This is the same Hutchinson family that produced the famous Milford - based Hutchinson Family Singers , who were known to perform concerts with songs supporting the abolition of slavery around the same time that Harriet Wilson was a teenager !
It 's even possible that Rebecca Hutchinson Hayward considered herself to be an abolitionist , even as she whipped the black child in her household .
In Our Nig , Harriet Wilson reminds us that — despite the unmitigated evil of slavery — the history of the battle against slavery and the attitudes of the North was more complicated than we have cared to believe , and certainly not free of racism .
The novel has also reminded historians that a black culture went very deep in antebellum New England life , but that it had been largely erased from memory as the people turned their focus to the plight of slaves in the South .
In an attempt to correct these deficiences , the Harriet Wilson Project was begun .
A statue of Harriet Wilson was erected in Milford , New Hampshire in 2006 — unfortunately pretty much guesswork because no known photographs exist of the woman — holding a copy of her amazing revelatory book , and accompanied by the son she could n't save .

Yes , we can hardly believe it ourselves , but Sony came a - knockin ' at our door today , and we were more than willing to answer .
The PlayStation 3
Slim is now official in - house , and it's a matte - laden beaut .
Enough chitchat -- live vicariously through our unboxing and hands - on pics below !
Some details for clarification .
The buttons in the front are now physical and actually " click " in to function .
The PS logo above the disc drive does not rotate for vertical use , and yes , the hard drive is swappable -- as you can see from the pictures , there 's a screw on the bottom , hidden by a panel , that lets you take off part of the front for access .
We 've also lined it up against our standard , fatty PS3 , and we gotta say , it 's noticeably lighter .
Here 's a more thorough comparison between the slim , the original , and the Xbox 360 .
Some people were asking about the texture of the matte finish , and compared to Microsoft 's console , it 's just a teensy bit rougher ( and on that note , about the same weight , too ) .
It 's still just as glossy as the original on the sides , however .
We still gotta compare the noise of the slim , stay tuned !
While our tests were far from thorough , the initial results from our quick - and - dirty decibel ratings show some promise .
With a baseline of 49 decibels , the Slim averaged 53 to 56 db when in use / playing a game / installing data ( in this case , Metal Gear Solid 4 ) , compared to the 55 to 58 db of the original .
Blu -ray movie playback is where it becomes noticeable , as the slim peaked for us at 60 db when the original was doing 70 db running the same disc .
MOSCOW 
After months sealed in an isolation chamber , participants in a simulated mission to Mars emerged into a muggy Moscow afternoon on Tuesday , completing what international scientists hope is a small step toward a staffed mission to the red planet .
The six participants  four Russians , a German soldier and a French airline pilot  spent 105 days locked in a series of hermetically sealed tubes as part of the Mars - 500 project at the Institute of Biomedical Problems here .
An actual staffed mission , if one occurs , could be decades off , but Russian scientists and officials said the Mars - 500 project , which will culminate in a 520 - day isolation experiment scheduled to start next year , was an indication of Russia ’s revitalized role in space exploration after years of struggling to keep a foothold in orbit .
“ At this time we are moving from the era of preserving Russia ’s place in space to its advancement , ” Vitaly A. Davydov , the deputy chief of the Russian Federal Space Agency , said at a news conference .
“ This is a promising project that will guarantee the orbital deployment of equipment that will fly to the moon and Mars . ”
After a string of teaser trailers got fans excited about the possibility of a new MechWarrior game , it 's now official : a new entry in the franchise is under development .
However , this wo n't be a sequel to 2002's MechWarrior 4 , but instead will be a reboot for the long - running series .
The game is being jointly developed by Vancouver - based Piranha Games and Smith & Tinker , a company made up of former members of the now defunct FASA .
After forming the company in 2007 , Smith & Tinker co-founder Jordan Weisman was able to secure the rights to the MechWarrior franchise from Microsoft , along with other prominent intellectual properties like Shadowrun and Crimson Skies .
IGN was able to get some early details on the game , which include plans for a single - player campaign , four - player co-op campaign , as well as numerous multiplayer modes .
The game will also reward players for picking a specific mech and sticking with it , providing upgrades like increased accuracy and more powerful weapons .
This feature is also expected to give the game a lot of replay value , as playing through with different mechs should provide very different experiences .
There 's currently no word on a release date , and the developers are still in the midst of finding a publisher for the game , which will be coming to both the PC and Xbox 360 .
In the meantime , check out the debut trailer below .

“ Global warming is accelerating , the arctic and antarctic ice shelves are rapidly melting , sea level and global temperatures are on the rise , ocean acidification is increasing , foot shortages and water shortages are occurring worldwide , a mass extinction event of millions of species is underway , and the human race faces peril .

First Goal is to Stop Gaza War Crimes Revelations
In a bid to staunch the flow of damaging evidence of war crimes committed during Israel ’s winter assault on Gaza , the Israeli government has launched a campaign to clamp down on human rights groups , both in Israel and abroad .
It has begun by targeting one of the world ’s leading rights organisations , the US - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , as well as a local group of dissident army veterans , Breaking the Silence , which last month published the testimonies of 26 combat soldiers who served in Gaza .
Additionally , according to the Israeli media , the government is planning a “ much more aggressive stance ” towards human rights groups working to help the Palestinians .
Officials have questioned the sources of funding received by the organisations and threatened legislation to ban support from foreign governments , particularly in Europe .
Breaking the Silence and other Israeli activists have responded by accusing the government of a “ witch hunt ” designed to intimidate them and starve them of the funds needed to pursue their investigations .
“ This is a very dangerous step , ” said Mikhael Mannekin , one of the directors of Breaking the Silence .
“ Israel is moving in a very anti-democratic direction . ”
The campaign is reported to be the brainchild of the far - right foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , currently facing corruption charges , but has the backing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Early last month , Mr Lieberman used a press conference to accuse non-government organisations , or NGOs , of replacing diplomats in setting the international community ’s agenda in relation to Israel .
He also threatened reforms to curb the groups ’ influence .
A week later , Mr Netanyahu ’s office weighed in against Human Rights Watch , heavily criticising the organisation for its recent fund - raising activities in Saudi Arabia .
HRW has pointed out that it only accepts private donations , and has not accepted Saudi government funds , but Israeli officials say all Saudi money is tainted and will compromise HRW ’s impartiality as a human rights watchdog in its treatment of Israel .
“ A human rights organisation raising money in Saudi Arabia is like a women ’s rights group asking the Taliban for a donation , ” Mark Regev , a government spokesman , told the right - wing Israeli daily newspaper the Jerusalem Post .
HRW recently published reports arguing that the Israeli army had committed war crimes in Gaza , including the use of white phosphorus and attacking civilian targets .
HRW is now facing concerted pressure from Jewish lobby groups and from leading Jewish journalists in the US to sever its ties with Saudi donors .
According to the Israeli media , some Jewish donors in the US have also specified that their money be used for human rights investigations that do not include Israel .
Meanwhile , Israel ’s foreign ministry is putting pressure on European governments to stop funding many of Israel ’s human rights groups .
As a prelude to a clampdown , it has issued instructions to all its embassies abroad to question their host governments about whether they fund such activities .
Last week the foreign ministry complained to British , Dutch and Spanish diplomats about their support for Breaking the Silence .
The testimonies collected from soldiers suggested the Israeli army had committed many war crimes in Gaza , including using Palestinians as human shields and firing white phosphorus shells over civilian areas .
One soldier called the army ’s use of firepower “ insane ” .
The Dutch government paid nearly 20,000 euros to the group to compile its Gaza report , while Britain funded its work last year to the tune of £ 40,000 .
Israeli officials are reported to be discussing ways either to make it illegal for foreign governments to fund “ political ” organisations in Israel or to force such groups to declare themselves as “ agents of a foreign government ” .
“ Just as it would be unacceptable for European governments to support anti-war NGOs in the US , it is unacceptable for the Europeans to support local NGOs opposed to the policies of Israel ’s democratically elected government , ” said Ron Dermer , a senior official in Mr Netanyahu ’s office .
He added that many of the groups were “ working to delegitimise the Jewish state ” .
Jeff Halper , the head of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions , said the government ’s position was opposed to decades - old developments in human rights monitoring .
“ Every dictator , from Hitler to Milosevic , has said that there must be no interference in their sovereign affairs , and that everyone else should butt out .
But international law says human rights are universal and cannot be left to individual governments to interpret .
The idea behind the Geneva Conventions is that the international community has a duty to be the watchdog on human rights abuses wherever they occur . ”
Mr Halper , whose organisation last year received 80,000 euros from Spain to rebuild demolished Palestinian homes , was arrested last year for sailing to Gaza with peace activists to break the siege of Gaza .
Other groups reported to be in the foreign ministry ’s sights are : B’Tselem , whose activities include providing Palestinians with cameras to record abuses by settlers and the army ; Peace Now , which monitors settlement building ; Machsom Watch , whose activists observe soldiers at the checkpoints ; and Physicians for Human Rights , which has recently examined doctors ’ complicity in torture .
The government ’s new approach mirrors a long - running campaign against leftwing and Arab human rights groups inside Israel conducted by NGO Monitor , a rightwing lobby group led by Gerald Steinberg , a professor at Bar Ilan University , near Tel Aviv .
NGO Monitor has also targeted international organisations such as Oxfam and Amnesty , but has shown a particular obsession with HRW .
Mr Steinberg recently boasted that HRW ’s trip to Saudi Arabia in May reflected the loss of major Jewish sponsors in the US following the publication of its Gaza reports .
In an article in the Jerusalem Post on Sunday , Mr Steinberg claimed that European governments treated their funding of Israeli human rights organisations “ as ‘ top secret ’ , reflecting the realization that such activities lack legitimacy ” .
Mr Mannekin said the Breaking the Silence report listed donors on the first page .
“ We are far more transparent than NGO Monitor .
We do n’t know who funds them . ”
NGO Monitor , which according to its website is chiefly funded by the shadowy Wechsler Family Foundation in the US , is closely linked to Dore Gold , a hawkish former adviser to Ariel Sharon .
Mr Mannekin added : “ The government cannot suppress information about what happened in Gaza by shutting us down .
You ca n’t send 10,000 soldiers into battle and not expect that some of the details will come out .
If it ’s not us doing it , it ’ll be someone else . ”
The government ’s current campaign follows a police raid on the homes of six Israeli women peace activists in April .
The women , all members of New Profile , a feminist organisation that opposes the militarisation of Israeli society , were arrested and accused of helping Israeli youngsters to evade the draft .
The women are still waiting to learn whether they will be prosecuted .
British police have apologised for failing to help a mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter by setting fire to their car after years of abuse from a gang of youths .
Fiona Pilkington pleaded for police assistance as she and her family suffered 10 years of torment and violence at the hands of the gang in Bullwell in central England , an inquest into their deaths heard .
But their requests to officers and local authorities were not given priority and their bodies were found in their burning car near their home in October 2007 , the court heard .
A jury at the inquest concluded on Monday that police failure to help the family properly - despite 33 calls logged to police over the 10 years - contributed to Pilkington 's decision to end their lives .
" Calls were not linked or prioritised , " the jury foreman said .

Researchers have found the unexpected in U.S. life expectancy :
We might have peaked .
Life expectancy rates rose for most of Americans over the last four decades by about six years , from an average of about age 71 to age 77 .
Yet a sizeable portion of the population , mostly in rural regions , saw those modest gains level off and even reverse starting in the 1980s .
This is in contrast to all other industrialized nations .
Nearly 20 percent of American women , in fact , experienced either stagnation or a decline in longevity , what researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Washington call a " reversal of fortunes . "
A team led by Harvard 's Majid Ezzati published these findings today in the online medical journal PLoS Medicine .
The analysis — the first to look at mortality trends county by county — is based on mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau between 1959 and 2001 .
Living large , and less
The findings are troublesome , the researchers said , because life expectancy , along with infant mortality , is a major indicator of the health of a nation .
A decline in life expectancy , as is seen during turmoil such as war and famine , is a sign that health and social systems are failing .
This failing trend could easily spread to the rest of the nation , meaning that for the first time in the history of this country , parents will have lived longer than their children .
Hardest hit are regions in the Deep South , along the Mississippi River , in Appalachia and also the southern part of the Midwest reaching into Texas .
The culprits — largely preventable with better diet and access to medical services — are diabetes , cancers and heart disease caused by smoking , high blood pressure and obesity .
Two Americas
The U.S. life expectancy already is nothing to brag about .
The United States is the wealthiest country on earth , yet the life expectancy of its people is only about 78 years , which places us 41st on the 2008 CIA World Factbook list , behind Bosnia but still edging out Albania .
What the new analysis reveals is the reality of two Americas , one on par with most of Europe and parts of Asia , and another no different than a third world nation .
For example , previous research has shown that the U.S. state of Georgia has a life expectancy and infant mortality rate similar to the impoverished Eastern European nation of Georgia .
In Harlem , African American men are less likely to reach the age of 65 than men in Bangladesh , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The United States might still be the destination for complicated surgery and cutting - edge procedures , but for the most part it fails its poorest citizens , with about 36 million of them ( 12 percent of the population , according to the CIA World Factbook ) living below the poverty line .
As a result , the U.S. healthcare system ranks 37th on a list of 191 systems compiled by the World Health Organization .
Science can't increase life expectancy forever ; good ol ' inequality will trump it every time .
The new longevity analysis should be a wake - up call for voters that this nation is n't No. 1 . Maybe it does n't need to be No. 1 , but , given our vast resources , it would be nice to strive for something better than 41st place .

Quotations
Farm girls turn calendar pin-ups for risqué charity photo shoot
A group of young female farmers from North Devon have posed in nothing but their wellies for a Calendar Girls - style photo shoot for charity .
The 11 girls , who are all members of Young Farmers ' Clubs ( YFC ) in North Devon , stripped off for the 2010 Cancer Research UK calendar .
They are hoping to raise £ 2,000 in sales from the calendar and are pictured doing farmyard chores - from milking cows and dressing horses to firing shotguns .
Hot chick :
The eleven farm girls posed naked for a charity calendar in aid of Cancer Research UK .
Organiser Hayley Cooper poses as Miss April in pink wellies
The project was the brainchild of 18 - year - old YFC member Hayley Cooper .
She said : ' I try and do something for charity every year but this has been by far the most nerve - racking .
' When I first had the idea and rang around the YFCs to see who was interested , loads of girls signed up but said they never thought it would actually happen .
' When I rang them all back a few months later to say that I had booked the photographer , they were all very surprised and worried - a few even made their excuses and dropped out . '
Hay , looking good : Miss June Georgie Harris mucks out the horses for the charity calendar
Horse play : Miss October Natasha Davey poses on her steed in the style of Lady Godiva
The shoot took place last month at Miss Cooper 's farm in Roborough .
Georgie Harris , who appears in the calendar as Miss June , said : ' The day of the shoot was most amusing - especially when the local churchgoers of Roborough turned up for a service and got a good eyeful of me posing for my photo - how embarrassing . '
Jenny Ashton , who is Miss September , said : ' I was slightly nervous but after the first photo I was well up for it .
' The only down side of the day was being pooed on by the cow I was standing with - it was extremely funny but I had to be cleaned off while standing naked in a parlour . '
Nice wheels : Miss March , Catherine Bellew , wears polka - dot boots for her pose on a tractor
Udderly gorgeous : Miss September 's Jenny Ashton poses in green wellies milking a cow
Giving it some wellie : Hollie Wood poses with a pail and a bale of hay as the calendar 's Miss August
Miss Cooper added : ' Both my granddads and my auntie died of cancer so my main motivation for doing this calendar is for them .
' We hope to raise more than £ 2,000 from sales of the calendar , all of which will go to Cancer Research UK . '
A local farmer commented : ' They are all pretty girls and this will probably see a big rise in people wanting to join the YFCs .
' They are all starkers apart from their colourful wellies .
I would n't mind them in my fields , ' he said .

It never ceases to amaze me that people who say we can " save the planet " by wearing a jumper or growing our own veg are treated with the utmost seriousness , while those who argue that tackling climate change might require some larger - scale projects – such as geo-engineering the Earth – are treated as sci- fi freaks who should stick to reading Philip K Dick novels and stop polluting public debate with their insane ideas .
When it comes to climate change , the only acceptable debate , it seems , is how we can encourage ordinary people to do less , consume less and fly less .
Bigger and more far - reaching ideas about how we might offset the impact of climate change are elbowed off the agenda .
This reveals something profound about environmentalism : it is not really a campaign to find solutions to the practical problem of climate change , but rather has become a semi-religious , almost medieval demonisation of human behaviour as dirty and destructive .
This is really a priestly , ideological effort to lower people 's horizons and expectations , rather than a focused attempt to create a less polluted planet .
Consider the events of yesterday .
First , the 10:10 campaign – supported by the Guardian – was launched .
Its aim is to encourage people and organisations to cut their carbon emissions by 10 % in 2010 .
Second , the Royal Society published a report on the need to invest in geo- engineering projects , such as putting a giant mirror on the moon to deflect the sun ray 's from Earth or erecting enormous " CO2 scrubbers " to clean the air .
( In keeping with orthodoxy , however , the Royal Society also said that such projects should not detract from their efforts to reduce carbon emissions . )
Needless to say , the 10:10 campaign – with its exhortations to " turn off the lights " or " grow veg on the balcony " – was treated more seriously than the Royal Society report .
Indeed , Greenpeace rubbished any talk of geo-engineering , claiming that " intervening in our planet 's systems carries huge risks " and will " undermine " the need to continue pursuing " emissions reductions " .
In short , large - scale solutions to climate change only divert attention from the myopic , mean - spirited focus on changing people 's behaviour and outlook .
Unfortunately , the 10:10 campaign highlights the petty moralism behind environmentalism .
At the launch at the Tate Modern last night , the artist Bob and Roberta Smith suggested that people who own a 4x4 should spend a " night in the cells " .
Another attendee said " it 's immoral to be wasteful " .
Other 10:10 supporters promise to eat less " junk food " and to take fewer flights .
It 's hard to know what is more galling about these pledges to live a cleaner life : the fact that they implicitly demonise certain forms of leisurely behaviour – especially the kind enjoyed by the 4x4 - driving , junk - food - eating nouveau riche – or the idea that making these minor changes will " save the planet " .
There is a glaring disconnect between the scaremongering employed by environmentalists and their proposed solutions .
In one breath they tell us we face the worst crisis in human history , one which will make " genocide and ethnic cleansing look like sideshows at the circus of human suffering " , and in the next they tell us we can avoid this disaster by wearing thermal underwear instead of turning on the heat and going to Leon instead of McDonald's .
No wonder " ordinary people " are n't enthusiastically signing up to the environmentalist ethos .
They know it simply does n't make sense to say that we face an enviro - holocaust and then to claim we can prevent it by not taking a cheap flight to Majorca .
Yesterday Ian Katz said that only " a small , saintly portion of the population " is taking climate change seriously ; that is because the larger , presumably un-saintly portion of the population instinctively recognises that changing their lightbulbs will not prevent the alleged End of Days .
The moralistic nature of environmentalism was revealed in the reports of the 10:10 launch .
It took place in the Tate Modern , a " cathedral to the concept of cutting emissions " , the Guardian said ; individuals held up pledge cards and promised to wear the 10:10 necklace , like a modern - day crucifix marking them out as Good .
It reminded me more than anything else of those youthful members of the religious right in the US who take pledges to be decent people , only where they " just say no " to sex and alcohol , the 10:10 supporters " just say no " to junk food and flights .
Franny Armstrong flatteringly compares the 10:10 campaign to the Suffragette movement .
Yet Sylvia Pankhurst said : " Socialism means plenty for all .
We do not preach a gospel of want and scarcity , but of abundance …
We do not call for limitation of births , for penurious thrift , and self - denial .
We call for a great production that will supply all , and more than all the people can consume . "
The 10:10 campaign , I 'm afraid , is the very opposite of that .
Pharmaceutical giant Wyeth paid medical writing companies to prepare 26 review articles that promoted the benefits of hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) with its drugs Premarin and Prempro and minimized the risks , the New York Times reported today .
The ghostwriting was revealed in court documents obtained by the Times and the journal PLoS Medicine .
The documents are part of the paperwork for about 8,400 lawsuits filed against Wyeth by women who say they were damaged by the drugs , which have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease , among other problems .
The articles were primarily summaries of information gleaned from scholarly papers describing clinical research and were typically signed by prestigious physicians who had little to do with their preparation , the Times reported .
Some researchers believe that the articles helped boost sales of the Wyeth drugs to their peak of nearly $ 2 billion in 2001 , the year before studies linking the hormones to heart disease came out .
A spokesman for the company insisted that the articles are scientifically accurate .
But in 2006 , he said , the company embraced a policy requiring the source of such articles to be acknowledged in the published text .
The news followed earlier reports that some pharmaceutical companies had paid publishers to produce specialized journals narrowly focused on disciplines where their drugs play a major role in treatment .
Other pharmaceutical companies have also been linked to ghostwriting of review articles that promote drugs .

Oh wait , it 's sold out .
As a parent , and a geek desperately clinging to his childhood , this image really speaks to me .
I ’ve been a huge fan of Calvin & Hobbes since the early days of its publication .
I ’ve got my own inner-Calvin , so I really connected with the daily strip .
I was very wrapped up in the series back then and was about crushed when Bill Watterson retired .
Now years later , I ’m raising two children and passing on my own childhood interests to them .
On top of the emotional impact of the image , I gotta say the artist did a phenomenal job mimicking Watterson ’s style .
Makes me want to shed some parental - man - tears .

Years ago , when I was doing some political work for a local union , I went to a conference on using the ( then ) new technologies to harness voters .
One of the presenters at this conference made a point that ought to burned into the frontal cortex of every campaign team in America .
He said that most campaigns using blast e-mails invariably messed up , because darned near every e-mail included an entreaty for money .
It was hard not to see the temptation for campaigns to do this : campaigns run on money , and sending out an e-mail appeal for cash to your campaign list was infinitely less work - intensive than doing classic written appeals for cash , or holding time - consuming ( and often expensive ) fundraisers .
But there was a real consequence for the campaign that used blast e-mails exclusively as a fundraising tool .
Playing the " e- mail money appeal " too often quickly led to a serious case of diminishing returns .
People , getting the increasing feeling that they were being used as an ATM , would shut down and stop reading e-mails .
Not only would they stop sending money , they 'd simply delete the e-mails when they saw them .
Thus , any other attempts at voter contact ( informational pieces , action alerts , etc. ) would go unheeded , because the campaign 's voter list was , by and large , tuning the candidate out .
Like many politically motivated souls , my in - box will be inundated in a typical week with missives from campaigns and political parties .
Two such e-mails which were sent over the past week underscored the lesson taught at that conference close to a decade ago .
For example , this popped into my inbox over last weekend .
Attention to all campaigns and candidates -- this is how you do it :
Dear Steve ,
When our daughter Thomasin was in the second grade , her teacher asked each student to write a story about how their parents met .
So , she came home and asked me how I met her Mom .
I explained that I was at what was known as a freshman ' mixer , ' what she knew as a ' dance , ' during my first year of college .
I saw Franni from across the room .
She was organizing some girls to leave and I really liked how she was taking charge , which , in hindsight , is not her best quality ...
Also , she was just beautiful .
So I asked her to dance , and we danced .
And then I bought her a ginger ale .
After the dance I escorted her back to her dorm and asked her for a date .
Thomasin wrote the story up with stunning accuracy .
She told her class , " ... my Dad asked my Mom to dance , bought her a drink , and took her home . "
Even at a young age , she had a keen grasp of the facts and a real knack for editing .
That night - the first night of the best thing that has ever happened to me - was exactly 40 years ago today .
When I was running for the Senate , I used to tell people , " Franni and I are running for the Senate .
If we win , I get to be the Senator . "
Well , we won .
And what I said proved true - I get to be the Senator .
Another thing that 's true is that I would n't be where I am today without the love and support of the most amazing woman in the world .
And , as we start the next chapter of our journey together , I wanted to send supporters like you a note .
A funny story from long ago in hopes that you might take a moment today , remember a funny story about someone you love , smile , and be thankful .
All the best , Al P.S. Happy Anniversary Franni , I love you !
Notice the critical characteristic of this e-mail : it has absolutely nothing to do with money , or campaigning , or anything of the sort .
It is pure Franken , sharing part of his life with his supporters , as only Al Franken can .
It is a sign to Franken 's undoubtedly massive e-mail list : " I am thinking of you guys , even when I do n't want you to empty your wallets or fill a rally . "
Besides being smart politics ( anyone who maintains a relationship like that with his / her supporters can count on the legwork and money when it is needed ) , it is a touching story with a wonderful message at the end .
Whether he did or not , one gets the sense that Franken wrote this himself , that this was not some focus - group tested pile of platitudes designs to persuade and influence .
By midweek , a money appeal from the Franken campaign landed in inboxes , in the form of a short message from ... Franni Franken .
I do n't know how successful this particular fundraising appeal was for Team Franken , but I do know that it was set up perfectly by the college story shared with his supporters just four days earlier .
Contrast that with the e-mail that landed in inboxes on Tuesday .
Because I do n't want to " call out " the campaign in question , I will keep the candidate 's name out of it .
It was one of the more atrocious attempts at campaign communications I have seen in quite some time from a professional campaign .
It had the potential to be an excellent piece .
The candidate focused the e-mail on a piece of potentially damaging information about the way that his opponent was raising campaign cash , among a few other solid pieces of information that could be very damaging for his rival .
If that had been the thrust of the e-mail ( complete with media links which could guide the reader to further accounts of the issues at hand ) , this would have been a solid piece of communication that could be used as an action item ( write letters to the editor , call the local paper , etc. ) .
Instead , it devolved into one of the most ham - handed fundraising appeals one could find .
The message was a short one : not counting appeals for money , the e-mail consisted of only 208 words .
In those eleven sentences , there were three " please contribute " links interspersed , a fourth appeal for contributions in the final sentence of the piece ( in case the first three links somehow went unseen ) .
And , on the off - chance that the first four appeals for moolah had gone unnoticed , there was a big contribution button beneath the signature .
The gist of this campaign message : " I have some really interesting information about my opponent .
But what I really , really want is your money . "
There is a lesson here , and not just in the realm of candidate e-mails .
This also speaks to the myriad of politicos that come to this site .
It can not be said often enough -- the campaign that tends towards dropping the occasional diary ( often with a helpful campaign and fundraising link ) , while never commenting or engaging the community is making a serious underestimation of their electorate .
The activists that comprise the party base are fairly sophisticated folks .
They know when they are being genuinely engaged , and they know when they are being used .
They will crawl over busted glass to help people who will attempt the former , and they will soon dismiss those that attempt the latter .
Campaigns would be wise to learn this .
It was a nightmare .
Like you , I read LRC every morning , but in my bad dream I turned on my computer only to find a 404 page - not - found error .
LewRockwell.com was no longer on the air .
I immediately wondered : what the heck is going to happen to all of us who depend on LRC ?
One lady said it kept her out of a padded room .
A college student wrote that this site helped him refute liberal professors .
A businessman said it taught him all he needed to know about the nature of government .
As for me , well , I feel like I have a virtual degree in Murray Rothbard studies .
Of course , if insults and smears were physical blows , Lew Rockwell would be in a body cast .
But you know what ?
He ’d still be hobbling along , smiting the enemy , unstoppable .
Thank goodness he ’s that way , for all our sakes .
Thank goodness the neocons and all the other statists do n’t faze him .
Thank goodness he finds joy in the battle .
And thank goodness he ’s a great editor .
There is a reason that LRC is the best - read libertarian site in the world , and ranked 11 of the 100 most important political sites in America .
Basically , as one young lady wrote , " LewRockwell.com rocks . "
Of course , politicians do n’t like it .
Except Ron Paul , who calls LRC his " favorite site in the whole world , and the first one I read every morning . "
The old media ca n’t stand LRC .
Where , they want to know , as Hillary put it , are the regime ’s " gatekeepers " ?
They are locked out of LRC .
That ’s why lovers of government coercion — neo , fasco , Marxo , and all the rest — despise LRC ( while secretly reading it , of course ) .
Their animus is a medal on Lew ’s chest .
But medals wo n’t pay the bills , and if the LRC bank account were a gasoline gauge , the needle would be nearing the big E .
So far there is no " 404 " notice , and may there never be !
But there is some good news that slightly worries me .
With few resources , Lew wants to expand LRC .
He wants to make it more like a daily libertarian newspaper for the 21st century , covering culture and sports as well as economics , history , politics , and everything .
First , however , Lew wants to add comments to the blogs and articles , which readers have been clamoring for .
But it ’s expensive if done right .
We have to make sure that our anti-spam software is the best , since spam can knock a site off the air by itself .
And we must have moderators to make sure that the comments are civil and intelligent .
Why ?
Because Lew is a lightning rod .
For a guy dedicated to social cooperation and international peace , to freedom and non-violence , to private property and sound money , to our libertarian heritage and our great heroes , Lew sure has a lot of opponents .
There are the freedom haters .
But the regime pays well , in fact and in prospect .
Others will offer their souls to the state because it seems cool , and so uncool to be a dissident in fascist times .
But there are many of us who love this site , and who think it ’s essential to the cause of liberty , here and all around the world , and we love liberty .
Not only must LRC survive in that cause , it must thrive .
My dream : to see it challenge the very top sites in news and opinion .
It is possible .
But first LRC must survive .
Please help me make sure it does .
Help me make sure that LRC grows and influences many , many thousands more for freedom .
Make a generous donation to LRC .
Go here to give .
Help me keep LRC going and growing .
There must be no popping of champagne corks on Capitol Hill or in any other place where " the gang of thieves writ large , " as Murray put it , meets to rip us off .
Help me keep the LRC dream alive .
The Best of Glenn Jacobs
I replied to an email I got this morning from one of our readers who requested to get quotes from solar installation companies a few weeks ago .
He was just curious whether there was any new solar technology out there he was n’t about to miss the boat on by going solar right now .
This is a common reaction among people considering solar .
In other realms , it ’s referred to as “ cognitive dissonance ” .
People need to feel they are getting the best available option all the way through the buying process .
That ’s why whizbang reports of newfangled solar technology can confuse people into thinking installing solar on their roof is now unwise .
Continual “ solar breaking news ” makes it easy to hear the rumble of progress around the corner – even though nobody has seen any of it with their own eyes .
Sometimes I compare this “ lets wait and see ” solar reaction to someone who is looking to get to a once in a lifetime symphony performance .
You have the opportunity to leave now and get there 15 minutes before show time with your friend who drives a Honda , or you could wait some indeterminate amount of time longer for this super sleek hydrogen powered neon limo to roll by and pick you up .
After all , a flyer from the sky informed you earlier in the year the hydrogen limo is on pace to cruise by your house around now to give you a supersonic ride anywhere you want to go .
Of course by waiting , you risk being late or missing the show .
Investing in solar panels may not seem like you ’re biting into the latest nectar filled bosom of solar technology the internet is all aflutter about , but you can rest assured those panels will perform admirably for decades , kinda of like your buddy ’s Honda .
That neon hydrogen limo might not make it around the corner .
If arriving on time to the once in a lifetime symphony above is equivalent to your payback time on the solar energy system , I can only speak for myself , but I ’d rather be in the Honda .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba , in the grip of a serious economic crisis , is running short of toilet paper and may not get sufficient supplies until the end of the year , officials with state - run companies said Friday .

Officials said they were lowering the prices of 24 basic goods to help Cubans get through the difficulties provoked in part by the global financial crisis and three destructive hurricanes that struck the island last year .
Cuba ’s financial reserves have been depleted by increased spending for imports and reduced export income , which has forced the communist - led government to take extraordinary measures to keep the economy afloat .
“ The corporation has taken all the steps so that at the end of the year there will be an important importation of toilet paper , ” an official with state conglomerate Cimex said on state - run Radio Rebelde .
The shipment will enable the state - run company “ to supply this demand that today is presenting problems , ” he said .
Cuba both imports toilet paper and produces its own , but does not currently have enough raw materials to make it , he said .
One of the measures taken to address the cash crunch is a 20 percent cut in imports , which in recent days has become evident in the reduction of goods in state - run stores .
Cuba imports about 60 percent of its food .
Despite the shortages , prices will be cut between 5 percent and 27 percent for some food , drugs and personal hygiene products , officials said .
A visit to a store in Havana ’s Vedado neighborhood on Friday found that prices had dropped for mayonnaise , barbecue sauce and canned squid .
One customer , who gave his name only as Pedro , complained that “ it does n’t look like prices have been lowered for the fundamental products ” such as cooking oil .
Ana Maria Ortega , deputy director for military - run retail conglomerate TRD Caribe , said there will be no shortage of basic goods .
“ The conditions are in place to maintain the supply of essential products , ” she said on the same radio program .
Cubans receive a subsidized food ration from the government each month that they say meets their needs for about two weeks .
President Raul Castro told the National Assembly last week that the government had cut its spending budget for the second time this year and has been renegotiating its debt and payments with foreign providers .
Cuba has long blamed the 47 - year - old U.S. trade embargo against the island for many of its economic problems .
It also said that last year ’s hurricanes did $ 10 billion worth of damage that forced the government to spend heavily on imports of food and reconstruction products .
Castro , who replaced his ailing older brother Fidel Castro as president last year , also has complained that Cuba ’s productivity is too low .
He has taken various steps to boost output , including putting more state - owned land in private hands and pushing for salaries to be based on productivity .
In terms of her biographical details , Marie Bila is a 77 year - old grandmother , who lives in small village in the Czech Republic with a cat called Jasmina , 15 chickens and goat Liza .
This year however , she 's become Granny Coder , and is proving you 're never too old to become a game developer .
On her blog , and helped by her three grandsons , she 's been documenting the process of making her first game - an iPhone physics puzzle game called Not only is it an interesting read in terms of the development process , but her enthusiasm for the game she 's making also makes it a delight .
We wanted to find out more ... Marie Bila :
My name is Marie , I 'm from little village called Lhota in the Czech Republic and I 'm retired .
I had lots of free time , and a few month ago my grandson Michal bought me an iPhone .
It really amazed me , and when I realised you can make your own applications on it , and that even little kids can do that , I decided to use my free time and to try and create something by myself .
I 've had lots of different jobs in my life , but the important job for my current ' game developer ' career was probably working at University in Brno , where ( apart from other things ) I was involved in some IT projects and learnt basics of the C and C++ programming language .
I would n't call myself a programmer , but after this experience I know a little bit about how things work .
I 'm playing games on my iPhone now and before that I 've played a few PC games - like - I really love that one .
I also like the Czech game
The first games I ever played were in the 1980s on the ZX Spectrum .
I felt a need to create a game then , but at that time I had lots of other things to do .
When iPhone came into my life , I felt that need again .
And this time I have another reason for creating a game - I wanna do a game for my grandchildren .
I had an idea about a ' physics ' game a long time ago .
That idea evolved in my head .
It was influenced by games such asandand also by the movieAnd , of course , the gameis quite similar toand had huge impact on me when I 've discovered it .
I decided on a puzzle game because I wanted to start with something simple .
I know every detail about farming and gardening , and a game based on these things would be really complex and much harder for me to create .
And another thing , I want this game mainly for my grandchildren and they are not really into gardening and farming , so I guess they would n't like them in a game either .
Optimising the code .
I 've written some articles about that on my blog and I 'm preparing another one .
I 'm still finding ways to improve the code , but it 's really hard and takes lots of time .
I 'm working on the high score system right and I 'm designing the main menu in my head .
I want it to be more interactive .
In other games you 've just got some buttons such as New Game , Setting etc But in Gelex , there will be other little things to do .
They will be useless , but funny .
But there are still lots of other things to do like music and sounds .
I do n't have any of them yet .
According to my plans I want to finish the game in a month or month and a half .
I love just playing with the bricks , hitting one with another and seeing how the physics works .
That 's what I really like in the game .
I would love to .
I already have some ideas about a new game and if I 'm healthy enough to continue with game development then I do n't see any reason to stop .
I have a huge support from my three grandsons .
Michal bough me an iPhone as I mentioned , then they gave me a Mac , because I had a Windows PC .
One of them is studying IT at university , so he is my adviser sometimes .
And all three of them are watching everything I create and give me feedback .
They 've also made the videos on my blog .
The rest of the family does n't really care , but my grandsons are my biggest fans and my motivation .
As I mentioned before , my grandson Pavel helps me sometimes with some harder things about programming .
He is really good at it , but he is not doing anything on iPhone .
I am also a member of some developer forums , but I am a passive member - just reading what other people say .
And I have some contact with other iPhone developers through twitter .
That mainly helps my motivation .
If your dream or goal is to create a game , you should definitely follow it .
It 's not easy to create a game : especially in the beginning you will need to learn a lot , but it is worth it .
Each time I create a new part of the game I am so proud of it and that feeling is worth the effort .
You can keep up to date with the development ofon her Granny Coder blog and via twitter

Joey , our snakes have been squeaky lately .
Run up the street to Lonnie ’s blanket and buy a worthless preparation , please . ”
“ Oh Ma , is n’t there someplace else we can get a quack remedy ? ”
“ No young man , Lonnie has the best worthless preparations in all Yangon .
That ’s why he has his own blanket ! ”

More stuff from Oddly Enough
The Pirate Bay , the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker , was unavailable Monday after a court ordered a leading Swedish ISP to block access .
But some users were able to reach the site again just hours later .
The order by a Swedish district court came months after the four co-founders of The Pirate Bay ( where copyrighted movies , games , software and music can be found for free ) were found guilty of facilitating copyright infringement and ordered jailed a year each pending an appeal .
After the April trial in Stockholm , the Hollywood movie studios urged the court to close The Pirate Bay .
They did so early Monday ... or tried .
A few hours after the block was enacted , former Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde encouraged users to refresh their DNS cache to get a new internet IP address for the Bay .
Some users reported success at the new address , which is registered to DCP Networks , a company owned by convicted Pirate Bay financier Frederick Neij .
But by 2:30 eastern time , it too was unreachable by Threat Level , as was the company website .
A cat - and - mouse game appears to be unfolding .
Sunde puts his money on the mouse .
Or is that the cat ?
Anyway , he says the Pirate Bay will prevail .
" Some of the most talented network people in the world have been working with the site , with a tremendous threat from the most corrupt and powerful corporations in the world , " Sunde wrote in an e-mail .
" A plan B ( and C , D , E and F ) is always in existence . "
The developments were days ahead of the potential sale of the site to Global Gaming Factory , which was to transform it into a pay - to - play venue for content .
None of the major content providers , however , have announced a licensing deal .
UPDATE :
Hans Pandeya , CEO of Global Gaming Factory , is apparently unfazed by the court - ordered outage of a website he 's about to pay $ 8.5 million to aquire .
" It does n't concern me actually , " Pandeya told Threat Level on Monday .
" But I do n't want to tell you why . "
Shareholders are expected to vote on the deal Thursday .
Pandeya and the company 's board control a majority of the company 's stock , and Pandeya says he still expects the sale to go through .

In the 19th century , Philadelphia did n't have a fire department ; it had lots of competing private fire departments .
Ben Franklin had set up the system some decades before , and had encouraged the formation of competing firefighter brigades on the grounds that it would promote more vigilant and more widespread coverage of the city .
Fast forward to about 1840 , and the system is now a gigantic freaking mess .
Fire departments were now affiliated with fire insurance companies , and , increasingly , with political parties and political machines .
They 'd sabotage each other 's equipment .
Sometimes rival companies even exchanged musket fire .
Two companies on the scene of a fire would literally stand there and argue over whose fire it was while the building burned down .
If your house was on fire but you did n't have the mark on your door that indicated you were fully paid up with your insurance company ( * ) , they would stand by and watch it burn .
They 'd pay kids to slap a barrel over a fire hydrant and sit on it , so as to deny use of the hydrant to another company .
The solution , to us here in the present , seems obvious : eliminate all the private fire departments -- funded by insurance companies and politics and accountable to God knows who -- and replace them with one fire department , funded by everybody and accountable to everybody .
That 's the way we do it today .
It is not free -- you pay for it with taxes plus if they respond to a fire at your house , the city does bill you -- but it 's cheaper for everyone and more equitable .
Like it or not , there are some cases where competition just does not make sense and a government monopoly does .
* Remember , " fire insurance " in this context is for the firefighters to show up .
It does n't cover rebuilding or replacing your stuff .
“ Some experts have doubts about the missile shield concept , ” as the more cautious reporters put it .
( That example comes from the BBC Web site . )
A franker journalist would say that the ballistic missile defence system that the Bush administration planned to put into Poland and the Czech Republic — and that President Barack Obama has just cancelled — has never worked , and shows few signs of ever doing so .
Obama has done the right thing .
It saves money that would have been wasted , and it repairs relations with Russia , which was paranoid about the system being so close to its borders .
And the cancellation also signals a significant decline in the paranoia in Washington about Iran .
“ Paranoia ” is the right word in both cases .
Iran does n’t have any missiles that could even come within range of the ballistice missile defence system that was to go into Poland and the Czech Republic , let alone nuclear warheads to put on them .
According to U.S. intelligence assessments , Iran is not working on nuclear weapons , nor on missiles that could reach Europe , let alone the United States .
Washington ’s decision to deploy the system anyway was so irrational that it drove the Russians into paranoia as well .
Their intelligence services told them the same thing that the U.S. intelligence community told the Bush administration : that Iran had no nuclear weapons or long - range ballistic missiles , nor any possibility of getting them within less than five to 10 years .
So what was the U.S. really up to , siting the system so close to Russia ’s borders ?
The intelligence people in Moscow also told Russian leaders that the U.S. system was useless junk that had never managed to intercept an incoming missile in an honest operational test .
( All the tests were shamelessly rigged to make it easy for the intercepting missiles to strike their targets , and still they failed most of the time . )
Besides , although the planned ballistic missile defence base in Poland was close to Russia , it was in the wrong place to intercept Russian missiles .
So why did the Russians get paranoid about it ?
Because although they knew how the military - industrial complex worked in the United States ( and they have similar problems with their own domestic version ) , they simply could not believe that the United States would spend so much money on something so stupid and pointless .
Surely there was something they were missing ; some secret American strategy that would put them at a disadvantage .
No , there was n’t , and almost everybody ( except some Poles and Czechs who want U.S. troops on their soil as a guarantee against Russian misbehaviour , and some people on the American right ) was pleased by Obama ’s decision to pull the plug on the project .
As Dmitry Rogozin , Russia 's ambassador to NATO , said : " It 's like having a decomposing corpse in your flat ( apartment ) , and then the undertaker comes and takes it away . "
But why did the Bush administration choose to deploy this nonfunctioning weapons system in Eastern Europe ?
Indeed , the same ballistic missile defence system has already been installed in California and Alaska to intercept North Korean missiles that cannot actually reach the United States either .
It ’s as if Ford or GM designed a car with faulty steering , and decided to put it on the market anyway .
The answer lies in another weapons project that began in 1946 : the nuclear - powered airplane .
It could stay airborne for months and fly around the world without refueling , its boosters promised , and that would give America a huge strategic advantage .
There was only one problem .
The nuclear reactor needed a lot of shielding , because the aircrew would be only feet ( metres ) away .
The shields had to be made of lead .
And lead - filled airplanes cannot fly .
Fifteen years and about $ 10 billion ( in today ’s money ) later , there was still no viable design for a nuclear - powered bomber , let alone a flyable prototype .
Ballistic missiles were taking over the job of delivering nuclear weapons anyway .
But when Robert McNamara became defence secretary in the Kennedy administration in 1961 , he was astonished to discover that the nuclear - powered aircraft was still in the defence budget .
It was , he said , “ as if I came down to breakfast in the morning and found a dead walrus on the dining - room table ” .
It took McNamara two more years to kill the program , against fierce opposition from the air force and defence industry .
The fact that the nuclear - powered aircraft did not and could not work was irrelevant .
Former general Dwight D. Eisenhower ’s presidency is perhaps best remembered for his warning against what he named the “ military - industrial complex ” in his farewell speech in 1960 , but he actually gave two warnings .
The other was that “ public policy could become the captive of a scientific - technological elite . ”
These were the lobbies that kept the nuclear airplane going for 17 years , and they have kept the ballistic missile defence system going for more than a quarter - century already .
President Obama has killed the most pointlessly provocative of the ballistic missile defence deployments , but he still cannot take the political risk of admitting that the system does n’t work ( though he twice explained in his speech that the United States needed missile defence systems that were “ proven and cost - effective ” . )
It is the grandchild of Star Wars , a sacred relic blessed by Saint Ronald Reagan himself , and it will keep appearing on various dining - room tables for years to come .

Die Partei macht vor , wie man im Internet Wähler für sich begeistern kann , und stiehlt dort den etablierten Politikern die Schau .
Denn von der CSU bis hin zur Linken buhlen alle Parteien im Netz so intensiv um Stimmen wie noch nie .
Nach dem erfolgreichen Online - Wahlkampf von Barack Obama hofften die Parteistrategen auch in Deutschland vor allem junge Wähler mit modernen Mitteln zu erreichen .
So stellen Politiker Videos auf YouTube , wetteifern darum , wer mehr Fans und Freunde in den sozialen Netzwerken wie Facebook oder StudiVZ hat , und schreiben im Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter um die Wette .
The NBA will this week introduce what it considers " minimal " guidelines for players , coaches and team officials when using Twitter and other social networking sites , according to sources with knowledge of the policy .
The primary restriction of the policy is expected to prevent various team representatives from tweeting during games , after the stir caused late last season when Detroit Pistons forward Charlie Villanueva , then with Milwaukee , tweeted from the Bucks ' locker room during halftime .
One source described the forthcoming policy as " very minimal " and " less stringent " than the guidelines announced earlier this month by the NFL , which now regards players , coaches and football operations personnel -- or any third party representing them -- to be in violation of league rules if they use social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook from 90 minutes before kickoff through the end of the standard post - game access period for media interviews .
Individual NBA teams , though , will have the right to impose their own standards that might be more strict , as seen with the NBA dress code where some teams in the past have mandated more formal apparel -- such as suits on team flights -- than league rules dictate .
The source said that the NBA 's new policy , furthermore , will treat social - networking commentary in the same manner as comments made in the traditional media , which means that anyone in the league can be fined or otherwise sanctioned for posts via Twitter , Facebook , etc. , that are deemed over the line .
Villanueva was not fined by his team or the league last season but was forbidden by Bucks coach Scott Skiles from tweeting again during games .
Mobile - phone usage in the locker room and on team buses has long been frowned upon in the NBA , but the severity of restrictions generally vary from team to team given the rise in recent years in texting and e-mailing from handheld devices .
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban received the NBA 's first - ever fine for comments he made via his Twitter account , when Cuban was docked $ 25,000 last March after complaining about the referees ' refusal to call Denver Nuggets guard J.R. Smith for a technical foul following a clash between Smith and then - Mavericks guard Antoine Wright .
The league did not announce the fine , but Cuban disclosed the punishment via his Twitter feed , revealing that it could no longer be said that " no one makes money from Twitter now " because " the NBA does . "
Asked if the Mavericks will impose their own Twitter restrictions on their players this season , Cuban said Sunday : " Not really .
I will talk to the guys about never venting or talking about team business on Twitter .
That 's usually what creates problems .
[ But ]
Twitter is just another form of media .
What you say on Twitter is like saying it on ESPN . "
Formal confirmation of the new policy is expected from the league office this week after teams are officially notified .
The NBA Players Association has likewise said that it will withhold comment until details of the league 's policy are announced .
The NBA is widely considered to be one of the major professional sports leagues most associated with Twitter usage , largely thanks to Cleveland Cavaliers center Shaquille O'Neal , who responded to a Twitter user pretending to be O'Neal by launching his own Twitter feed , which now boats more than 2.3 million followers .
Other Twitter landmarks in the NBA besides Villanueva 's halftime tweet include the June disclosure by Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Love that coach Kevin McHale was leaving the organization -- before the news had been reported anywhere else -- and Allen Iverson 's numerous tweets about his summerlong courtship and eventual signing with the Memphis Grizzlies .
Marc Stein is a senior NBA writer for ESPN.com .

Art depicting life : a Mayan pot inspired by the trunk of a Ceiba tree
Some of the Central American rainforest 's hidden treasures are being revealed by the Maya , more than a millennium after their passing .
A study of the giant trees and beautiful flowers depicted in Maya art has identified which they held sacred .
Created during the Maya Classic Period , the depictions are so accurate they could help researchers spot plants with hitherto unknown medicinal uses .
The research is published in the journal Economic Botany .
Plants played a significant role in the ecology , culture and rituals of the Maya people , whose artwork reflected the rich diversity of plant life around them .
But while numerous examples of such artwork exist , few have been studied to see exactly which plants they depict .
So natural historian and archaeologist Charles Zidar of Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis , US , and botanist Wayne Elisens of the University of Oklahoma , Norman , US , decided to find out .
They hope to discover plants of importance to the Maya that are either unknown to modern people , or have since been forgotten .
The Maya have lived and used rainforest plants to heal themselves for thousands of years .
We are just beginning to understand some of their secrets
Archaeologist Charles Zadir
The team 's first analyses focused on artwork produced within the southern lowland region of the Maya , located in the modern countries of Belize , Guatemala and Mexico .
They examined more than 2,500 images of Maya ceramics created within the Maya Classical Period of AD 250 to 900 .
The images are held within an image collection taken by Justin and Barbara Kerr , curated by the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies , based in Crystal River , Florida , US .
In particular , the two men searched for depictions of bombacoids , a diverse lineage of trees in the Neotropics characterised by swollen or spiny trunks and big , colourful , conspicuous flowers with long folding petals .
Across different ceramics , Zidar and Elisens found depictions of five species .
" I was surprised that a variety of plants from this family were depicted , " says Zidar .
The Maya clearly depicted the cebia tree ( Ceiba pentandra ) also known as the Silk Cotton or Kapok tree .
Trees of the Ceiba genus can grow up to 50 m tall , with swollen trunks producing large buttresses .
White blooms on ceramic : Quararibea painted on a cup for drinking chocolate
To the Maya , the ceiba tree was sacred , mapping out the upper , middle and underworlds .
Considered the " first tree " , or " world tree " , the ceiba was thought to stand at the centre of the Earth .
Modern indigenous people still often leave the tree alone out of respect when harvesting forest wood .
The thorny trunks of the ceiba tree are represented by ceramic pots used as burial urns or incense holders , which are designed in a strikingly similar fashion .
Two other tree species , the Provision Tree ( Pachira aquatica ) and the Shaving Bush Tree ( Pseudobombax ellipticum ) are also copied into the designs of similar pots .
On cacao pots and a plate for holding tamales , made from dough , the Maya drew flowers of either P. ellipticum or P. aquatica .
On the cacao pot , the flowers seem to form part of the headdress of a high ranging individual .
Smaller white - flowered blossoms of Quararibea funebris or Q. quatemalteca also appear to adorn another vessel used for cacao drinking .
The Maya used this species to flavour and froth cacao beverages so it is appropriate for them to represent the plant on the vessel , says Zidar .
" It was previously thought that only the ceiba tree was of great importance , " says Zidar .
A Pseudobombax flower inspires a headdress worn by the Maya elite
" It has amazed me that so many plants are depicted .
These plants are not as stylised as previously though , and thus you can name the plant family , genus and even the species . "
Zidar is continuing the work , expanding it further to find out which animals as well as plants were considered of high importance by the Maya people .
He also hopes the research will unveil secrets known to the Maya that have become lost in time .
" The Maya have lived and used rainforest plants to heal themselves for thousands of years .
We are just beginning to understand some of their secrets . "
" By determining what plants were of importance to the ancient Maya , it is my hope that identified plants can be further studied for pharmaceutical , culinary , economic and ceremonial uses .
More should be done to conserve large tracts of forest in order to properly study theses plants for their value to mankind , " he continues .
" This research has already been of interest to pharmaceutical companies that are looking to extract alkaloids from plants that were important to the ancient Maya . "

Wisconsin court praises drunken underage concert goer
MADISON , Wis. --
An Illinois teen knew he was too drunk to drive home after a Dave Matthews Band concert south of Milwaukee .
So he fell asleep in his car , only to be awoken by a state trooper .
Travis Peterson , 19 , of Dixon , said even though he told the officer he was drunk and sleeping it off , the trooper ordered him to leave because the lot was being cleared .
Once out of the parking lot , Peterson was arrested for drunken driving .
He was subsequently found guilty and ordered to spend 60 days in jail .
A Wisconsin appeals court on Wednesday commended Peterson for doing the right thing by trying to sleep it off , and said the trial court was wrong not to let him argue that police had entrapped him .
The state had argued successfully at trial that people who choose to drink too much can't argue they 've been entrapped when stopped for drunken driving .
The 2nd District Court of Appeals disagreed .
" Drinking alcohol to excess , while inadvisable and unhealthy , is not unlawful by itself , " the appeals court said .
It did not address the fact that Peterson was underage .
Peterson 's attorney , Andrew Mishlove , said that was irrelevant given the other issues at stake .

Monopoly goes online with giant global game using Google Maps
Google is to team up with one of the world ’s biggest board game manufacturers to create an online version of Monopoly .
The search engine has called on Hasbro to produce the game , which will use Google Maps as a board so players can choose from millions of streets around the world to buy .
The online version will be the same as the traditional board game but players will be able to build football stadiums and skyscrapers as well as the usual houses and hotels .
Buy your own address :
An online Monopoly view of Mayfair in London .
The game uses Google Maps as a board
Building up : The online Google Maps version is being used to launch Monopoly City Streets
The Chance cards will also give players the chance to build prisons and rubbish dumps on their rivals ’ streets .
Players start the free game with three million Monopoly dollars and can buy Downing Street for $ 231,000 , while Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , where the White House stands , costs $ 2 million .
Rent is paid automatically each day , from $ 50,000 for a house to $ 100 million for a skyscraper .
Hasbro said : ' It ’s a chance to escape the harsh reality of recession and enjoy building up an empire . '
Traditional : The Monopoly board game as we know it .
Now manufacturer Hasbro is taking it into the digital age
It ’s the difference between the guy who got the marbleized rib-eye and the guy who got the oh - so - lean filet .
Or between the guy who got a Château Grand Pontet St. Emilion with his brie and the guy who got water .
As Edgar notes in King Lear , “ Ripeness is all . ”
You do n’t get to ripeness by eating apple peel for breakfast .
Speaking of St. Emilion , scientists , aware that most human beings do n’t have the discipline to slash their calorie intake by almost a third , have been looking for substances that might mimic the effects of caloric restriction .
They have found one candidate , resveratrol , in red wine .
The thing is there ’s not enough resveratrol in wine to do the trick , so scientists are trying to concentrate it , or produce a chemical like it in order to offer people the gain ( in life expectancy ) without the pain ( of dieting ) .
I do n’t buy this gain - without - pain notion .
Duality resides , indissoluble , at life ’s core —
Faust ’s two souls within his breast , Anna Karenina ’s shifting essence .
Life without death would be miserable .
Its beauty is bound to its fragility .
Dawn is unimaginable without the dusk .
When life extension supplants life quality as a goal , you get the desolation of Canto the monkey .
Living to 120 holds zero appeal for me .
Canto looks like he ’s itching to be put out of his misery .
There ’s an alternative to resveratrol .
Something is secreted in the love - sick that causes rapid loss of appetite — caloric restriction — yet scientists have been unable to reproduce this miracle substance , for if they did they would be decoding love .
Because love is too close to the divine , life ’s essence , it seems to defy such breakdown .

London is one of the world 's most monitored cities
Only one crime was solved by each 1,000 CCTV cameras in London last year , a report into the city 's surveillance network has claimed .
The internal police report found the million - plus cameras in London rarely help catch criminals .
In one month CCTV helped capture just eight out of 269 suspected robbers .
David Davis MP , the former shadow home secretary , said : " It should provoke a long overdue rethink on where the crime prevention budget is being spent . "
The Metropolitan Police has been extraordinarily slow to act to deal with the ineffectiveness of CCTV
David Davis MP
He added : " CCTV leads to massive expense and minimum effectiveness .
" It creates a huge intrusion on privacy , yet provides little or no improvement in security .
" The Metropolitan Police has been extraordinarily slow to act to deal with the ineffectiveness of CCTV . "
Nationwide , the government has spent £ 500 m on CCTV cameras .
But Det Sup Michael Michael McNally , who commissioned the report , conceded more needed to be done to make the most of the investment .
He said : " CCTV , we recognise , is a really important part of investigation and prevention of crime , so how we retrieve that from the individual CCTV pods is really quite important .
" There are some concerns , and that 's why we have a number of projects on - going at the moment . "
Among those projects is a pilot scheme by the Met to improve the way CCTV images are used .
A spokesman for the Met said : " We estimate more than 70 % of murder investigations have been solved with the help of CCTV retrievals and most serious crime investigations have a CCTV investigation strategy . "
Officers from 11 boroughs have formed a new unit which collects and labels footage centrally before distributing them across the force and media .
It has led to more than 1,000 identifications out of 5,260 images processed so far .
A Home Office spokeswoman said CCTVs " help communities feel safer " .

Kennedy 's death may rally Dems on health care

In the wake of Sen. Edward Kennedy 's death from brain cancer , Democrats hoped Wednesday to drum up bipartisan support for health care reform legislation , which Kennedy called " the cause of my life , " without being accused of over - politicizing a time of mourning .
" Ted Kennedy 's dream of quality health care for all Americans will be made real this year because of his leadership and his inspiration , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , declared after his death Tuesday .
And Conservatives for Patients Rights , one of the main groups opposing Democratic health care reform plans , said it was temporarily suspending its advertising campaign " out of respect to the Kennedy family " and colleagues .
But while Kennedy earned the respect of Democrats and Republicans during his 46 - year political career , it is unlikely that bipartisan goodwill will linger long past the tributes running up to his burial Saturday at Arlington National Cemetery , political experts said .
" Polarization is very strong in Washington .
There are few centrists , " said Julian Zelizer , a professor of public affairs and political history at Princeton University .
" So while there may be a lot of good feelings right now , I do n't think it will last after Congress returns in September . "
Historical precedent
There is historical precedent for Congress to use the passing of a colleague as a rallying cry for a piece of stalled legislation .
President Lyndon Johnson frequently invoked the memory of Kennedy 's brother , slain President John F. Kennedy , to pass his Great Society social programs in the mid-1960s .
But Zelizer said passage of social programs like Medicare was more a result of Johnson 's skill at muscling legislation through Congress than honoring the memory of JFK .
Still , Democrats in Congress , who have been under attack at town hall meetings on health care during this month 's Capitol recess , were aiming to gain momentum for a public insurance option and other elements of their party - backed bills in the House and Senate .
On Wednesday , Sen. Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , suggested naming the Senate version of health care legislation after Kennedy .
California Young Democrats told its supporters to call California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and " ask her to vote for health care for all , " one of Kennedy 's longtime goals , while liberal activist Ralph Neas , who leads the National Coalition on Health Care , said conservative " Blue Dog " Democrats might be inspired to support the legislation in Kennedy 's memory .
Conservative bloggers , including Glenn Reynolds at instapundit.com , were predicting that Kennedy 's passing would be a " Wellstone memorial on steroids . "
In 2002 , conservatives criticized a 20,000 - person memorial service for Minnesota Sen .
Paul Wellstone , who died while seeking re-election , as being a political rally for Walter Mondale , who was seeking to replace him .
" For whatever reason , liberal Democrats have a tendency to over - politicize events like this , " said Keith Appell , a spokesman for the group Conservatives for Patients Rights .
" I do n't think this will affect the debate at all . "
' Stop shouting '
California Sen. Barbara
Boxer said she hopes the national reflection on Kennedy 's life will lead to a more civil conversation about health care .
" What he would want us to do is stop the shouting and start the talking , " she told The Chronicle .
" What Ted would want us to do is to find that common ground , even if it is a small little patch , and build it into something . "
Added Rep. George Miller , D - Martinez , an architect of the House 's health reform bill : " We just went through a month of dangerous and misleading debate of a very raw political form .
Now , the question is , does the country really want to take a pause and remember why Sen.
Kennedy initiated this effort almost 40 years ago to bring health care insurance reform to every family ? "
Sen . Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , was noncommittal when asked if he would return to the panel 's bipartisan negotiations " in memory " of his friend with whom he often cooperated .
" I 'll be happy to work in a bipartisan basis any day , any time , " Hatch said .
" But it 's got to be on something that 's good and not just some partisan hack job . "
Anyone who has dealt with mold knows that it 's smelly , hard to remove , and can cause headaches — literally and figuratively .
You do n't have to accept its presence in your home !
Mold exposure can lead to health concerns , from rashes to respiratory ailments , so eliminating mold safely and effectively is important .
If you want to get rid of mold without harsh chemicals , read on .
" If you find mold in your home , do n't panic , " explains Dr. Lauren Tessier , a Naturopathic Physician in Vermont .
" Stressing over things just activates our flight or fight system , which can make us feel worse .
Simply make a plan and get to work . "
If you 've found mold in your home , you can use environmentally and budget - friendly DIY cleaning methods .
" The reality is , you will find a solution that will work for you , " says Tessier .
What Is Mold Exposure ?
Molds are fungi that grow on materials in homes and buildings .
You may hear it referred to as " black mold " or " toxic mold . " but there are many types of mold , and they can be almost any color .
Molds give off a musty odor and often look like a stain on surfaces such as wood , fabric , carpet , and drywall . [ 1 ]
Mold thrives in damp and moist environments .
It reproduces by releasing tiny spores into the air that people and pets inhale .
Cladosporium , Penicillium , Chaetomium , and Aspergillus are common molds you may encounter indoors .
Many people are worried about black mold ( usually Stachybotrys chartarum ) ; you can remove it as you do other species .
Like all forms of fungus , molds are living organisms that grow and reproduce .
In the right conditions ( warm , moist ) , most molds go through a four - stage life cycle : spore , germ , hypha , and mature mycelium . [ 2 ]
Mature molds produce microscopic spores and release them into the air , similar to plant seeds .
The spores land on a surface where they grow ( germ stage ) .
Hyphae are long , thin branching structures .
These hyphae join together to form a mycelium , which is a name for multiple hyphae together .
As the mold mycelium grows and expands , it eventually " fruits , " producing new spores and releasing them into the air to repeat the mold life cycle . [ 2 ]
Mold thrives if your home has water damage from rain , flooding , or a water leak .
The best way to break the mold life cycle and prevent exposure involves thoroughly cleaning all surfaces in the environment that have mold .
After that , remove excess humidity in the air to prevent it from taking hold again .
How Does Mold Affect Health ?
When you inhale mold — usually the spores — or get it on your skin , this is considered mold exposure .
The delicate mucous membranes of the nose , mouth , and ears are particularly sensitive to mold exposure .
People who live in homes with mold and damp conditions are more likely to experience health issues from mold exposure .
Some people call it " toxic mold " because of the health issues people may experience after exposure .
Many molds produce mycotoxins , naturally - occurring toxins produced by mold spores that pose a serious health risk to people .[ 3 , 4 , 5 ]
The most common symptoms of mold exposure include :
Chronic coughing
Congestion
Eye , nose , and throat irritation
Skin rash
Itchy skin
Eye irritation
Worsening allergies and asthma
Brain fog
Infants , children , the elderly , and those with existing health conditions such as asthma are at higher risk of developing health issues from mold exposure . [ 4 ]
Symptoms can occur immediately or show up later . [ 3 ]
Chronic exposure to mycotoxins can wear down your immune system .
They may cause abdominal pain , fever , headache , vomiting , and more . [ 6 ]
All mold has the potential to cause allergic reactions , leading to dry , scaly skin , watery eyes , and a runny or stuffy nose .
Take mold seriously .
It ’s not only harmful to your home , but also to your health .
Eco-Friendly Ways to Get Rid of Mold
Since we spend so much of our time at home , we want to make sure our homes are healthy environments .
If you know you have mold inside of your home , it ’s important to get it cleared away as soon as possible .
Before beginning any mold remediation , take steps to ensure that you do n’t expose your skin or mucous membranes to mold and mycotoxins during the cleaning process .
Look for these items : [ 7 ]
An adequate breathing mask or respiratory protective device ( e.g. , N95 mask )
Safety goggles
Rubber gloves
Old rags and a scrub brush
An N95 mask is designed for a close facial fit that provides efficient filtration of airborne particles such as mold spores .
You can purchase these at most home improvement stores .
Do n't pull out harmful chemicals like bleach to get rid of mold .
Plenty of natural remedies work .
Here are some of the most effective and safest ways to remove mold from surfaces in a healthy way .
These recipes are in quantities you would use for indoor cleaning .
If you have outdoor surfaces to clean mold off of , you may require larger quantities for these recipes .
Tea Tree Oil
Of all the natural solutions , tea tree oil ( Melaleuca alternifolia ) may be the most effective . [ 8 ]
A natural fungicide , even small amounts of tea tree oil can kill stop spores on contact .
Tea tree oil has many uses and is environmentally friendly , which makes it a great choice .
How to Use : A little goes a long way .
Mix one teaspoon of tea tree oil with one cup of water in a spray bottle .
Be sure to wear gloves , as undiluted tea tree oil may irritate your skin .
Mist the affected area with your solution and wipe away .
Vinegar
Vinegar ( acetic acid ) has an antimicrobial effect on fungi and can eliminate many mold species . [ 8 ]
Regular white vinegar — the kind you can cook with — contains 5 percent acetic acid .
To get rid of mold , buy cleaning vinegar with at least 6 percent acetic acid .
You can get it at most home improvement stores .
This extra 1 percent of acidity makes the solution much more effective .
Vinegar can also stop viruses and bacteria in their tracks , so cleaning your home with it can help you and your family stay healthy ! [ 9 ]
How to Use : Pour white distilled , undiluted vinegar into a spray bottle .
Spray the vinegar directly onto the moldy surface and let it sit for an hour .
Use a scrub brush to loosen any mold and wipe the area clean with warm water .
Any smell from the vinegar should clear within a couple of hours .
Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is a powerhouse cleanser .
With its antiviral , antibacterial , and antifungal properties , it is lethal to most types of mold — but safe for people .
[ 10 , 11 ]
As a non -toxic cleanser , you can use hydrogen peroxide around pets , children , and anyone experiencing respiratory discomfort because it 's not a lung irritant .
You can use it on any surface , including walls , sinks , countertops , and other hard surfaces .
How to Use : Saturate any moldy surface with generous amounts of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and let it sit for 10 minutes , or wait for the peroxide to stop bubbling .
Scrub the area to remove all mold remnants and stains , and wipe the surface to remove any residual mold and spores .
You may want to repeat this step after your initial clean - up to ensure complete mold removal .
Baking Soda
Baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) is a white mineral powder that you can safely use to remove mold on most surfaces .
In addition to eliminating mold , it will help absorb moisture to prevent further mold growth . [ 12 ]
Never mix baking soda with vinegar , or you might get a dangerous chemical reaction .
How to use :
Add one - quarter tablespoon baking soda to a standard spray bottle .
Mix with water and shake until the powder has dissolved .

How to Prevent Mold
Mold can grow on anything that holds moisture .
It can sometimes be difficult — but not impossible — to avoid .
Keeping your home dry and controlling humidity is the key to a mold - free home .
Here are some tips .
Dehumidifiers
Experts recommend keeping the humidity in your home between 30 to 50 percent to prevent mold growth . [ 13 ]
A dehumidifier can reduce the amount of moisture in the air , which makes your home less mold - friendly , particularly if you live in a high - humidity climate .
Keep in mind that dehumidifiers can help prevent mold growth and spread , but they ca n’t remove spores that are already there .
Keep Your House Ventilated
Keep your home well - ventilated , ensuring that air moves freely throughout the home ; this deters mold .
Use ventilation fans in bathrooms when showering , and exhaust fans in the kitchen when cooking .
Clothes dryers should be properly ventilated to the outside , too . [ 13 ]
Other things you can do to prevent mold growth include :
Seal bathtubs and sinks with caulking to prevent water from leaking and pooling .
Re -grout tiles to help deprive any remaining mold of oxygen and prevent growth .
Remove excess water left on shower doors and walls with a bathroom squeegee , available at home improvement stores .
Check window sills , walls , the roof , and the foundation regularly for condensation , moisture , or leaks .
If you find any leaks or experience a flood , dry the area within 48 hours to prevent mold growth .
Use fans to speed drying .
Ensure good air circulation throughout the home .
Open windows when possible .
Points to Remember
If you want to know how to get rid of mold , there are simple , natural remedies that can work .
Tea tree oil , hydrogen peroxide , baking soda , and vinegar are four easy - to - use , healthy choices for mold remediation .
Mold thrives in moist and damp environments , and exposure to this fungal species can cause health issues — particularly with your respiratory system .
Cladosporium , Penicillium , Chaetomium , and Aspergillus , as well as black mold ( Stachybotrys chartarum ) are common indoor molds .
The most important measures for mold prevention are controlling moisture and keeping your home dry .
Generally speaking , mold exposure symptoms clear up once it is removed — then you will likely feel better and have a healthy home once again .
If your living space has significant water damage and the drywall has been wet for more than 48 hours , it may be too mold - damaged to simply clean the surface .
Porous materials like drywall can harbor mold below the surface .
In these cases , you should seek a professional mold remediation company .
If you continue to experience long - term health effects from mold exposure , talk with your healthcare provider .

The United States government has a monopoly on marijuana research .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) is the only government institution legally allowed to provide researchers with marijuana .
Unsurprisingly , the government uses its monopoly status to only fund and / or provide marijuana for studies seeking to depict marijuana 's negative attributes .
According to Reason Magazine :
Even when researchers have received Food and Drug Administration approval for their studies , NIDA frequently refuses to sell them the pot they need to carry out their research , essentially exercising a veto on the FDA ’s decisions .
With NIDA bogarting America ’s only federally sanctioned weed , the number of privately funded medical cannabis studies currently taking place in America right now is exactly zero .
Of the 14 studies investigating marijuana in any way , 13 are NIDA projects looking into drug abuse .
censors viable research linking marijuana use to reduced risk of cancer
What we found instead was no association ( between marijuana smoking and cancer ) and even a suggestion of some protective effect .
At this point , I 'd be in favor of ( marijuana ) legalization .
I would n't encourage anybody to smoke any substances .
But I do n't think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance .
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm .
And in terms of an intoxicant , alcohol causes far more harm ( than marijuana ) .
This is too bad , as not only does it put the United States at odds with Latin America , but also A recent study by researchers at Brown University , Boston University , Louisiana State University , and the University of Minnesota has found that even with cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol , " ... " Lead researcher Dr. Donald Taskin admitted that the government funded his team 's research to find negative health effects of marijuana use .
Instead , Dr. Taskin stated :
Epistemology is the investigation of the nature of knowledge itself .
Its study focuses on our means for acquiring knowledge and how we can differentiate between truth and falsehood .
Modern epistemology generally involves a debate between rationalism and empiricism .
Rationalists believe that knowledge is acquired through the use of reason , while empiricists assert that knowledge is gained through experiences .
Why Epistemology Is Important
The study of epistemology is fundamental to understanding how and why we think , in other words , how we acquire knowledge , how we rely upon our senses , and how we develop concepts in our minds .
A sound epistemology is necessary for the development of sound thinking and reasoning , which is why so much philosophical literature can involve seemingly arcane discussions about the nature of knowledge .
Some questions frequently discussed by epistemologists include :
What can we know ?
How can we know it ?
Why do we know some things , but not others ?
How do we acquire knowledge ?
Is knowledge possible ?
Can knowledge be certain ?
Why do we believe certain claims and not others ?
Two Camps
There are many different theories of epistemology , but they all fall into mostly one of two camps : empirical or rational .
According to empiricists , we can only know things after we have had the relevant experience , in other words , our knowledge is a posteriori .
Rationalists , however , believe it is possible to know things before we have had experiences , in other words , our knowledge is a priori .
To epistemologists , there are no third options , except , perhaps , for the extreme skeptical position that no knowledge is possible at all .
But otherwise , one is either a rationalist or an empiricist .
Rationalism is not a uniform position .
Some rationalists will simply argue that some truths about reality can be discovered through pure reason and thought ( examples include truths of mathematics , geometry , and sometimes morality ) , while other truths do require experience .
Other rationalists will go further and argue that all truths about reality must in some way be acquired through reason , normally because our sense organs are unable to directly experience outside reality at all .
Empiricism , on the other hand , is more uniform in the sense that it denies that any form of rationalism is true or possible .
Empiricists may disagree on just how we acquire knowledge through experience and in what sense our experiences give us access to outside reality ; nevertheless , they all agree that knowledge about reality requires experience and interaction with reality .
Epistemology and Atheism
Many debates between atheist and theists are epistemological in nature .
When atheists and theists argue about whether it 's reasonable to believe in miracles , to accept revelation and scriptures as authoritative , and so forth , they are ultimately arguing about basic epistemological principles :
How do we know what is and is n't true , and is belief founded in knowledge ?
Atheists tend to be either exclusively or primarily empiricists : they insist that truth - claims be accompanied by clear and convincing evidence , which can be studied and tested .
Theists tend to be much more willing to accept rationalism , believing that " truth " can be attained through revelations , mysticism , faith , etc .
This difference in positions is consistent with how atheists tend to place primacy on the existence of matter and argue that the universe is material in nature , whereas theists tend to place primacy on the existence of the mind ( specifically , the mind of God ) and argue that existence is more spiritual and supernatural in nature .

Once in a while , we hear stories about people who find extraordinary strength in a time of crisis .
Aaron Cole , a college student from Grass Lake , is fortunate those stories can be true .
Otherwise he 'd probably be dead .
Cole , 24 , and his girlfriend , Shelly Johnson , 22 , also a college student from Grass Lake , were headed to Maine on a vacation when disaster struck Aug. 18 .
" We were in New Hampshire when we saw a beautiful waterfall and decided to climb to the top , " said Cole , a graduate student studying speech pathology at Eastern Michigan University .
On the hike , Cole started fooling around by walking in the water .
It was not incredibly steep , but the water had lots of slippery algae and rocks .
To Johnson , it looked dangerous .
She pleaded with her boyfriend to get back on dry ground .
" He 's one of those daredevil kids , so it ( the warning ) did not do any good , " Johnson said .
Suddenly Cole slipped .
For a split second , it seemed OK .
" Then I lost control and could not stop , " he said .
He careened about 120 feet , bashing his head on rocks .
He stopped , bloody and unconscious , face - down in a pool of water .
That was actually a lucky break because he just missed sliding off a tall drop - off .
His second lucky break was the fact his girlfriend of four years is a senior nursing student at the University of Michigan .
Cole was not breathing when she reached him , so she gave him a few " rescue breaths . "
It worked .
Cole coughed and spit water .
Johnson took off her swimming suit to bandage gashes on his head , then carried him down a hill that took them 45 minutes to climb .
Most of the way , she said , she cradled him , talked to him and tried to keep him conscious .
" With head injuries , I knew it was important to keep him from going into a coma , " she said .
Johnson is athletic  a state champion hurdler at Grass Lake  but it defies explanation that she , at 115 pounds , carried a 160 - pound man so far .
" She tried picking me up again the other day and could hold me for only a few seconds , " Cole said .
" If all the money in the world was placed on it now , " she said , " I do n't think I could do it again .
It was adrenaline and God . "
Cole 's third piece of luck came at the bottom of the hill .
The first people to find them were an intensive - care nurse and an emergency - room nurse .
The closest hospital was not equipped to handle serious head wounds , so Cole was airlifted to Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon , N.H .
He was treated in intensive care for two days , but had no permanent brain damage .
" Shelly is a true hero and deserves all the credit in the world for saving my life , " Cole said .
Johnson is not comfortable being called a hero , but she knows one thing .
" He owes me ice cream for life , " she said .
United States would be mistaken to take for granted the dollar 's place as the world 's predominant reserve currency , says Zoellick
The United States must brace itself for the dollar to be usurped as the world 's reserve currency as American dominance wanes in the wake of the financial crisis , the World Bank president , Robert Zoellick , warned yesterday .
Speaking ahead of the World Bank / IMF annual meetings in Istanbul , he said it was time for a " responsible globalisation " , in which decision - making was shared between the old powers and developing countries such as China and India .
Ever since the post - second world war Bretton Woods agreement , which cemented the dollar 's ascendancy over sterling , Americans have been able to rely on borrowing cheaply from the rest of the world as governments banked on the dollar as a safe bet .
But Zoellick said the greenback 's status could be under threat from the growing strength of the Chinese yuan and the euro .
" The United States would be mistaken to take for granted the dollar 's place as the world 's predominant reserve currency .
Looking forward , there will increasingly be other options to the dollar , " Zoellick told an audience at Johns Hopkins University in Washington .
From now on , he said , confidence in the US currency – and its economy – would have to be earned .
" The future for the United States will depend on whether and how it will address large deficits , recover without inflation that could undermine its credit and currency , and overhaul its financial system . "
Zoellick 's comments came as Beijing launched the first yuan - denominated bond available to outside investors , as it gradually makes its currency more exchangeable on international markets .
" I expect China will inevitably be drawn outward , " he said .
" Over 10 to 20 years , the renminbi [ yuan ] will evolve into a force in financial markets . "
Several countries , including China and Russia , have repeatedly raised what they see as the problem of excessive dollar hegemony .
G20 as a steering group
Zoellick predicted that the tumultuous events of the credit crunch would eventually lead to a radically different world economic order .
He welcomed the expanded role of the G20 group of nations , agreed by leaders at their summit in Pittsburgh last week ; but warned against excluding bodies such as the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund , which have a much broader membership .
" The G20 should operate as a ' steering group ' across a network of countries and international institutions , " he said .
Claire Melamed , ActionAid 's head of policy , said the decision at Pittsburgh to shift economic decision - making away from the G8 , which includes Italy and Canada but not China and India , could reverberate for decades .
" The shift from the G8 to the G20 … has the potential to be hugely significant , breaking not just the power of the US but that particular group of countries that have had everything their own way for so long , " she said .
Developing country governments have blamed the US , with its deregulated financial markets and decade - long borrowing binge , for dragging the world to the brink of the abyss over the past 12 months .
Zoellick said all countries would have to learn to rely less on rampant American consumption to drive growth in the world economy .
" A more balanced and inclusive growth model for the world would benefit from multiple poles of growth , " Zoellick said .
" With investments in infrastructure , people , and private businesses , countries in Latin America , Asia and the broader Middle East could contribute to a ' New Normal ' for the world economy . "
Leaders in Pittsburgh also agreed to transfer some of the voting rights of over - represented rich countries at the IMF to under - represented developing economies , but detailed negotiations about how the balance of power will change – and which countries will agree to give up some of their votes – will go on until 2011 .
At this week 's meetings in Istanbul , which will be attended by the chancellor , Alistair Darling , and Mervyn King , Bank of England governor , the World Bank is likely to ask donor governments for more funding to mitigate the impact of the credit crunch on the world 's poorest countries .
The IMF , meanwhile , is expected to give more details of how it will spot future crises and urge governments to take preventative policy measures – tasks set for it by the G20 last week .

Slimewatch UK : 8inch - thick carpet of algae is clogging South Coast
Advertisement
A vast slick of seaweed is choking the South Coast - threatening wildlife and playing havoc with boats , according to the Environment Agency .
The hot June and washout July created perfect conditions for the floating algae which has grown up to 8in thick in some harbours and estuaries .
Algal blooms are also hitting beaches along the French coast , where rotting seaweed above the high tide mark has released a potentially deadly toxic gas .
Clogged :
The algal bloom on the shore of Langstone harbour in Hampshire
While the huge mats of weed on the coastline of Sussex , Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are unlikely to harm people , they pose a serious threat to plants and animals .
One of the worst affected areas is Langstone harbour , between Chichester and Portsmouth .
Locals describe it as one of the worst blooms since the algae began building up back in the 1960s .
This summer , the thick slime covers an estimated 926 acres of British harbour .
Other areas badly hit include harbours at Portsmouth , Chichester , and Poole , the Hamble estuary near Southampton and the Medina estuary on the Isle of Wight .
The weed thrives on nutrients released from sewage works and the nitrate - rich fertilisers washed off farmland during heavy rain .
Hundreds of acres of mudflats along estuaries and harbours have now been taken over including Langstone Harbour , Portsmouth ( above )
The unnatural level of algae growth is caused by nutrients released by farmland fertilisers and sewerage which cause the seaweed to thrive
The Environment Agency said it is unlikely to be dangerous to humans .
Twice - daily tides mean the algae does not have time to dry out and bake - and so does not release toxic gas .
However , when it decays in winter it releases hydrogen sulphide into the water , killing marine life .
As it grows during the summer , the algae uses up vital oxygen in the water , killing shrimp , eel grasses and worms and depleting food for other wildlife such as fish and birds .
Walkers are being advised to avoid badly - affected areas as a precaution if they smell an odour of rotting eggs , since this would indicate poisonous gas is being released from the weed .
Picturesque :
The harbour just two months ago before it was taken over by the algae
The Agency 's marine expert Dave Lowthion said : ' We have n't been measuring the seaweed from year to year so we can't say how much the amount has gone up , but we had a fairly hot and sunny April and May which is when the stuff starts growing , and we 've not had the storms needed to wash the weed away .
' The river flows are high after the wet July so nutrients are likely to have been entering the harbour . '
Two species of floating seaweed are clogging up the South Coast - the spaghetti- like enteromorpha and sea lettuce , which has rufflelike fronds .
The Agency is taking samples of the weed and is using aerial mapping to see how it is spreading .
It said water quality is improving in the Solent - thanks to millions of pounds spent improving sewage treatment - and it expects weed levels to decline in the future .
The initiative , the first such statewide effort , has attracted widespread attention , since California , together with Texas , dominates the nation ’s textbook market .
Many superintendents are enthusiastic .
“ In five years , I think the majority of students will be using digital textbooks , ” said William M. Habermehl , superintendent of the 500,000 - student Orange County schools .
“ They can be better than traditional textbooks . ”
Schools that do not make the switch , Mr. Habermehl said , could lose their constituency .
“ We ’re still in a brick - and - mortar , 30 - students - to - 1 - teacher paradigm , ” Mr. Habermehl said , “ but we need to get out of that framework to having 200 or 300 kids taking courses online , at night , 24/7 , whenever they want . ”
“ I do n’t believe that charters and vouchers are the threat to schools in Orange County , ” he said .
“ What ’s a threat is the digital world  that someone ’s going to put together brilliant $ 200 courses in French , in geometry by the best teachers in the world . ”
But the digital future is not quite on the horizon in most classrooms .
For one thing , there is still a large digital divide .
Not every student has access to a computer , a Kindle electronic reader device or a smartphone , and few districts are wealthy enough to provide them .
So digital textbooks could widen the gap between rich and poor .
“ A large portion of our kids do n’t have computers at home , and it would be way too costly to print out the digital textbooks , ” said Tim Ward , assistant superintendent for instruction in California ’s 24,000 - student Chaffey Joint Union High School District , where almost half the students are from low - income families .
Many educators expect that digital textbooks and online courses will start small , perhaps for those who want to study a subject they cannot fit into their school schedule or for those who need a few more credits to graduate .

The bee may have inhabited the earth for more than 80 million years - long before Man-and has survived all the upheavals of our planet , but its present situation has become a focal point for all countries involved in intensive agriculture .
Although there are many reasons which could to explain the phenomenon , the most likely protagonist is to be found in the use of phyto - pharmaceutic products and particularly powerful pesticides especially the systemic neuro - toxics used to coat the seeds , such as the well - known Gaucho or Regent .
These hyper - powerful molecules coat the grains of seed and there are dozens of grams in one hectare .
They protect the root system and remain in the plant system up to the time of flowering so that destructive pests are eliminated .
The research carried out by the National Institute for Agricultural Research ( INRA ) [ 1 ] and also the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) has found that the presence of these molecules in pollen , even in minute doses , is enough to have a adverse effect on untargeted insects such as the bee , and that their durability in the sun can last for many years .
Poisoning takes place at the time of planting because part of the coating is dispersed into the air and spreads out , killing the pollen gatherers , also when the plants come into flower and the bees collect the nectar and pollen .
Beekeepers fought an unprecedented battle in the media and through the courts in order to persuade the market to suspend the authorisation of Gaucho on sunflowers in 1999 , on maize in 2004 and of Regent in 2004 . .
In spite of four victories won in the Council of State by the beekeeping unions ( notably the UNA ) the phyto - sanitary firms , who were concerned about the financial consequences , used considerable means of persuasion such as lobbying and refused to accept their responsibility .
Instead , they continued to promote these molecules which are poisonous for the bees and the environment .
In the meantime , faced with the high mortality rate in apiaries the length of the Rhine valley , the German government suspended authorisation for putting any of these products on the market , with the exception of colza in 2008 .
The Bayer Corporation has compensated the beekeepers , refusing to recognise the harmful properties of the molecule and blaming the quality of the drilling machines .
Italy , faced with many thousands of dead colonies on the wide plain of the River Po , withdrew authorization for these products in 2008 .
France , a leader in matters of authorisation , approved the use of Cruiser in maize in 2008 despite opposition from beekeepers and environmental organisations who had taken part in the Environmental Round Table [ 2 ] .
The bee produces honey but also has a highly important role to play as a pollinator in the processes of biodiversity and agricultural production .
According to the last research carried out by INRA and CNRS , 35 % of the available resources on the planet rely upon insect pollinators , especially the bee .
This applies to 65 % of our food diversity .
Without the bee there would be less fruit , fewer vegetables , fewer seeds and less oil - producing plants .
In the global plan , the volume of trade created by the bee is estimated to be 152 billion euros .
Farmers and Beekeepers are complementary .
If a constructive dialogue were to be established between farmers and nurserymen , market gardeners or greenhouse operators , it is still a sensitive issue for those of growers of maize strongly in favour of the expanding production .

There is no good evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
It has offered to allow regular International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of the newly announced facility near Qom , which would effectively prevent it from being used for weapons production .
There is a secret nuclear facility in the Middle East , however , producing plutonium and not just enriched uranium , which has the capacity to make 10 nuclear warheads a year .
Here is a 3 - D reconstruction of the most dangerous weapons plant in the Middle East , at Dimona in Israel .

Iran ’s reported test - firing Monday of medium - range missiles that could reach Israel , Europe and American bases in the Persian Gulf was a reminder of the potent military threat Tehran poses to nations seeking to derail its nuclear program .
The launches demonstrated that Tehran was capable of striking its enemies , especially Israel , which has suggested it might attack Iran ’s nuclear installations , and the United States , which is urging tougher United Nations sanctions against the Islamic Republic while preparing to create a shield to protect its allies from Iranian missiles .
The missiles fired Monday , the Shahab - 3 and Sejil - 2 , were launched in the desert as part of military exercises that began before the U.S. , France and Britain last week accused Tehran of building a secret uranium - enrichment plant .
The U.S. and other nations suspect Tehran ’s nuclear program is designed to create weapons rather than energy for civilian purposes and have threatened new sanctions on Iran if international inspectors are denied access to the facility .
In Washington , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the missile tests again showed “ the provocative nature with which Iran has acted on the international stage for a number of years ” and repeated President Obama ’s recent demand that Tehran allow inspectors into the new site .

“ There has never been a stronger international consensus to address Iran and its nuclear program than there is right now , ” Gibbs added .
Russian news service Ria Novosti quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying : “ This is not illegal under any international agreements , but of course when missile launches are accompanied by an unresolved situation around Iran ’s nuclear program , this concerns us . ”
Lavrov spoke after meeting with his Iranian counterpart , Manouchehr Mottaki , in New York .
The Shahab - 3 and the Sejil - 2 have ranges of 800 to 1,200 miles .
The Sejil - 2 is powered by solid fuel , making it more accurate than previous generations of missiles in the Islamic Republic ’s arsenal .
It was not the first time these missiles were tested , but their launches as part of an exercise named the Great Prophet IV coincided with growing tension before Iran ’s meeting in Geneva on Thursday with representatives of the U.S. and other world powers .

Iran ’s Press TV reported that the missiles “ accurately hit their designated targets . . . during the first and second stages of military drill in central Iran Sunday night . ”
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said the missile tests were not a response to international pressure on Iran ’s nuclear program .
They were , he said , part of Sacred Defense Week ’s annual military exercises to commemorate Iran ’s war with Iraq in the 1980s .
“ Many countries have these [ displays ] , and it has nothing to do with Iran ’s peaceful nuclear technology , ” he said at a news conference .
Gen. Hossein Salami , commander of the Revolutionary Guard Air Force , was more pointed .

The general was quoted by the Iranian media as saying the tests in recent days of medium - and short - range missiles send “ a message for certain greedy nations that seek to create fear , to show that we are able to give a swift and suitable answer to our enemies . ”
The general added , “ We are going to respond to any military action in a crushing manner , and it does n’t make any difference which country or regime has launched the aggression . ”

Nigerian authorities ignored dozens of warnings about a violent Islamist sect until it attacked police stations and government buildings last week in a bloodbath that killed more than 700 people , Muslim clerics and an army official said .
More than 50 Muslim leaders repeatedly called Nigeria 's police , local authorities and state security to urge them to take action against Boko Haram sect militants but their pleas were ignored , Imam Ibrahim Ahmed Abdullahi said .
He spoke last Saturday to the Associated Press along with several other Muslim scholars in the battle - ravaged city of Maiduguri .
" A lot of imams tried to draw the attention of the government , " Abdullahi said , drawing nods from other scholars sitting with him in a Maiduguri slum .
" We used to call the government and security agents to say that these people must be stopped from what they are doing because it must bring a lot of trouble . "
Government officials did not respond to repeated requests for a comment .
On 26 July , militants from the sect attacked a police station in Bauchi state , triggering a wave of militant violence that spread to three other northern states .
Nigerian authorities retaliated five days later by storming the group 's sprawling Maiduguri headquarters , killing at least 100 people in the attack , half of them inside the sect 's mosque .
About 700 people were killed in days of violence last week in Maiduguri alone , according to Colonel Ben Ahanotu , the military official in charge of a local anti-crime operation .
A relief official said thousands fled the city .
The death toll in other northern areas is not known and authorities have not said how many suspected militants have been arrested .
Rights groups have claimed that innocent civilians were killed during the government hunt for sect members .
The imams were not the only ones to raise the alarm .
Ahanotu said he recommended several times that action be taken against the group but received no orders to do so .
" I complained a lot of times , " he said .
" I was just waiting for orders . "
The allegations of authorities dismissing the warnings raise serious questions about the west African nation 's capacity to monitor and defend itself against terrorist groups .
International concern is growing over the ability of al - Qaida affiliates to cross the desert borders of north African countries such as Niger , which shares a border with Nigeria .
Abdullahi said he had known Boko Haram 's charismatic leader Mohamed Yusuf for 14 years before the 39 - year - old was killed last Thursday while in police custody .
Several human rights groups have urged an investigation into the killing , the details of which remain murky .
Yusuf 's sect , Boko Haram – which means " western education is sacrilege " – seeks the imposition of strict Islamic sharia law in Nigeria , a multireligious country that is a major oil producer and Africa 's most populous nation .
Claudia Pechstein vermutet , dass Jens Weinreich gedopt war , als er über sie schrieb , dass vieles dafür spricht , dass sie gedopt hat , aber das hier wird kein Text über Leute , die Dinge sportlich nehmen .
Im Gegenteil .
Jens Weinreich ( die Älteren werden sich noch an seine Auseinandersetzung mit DFB - Präsident Theo Zwanziger erinnern ) ist einer von den Kollegen , nach denen auf irgendwelchen Podien über Qualität im Journalismus dauernd gerufen wird .
Er ist einer der wenigen investigativen Sportjournalisten , kritisch und unabhängig , er recherchiert statt abzuschreiben , er verbeißt sich in Themen , auch wenn sie gerade keine Konjunktur haben .
In seinem Blog zapft er das Wissen seiner Leser an und veröffentlicht Original - Dokumente , damit sich jeder selbst ein Bild machen kann .
Und wenn er etwas nicht weiß , schreibt er das ebenso auf , wie wenn er etwas falsch gemacht hat .
Er ist , mit anderen Worten , eine unfassbare journalistische Nervensäge , und es gibt sicher eine erhebliche Zahl von Leuten , die nur darauf warten , dass sie ihm an den Karren fahren können .
Am vergangenen Donnerstag berichtete er über die Blutdoping - Fernsehshow der Eisschnellläuferin Claudia Pechstein und machte einen Fehler .
Er schrieb zum Beispiel in der Online - Ausgabe der „ Frankfurter Rundschau “ :
Inhaltliche Schwer - und Reizpunkte setzten die beiden von der Verteidigung beauftragten und bezahlten Gutachter : Holger Kiesewetter aus Berlin und Rolf Kruse vom Referenz - Institut für Bio-Analytik in Bonn .
Weinreich selbst hatte in der Pressekonferenz nach der Bezahlung gefragt , aber die Antwort teilweise falsch verstanden .
Kiesewetter bekam Geld für sein Gutachten , Kruse nicht .
Nun hätte es vermutlich ausgereicht , Weinreich eine kurze Mail mit der Bitte um Korrektur zu schreiben , und alles spricht dafür , dass er dieser Bitte auch dann sofort nachgekommen wäre .
Aber Weinreich erhielt keine Bitte um Korrektur , sondern noch am selben Abend per Fax eine Abmahnung von Simon Bergmann , dem Anwalt von Claudia Pechstein .
Er wurde aufgefordert , eine Unterlassungserklärung abzugeben .
So eine richtige Abmahnung hat gegenüber einer bloßen Aufforderung zur Richtigstellung einen schönen Nebeneffekt :
Sie kostet den Abgemahnten Geld , sogar dann , wenn er der Forderung sofort nachkommt .
Im konkreten Fall sind es Abmahngebühren in Höhe von 775,64 Euro inklusive Mehrwertsteuer für die Arbeitszeit des Anwalts .
Das kann man natürlich machen .
Womöglich ist es im besten Interesse von Claudia Pechstein , wenn ihr Anwalt gleich mit großer Wucht gegen falsche Darstellungen ihrer Verteidigungsstrategie vorgeht , vielleicht war das auch ein Anliegen von Frau Pechstein selbst , die „ Weinrich “ für den „ naivsten Sportjournalisten “ hält , von dem sie „ bislang je etwas lesen durfte “ .
Und natürlich muss ein Journalist für seine Fehler geradestehen — auch wenn er in diesem Fall einen unverhältnismäßig hohen Preis für ein offenkundiges Missverständnis zahlt .
So weit , so alltäglich .
Am nächsten Tag bekam Jens Weinreich eine weitere Abmahnung .
Er sollte sich noch einmal verpflichten , den bereits einmal abgemahnten Satz nicht mehr zu wiederholen .
Diesmal trat Simon Bergmann allerdings nicht als Anwalt , sondern als Klient auf .
Absender des Schreibens war sein Sozius Christian Schertz .
Das ist ein lustiger Trick .
Man behauptet , dass die falsche Aussage über Rolf Kruse und die „ Verteidigung “ von Pechstein nicht nur die Rechte von Pechstein verletze , sondern auch die ihres Anwalts .
Und verdoppelt so die Zahl der Abmahnungen .
Und die Höhe der geforderten Abmahngebühren : auf schlappe 1551,28 Euro .
Hier ist Simon Bergmann nicht mehr für Claudia Pechstein im Einsatz .
Hier handeln er und Christian Schertz quasi auf eigene Rechnung .
Und womöglich hatten sie davon noch eine offen .
Denn Weinreich und Schertz kennen sich persönlich — von der Auseinandersetzung zwischen dem Journalisten und Theo Zwanziger .
Schertz vertrat dabei den DFB und seinen Präsidenten und musste eine Reihe peinlicher juristischer Niederlagen hinnehmen .
Die Frage , ob Schertz im Recht ist und Bergmann einen Anspruch gegenüber Jens Weinreich jenseits der ( längst erfolgten ) Korrektur des Fehlers hat , überlasse ich gerne Juristen .
Aber was die Motivation des Vorgehens angeht , spekuliere ich gerne : Es könnte ein persönlicher Akt der Revanche sein .
Oder der Versuch , einen kritischen , lästigen Journalisten einzuschüchtern .
Es geht nicht um Gerechtigkeit ( und um die Wahrheit schon gar nicht ) ; es geht um Schadensmaximierung .
Wer es wagt , kritisch über Pechstein und ihre Fernsehshow zu berichten , wer sich traut , kritisch über Simon Bergmann und seine PR - und Verteidigungsstrategie zu berichten , wer hartnäckig nervt , soll gewarnt sein : Schon ein blöder Fehler kann richtig teuer werden .
Christian Schertz hat uns bei BILDblog und mich bei den juristischen Auseinandersetzungen um dieses Blog sehr unterstützt .
Aber ich habe mich ( auch weil es schon früher Anlass für Zweifel gab ) entschieden , mich in Zukunft nicht mehr von der Kanzlei Schertz - Bergmann vertreten zu lassen .
John Key says his government has n’t ruled out using legislation to bypass Commerce Commission recommendations that could see a sizable fall in wholesale broadband prices .
That kind of move would protect Chorus which says it could lose up to $ 160 million a year from the regulatory change .
It would also become a form of price discrimination favouring the UFB fibre network being built by Chorus and three other fibre companies .
In effect government intervention would make copper less attractive by making it more expensive than fibre .
While it is understandable the government would want to shore up its own fibre project , there are three reasons why this is a bad move :
1 . It punishes poorer New Zealanders
It will take another seven years to build the fibre network .
Business districts , schools and medical centres are a priority .
Next on the list are the wealthier suburbs where the government thinks people are more likely to sign - up early for fibre .
The poorer suburbs are at the back of the queue .
This means poorer New Zealanders will have no choice but to use copper for years to come .
Making them pay more for it is doubly cruel .
This is politically dangerous for a National government .
While it is n’t quite take - from - the - poor , give - to - the - rich , National ’s opponents could easily make it look that way .
2 . Not everyone gets fibre any way
If everything goes to plan – let ’s assume for now it will – UFB will reach 75 percent of New Zealanders by 2019 .
There ’s the rural RBI network for those in the back - blocks .
People in small towns will be left with the fibre - to - the - node network where the last leg of distribution will be over copper .
Making them pay more for their copper will add insult to injury .
Higher copper prices also mean ISPs will be less able to invest in technologies like VDSL to serve these customers .
3 . Making copper dearer wo n’t change fibre demand anyway
Copper is the gateway drug leading to fibre .
People who buy faster copper services , such as VDSL , are likely to be the first to buy fibre when it becomes available .
Getting people hooked on fast broadband will do more to make sure fibre succeeds than discriminating against copper .
I ’ve said all along , if the government has to discriminate against copper to sell fibre , that means there ’s something wrong with the fibre project that needs fixing .
Fix the problem , do n’t cripple the competition .
What I would do
I ’m not in favour of discriminating against copper full stop .
If I was a politician and my advisers convinced me it was necessary to discriminate against copper in order for my fibre project to succeed , then I ’d choose to discriminate against copper only where the fibre alternative is already in place .
in that way , the price discrimination would n’t punish those who do n’t have fibre access .
My guess is the government wo n’t do this , because that kind of price discrimination would only serve to highlight the problem .

Over 45 years after they first appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show , 2009 looks like it could be the most lucrative year the Beatles have ever had .
Despite the fact that the Fab Four recorded together as a group for a mere eight years — from 1962 ’s “ Please , Please Me ” until their breakup nearly 40 years ago in 1970 — John , Paul , George and Ringo remain a money machine that shows all contenders how it ’s done .
In fact , they have sketched a legacy blueprint that has been adopted by the estates of Elvis Presley and likely Michael Jackson , whose ownership of the publishing of numerous Beatles songs will reap millions this year .
( Pictured , fans at the recent 40th anniversary of the " Abbey Road " cover shoot ; Getty Images . )
Year after year , Christmas after Christmas , new ways are found to mint money : rarely heard demos or unreleased tracks like “ Free as a Bird , ” “ True Love ” and the still unreleased 14 - minute improvisational “ Carnival of Light ” ; greatest hits packages and anthologies ; reproduced albums like 2003 ’s “ Let It Be … Naked , ” where Paul McCartney stripped off the Phil Specter production he always hated so much ; even stage shows like Las Vegas ’ “ LOVE . ”
( See accompanying article , " Re-Repackaging the Beatles . " )
There ’s also a library ’s worth of coffee - table books , not to mention the officially licensed coffee mugs , fountain pens — which go for $ 528.95 on the band ’s site — Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit games , Zippo lighters , limited - edition baseball sets and , among much more , throw blankets .
Which brings us to next month .
For starters , on Sept. 9 , remastered versions of all 12 of the Beatles ’ British albums plus " Magical Mystery Tour " ( not an album in the U.K. ) will be re-released on CD .
It marks the first significant upgrade of the Fab Four ’s canon since the records first arrived on CD 22 years ago — and the first time the first four British albums will be available in stereo .
Each disc will feature not only startling clarity revealing every harmony , guitar lick and the studio wizardry of the later years , but also a DVD that includes a documentary on the specific album as well booklets full of unseen photographs and a host of other collectables .
will cost about $ 19 individually or as a luxury box set , retailing for around $ 260 , as well as a 10 - disc “ Beatles in Mono ” set .
The “ special editions ” discs , with the music and the embedded documentaries , will cost about $ 19 individually or as a luxury box set , retailing for around $ 260 , as well as a 10 - disc “ Beatles in Mono ” set .
Then , if Beatles fans repurchasing their entire collections is n’t enough to provide a boon for the ailing music biz , on the same day , “ The Beatles : Rock Band ” videogame will hit shelves .
The long - awaited Beatles version of " Rock Band " also arrives on Sept. 9 . Not only will there be the $ 59.99 version for Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii systems , but a deluxe $ 249.99 customized - instruments - included edition , as well .
Distinguishing itself from rival “ Guitar Hero ” — which has had great band - specific success with “ Guitar Hero : Aerosmith ” and is about to bring out “ Guitar Hero : Van Halen ” — game developer Harmonix , which is owned by MTV , has transformed “ Rock Band ” into a cooperative “ platform ” with digital downloads that go for around $ 2 and add - ons as well as game play .
The game will allow up to six players sing and perform in a virtual Beatles band , with 45 song choices
Having sold over 600 million albums worldwide , the Beatles ’ marriage to “ Rock Band ” — which has had worldwide sales of approximately $ 1 billion since the franchise debuted in 2007 — looks to be a match made in Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Heaven , even in this sagging economy and tough times for the $ 30 billion videogame industry .
Accordingly , the hype machine is in full force .
Coming soon to a TV near you , there ’ll be a “ Beatles : Rock Band ” commercial that depicts the band , in archive footage grafted to computer generated images , enacting their famous photograph walking across Abbey Road with frenzied fans pursuing them .
If you ’ve seen Paul McCartney on tour this summer , including topping the bill on the first night of this year ’s Coachella Festival , you ’ve been watching an unannounced ad for “ Beatles : Rock Band . ”
McCartney , likely not unaware of the potential online viral spread , has seamlessly incorporated images from the game on to the giant video screens that play behind him when he plays Beatles songs like “ Got to Get You Into My Life ” live .
On Twitter , Facebook and YouTube , fans have been teased with other images and pre-order exclusives of the game including a segment with the “ White Album ” - era Fab Four , tinged in blue and yellow , performing " Birthday . ”
McCartney also re-created the famous Beatles ’ rooftop performance earlier this month by performing live atop the marquee for David Letterman ’s “ The Late Show . ”
On Aug. 9 , QVC opened its Beatles Shop , selling pre-orders for both the game and the remasters on TV – as has VH1 .
Pre-orders for both the standard and the deluxe version of “ Beatles : Rock Band ” have been “ very very healthy , ” according to sales staff at Game Stop on Vine in Hollywood .
“ The Beatles today are like the U.S. Marines or the New York Yankees , ” says brand strategist Claude Singer .
“ They ’re the Cadillac brand of 20th - century rock . ”
But this is only the tsunami ’s first wave .
You still ca n’t purchase the Beatles catalogue digitally , largely due to decades of trademark and lawsuits between the Beatles ’ Apple Corp and the similarly named Apple Computers .
In fact , the first Beatles download ever will be “ All You Need Is Love , ” through “ Beatles : Rock Band ” for Xbox LIVE console owners to purchase for around $ 2 , with all proceeds going to Doctor ’s Against Borders .
The entire “ Abbey Road ” album , which is already embedded in the game ’s system files , is to follow on Oct. 20 .
“ Rubber Soul ” and “ Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Heart ’s Band ” are also slated for owners of the game to download onto their consoles in the near future .
It ’s just a matter of time until Beatlemania hits iTunes — especially once the “ Rock Band ” and remastered - CD bonanza has run its course .
And another Christmas approaches .
In an artfully worded statement on the release of the remastered catalogue , EMI and Apple Corps said “ discussions regarding the digital distribution of the catalogue will continue .
There is no further information available at this time . "
No wonder , once George Harrison ’s son Dhani convinced them of the opportunity , Paul McCartney , Ringo Star , Yoko Ono and George ’s widow Olivia all participated significantly in both the production of the videogame and the remastered albums .
No wonder , since the game was made public on June 1 at this year ’s E3 conference , “ the reaction , ” Josh Randall , who led the “ Beatles : Rock Band ” project for Harmonix , told TheWrap , “ has been phenomenal . ”
Phenomenal — but not surprising , when you consider that 2000 ’s “ Beatles 1 ” greatest - hits collection sold over 11.4 million copies domestically , according to Nielsen SoundScan , and over 31 million worldwide .
Not bad for what was basically a remastered and repackaged version of 1982 ’s 20 Greatest Hits with “ Something ” tacked on .
Even the soundtrack to the Cirque du Soleil Vegas stage production of “ Love ” has sold almost 2 million copies .
For brand strategist Singer , the Beatles have n’t even left the marketing launch pad .
“ Can the brand be stopped ? ” he asks .
“ Never .
In 3009 there will be Beatles starships . ”
I returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favour to men of skill ; but time and chance happeneth to them all .
Take a look at the first line of the movie for example :
Keisari , pahoittelen häiriötä , mutta
suosittelisin teitä harkitsemaan vielä kerran .
The English translation for this is :
I would like to suggest , Emperor ,
that you reconsider your plan .
Okay , so now we know what it means .
But what would a more literal translation be ?
Google gives us this for the line in Finnish :
Emperor , I apologise for the inconvenience , but
recommend you to consider once again .
Not bad at all .
Now here 's another trick for when using the automatic translator .
Take an entire sentence and put a period in between each word .
Now the Finnish we 'll be putting into it looks like this :
Keisari .
Pahoittelen .
Häiriötä .
Mutta .
Suosittelisin . Teitä . Harkitsemaan .
Vielä. Kerran .
And putting that into the translator gives us the following :
Emperor .
I am sorry .
Disturbances .
But .
Would recommend .
You .
Harkitsemaan .
Yet .
Once .
Far better than looking up words in the dictionary one by one .
Last , next et first précèdent les nombres .
Exemple : the last ten months : les dix derniers mois .
the first two weeks : les deux premières semaines .
Ecclesiastes .
If you do n't mind reading religious content ( but even the Skeptic 's Annotated Bible thinks Ecclesiastes is by far the best book in the Bible ) then this is what I would recommend .
It 's only 12 chapters , does n't have any weird place names , and is basically just about how the authour viewed life and death and how a lot of the things we do on Earth are basically just chasing after wind .
This passage from Ecclesiastes is particularly well - known : Depending on the language you are studying you may be able to find an online version of this book complete with mp3 .
In French for example you have it written here : http://dar.saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/1.htm with mp3s here : if you 're learning Bulgarian then just go to bgbible.com and you 're set for both .
It might not be possible to find in some languages though .
You 'll also want to check with somebody you know that speaks the language to make sure that the translation is n't archaic , because you wo n't know that by yourself at the outset .
Google Translate .
One good aspect of Google Translate that few use is its ability to be used as a dictionary to quickly look up a large number of words at the same time .
I wrote about this here when giving it as an example to learn Finnish : So the trick is to take a piece of text , separate each word with a period , and see what Google gives you .
International broadcasters like Deutsche Welle , BBC , TRT , RAI , etc .
Find a program you like in the language , download it as an mp3 , put it on your player and listen to it all the time .
They 're generally available every day so you can get your news in another language this way .
This is a more passive method , something to do when you 're walking or driving from one area to another , or when you 're too busy to take out a book and study but can still put in the headphones and listen while you do something else .
Find something in the language you 're learning that you can't find in English and pursue that .
If it 's Japanese then you might want to go with video games or manga , if it 's Icelandic you 'll probably be interested in the Eddas .
Often having an interest in a language means having an interest in the country ( ies ) behind it , so it 's generally not too hard to find something that you can't find in English .
Even small languages generally have fairly detailed Wikipedia articles on subjects related to the language , like this page in Occitan on a linguistic academy that has been proposed for the language .
Languages are always easier to study when they contain something that you want to know that just is n't available in your mother tongue .
When first learning a language , spend as much time as you can learning * about * the language as opposed to starting with things like greetings and numbers .
If you 're studying a European language there 's a good chance that it will contain a lot of hidden similarities to English that can be uncovered if you know how the language works .
Knowing for example that ss in German often corresponds to t in English will let you know that Wasser means water and dass means that , or if you know that ff in German often corresponds to English p , then you might recognize Affe as ape and Schiff as ship .
Since you already know thousands and thousands of words in English , if you 're studying a fairly related language then simply learning this in the beginning will be much more effective than just starting out by memorizing words .
Also learn about word formation as well , how Spanish - dad corresponds to English - ity and so on .
How to learn from a vocabulary list : vocabulary lists are a good way to study when they 're not the main activity you use .
If possible you 're going to want to get a list of most frequent vocabulary such as those available here , and that 's because you can be sure right at the outset that the words you are learning are words you 're going to see and hear quite often .
Okay , so now you have a list of 1000 words or so .
Now what ?
Well , this list is going to accompany you for the next few months as you whittle it down to nothing .
The best thing to do is print it or write it out , and take it with you to a coffee shop or some other place you study , and then you write out words one by one until you get bored .
As you write them out though , think about how well you know the word .
You might have seen it before and remember it when you see it , but can you use it in a sentence right away ?
If not , then leave it on the list .
If you 're sure that you know a word inside and out , then cross it out .
As you go over the list every day you 'll find some words that you 're sure you know , some that you feel like you know but do n't want to cross out yet , some that you kind of know but need more practice , and some that you probably do n't remember seeing at all .
Continue reprinting the list over the next few weeks as it gets smaller and smaller .
Now what will happen is you will probably end up with a few hundred words that you feel like you know but just can't cross out by yourself because they 're just too esoteric or not too useful , verbs like " correspond " or " attract " or " twist " or perhaps a few words like " cotton " and " wool " and " cloth " that kind of blend together because they 're too similar .
To test whether you know these words you 're going to want to find samples of writing in the language to skim over .
The subject can be about anything .
Just read over the piece of writing , do n't stress too much about what everything means , and just wait until you recognize a word you know that you have n't crossed out yet .
If you find that you see a word you have n't crossed out yet and know exactly what it means in the sentence then it 's probably safe to assume you know it well enough to cross it out .
If you take a look at this page here you can see that the first 1000 words alone will cover over 75 % of a language , another 1000 words brings you up to 84 % , and 1000 more brings you to 88 % , so the most important thing you can do in the beginning is make sure that you are learning the most frequent words .
But learning straight vocabulary should never be the main activity in learning a language , just something you do at the beginning of a study period when your mind is just warming up and you want to chill for a bit , or when you 're at the end and feeling a bit mentally exhausted .
Image searching to learn vocabulary : this is related to the point above .
Sometimes if you just can't seem to establish a connection with a word you might want to try a few image searches to see what turns up .
Similar vocabulary is often the hardest to remember , but an image search can easily show you the difference between a book and a tome .
If you 're in a crowded area you might want to have the filter turned on however , because you never know what other meanings a word might have in a language .
A seemingly innocent word like peaches turns up a fair amount of pornographic imagery for example , whereas peach does n't .
There 's no way to tell what 's going to turn up in a language you 're learning .
Find a good transliteration site if the language uses non-Latin characters .
Even if you have it installed on your computer you probably wo n't be able to type in the language when using another computer , or maybe you 're not used to the other language 's keyboard yet .
In that case using a site like this one can make a big difference .
Finding English textbooks in the language you 're studying .
Once you 've mastered the basics of a language and are able to understand a large amount of what you read , it 's always interesting to read an English textbook in the language you are working on to see how they explain the grammar of the language to their own people .
Here 's an example of this : a page on the French Wikibooks explaining how adjectives in English work :
So now that you 've seen an explanation in French reminding them that last , next and first precede numbers in English , you now know that the opposite is the case in French .
Read * about * the language too .
If you are learning French then you might want to pick up a book on the effect of the Norman invasion on the English language .
If you 're learning German or Dutch you might want to read Beowulf next to see if you can spot any similarities in the Old English text as you go along .
This helps to provide you with an extra bit of depth on the language you 're learning even while just reading books in English ( i.e. non-study , relaxation time ) .
In a scene which appears to have been lifted straight out of Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 , a group of Christians in Wisconsin has launched a legal claim demanding the right to publicly burn a copy of a book for teenagers which they deem to be " explicitly vulgar , racial [ sic ] , and anti-Christian " .
The offending book is Francesca Lia Block 's Baby Be-Bop , a young adult novel in which a boy , struggling with his homosexuality , is beaten up by a homophobic gang .
The complaint , which according to the American Library Association also demands $ 120,000 ( £ 72,000 ) in compensatory damages for being exposed to the book in a display at West Bend Community Memorial Library , was lodged by four men from the Christian Civil Liberties Union .
Their suit says that " the plaintiffs , all of whom are elderly , claim their mental and emotional well - being was damaged by this book at the library , " and that it contains derogatory language that could " put one 's life in possible jeopardy , adults and children alike . "
" The word ' faggot ' is very derogatory and slanderous to all males , " the suit continues .
" Using the word ' Nigger ' is dangerously offensive , disrespectful to all people .
These words can permeate violence . "
The suit also claims that the book " constitutes a hate crime , and that it degrades the community " .
" They 've filed a claim against the city of West Bend and the city has to decide if it is valid , " said Deborah Caldwell - Stone , acting director of the ALA 's office for intellectual freedom .
" Their insurance company is evaluating the claim , but I would be very surprised if they found any merit in it ...
Should they find any merit in this claim , we would certainly support the library in fighting it . "
The legal challenge follows a lengthy campaign by some West Bend residents to restrict access to teenage books they deemed sexually explicit from library shelves , which was eventually thrown out at the start of June .
" Obviously we were really pleased with the outcome to that – there was a unanimous vote to keep the books in the library and we thought the matter should be over , " said Larry Siems , director of the Freedom to Write programme at PEN America .
Siems said there was clearly " a bit of theatre " in the lawsuit which followed .
" They 've filed a lawsuit which has little possibility of going forward legally , and they 're asking for damages which include the right to burn a book .
It does seem more to gain publicity than a real serious challenge . "
But , he said , PEN remained very concerned about the impulse behind the claim .
" This is a group of people trying aggressively to rid the library of these books and that 's very serious - it needs to be fought . "
The claimants , he said , " have a right to continue to express their views , and this in a way is a creative attempt to express those views " .
But it 's " also a dangerous game when you 're talking about something like book burning , calling on the law to burn books .
It 's certainly completely un-American , and if they paused , I think they would agree . "
It was not possible to reach the Christian Civil Liberties Union for comment .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sent a detailed letter to the finance ministers from the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations calling for tough new capital rules for the world ’s largest banks .
The standards , which Mr. Geithner said should be agreed on by the end of 2010 and implemented by the end of 2012 , would call for much higher capital requirements at banks and require a much higher quality capital , with a heavy emphasis on equity .
U.S. officials have called for tougher capital requirements for months , but Mr. Geithner ’s detailed proposal comes as many European leaders have shifted their focus on bank regulation to things such as limiting the size of banks and caps on bonuses .
So the U.S. proposal could be controversial and set up a clash of top regulators as fault lines form over the best way to supervise banks .
In his “ Principles for Reforming the U.S. and International Regulatory Capital Framework for Banking Firms , ” Mr. Geithner calls for :
1 ) capital requirements that are designed to protect the stability of the financial system and individual banks .
In other words , reduce the ability of banks to “ accumulate ” risk during boom times by requiring them to hold more capital during boom times .
2 ) all banks to hold more capital and the biggest banks to hold even more capital than that .
No large financial companies should be able to evade these limits .
3 ) a greater emphasis on the quality of capital .
Higher quality capital means it is better able to absorb losses .
Voting common equity should represent a large majority of a bank ’s tier 1 capital .
4 ) risk - based capital requirements that reflect the risk of a bank ’s exposures .
Reduce the reliance on a bank ’s internal models to dictate what their capital requirements should be .
Regulatory capital ratios should reflect more accurate information about the health of a bank .
5 ) a way of addressing the huge problem caused by procyclicality , which essentially means that banks have little capital to spare when times are bad because they were able to hold less capital when times are good .
This has been a huge issue that policy makers have struggled with for years , and Mr. Geithner has several pages worth of ideas on this front .
6 ) a “ simple , non-risk - based leverage constraint . ”
G - 20 leaders have agreed to this in principle , but it has not yet been implemented .
It would make it harder for banks to game risk - based capital standards because there would be a capital floor they could n’t fall below .
7 ) a conservative and explicit liquidity standard .
This is something regulators have been emphasizing in the last year and many consider as important as capital standards .
8 ) ensuring that tougher capital requirements do n’t allow firms to migrate to places where such capital requirements do n’t exist .
In other words , keep the playing field balanced and do n’t allow huge risks to buildup in the system outside of regulation .
I ’ve been toying around with Scala ’s type system a little bit , and I ’ve come to the conclusion that it ’s completely brilliant .
And I ’m very encouraged by how rapidly it has improved .
There is , for example , limited support for type - level computation .
But not so much that typing becomes undecidable .
In Scala , types can have type members , and those members can take type parameters .
Type members can be bounded , and so can their parameters .

The meat heaters : 5,000 tons of unsold Tesco cuts a year are being burned to provide power for homes
Tesco is sending 5,000 tons of leftover meat a year to be burned to generate electricity for homes , it emerged yesterday .
The supermarket disposes of enough meat that has passed its sell - by date to power 600 homes for a year through the National Grid .
Other major supermarkets plan to follow suit .
But animal rights campaigners yesterday said many homeowners would be ' horrified ' to learn that their electricity was generated by the ' macabre ' recycling scheme .
Tesco has hailed the scheme as part of a ' green ' drive which had enabled it to stop sending any of the waste it produces to environmentally damaging landfill sites .
But the campaigners said the environmental benefits were far outweighed by the greenhouse gases produced by all the extra animals unnecessarily reared for slaughter in the first place .
The supermarket giant sends 5,000 tons of out - of - date meat to the National Grid , enough to power 600 homes for a year
Animal rights campaign group Viva said vegetarians in particular would be alarmed to discover that their houses were being part - powered by out - of - date meat .
Justin Kerswell , campaigns manager for Viva ( Vegetarians International Voice for Animals ) , said : ' It 's a sad indictment of modern life that not only hundreds of millions of animals are killed each year in the UK , but so much meat is left over from greed and indifference .
' To turn this wasted meat into power might seem like a good idea at first , but you have to ask yourself why is so much left over and why are so many animals dying to provide this excess ?
' Surely killing fewer animals in the first place should be the aim .
' Whatever savings are made by turning this meat into energy is more than voided by the huge amount of greenhouse gases generated by the farming and production of the meat in the first place .
' Tesco should take a long hard look at its wasteful practices . '
He said consumers should be told if their domestic power came from such sources .
' More and more people are choosing to adopt an ethical and green vegetarian or vegan diet , ' he added .
' Green Drive ' :
The supermarket says the scheme means it is not sending as much waste to environmentally damaging landfill sites
' Most would be horrified to find out that their power was generated by leftover meat .
' Consumers should have the right to know if their power is generated in this macabre manner . '
The meat and other food waste is processed in biomass - to- energy
plants which turn waste food into biofuel and then use that to produce renewable electricity .
Britain lags behind other European countries in the use of this ' anaerobic digestion ' conversion , and ministers were handed recommendations on how to boost rates by an expert review panel last month .
Tesco , the UK 's biggest retailer , said this week that it had succeeded in diverting all of its annual 531,000 tons of waste - equivalent to the weight of 75,000 double - decker buses - away from landfill .
Normally only about 385,000 tons would be recycled , with 146,000 tons going to landfill .
The supermarket giant had originally planned to have no waste going to landfill by the end of this year , but has fulfilled its pledge early .
Sainsbury 's are also running a zero landfill scheme in which food waste will be sent to anaerobic digestion plants .
The leftover products will then be turned into fertiliser or pet food .
The supermarket also plans to recycle all its 20,000 tons of non-food waste including metal , plastic and paper packaging .
Asda and Ocado , which delivers Waitrose groceries , are also planning to follow suit .
Of the main supermarket chains , only Wm Morrison has yet to make any firm commitment to sending no waste to landfill .
Introduction
The USA government blames hatred of democracy and envy at the American way of life for this resentment .
Many people in the USA and a majority around the world look towards USA foreign policy for the answers .
Much of this policy , its history and consequences is under - reported by the American media .
The American people are generally a friendly , kindly and compassionate people .
If they knew one tenth of what their governments get up to around the world and in their dealings with foreign governments and people , there would be an enormous outcry .
For this reason much is hidden or obscurred .
Since the terrible events on 11 September 2001 , many Americans have taken to the internet to find out more about the world beyond their borders .
However , when you read these items , do not simply believe everything - always check for yourself .
Treat the stories and quotes in these pages as pointers and use the information to find out more .
Learn to think and check all information .
The facts are there if you look for them .
These pages are dedicated to all victims of private or state terrorism regardless of nationality , race ,

" We do n't really give a damn for what anybody thinks .
We rub everyone 's face in it .
We 're Americans and you 're not .
We 're really talking the Roman Empire here .
We 'll do anything we want to do and anywhere we want to do it .
You 're either with us or against us .
Multi-lateral institutions like the UN are incidental and irrelevant to the powers that be .
This is the image we 're sending to the world .
That is what much of the world feels about this country this minute . "
Dr. Robert M. Bowman , a retired Lieutenant Colonel from the USA Air Force , in an open letter to the USA President , George W Bush ( 2001 ) :
" We are not hated because we practice democracy , freedom , and human rights .
We are hated because our government denies these things to people in third world countries whose resources are coveted by our multinational corporations .
And that hatred we have sown has come back to haunt us in the form of terrorism ... "
" We are the target of terrorists because we stand for dictatorship , bondage , and human exploitation in the world .
We are the target of terrorists because we are hated .
And we are hated because our government has done hateful things .
In how many countries have we deposed popularly elected leaders and replaced them with puppet military dictators who were willing to sell out their own people to American multinational corporations ? "
" We did it in Iran when we deposed Mossadegh because he wanted to nationalize the oil industry .
We replaced him with the Shah , and trained , armed , and paid his hated Savak national guard , which enslaved and brutalized the people of Iran .
All to protect the financial interests of our oil companies .
Is it any wonder there are people in Iran who hate us ? "
" We did it in Chile when we deposed Allende , democratically elected by the people to introduce socialism .
We replaced him with the brutal right - wing military dictator , General Pinochet .
Chile has still not recovered . "
" We did it in Vietnam when we thwarted democratic elections in the South which would have united the country under Ho Chi Minh .
We replaced him with a series of ineffectual puppet crooks who invited us to come in and slaughter their people , and we did .
( I flew 101 combat missions in that war .... ) "
" We did it in Iraq , where we killed a quarter of a million civilians in a failed attempt to topple Saddam Hussein , and where we have killed a million since then with our sanctions .
About half of these innocent victims have been children under the age of five . "
" And , of course , how many times have we done it in Nicaragua and all the other banana republics of Latin America ?
Time after time we have ousted popular leaders who wanted the riches of the land to be shared by the people who worked it .
We replaced them with murderous tyrants who would sell out and control their own people so that the wealth of the land could be taken out by Domino Sugar , the United Fruit Company , Folgers , and Chiquita Banana . "
" In country after country , our government has thwarted democracy , stifled freedom , and trampled human rights .
That 's why we are hated around the world .
And that 's why we are the target of terrorists . "
" People in Canada enjoy better democracy , more freedom , and greater human rights than we do .
So do the people of Norway and Sweden .
Have you heard of Canadian embassies being bombed ?
Or Norwegian embassies ?
Or Swedish embassies .
No .
We are not hated because we practice democracy , freedom , and human rights . "
" Instead of sending our sons and daughters around the world to kill Arabs so the oil companies can sell the oil under their sand , we must send them to rebuild their infrastructure , supply clean water , and feed starving children .
Instead of continuing to kill thousands of Iraqi children every day with our sanctions , we must help them rebuild their electric power plants , their water treatment facilities , their hospitals ; all the things we destroyed in our war against them and prevented them from rebuilding with our sanctions . "
" Instead of seeking to be king of the hill , we must become a responsible member of the family of nations .
Instead of stationing hundreds of thousands of troops around the world to protect the financial interests of our multinational corporations , we must bring them home and expand the Peace Corps .
Instead of training terrorists and death squads in the techniques of torture and assassination , we must close the School of the Americas ( no matter what name they use ) .
Instead of supporting military dictatorships , we must support true democracy ; the right of the people to choose their own leaders .
Instead of supporting insurrection , destabilization , assassination , and terror around the world , we must abolish the CIA and give the money to relief agencies . "
" In short , we do good instead of evil .
We become the good guys , once again . "
" The threat of terrorism would vanish .
That is what the American people need to hear .
We are good people .
We only need to be told the truth and given the vision .
You can do it , Mr. President .
Stop the killing .
Stop the justifying .
Stop the retaliating .
Put people first .
Tell them the truth . "
John Gerassi , USA citizen :
" I can't help crying .
As soon as I see a person on TV telling the heart - rendering story of the tragic fate of their loved one in the World Trade Center disaster , I can't control my tears .
But then I wonder why did n't I cry when our troops wiped out some 5,000 poor people in Panama 's El Chorillo neighborhood on the excuse of looking for Noriega .
Our leaders knew he was hiding elsewhere but we destroyed El Chorillo because the folks living there were nationalists who wanted the USA out of Panama completely . "
" Worse still , why did n't I cry when we killed two million Vietnamese , mostly innocent peasants , in a war which its main architect , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , knew we could not win ?
When I went to give blood the other day , I spotted a Cambodian doing the same , three up in the line , and that reminded me :
Why did n't I cry when we helped Pol Pot butcher another million by giving him arms and money , because he was opposed to " our enemy " ( who eventually stopped the killing fields ) ?
"
" To stay up but not cry that evening , I decided to go to a movie .
I chose Lumumba , at the Film Forum , and again I realized that I had n't cried when our government arranged for the murder of the Congo 's only decent leader , to be replaced by General Mobutu , a greedy , vicious , murdering dictator .
Nor did I cry when the CIA arranged for the overthrow of Indonesia 's Sukarno , who had fought the Japanese World War II invaders and established a free independent country , and then replaced him by another General , Suharto , who had collaborated with the Japanese and who proceeded to execute at least half a million ' Marxists ' ( in a country where , if folks had ever heard of Marx , it was at best Groucho ) ? "
" I watched TV again last night and cried again at the picture of that wonderful now missing father playing with his two - month old child .
Yet when I remembered the slaughter of thousands of Salvadorans , so graphically described in the Times by Ray Bonner , or the rape and murder of those American nuns and lay sisters there , all perpetrated by CIA trained and paid agents , I never shed a tear .
I even cried when I heard how brave had been Barbara Olson , wife of the Solicitor General , whose political views I detested .
But I did n't cry when the USA invaded that wonderful tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada and killed innocent citizens who hoped to get a better life by building a tourist airfield , which my government called proof of a Russian base , but then finished building once the island was secure in the US camp again . "
" Why did n't I cry when Ariel Sharon , today Israel 's prime minister , planned , then ordered , the massacre of two thousand poor Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila , the same Sharon who , with such other Irgun and Stern Gang terrorists become prime ministers as Begin and Shamir , killed the wives and children of British officers by blowing up the King David hotel where they were billeted ? "
" I guess one only cries only for one 's own .
But is that a reason to demand vengeance on anyone who might disagree with us ?
That 's what Americans seem to want .
Certainly our government does , and so too most of our media .
Do we really believe that we have a right to exploit the poor folk of the world for our benefit , because we claim we are free and they are not ? "
" So now we 're going to go to war .
We are certainly entitled to go after those who killed so many of our innocent brothers and sisters .
And we 'll win , of course .
Against Bin Laden .
Against Taliban .
Against Iraq .
Against whoever and whatever .
In the process we 'll kill a few innocent children again .
Children who have no clothes for the coming winter .
No houses to shelter them .
And no schools to learn why they are guilty , at two or four or six years old .
Maybe Evangelists Falwell and Robertson will claim their death is good because they were n't Christians , and maybe some State Department spokesperson will tell the world that they were so poor that they 're now better off . "
" And then what ?
Will we now be able to run the world the way we want to ?
With all the new legislation establishing massive surveillance of you and me , our CEOs will certainly be pleased that the folks demonstrating against globalization will now be cowed for ever .
No more riots in Seattle , Quebec or Genoa .
Peace at last . "
" Until next time .
Who will it be then ?
A child grown - up who survived our massacre of his innocent parents in El Chorillo ?
A Nicaraguan girl who learned that her doctor mother and father were murdered by a bunch of gangsters we called democratic contras who read in the CIA handbook that the best way to destroy the only government which was trying to give the country 's poor a better lot was to kill its teachers , health personnel , and government farm workers ?
Or maybe it will be a bitter Chilean who is convinced that his whole family was wiped out on order of Nixon 's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who could never tell the difference between a communist and a democratic socialist or even a nationalist . "
" When will we Americans learn that as long as we keep trying to run the world for the sake of the bottom line , we will suffer someone 's revenge ?
No war will ever stop terrorism as long as we use terror to have our way .
So I stopped crying because I stopped watching TV .
I went for a walk .
Just four houses from mine .
There , a crowd had congregated to lay flowers and lit candles in front of our local firehouse .
It was closed .
It had been closed since Tuesday because the firemen , a wonderful bunch of friendly guys who always greeted neighborhood folks with smiles and good cheer , had rushed so fast to save the victims of the first tower that they perished with them when it collapsed .
And I cried again . "
" So I said to myself when I wrote this , do n't send it ; some of your students , colleagues , neighbors will hate you , maybe even harm you .
But then I put on the TV again , and there was Secretary of State Powell telling me that it will be okay to go to war against these children , these poor folks , these USA haters , because we are civilized and they are not .
So I decided to risk it .
Maybe , reading this , one more person will ask :
Why are so many people in the world ready to die to give us a taste of what we give them ? "
George W Bush , USA president during the State of the Union address on 28 January 2003 :
" Throughout the 20th century small groups of men seized control of great nations , built armies and arsenals , and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world . "
Ann Coulter , USA commentator for the Republican Party discussing the Middle East :
" We should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity . "
Robert Hunter Wade , professor of political economy at the London School of Economics ( UK ) and author of " Governing the Market " ( Princeton University Press ) :
" Suppose you are a modern - day Roman emperor , leader of the most powerful country in a world of sovereign states and international markets .
What international political economy do you create so that , without having to throw your weight around too much , normal market forces bolster the economic pre-eminence of your country , allow your citizens to consume far more than they produce , and keep challengers down ? "
" You want autonomy to decide on your own exchange rate and monetary policy , while having other countries depend on your support in managing their own economies .
You want to be able to engineer volatility and economic crises in the rest of the world in order to hinder the growth of centres that might challenge your pre-eminence .
You want intense competition between exporters in the rest of the world to give you an inflow of imports at constantly decreasing prices relative to the price of your exports .
You want to invite the best brains in the rest of the world to your universities , companies and research institutes .
You befriend middle classes elsewhere and make sure they have good reasons for supporting your framework .
What features do you hard - wire into the international political economy ? "
" First , free capital mobility . "
" Second , free trade ( except imports that threaten domestic industries important for your reselection ) . "
" Third , international investment free from any discriminatory favouring of national companies through protection , public procurement , public ownership or other devices , with special emphasis on the freedom of your companies to get the custom of national elites for the management of their financial assets , their private education , healthcare , pensions , and the like . "
" Fourth , your currency as the main reserve currency . "
" Fifth , no constraint on your ability to create your currency at will ( such as a dollar - gold link ) , so that you can finance unlimited trade deficits with the rest of the world . "
" Sixth , international lending at variable interest rates denominated in your currency , which means that borrowing countries in crisis have to repay you more when their capacity to repay is less .
This combination allows your people to consume far more than they produce ( and it periodically produces financial instability and crises in the rest of the world ) .
To supervise the international framework you want international organisations that look like cooperatives of member states and carry the legitimacy of multilateralism , but are financed in a way that allows you control . "
" Is the above a Machiavellian interpretation of the US role in the world economy since the end of the Bretton Woods regime around 1970 ?
Certainly .
America 's engineering of its dominance has at times been for the general good , when it used its clout to " think for the world " .
But often its clout has been used solely in the interests of its richest citizens and most powerful corporations .
This latter tendency has been dominant lately .
We see it in its new single - minded unilateralism in international relations , much exacerbated by the mixture of rage at September 11 and gung - ho jubilation at " success " in Afghanistan .
And we see it in what the United States is now ramming through the international supervisory organisations . "
" The USA has engineered the WTO to commit itself to negotiate a general agreement on trade in services , which will facilitate a global market in private healthcare , welfare , pensions , education and water , supplied - naturally - by USA companies , and which will undermine political support for universal access to social services in developing countries .
It has engineered a " private sector development " agenda devoted to accelerating the private ( and nongovernmental ) provision of basic services on a commercial basis .
The World Bank has made no evaluation of its earlier efforts to support private participation in social sectors .
Its new private development thrust , especially in the social sectors , owes everything to USA pressure . "
" These power relations and exercises of statecraft are obscured in the current talk about globalisation .
The increasing mobility of information , finance , goods and services frees the American government of constraints while more tightly constraining everyone else .
Globalisation enables the US to harness the rest of the world to its own rhythms and structure . "
" Of course these arrangements do not produce terrorism .
But they are deeply implicated in the very slow economic growth in most of the developing world since 1980 , and in the widening world income inequality .
Slow economic growth and vast income disparities breed cohorts of partly educated young people who grow up in anger and despair .
Some try by legal or illegal means to migrate to the west ; some join militant ethnic or religious movements directed at each other and their own rulers .
But now the idea has spread among a few vengeful fundamentalists that the USA should be attacked directly . "
" The USA and its allies can stamp out specific groups by force and bribery .
But in the longer run , the structural arrangements that replicate a grossly unequal world have to be redesigned , so that markets working within the new framework produce more equitable results .
Historians looking back a century hence will say that the time to have begun was now . "
Tariq Ali , UK writer :
" There are 189 member states of the UN .
There is , according to USA Defense Department figures , a USA military presence in 120 countries today . "
Rebuilding America 's Defenses : Strategies , Forces And Resources
For A New Century , a document produced in 2000 by advisers to the USA government ( page 28 ) :
" This is especially important in light of the nascent European moves toward an independent defense ' identity ' and policy ; it is important that NATO not be replaced by the European Union , leaving the United States without a voice in European security affairs . "
Page 40 :
" American landpower is the essential link in the chain that translates U.S. military supremacy into American geopolitical preeminence . "
Gregg Easterbrook , journalist in the USA newspaper , The New York Times , writing about American military force :
" For years to come , no other nation is likely even to try to rival American might .
Other nations are not even trying to match American armed force , because they are so far behind they have no chance of catching up .
The great - powers arms race , in progress for centuries , has ended with the rest of the world conceding triumph to the United States . "
Major General Smedley D. Butler , USA strategist , 1935 .
" Lest this seem to be the bellicose pipedream of some dyspeptic desk soldier , let us remember that the military deal of our country has never been defensive warfare .
Since the Revolution , only the United Kingdom has beaten our record for square miles of territory acquired by military conquest .
Our exploits against the American Indian , against the Filipinos , the Mexicans , and against Spain are on a par with the campaigns of Genghis Khan , the Japanese in Manchuria and the African attack of Mussolini .
No country has ever declared war on us before we first obliged them with that gesture .
Our whole history shows we have never fought a defensive war .
And at the rate our armed forces are being implemented at present , the odds are against our fighting one in the near future . "
