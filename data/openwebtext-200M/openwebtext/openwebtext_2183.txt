CMake is now 20 !
Kitware posted yesterday an interview with Bill Hoffman , the original creator for CMake and shared that August 31 was CMake 's 20th birthday Here , in the C++ team , we are not only heavy CMake users .
We also believe that CMake is a foundational piece for all C++ cross-platform developers and , as such , we strive to enable the ...
This is my second entry on Code : : Blocks in the past couple of weeks .
I had earlier commented on the release of the IDE but refrained myself to get too carried away and thus , purposefully , did n’t get into details at that time .
The reason ?
Well , we all know how deceptive first impressions can be , especially about something like an IDE .
IDEs can be complex beasts and it can take some time to work things out with them .
However , Code : : Blocks has been mostly easy to adapt to , at least for me .
This in part due the fact that it mostly mirrors how Visual Studio works , and I work on that beast 98 % of the time .
So adapting to Code : : Blocks was not too difficult except for minor differences .
First of all , Kudos to the Code : : Blocks team .
They have done a great job at bringing us this editor .
It ’s no mean feat , but they seemed to have pulled through all odds and that does indeed deserve a praise .
It ’s true I was eagerly waiting for the Code : : Blocks release for some time now , and if you have been reading my blog , you will have seen me mention the IDE a couple of times before .
To cut the long story short , I am lazy !
I hate writing UI code and Code : : Blocks ( wxSmith ) just does much work for you in that regard and yes , I always tend to use wxWidgets for most of my cross - platform UI projects .
I wish this release could have come in a year earlier , when I was working on a C++ project which involved using wxWidgets for the UI , would have saved me a sh**t load of trouble .
Even though the IDE auto generates UI code , it ’s surprisingly clean .
Most editors will make a mess of code generation , but not so with C:: B. The UI code is generated into pure C++ files ( .h and .cpp ) which you can continue editing like your normal text files provided you do n’t insert code into the blocks C: : B uses .
Reminds me of the days I worked with Visual Studio 6.0 and MFC .
If I am not mistaken VC ++ 6.0 used a similar method for code generation .
You can even move the code around and C : : B is correctly recognize it , yes , provided the blocks are kept intact .
A good thing is the fact that you can save the resources as .XRC files , which I tend to use extensively with wxPython .
For me , Code : : Blocks could very well become the de-facto editor while working with wxWidgets .
To bad it does n’t allow native Python support .
That would have been great indeed .
So , besides having a good integration with a UI builder what more does C: : B offer ?
Other than the fact that it can be used for UI development , can it be used for ( , maybe other ) serious C++ development ?
Yes it very much can be .
All said , my main interest in IDE was not how easily you could build UI .
My main interest was too see if C:: B could be used for serious day - to - day development and how well it scales to full scale projects .
There are several other IDEs that look equally impressive , until you actually try to get things done with them .
So what ’s the story with C::B ?
Does it live up to the standards of other professional IDEs ?
Well , besides some niggling quirks C:: B seems to be pretty good for full scale projects .
I always have a habit of building , a hello world , a “ hello notepad ” project with any new UI library I encounter .
It gives you a fair idea of the capabilities of the UI .
I tried the same with C:: B and was pretty happy with the overall experience .
Now for some issues I had with the IDE .
First and probably the most annoying was the fact that short - cut key assignments are very different from other editors , at least the ones I use .
Also the fact that the IDE does n’t allow me to set shortcuts like Ctrl - F5 or Shift - F5 is somewhat of a hindrance to quick acclimatization to C:: B.
That ’s one serious nag !
The other thing I noticed was the fact that the debugger can get really slow on Linux systems , though I must say it happened only twice for me and is not a frequent occurrence .
On Windows the Visual Studio 9.0 directories got messed up when I installed VC 9.0 after I had installed C::B. C: : B does n’t pick up the VC 9.0 directories when you upgrade or remove older express versions .
Not a problem though , I did managed to manually set them in the Options section .
The debugger is not as extensive as others , but I guess you can generally live with that by adding “ watches ” .
Most other issues , or for the matter of fact even these are rather trivial , I suppose .
OK then , how does the IDE handle projects across platforms ?
I found almost no trouble porting applications across platforms , at least no issues that were IDE centric .
But then again my sample application was not entirely that extensive .
Even then it ’s worth a mention that after having been setup right , the project written under Linux compiled without a single major change on windows .
No mucking around with Makefiles or build systems .
Yes , it ’s true I programmed for compatibility but still , all I really had to do was switch the compiler settings ( for VC 9.0 ) thats all .
So can C : : B be used for production quality projects ?
I would have to answer “ yes ” to that question .
It definitely is good enough to be used for production code and if you are working with wxWidgets , I would even go so far as recommending this IDE over others .
True it is not as powerful as Visual Studio , at least yet , but it still deserves more than a praise .
For C++ development under Linux , I would recommend this IDE hands down , period !
Palm oil is one of the biofuel crops stirring controversy
The replacement of traditional fuels with biofuels has dragged more than 30 million people worldwide into poverty , an aid agency report says .
Oxfam says so - called green policies in developed countries are contributing to the world 's soaring food prices , which hit the poor hardest .
The group also says biofuels will do nothing to combat climate change .
Its report urges the EU to scrap a target of making 10 % of all transport run on renewable resources by 2020 .
Oxfam estimates the EU 's target could multiply carbon emissions 70 - fold by 2020 by changing the use of land .
The report 's author , Oxfam 's biofuel policy adviser Rob Bailey , criticised rich countries for using subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the use of food crops for alternative sources of energy like ethanol .
" If the fuel value for a crop exceeds its food value , then it will be used for fuel instead , " he said .
" Rich countries ... are making climate change worse , not better , they are stealing crops and land away from food production , and they are destroying millions of livelihoods in the process . "
Opportunity - or crime ?
Biofuels are a divisive issue with strong arguments on both sides .
Leaders such as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have suggested the biofuel boom provides developing nations with a great opportunity .
He says it creates a profitable export for energy crop producers in Africa , Central America and the Caribbean that could enable them to claw their way out of poverty .
But several aid agencies and analysts have warned of the possible downside of biofuel crop cultivation .
One UN adviser went as far as describing biofuels as a " crime against humanity " .

Conservatives are happier than liberals .
This according to a 2006 Pew Research Center survey cited in a paper published this month in Psychological Science .
But New York University researchers set out to isolate the reasons why right - wingers would have greater subjective well - being than left - wingers .
They collected data from nearly 1,200 people from the 2000 American National Election Study and found that above the effects of gender , marital status , income , religion and age , the reason for this happiness disparity can be distilled to the separate ideologies of liberals and conservatives .
The authors argue that a conservative belief acts as a psychological buffer in a world of increasing inequality .
The idea is that conservatives tend to rationalize inequality as the result of a fair process in a meritocracy , whereas liberals tend to see inequality as inherently unjust .
Analyses with data from 9,000 people across 10 countries uncovered the pattern that , not only do right - wingers report greater life satisfaction across cultures , but the gap widens in those countries where quality of life is low .
Finally , the authors looked at U.S. data spanning the past 30 years , and found that increasing economic inequality is associated with the decrease in the nation ’s overall happiness .
But noted they found that liberals ’ self - reported happiness decreased more steeply than that of conservatives .

Will Elder , whose frantic , gag - filled illustrations helped to define the comic identity of Mad magazine and who was a creator of the Playboy cartoon serial “ Little Annie Fanny , ” died Wednesday in Rockleigh , N.J. He was 86 .
The cause was Parkinson ’s disease , said Gary VandenBergh , his son - in - law .
A dead - on caricaturist with an anarchic sense of humor , Mr. Elder stuffed the backgrounds of his Madison Avenue parodies and comic - strip spoofs with inane puns , silly signs and weird characters doing strange things .
“ That approach to humor seeped into the rest of the magazine and the DNA of its contributors , ” said John Ficarra , the editor of Mad .
“ It set the tone for the entire magazine and created a look that endures to this day . ”
Mr. Elder called these background fillers “ chicken fat , ” explaining that they were “ the part of the strip that gave it some flavor but did little to advance the story line . ”
This layered , free - for - all approach influenced the cartoons of R. Crumb and films like “ Airplane ! ” and the “ Naked Gun ” series .
Consider the newly passed GI benefits bill .
When it was introduced , McCain tried to kill it .
When the NY Times questioned McCain ’s opposition to the bill , he “ got a little touchy “ .
When the bill came up for a vote Thursday night , McCain did n’t even show up to vote .
So , is anyone surprised when McCain tries to take credit for helping pass the bill ?
Crunchy salad , toasted pitta bread and a dash of chilli sauce have helped aficionados kid themselves and their taste buds that a doner kebab is one of the healthier takeaway options .
But scientists have found that the food contains up to the equivalent of a wine glass of cooking oil .
One of the kebabs tested contained 140g of fat , twice the maximum daily allowance for women .
Another contained 111g .
Nutritionists said eating two a week could cause a heart attack within 10 years .
Food scientists from Hampshire county council tested the fat , salt and trans fat content of popular takeaway food , including Chinese and Indian meals , pizzas , kebabs and fish and chips .
They found many of the dishes contained an entire day 's fat in one meal .
But by far the worst offender was the doner kebab .
Trans fat , which contributes to coronary heart disease by raising levels of " bad " cholesterol and lowering levels of " good " cholesterol , was found in all the kebabs tested .
There is no UK legislation on trans fat in food , but health authorities recommend that consumption should be restricted to trace amounts and the only European standard , the Danish food act , stipulates no more than 5 % trans fat in food .
Sixty per cent of kebabs contained more than 5 % , while the other meals were below the Danish benchmark .
The least fatty takeaway food was found to be Chinese char sui or barbequed pork , but shish kebab also scored low in fat .
The best in terms of low salt content was fish and chips .
Denise Thomas , head of nutrition and dietetics at Portsmouth Hospitals Trust , said that 111g of fat in a kebab was 1,000 calories , the equivalent of a wine glass of cooking oil .
" The majority of that fat is saturated , so it 's going to raise your cholesterol and give you thickening of your arteries , " she said .
" If you were eating that meal twice a week on top of your ordinary diet , it 's a ticking time bomb of coronary heart disease . "
The effect of eating doner kebabs was dependent on the rest of a person 's diet .
" If you eat lots of fruit and vegetables the rest of the time , it 's not going to be a problem .
But if you 're eating pie and chips and fried breakfasts as well , you 're heading towards a heart attack within 10 years . "
Policy Exchange dispute - update
Newsnight
As summer approaches we thought it was about time we revisited the row we got into late last year with the influential right - leaning think tank Policy Exchange .
It 's almost six months since we broadcast our investigation into Policy Exchange 's report " The Hijacking of British Islam " which named and shamed mosques across the UK for disseminating extremist literature .
We have a new statement from them , but more of that later .
( Watch the original report , followed by the interview with the Research Director of the Policy Exchange , below : )

Webwise for full instructions
Here 's a quick reminder about the original story : outside researchers working for Policy Exchange on the report visited 100 mosques and Islamic institutions and said they found extremist books available in a quarter of the survey sample .
The researchers had obtained receipts as evidence .
These were shocking findings and , unsurprisingly , the report made front page news .
Newsnight too had been planning to broadcast a detailed film based on these findings but when we began checking the receipts a rather different story emerged .
The first anomaly we found was in the receipt said to have been obtained from the Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West London .
The document contained basic spelling errors in the address ( see below ) .
We showed it to the centre 's director who strongly denied it was genuine .
When we looked at some of the other receipts we were concerned enough to suspend our broadcast while we checked them .
This approach was derided by Policy Exchange 's chairman , Charles Moore , who suggested we should have simply broadcast the findings and allowed the mosques to have their say .
We took the view that this was not a sensible way forward and began detailed checks .
We soon found suspicious inconsistencies in receipts allegedly obtained from North London Central Mosque , Euston Mosque , Leyton Mosque in London and the Muslim Education Centre in High Wycombe .
Most worryingly :
- forensic evidence suggested that at least one receipt had been forged
- forensic evidence strongly suggested that two other receipts - supposedly from different mosques - were in fact written by the same hand
- there were basic mistakes in the addresses printed on three receipts
- all of the receipts we had suspicions about had been printed on home - style ink jet printers .
Ink jets are usually used for one - offs or for limited print runs because of expense .
We 're republishing the receipts so you can judge for yourself .
Policy Exchange 's internal inquiry
On 19th December Policy Exchange released a statement standing by their report but advising readers that " as an evidence - based research organisation , we take the allegations made seriously " .
It continued : " Our investigations must be allowed time to proceed . "
Well surely six months is enough ?
I contacted Policy Exchange 's external relations director Dr Steven King for an update .
He got back to me this week with a statement saying that the independent inquiry had been " adjourned " because " the Muslim researchers who conducted the original investigation into the mosques have gone into hiding for fear of violent reprisals after Newsnight revealed their whereabouts on air , in breach of an undertaking given to Policy Exchange .
Following the Newsnight broadcast , an Islamist website denounced the undercover researchers and called for them to be hunted down .
Policy Exchange takes any allegations against its research methodology seriously , and so is keeping the investigation open in case circumstances change making it possible for it to be completed . "
Just to be clear - we did n't identify the researchers , we reported which country they were in , which was the reason why PE said they could not be contacted for interview .
Policy Exchange 's most recent statement also states that the report " does not mention the receipts or rely on them as evidence , and Policy Exchange stands by the study 's content " .
Newsnight finds that argument surprising .
Policy Exchange has argued that the report is justified because extremist literature was discovered in the mosques .
But if researchers working for Policy Exchange put forward evidence , some of which was flawed , then what reliance should be placed on this influential report which was advertised as " the most comprehensive academic survey of its kind ever produced in the UK " ?
What is reliable and what is unreliable ?
Six months down the line the think tank has still not answered the most basic question of all : were some of the receipts fabricated ?
Given Policy
Exchange 's decision to put their internal investigation on hold , it seems unlikely we 'll be getting an answer any time soon .
Several of the mosques said they were prepared to take legal action against the report and have instructed libel lawyers .
Leading libel firm Carter - Ruck said : " we have been instructed by Al - Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre and Masjid and Madrasa al - Tawhid ( " Al - Tawhid Mosque " ) to bring a complaint for libel against Policy Exchange in respect of allegations contained in the report
The hijacking of British Islam ... which we anticipate making shortly " .
Receipt from Muslim Education Centre , High Wycombe
A registered forensic document examiner conducted an ESDA test on this receipt from High Wycombe Muslim Education Centre .
This test proved that the High Wycombe receipt was filled in while resting on top of another receipt supposedly from a mosque in West London - 40 miles away .
Policy Exchange has yet to comment on how this might have occurred .
Receipt from Leyton mosque compared with receipt from Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre
Take a close look at the hand - writing on these two receipts , supposedly obtained from different mosques 10 miles apart .
To my eye they look identical .
The registered forensic document examiner concluded there was " strong evidence " that these two documents were written by the same person .
This is the second highest degree of certainty in forensic examinations of this kind .
Furthermore , note the misspelling of raod and center on the Muslim Cultural Heritage receipt .
And the address on the receipt for Leyton Mosque is wrong : it gives the address of an independently owned bookshop next door , not the mosque itself .
Policy Exchange claims the researcher was " led " from the mosque into the bookshop and therefore the mosque sanctioned the purchase of extremist materials .
Their argument appears to be that this is the same as the mosque actually selling the material itself .
However this version of events was not spelled out in the report .
In a similar fashion , the report also said that extremist material had been bought from East London mosque .
This particular claim featured in the Times but the newspaper backtracked a week after our broadcast : " We would like to make clear that the bookshop situated near the East London Mosque .... is a commercial tenant of the Mosque and is situated on different premises .
The chairman of the Mosque , Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari , has no responsibility for or control over the material that is being sold there .
We apologise to Dr Bari for any distress caused . "
Receipt from North London Central Mosque
The researchers working on the Policy Exchange report said they obtained this receipt from the North London Central Mosque in Finsbury Park .
The management there deny all knowledge , and say it 's a forgery .
Like the other suspect receipts , this document was printed on an ink - jet printer - the kind used for small print runs at home .
Receipt from Euston Mosque
This receipt issued in the name of " Euston Mosque " inexplicably gives its address as 202 North Gower Street - which is in fact the address of an entirely different organisation around the corner known as the UK Islamic Mission .
Euston Mosque is located at 204a North Gower Street , as any simple check would have shown .
The elders at Euston mosque told us it's a forgery .
They showed us their genuine , numbered receipt book , which is very different to this receipt .
At first Policy Exchange argued they were not able to explain this anomaly because their researchers were " away on a retreat " .
Later they argued the extremist books were from the UK Islamic Mission around the corner from Euston Mosque ( something UKIM denies ) .
But if that was the case then how and why did they obtain a receipt in the name of " Euston Mosque " ?

Many economists believe the US economy is already in recession The Federal Reserve has cut US interest rates sharply in an attempt to restore confidence to nervous financial markets and boost the ailing economy .
The central bank lowered rates to 2.25 % from 3 % , but the cut was smaller than financial markets had expected .
Many economists believe the US economy is already in a recession .
The Fed has taken strong action this week to avert a financial panic after investment bank Bear Stearns was forced into a fire sale to avoid collapse .
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson admitted earlier on Tuesday that the economy was facing a " sharp decline " at the moment , but hoped for a recovery later in the year .
Aggressive action
The Fed 's action is yet another forceful move in its attempts to alleviate the liquidity crunch and to shore up a rapidly weakening economy ,
Arun Raha , senior economist at Swiss Re The Fed has now lowered rates six times since mid-September , with the economy reeling from the credit crisis that was triggered by a slump in the US housing market .
" Today 's policy action , combined with those taken earlier , including measures to foster market liquidity , should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity , " the Federal Reserve said .
US shares initially trimmed gains after the Fed 's announcement but the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average later resumed its ascent .
Wall Street rallied earlier after two leading investment banks , Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers , reported smaller falls in profits than analysts had been expecting .
The dollar , which has been hitting record lows against the euro , gained ground .
Recession fears
The Fed is hoping its actions will stave off both a recession in the wider economy and go some way to ease unprecedented conditions in the financial system .
" The Fed 's action is yet another forceful move in its attempts to alleviate the liquidity crunch and to shore up a rapidly weakening economy , " said Arun Raha , senior economist at Swiss Re .
As the economy worsens , banks and financial institutions are calling in loans and becoming increasingly reluctant to lend money , particularly to borrowers considered to be high risk .
Bear Stearns got into trouble when other banks refused to lend it money over fears that it had too many bad debts due to the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
" There can be no health in the economy until the banking system is working properly , " said K Daniel Libby at Sands Brother Select Access Fund .
Inflation concerns
The Fed expressed some concern about inflation in the statement that accompanied the interest decision .
Analysts said this could signal that an end to the current cycle of rate cut cycle was fast approaching .
" The economy is in , or close to , a recession , but increasing oil prices have kept inflationary pressures from abating , complicating the Fed 's task , " said Mr Raha .
US producer prices , released on Tuesday , rose by 0.3 % in February compared to the month before , but a key measure of producer core inflation rose by 0.5 % , the fastest pace in well over a year .
There were also signs of opposition inside the Fed to the aggressive moves .
Two members of the central bank 's rate - setting Federal Open Market Committee voted for a smaller cut in rates .
" By cutting 75 points rather than 100 points , the Fed sought to restore leadership over the market and indicate that its actions would not be entirely dictated by market expectations , " the Bank of New York said .

Hands down the worst show / comedian in the history of television / comedy .
Carlos Mencia does for comedy what the holocaust did for the jews , except the holocaust was n't as brutal , it made more sense , and was slightly less of a crime against humanity .
Carlos Mencia 's jokes have no range outside of weak observations about race , nor do they contain an ounce of originality .
When I talk about the show being a horrendous atrocity , I 'm not reffering to the show being overly racist , in fact that has almost nothing to do with it .
It 's the constructs of the jokes themselves .
They 're pitiful attempts at humor .
They lack any kind of intelligence whatsoever , so little in fact , that his comedy is barely one notch above a clown slipping on a banana peel .
80 % of his jokes do n't even have a punch line , they are just stereotypes examined to the point of obscurity .
The following paragraph is specifically for Carlos ... Yelling a joke does n't make it funnier .
Doing little twitches while telling a joke does n't make it funnier .
Pointing at the camera or various people in the audience does n't make it funnier .
Laughing hysterically at your own jokes does n't make them funnier .
Relying on stereotypes for 99.8 % of your material does n't make you funnier .
Having your own show does n't make you funny .
Your not funny , nor are you by any means a respected comedian , but rather , you are a commercialized joke , a fat vulture feeding on the remains of the Chappelle show .
Perhaps when you take the time to construct a joke coherently , rather than fall back on " in - yo - face " - ity , will you truly know what it means to be a comedian .
What 's that you say , Carlos speaks the truth ?
He 's brave for saying what we 're all thinking and people just need to lighten up ?
Well then I have good news for all you Mencia fans :
We can all be Carlos Mencia !
Its easier than you think .
Just take a sterotypical topic ( like Asian drivers , Black people eating watermelon , or mexicans mowing lawns ) and yell it while doing a little dance HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED ASIANS CAN'T DRIVE !!!
DEE DEE DEE !!!!
See ?
Was n't that easy ?
I hope there are enough time slots and paychecks at Comedy Central for all of us .
Mind of Mencia 's abnormal success is a dark glimpse into the comedic mind of the American majority ( although we all know tv rating systems are inaccurate ) .
To put it simply , it is simplistic , it is comedy ( dare I even use that word to describe it ) that requires no thinking , intelligence , or taste .
The next time you laugh at his quote - unquote " jokes " , ask yourself why your laughing .
Is it content that is essentially clever and humorous , or is it an exploitation of obvious stereotypes that any person with half a brain can concieve ?
WASHINGTON  Cindy McCain , the wife of the Republican presumptive nominee for president , has sold off at least $ 2 million she held in funds with investments in Sudan businesses .
The mutual funds  American Funds Europacific Growth and American Funds Capital World Growth and Income  have investments in companies with business in Sudan , according to the Sudan Divestment Task Force , an advocacy organization that has been working to persuade states , universities and other organizations to divest .
“ As soon as she was made aware , she sold it , ” said Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the McCain campaign .
“ Senator and Mrs. McCain are committed to doing everything possible to end the genocide in Darfur . ”
Both funds were listed by her husband , Senator John McCain , on his financial disclosure forms .
The investments and the divestiture were first reported by The Associated Press , and confirmed by the McCain campaign .

To test this idea , Dr. Brennan traveled to Alaska .
Many species of waterfowl breed there , with a wide range of mating systems .
Working with Kevin McCracken of the University of Alaska and his colleagues , she caught and dissected 16 species of ducks and geese , comparing the male and female anatomy .
If a male bird had a long phallus , the female tended to have a more elaborate lower oviduct .
And if the male had a small phallus , the female tended to have a simple oviduct .
“ The correlation was incredibly tight , ” Dr. Brennan said .
“ When you dissected one of the birds , it was really easy to predict what the other sex was going to look like . ”
Dr. Brennan and her colleagues are publishing their study Tuesday in the journal PLOS One .
Dr. McCracken , who discovered the longest known bird phallus on an Argentine duck in 2001 , is struck by the fact that it was a woman who discovered the complexity of female birds .
“ Maybe it ’s the male bias we all have , ” he said .
“ It ’s just been out there , waiting to be discovered . ”
Dr. Brennan argues that elaborate female duck anatomy evolves as a countermeasure against aggressive males .
“ Once they choose a male , they ’re making the best possible choice , and that ’s the male they want siring their offspring , ” she said .
“ They do n’t want the guy flying in from who knows where .
It makes sense that they would develop a defense . ”
Female ducks seem to be equipped to block the sperm of unwanted males .
Their lower oviduct is spiraled like the male phallus , for example , but it turns in the opposite direction .
Dr. Brennan suspects that the female ducks can force sperm into one of the pockets and then expel it .
“ It only makes sense as a barrier , ” she said .
To support her argument , Dr. Brennan notes studies on some species that have found that forced matings make up about a third of all matings .
Yet only 3 percent of the offspring are the result of forced matings .
“ To me , it means these females are successful with this strategy , ” she said .
Dr. Brennan suspects that when the females of a species evolved better defenses , they drove the evolution of male phalluses .
“ The males have to step up to produce a longer or more flexible phallus , ” she said .
Amnesty International has graded Twitter on progress to keep women safe on platform

Perhaps the word “ Tanked ” is too strong … but it could indeed apply here .
Will Ferrell ’s new film “ Semi Pro ” ( you can read Doug ’s review of it here ) is on pace to be one of his worst opening weekend ’s in his career .
The folks over at Yahoo News give us this :
“ Semi - Pro , ” in which the comedian plays the flamboyant owner of an underdog team in the now - defunct American Basketball Association , opened at No. 1 with estimated earnings of $ 5.45 million on Friday , tracking firm Box Office Mojo said .
It is on track to earn about $ 14 million for the Friday - to - Sunday period , based on the multiples for his last two sports spoofs , 2007 ’s “ Blades of Glory ” and 2006 ’s “ Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby . ”
Industry observers had expected “ Semi - Pro ” to open above $ 20 million for the weekend .
There are films out ther that would kill for $ 15 million on opening weekend … but not many studio wide releases .
To put it in more context , the last 2 Ferrell films opened much stronger :
Blades of Glory – $ 33 million
Talladega Nights – $ 47 million
So the question that has to be asked is … why was the opening weekend of this Ferrell film so weak ?
I think there are three things that have to be looked at .
The “ R ” rating , early bad reviews and finally , people getting tired of Will Ferrell .
1 ) R rating
There can be no doubt that this had an impact on the final numbers .
Both Blades and Nights had the more age inclusive PG - 13 rating which opened the theaters to a few more people that just could n’t get into Semi Pro.
Ferrell ’s comedy does seem to target juvenile minds ( mine included ) .
However , I really do n’t think this was that big of a factor .
2 ) Early bad reviews
Word got out early that this film was n’t all that good .
Ferrell has some classics in his stable of films , but this on did n’t get much pop from wither critics or those seeing early screenings .
However , Ferrell is one of those guys who is pretty much critic proof , and I do n’t think early bad word of mouth kept anyone away who was already intent on seeing it .
I ’m sure it had an effect … but I do n’t think it was the major culprit .
3 ) Getting tired of Will Ferrell ’s schtick
Let ’s face it , in all of his sports comedies so far ( Blades , Nights , Semi Pro… heck let ’s throw in Anchorman and just about every other film of his )
Ferrell plays the exact same person every single time .
And no matter how funny a joke is , after you hear it for the 5th time you stop laughing .
All of Ferrells high profile flick are essentially the exact same movie and I ’ve been saying for some time now the general public is getting tired of it .
Where is that great comedic diversity we know Ferrell is capable of that he so often used during his days on SNL ?
The man is one of the best pure comedic performers of our age , but he ’s been stuck in the is same character rut for the last 5 years .
So what do you think ?
Do you agree with my assessment , or do you think there are other reasons for the poor performance of Semi Pro ?

Senator Karen Johnson Blasts Congress for Failure to Defend U.S .
In a formal Floor speech in the Arizona Senate tomorrow ( Tuesday , June 10 ) , Senator Karen S. Johnson plans to blast Congress for their failure to defend U.S. citizens who were killed on September 11 , 2001 , and their failure to properly investigate those attacks .
“ It has been nearly seven years , ” says Johnson , “ and we are faced with new evidence that turns the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission upside down .
We are fighting a war because of 9/11 – and we still do n’t really know what happened .
We have spent billions of dollars on the war , with an additional $ 340 million per day .
Thousands of U.S. servicemen and women have lost their lives , not to mention the lives of innocent Iraqi and Afghan civilians . ”
Johnson revealed in a committee hearing in April that she did not accept the official report of the 9/11 Commission and has since defended supporters calling for a new independent investigation of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
“ Ground Zero was treated like little more than the site of a building demolition – which , of course , is exactly what it was , ” says Johnson .
“ Everyone who has studied it recognizes that the Twin Towers and Building 7 came down as a result of controlled explosions – not because of the airplanes and fires . ”
Johnson has joined forces with local 9/11 activists who for more than two weeks have been staging a protest outside the Phoenix office of presidential candidate U.S. Senator John McCain .
One protestor , college professor Blair Gadsby of Scottsdale , began a hunger strike on May 26 to bring attention to the need for Congress to re-open the investigation into 9/11 .
Gadsby plans to fast until Senator McCain agrees to meet with experts who will present evidence that the WTC buildings came down through controlled demolition .
Tomorrow will be Day 16 of the Hunger Strike .
Senator Johnson has invited Gadsby to the Senate to listen to her Floor speech .
“ The U.S. government is constantly interfering with states in matters that are none of its business , ” said Johnson .
“ Yet when it comes to the one really significant job the Constitution assigns to the government -- defending our nation – the federal government failed miserably .
Not only did they fail to put up any sort of a defense after the first plane struck the North Tower ( Tower 1 ) , but they failed to mobilize the air defense system , they failed to protect the President , who sat reading in a public school for 20 minutes while the attacks continued , and they failed to defend our most important military installation – the Pentagon .
The public is sick to death of do - nothing politicians in Congress who forget what their job is the minute they arrive in Washington .
Finding out what happened on 9/11 and bringing the perpetrators to justice is the job of Congress and the Executive branch .
We need to know what happened to Building 7 .
We need to get answers to the many unanswered questions that still exist .
We need an investigation – especially of the new evidence .
It ’s time for Congress and our President to act . ”

貧しい労働者がマッチョなミリタリズムやファンダメンタリズムへ同調するのは、社会構造に起因する
理不尽な扱いを受けることで痛めつけられた自尊心を、最も簡単に回復する方法が、自分より「弱い者」「劣る者」を「発見」して彼らに理不尽な攻撃を浴びせること
アメリカ民主党の大統領候補氏の「失言」が波紋を呼んでいるという。オバマ氏がペンシルベニア州予備選を前に「ペンシルベニアの田舎町の人々は、、（その反動で）」と発言していたことが明らかになり（朝日新聞2008/04/14 20:03、太字強調は引用者による）、共和党やヒラリー・クリントン候補陣営が労働者を差別していると攻撃しているという。私は別にオバマ氏の支持者ではなく、そのポピュリストぶりを警戒しているくらいだが、くだんの発言は事実を指摘しただけで、どこが「失言」なのかさっぱりわからない。オバマ氏の発言は、ことを示唆している。労働者が「銃や宗教」に「執着」するのは、彼らが愚かだからだとか、本質的に暴力的だからだなどと言ったのならば、あからさまな侮蔑と差別だが、彼らがそうならざるをえない要因を不安定な雇用に求めているのは、全くもって正しい。エリート意識丸出しどころか、冷静な社会認識で、オバマ氏を見直したくらいである。オバマ発言はそのまま日本社会の排外主義風潮にも当てはまる。経済のグローバル化で、現実に人件費の低い中国企業との競争を強いられたり、低賃金の外国人労働者との「賃下げ競争」を強いられたりしていることが、特にアジア諸国の人々への差別意識の温床になっている。また、雇用や福祉の不安定化が「強い力」に対する潜在的な被保護要求を呼び起こし、ナショナリズムへの同調要因になっている。そして何より、生活のさまざまな場でである。ナショナリズムは「非国民」や外国人を「劣る者」とみなし、ただ「自国人」であるというだけで何も努力せずとも自尊心を高めることができる「魔法」である。「嫌韓」「嫌中」に走るのは、それくらいしか自己の生を確認する術がないからである。搾取と収奪はカネやモノのみならず人間性をも喪失させる。劣悪な環境にいれば思考も劣化する。逆に劣悪な雇用環境を変えることは、「銃や宗教」から人々を切り離すことにつながる。オバマ発言は、安定雇用の確立が狂信的なファンダメンタリズムを弱めるためにも急務であることを示唆している。《追記
2008/04/17》本稿に対する「はてなブックマーク」で、「グローバリズムは『自国民』や愛国主義者を『劣る者』とみなし、ただ「反差別主義者」であるというだけで何も努力せずとも自尊心を高めることができる『魔法』である。ブーメラン（笑）」というツッコミ（？）があったが、全く本稿の趣旨を理解していないと言わざるをえない。まず、このコメントは「グローバリズム」＝「反差別主義」とみなし、なおかつ「ナショナリズム」と対立関係にあると捉えているが、実際のグローバリズムは本質的に「弱肉強食」で差別があり、しかも現在のナショナリズムはグローバルな競争を勝ち抜くために国民統合を図る「手段」でもあるので、両者は必ずしも対抗関係にはない。さらに、仮に「グローバリズム」を「反ナショナリズム」と置き換えてもこのコメントはおかしい。反ナショナリストはナショナリストを「自国民」だからという理由で批判しているわけではない。また「日本人」は「日本人」として生まれれば何もしなくても「日本人」でいられるが、「反差別主義者」は「反差別主義者」になろうと努力しないとなれない。故にこの点では決して「ブーメラン」にはなりえないのである。こんなつまらないコメントについ反応して貴重な時間を無駄にしてしまった・・・（泣）。
Blue Planet in Green Shackles
Presentation of the book " Blue Planet in Green Shackles " , National Press Club , Washington D.C. , 27 .
May , 2008
It is a great pleasure to be here .
Let me thank all those who helped to make the English translation and publication of my book " Blue Planet in Green Shackles " possible , especially Fred Smith and his Competitive Enterprise Institute , and those who co-organized the presentation of it in this very prestigious place .
I am really excited to finally hold in my hands - after the Czech , German and Dutch editions - the English version of my book .
The authors often claim that their books speak for themselves .
I cautiously agree and will , therefore , speak not about the book itself but about my motivations to write it .
To make my position and my message clear , I should probably revoke my personal experience .
My today 's thinking is substantially influenced by the fact that I spent most of my life under the communist regime which ignored and brutally violated human freedom and wanted to command not only the people but also the nature .
To command " wind and rain " is one of the famous slogans I remember since my childhood .
This experience taught me that freedom and rational dealing with the environment are indivisible .
It formed my relatively very sharp views on the fragility and vulnerability of free society and gave me a special sensitivity to all kinds of factors which may endanger it .
I do not , however , live in the past and do not see the future threats to free society coming from the old and old - fashioned communist ideology .
The name of the new danger will undoubtedly be different , but its substance will be very similar .
There will be the same attractive , to a great extent pathetic and at first sight quasi - noble idea that transcends the individual in the name of something above him , ( of something greater than his poor self ) , supplemented by enormous self - confidence on the side of those who stand behind it .
Like their predecessors , they will be certain that they have the right to sacrifice man and his freedom to make their idea reality .
In the past it was in the name of the masses ( or of the Proletariat ) , this time in the name of the Planet .
Structurally , it is very similar .
I see the current danger in environmentalism and especially in its strongest version , climate alarmism .
Feeling very strongly about it and trying to oppose it was the main reason for putting my book together , originally in Czech language , in the spring of 2007 .
It has also been the driving force behind my active involvement in the current Climate Change Debate and behind my being the only head of state who in September 2007 at the UN Climate Change Conference in New York City openly and explicitly challenged the undergoing global warming hysteria .
My central concern is - in a condensed form - captured in the subtitle of this book .
I ask : " What is Endangered : Climate or Freedom ? "
My answer is : " it is our freedom . "
I may also add " and our prosperity " .
The book was written by an economist who happens to be in a high political position .
I do n't deny my basic paradigm , which is the " economic way of thinking " , because I consider it an advantage , not a disadvantage .
By stressing that , I want to say that the Climate Change Debate in a wider and the only relevant sense should be neither about several tenths of a degree of Fahrenheit or Celsius , about the up or down movements of sea level , about the depths of ice at North and Southern Pole , nor about the variations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
The real debate should be about costs and benefits of alternative human actions , about how to rationally deal with the unknown future , about what kind and size of solidarity with much wealthier future generations is justified , about the size of externalities and their eventual appropriate " internalization " , about how much to trust the impersonal functioning of the markets in solving any human problem , including global warming and how much to distrust the very visible hand of very human politicians and their bureaucrats .
Some of these questions are touched upon in my book .
My deep frustration has been exponentially growing in recent years by witnessing the fact that almost everything has already been said , that all rational arguments have been used and that global warming alarmism is still marching on .
It could be even true that " We are now at the stage where mere facts , reason , and truth are powerless in the face of the global warming propaganda " ( R. McKittrick , private correspondence ) .
We are regretfully behind it .
The whole process is already in the hands of those who are not interested in rational ideas and arguments .
It is in the hands of climatologists and other related scientists who are highly motivated to look in one direction only because a large number of academic careers has evolved around the idea of man-made global warming .
It is , further , in the hands of politicians who maximize the number of votes they seek to get from the electorate .
It is also - as a consequence of political decisions - in the hands of bureaucrats of national and more often of international institutions who try to maximize their budgets and years of careers as well regardless the costs , truth and rationality .
It is in the hands of rent - seeking businesspeople who are - given the existing policies - interested in the amount of subsidies they are receiving and look for all possible ways to escape the for them often merciless , but for the rest of us very positive , general welfare enhancing functioning of free markets .
An entire industry has developed around the funds the firms are getting from the government .
The basic questions of the current climate change debate are sufficiently known and well - structured :
1 ) Do we live in an era of a statistically significant , non-accidental and noncyclical climate change ?
2 ) If so , is it dominantly man-made ?
3 ) If so , should such a moderate temperature increase bother us more than many other pressing problems we face and should it receive our extraordinary attention ?
4 ) If we want to change the climate , can it be done ?
Are current attempts to do so the best allocation of our scarce resources ?
My answer to all these questions is NO , but with a difference in emphasis .
I do n't aspire to measure the global temperature , nor to estimate the importance of factors which make it .
This is not the area of my comparative advantages .
But to argue , as it's done by many contemporary environmentalists , that these questions have already been answered with a consensual " yes " and that there is an unchallenged scientific consensus about this is unjustified .
It is also morally and intellectually deceptive .
Václav Klaus is President of the Czech Republic .
He has spent two decades and nearly $ 20 million in a quest to fly to the upper reaches of the atmosphere with a helium balloon , just so he can jump back to earth again .
Now , Michel Fournier says , he is ready at last .
Depending on the weather , Fournier , a 64 - year - old retired French army officer , will attempt what he is calling Le Grand Saut ( The Great Leap ) on Sunday from the plains of northern Saskatchewan .
He intends to climb into the pressurized gondola of the 650 - foot balloon , which resembles a giant jellyfish , and make a two - hour journey to 130,000 feet .
At that altitude , almost 25 miles up , Fournier will see both the blackness of space and the curvature of the earth .
Then he plans to step out of the capsule , wearing only a special space suit and a parachute , and plunge in a mere 15 minutes , experiencing weightlessness along the way .
NASA scientists are pretty excited about the initial results of the Phoenix Mars lander 's " flawless " first wet chemistry experiment which has revealed the Red Planet 's soil to be " a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica " , as wet chemistry lead investigator Sam Kounaves put it .
With 80 per cent of said test - carried out in the Microscopy , Electrochemistry , and Conductivity Analyzer ( MECA ) - done and dusted , Kounaves explained : " The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking .
At this specific location , one - inch into the surface layer , the soil is very basic , with a pH of between eight and nine .
We also found a variety of components of salts that we have n't had time to analyze and identify yet , but that include magnesium , sodium , potassium and chloride .
" This is more evidence for water because salts are there .
We also found a reasonable number of nutrients , or chemicals needed by life as we know it .
Over time , I 've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world , but that in many aspects , like mineralogy , it 's very much like Earth . "
So much so , in fact , that Kounaves suggested future colonists might be able to use the Martian dirt around Phoenix ( seen above at the tip of the Robotic Arm scoop ) " to grow asparagus very well " .
While the alkalinity of the soil sample will please asparagonauts , it 'll come as a blow to strawberry - loving interplanetary gardeners , since the fruit requires somwhat more acidity .
However , NASA notes that elsewhere on the Martian surface may prove suitable for future cultivation of Wimbledon 's favourite punnet - filler . *
Elsewhere on Phoenix , meanwhile , the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) has " baked its first soil sample to 1,000 °C ( 1,800 °F ) " , and scientists have " begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make - up of soil and ice " .
Lead TEGA boffin , William Boynton of the University of Arizona , described the preliminary results coming out of the test as " spectacular " , although complete analysis will take several weeks .
He said : " At this point , we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past .
We do n't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region , or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust . " ®
Bootnote
* Indeed , we can imagine this exchange at Wimbledon 2043 : " Ten thousand quid for a punnet of strawberries ?
You must be bloody joking . "
" Yeah , well love , these are yer top - notch Martian strawberries - three quid a crate at source , but the transport costs are astronomical ... "
Thames baby : Rescuer tells of harrowing moment he saw a tiny hand in the water
The full horror of a couple 's desperate struggle to save a drowning baby was revealed yesterday as the little girl lost her fight for life .
Police named the ten - month - old as Monica Parsons , who had fallen into the Thames with her mother and three - year - old sister .
Last night her parents Maria , 38 , and Nigel , a 44 - year - old financier , were trying to come to terms with how their youngest daughter was brought ' back from the dead ' only to succumb later in hospital .
Frantic : John
West , who was boating with his wife Sue , spotted the baby girl 's hand in the water and rescued her limp body from the fast - flowing river
Police had announced Monica 's death after doctors gave up hope , but two hours later hospital staff found a faint pulse .
Cruelly , 12 hours after that , Monica passed away just before midnight on Wednesday .
Yesterday , John and Sue West , who were on a boating holiday , told how they spotted the baby 's hand poking above the surface of the Thames at Goring , Oxfordshire .
Tragic : Forensic teams work near to where the family fell in the river .
The baby girl died overnight after initially staging a miraculous recovery
A police forensic photographer carries evidence bags , including one containing a baby 's buggy , away from the scene
Mr West , 55 , a music lecturer and a first aid teacher , said : ' At first we heard a screech and we thought it was an animal , then we heard a woman screaming and shouting , " Help !
My baby , my baby ! " .
' We saw her in the water , by the bank , holding a toddler in her arms ' She was in shock and we were asking her , " Is there another child ? " .
Then we saw a tiny hand floating in the river about ten yards away .
' I threw on a life jacket and dived into the water .
I pulled the baby out and I swam with her , holding her up .
I held her in one hand and grabbed a branch with my other hand .
' I'm a really strong swimmer butthe current was fierce .
The baby was blue and I recognised her as going into hypothermia .
' There were no signs of life whatsoever and I could not administer any CPR at all because , if I had , I would have had to let go of the branch I was holding and we would have both gone under . '
He added there was fluid leaking from the girl 's nose and mouth .
Drama :
The incident happened at Goring - on - Thames , Oxfordshire , just yards from George Michael 's house ( pictured )
From the deep :
An officer holds what may be a toy
His wife said Mrs Parsons , who is Spanish , could not explain what had happened .
She was walking with her youngest two daughters shortly after her eldest , Sylvia , five , was dropped off at primary school .
The Parsons live half a mile from the scene of the tragedy in a £ 1.5 million detached four - bedroom house in Streatley - on - Thames , opposite Mr Parson 's parents Peter and Margaret .
They were all too upset to comment last night .
Mr Parsons is the director or vicepresident of 64 companies , mainly specialising in technology .
Parents at the Streatley Church of England Primary School attended by Sylvia were told of the death as they dropped off their children .
Headmistress Jill Hopgood said : ' We are a small village school and a tragedy such as this is felt by the entire community .
' Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and we are working closely with the children to comfort them and help them come to terms with what has happened . '
Congress adopted a nationwide 55 mph speed limit law during the oil embargo of the 1970s and threatened to withhold highway funding for any state that did n't comply .
It repealed the law 13 years ago , when oil was cheap and gas plentiful .
But with prices going through the roof and everyone worried about global warming , there are increasing calls for Congress to bring back the double - nickel speed limit .
Advocacy groups like drive55.orgsay rolling the speed limit back to 55 will save fuel , reduce pollution and save lives .
It seems logical , but not everyone is convinced slower speeds bring any real benefit , and the debate is heating up .
" Sheer physics tell you lower speeds equal better fuel economy , fewer injuries and lower emissions , " said Justin McNaull , director of state relations for AAA .
" But what happens when you change the speed limit is a little less clear . "
It depends upon who you want to believe .
Connecticut adopted the nation 's first vehicular speed limit 107 years ago today - setting the maximum speed at 12 in the city and 15 in the country - and people have been ignoring them ever since .
Congress set the limit at 55 mph under the National Maximum Speed Law of 1974 .
The law was repealed 19 years later and the states allowed to set their own limits .
Most of them bumped it up to 65 mph , although some went to 75 mph and there are stretches of highway in west Texas where you can cruise at 80 .
The U.S. Department of Energy says gas mileage plummets above 60 mph and says every 5 mph above that speed is akin to paying an additional $ 0.20 per gallon for gas .
But the American Heritage Foundation claims 12 years of 55 mph speed limits cut fuel consumption by just 1 percent .
After Congress repealed the National Maximum Speed Law and 33 states raised their speed limits , the Cato Institute said traffic deaths dropped to a record low .
More than fuel economy and traffic deaths are at stake now .
" Emissions increase pretty appreciably above
55 , " McNaull says .
drive55.org claims Washington state would cut CO2 emissions by 10 percent if it cut its 70 mph speed limit by 15 mph .
But even here , the evidence is debated .
The Automobile Association in England claims reducing the speed limit from 30 mph to 20 on residential roads would increase CO2 emission by more than 10 % .
drive55.org also says the average speed people travel on the highway has been rising for 20 years .
McNaull notes that advances in vehicle deign , such as better windows and sound proofing have changed peoples ' sense of how fast they 're going , which is one reason people regularly exceed the posted speed limit .
" Doing 60
mph in a 2008 vehicle feels a lot different than in the vehicles our grandparents drove . "

Residential applications for solar panels have been making news for several years .
But as rising fuel prices spur consumers to look for alternate energy sources , another clean power source is beginning to get attention : wind energy .
Even though the residential wind power sector has seen tremendous growth over the last decade , an article in The Arizona Republic estimates that there are still only 4,000 residential wind turbines nationwide .
The primary reason that wind energy has been slow to take hold is that wind turbines are fairly visible , and therefore highly controversial , installations .
According to the American Wind Energy Association , small wind systems ( 100 kilowatts or less ) need to be at least 30 feet above barriers which might break the force of the air currents reaching the turbine .
Right now , the industry recommends wind turbines only for sites that are at least one 1 acre in size .
Consequently , wind turbines in urban areas are still quite rare .
( In a September 2007 post , earth2tech featured a San Francisco home which sports a turbine , and pointed out that this may be the first urban wind turbine in the country . )
Unfortunately , individual efforts to experiment with wind power , even in outlying areas , have encountered a lot of roadblocks .
Proposed turbine installations are usually evaluated by local governments on a case by case basis , since most city zoning laws have height restrictions which would implicitly prohibit turbines .
Oftentimes , even if permission is granted and a turbine is erected , neighbors unite to fight the decision .
( For individual turbine projects that have made news for seeking exceptions to local codes , see these articles on Wayne , New Jersey and Atlanta , Georgia ) .
Some locales are at last beginning to address this issue in a more systematic way .
In a Green Building Elements article last week , Philip Proefrock cited Chicago as an example of a city that has amended its building code to allow rooftop wind turbines .
Similarly , San Francisco ’s mayor recently formed a “ Residential Wind Power Work Group , ” which will research the feasibility of urban wind power installations and make recommendations on changes to local building and zoning codes .
The Denver Post reported in January that the Denver City Council had enacted an ordinance that would significantly ease restrictions on commercial wind generators but would also give homeowners a break on property line setbacks from the current 20 feet to 10 feet .
Even some small communities seem to be taking a proactive stance by agreeing to examine local codes .
Blaine County Commissioners in central Idaho recently agreed to look into changing their zoning laws .
According to an article in the Idaho Mountain Express last month , this valley area is not particularly suited for utility - scale wind farms , but many homeowners have indicated an interest in supplementing their own power systems .
In a February article in the Casper Star - Tribune , Natrona County , Wyoming , has also declared its support for residential wind power , although changes to the zoning rules have not yet taken effect .
See these sites for more information on small scale wind power generators :

Not every project was like Cabrini - Green .
Dixie Homes was a complex of two - and three - story brick buildings on grassy plots .
It was , by all accounts , claustrophobic , sometimes badly maintained , and occasionally violent .
But to its residents , it was , above all , a community .
Every former resident I spoke to mentioned one thing : the annual Easter - egg hunt .
Demonizing the high - rises has blinded some city officials to what was good and necessary about the projects , and what they ultimately have to find a way to replace : the sense of belonging , the informal economy , the easy access to social services .
And for better or worse , the fact that the police had the address .
Better policing , better - connected to new residential patterns , is a step in the right direction .
Janikowski believes the chaos can be controlled with information and technology , and he ’s been helping the department improve both for several years .
This spring he helped launch a “ real - time crime center , ” in the hope of making the department more nimble .
Twenty - four hours a day , technicians plot arrests on giant screens representing the city ’s geography , in a newly built studio reminiscent of CNN ’s newsroom .
Cops on the dots is the national buzzword for this kind of information - driven , rapid - response policing , and it has an alluring certainty about it .
The changes seem to be making a difference ; recent data show violent - crime rates in the city beginning to inch down .
In the long view — both Betts and Janikowski agree — better policing is of course not the only answer .
The more fundamental question is the one this social experiment was designed to address in the first place :
What to do about deep poverty and persistent social dysfunction ?
Betts ’s latest crusade is something called “ site - based resident services . ”
When the projects came down , the residents lost their public - support system — health clinics , child care , job training .
Memphis ’s infant - mortality rate is rising , for example , and Betts is convinced that has something to do with poor people ’s having lost easy access to prenatal care .
The services remained downtown while the clients scattered all over the city , many of them with no convenient transportation .
Along with other nonprofit leaders , Betts is trying to get outreach centers opened in the outlying neighborhoods , and especially in some of the new , troubled apartment buildings .
She says she ’s beginning to hear supportive voices within the city government .
But not enough leaders have acknowledged the new landscape — or admitted that the projects are gone in name only , and that the city ’s middle - class dreams never came true .
And beyond this , what ?
The social services Betts is recommending did not lift masses of people out of poverty in the projects .
Perhaps , outside the projects , they will help people a little more .
But perhaps not .
The problems of poverty run so deep that we ’re unlikely to know the answer for a generation .
Social scientists tracking people who are trying to improve their lives often talk about a “ weathering effect , ” the wearing - down that happens as a lifetime of baggage accumulates .
With poor people , the drag is strong , even if they have n’t lived in poverty for long .
Kids who leave poor neighborhoods at a young age still have trouble keeping up with their peers , studies show .
They catch up for a while and then , after a few years , slip back .
Truly escaping poverty seems to require a will as strong as a spy ’s : you have to disappear to a strange land , forget where you came from , and ignore the suspicions of everyone around you .
Otherwise , you can easily find yourself right back where you started .

Korean computer engineers are introducing a new digital music format that has separate controls on the sound volume for each musical instrument , such as guitar , drum , base and voice -- an ideal tool for music lovers of different tastes as well as karaoke fans .
The new format , which has a file extension format of MT9 and a commercial title of Music 2.0 , is poised to replace the popular MP3 file format as the de facto standard of the digital music source , its inventors say .
The MT9 technology was first conceived by Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute ( ETRI ) and is being shaped into commercial use by venture company Audizen .
It was selected as a candidate item for the new digital music standard at a regular meeting of Motion Picture Experts Group ( MPEG ) , the international body of the digital music and video industry , held in France late April .
`` We made presentations to the participants and they were all surprised to see it .
They immediately voted to make it a candidate for the digital music standard , '' said Ham Seung - chul , chief of Audizen .
He is expecting it will be formerly selected as an international standard in the MPEG forum 's next meeting to be held in Germany June .
The distinctive feature of MT9 format is that it has a six - channel audio equalizer , with each channel dedicated to voice , chorus , piano , guitar , base and drum .
For example , if a user turns off the voice channel , it becomes a karaoke player .
Or one can turn off all the instruments and concentrate on the voice of the main singer as if he or she is singing a cappella .
Ham says that the music industry should change its attitude to the market as music is becoming a digital service , rather than a physical product .
MT9 is the ideal fit for the next generation of music business because it can be used for multiple services and products , such as iPhones , PCs , mobile phones and karaoke bars , he says .
Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics are both interested in equipping their mobile phones with an MT9 player and their first commercial products are likely to debut early next year , he said .
If selected as an international format , the MT9 technology can earn big for both Audizen and ETRI , a governmental research institute .
ETRI said that it holds three international and six domestic patents for the technology and is planning to file two more this year .
The MT9 files are served in an album package .
Audizen is currently selling a limited choice of albums at 2,000 won to 3,000 won on its Web site .
More albums are being recorded in the format and even very old albums , such as Queen 's or Deulgookhwa's , can be made into MT9 files if they have a digitally re-mastered music source , Ham said .
Unlike other digital formats exclusively used by big companies such as SK Telecom , Audizen allows users to copy the MT9 files , making it a more attractive format .
`` It 's like having a CD or cassette tape .
Once you buy it , you can lend it to your friends .
We do n't want to be too fussy about DRM ( digital right management ) , '' he said .
DALLAS  Opponents of teaching evolution , in a natural selection of sorts , have gradually shed those strategies that have not survived the courts .
Over the last decade , creationism has given rise to “ creation science , ” which became “ intelligent design , ” which in 2005 was banned from the public school curriculum in Pennsylvania by a federal judge .
Now a battle looms in Texas over science textbooks that teach evolution , and the wrestle for control seizes on three words .
None of them are “ creationism ” or “ intelligent design ” or even “ creator . ”
The words are “ strengths and weaknesses . ”
Starting this summer , the state education board will determine the curriculum for the next decade and decide whether the “ strengths and weaknesses ” of evolution should be taught .
The benign - sounding phrase , some argue , is a reasonable effort at balance .
But critics say it is a new strategy taking shape across the nation to undermine the teaching of evolution , a way for students to hear religious objections under the heading of scientific discourse .
Already , legislators in a half - dozen states  Alabama , Florida , Louisiana , Michigan , Missouri and South Carolina  have tried to require that classrooms be open to “ views about the scientific strengths and weaknesses of Darwinian theory , ” according to a petition from the Discovery Institute , the Seattle - based strategic center of the intelligent design movement .

One of the best ways you can keep your business secure is by training staff so that they follow certain protocols .
For example , you may train them so that they go through a specific checklist before they close up for the day .
This checklist may cover tasks such as locking rooms or ‘ vaults , ’ thereby ensuring that no thieves can get in .
You might also train your staff so that they know how to make sure the alarm system is turned on .
2. Invest in the Correct Technology
Investing in the right technology is another way you can avoid business theft .
Such technology might include a CCTV system that allows you to have a video record of everything happening within your premises .
It ’s also worth noting that a CCTV system can also act as a deterrent .
That ’s because people may be less willing to commit a crime if they know it ’ll be captured on video .
Due to this , you should think about placing your cameras so that they ’re highly visible .
You might also want to consider investing in an alarm system that ’s designed specifically for businesses .
Such alarm systems will often automatically notify the police if a robbery is taking place .
These kinds of alarm systems can be expensive , but the expense is usually worth it when you consider the costs of a robbery .
3. Hire Security Staff
If you really want to keep your business secure , you may want to think about hiring some security staff .
If you adopt this approach , there are generally two paths you can go down .
The first is to hire staff that ’ll be present whenever the business is open and dealing with customers .
However , the other option is to hire security patrol staff that ’ll monitor the premises while the business is closed .
The option you go for will depend on your specific needs , and you may even find that combing these approaches works best for you .
Do You Know How to Keep Your Business Safe ?
If you know how to keep your business safe , you should be able to avoid the negative financial impact of a burglary .
You should review your approach to security regularly so that you can continually improve upon your strategy .
In doing so , you should be able to stay one step ahead of those that want to steal from your business .

TUCSON , Ariz .
- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has filled its first oven with Martian soil .
" We have an oven full , " Phoenix co-investigator Bill Boynton of the University of Arizona , Tucson , said today .
" It took 10 seconds to fill the oven .
The ground moved .
" Boynton leads the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer instrument , or TEGA , for Phoenix .
The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients , such as water .
The lander 's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called " Baby Bear " to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday , June 6 , which was 12 days after landing .
A screen covers each of TEGA 's eight ovens .
The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity , which is no wider than a pencil lead .
Each TEGA chute also has a whirligig mechanism that vibrates the screen to help shake small particles through .
Only a few particles got through when the screen on oven number 4 was vibrated on June 6 , 8 and 9 .
Boynton said that the oven might have filled because of the cumulative effects of all the vibrating , or because of changes in the soil 's cohesiveness as it sat for days on the top of the screen .
" There 's something very unusual about this soil , from a place on Mars we 've never been before , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona .
" We 're interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together . "
Plans prepared by the Phoenix team for the lander 's activities on Thursday , June 12 include sprinkling Martian soil on the delivery port for the spacecraft 's Optical Microscope and taking additional portions of a high - resolution color panorama of the lander 's surroundings .
The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith at the University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus , Denmark ; Max Planck Institute , Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

There are lots of women who are disappointed because they cannot get the person they want .
Sure , a few of these ladies remain in a relationship however they are not with the individual they wish to be with .
For others , they cannot be in a relationship because they are awaiting that man to see them .

Charlie Black 's statement that " certainly it would be a big advantage to " John McCain for American civilians to be slaughtered by international terrorists helps bring to the surface the central paradox of our times .
How reasonable is it to trust that a political movement will bring safety to the country when they themselves believe that doing so would ill - serve their interests ?
Insofar as representative democracy works as a system of government , the general idea is that politicians expect to be rewarded for good stuff happening and punished for bad stuff happening , and thus make some effort to try to see that good stuff rather than bad stuff happens .
The post -9/11 GOP upends that relationship , and you repeatedly see instances of conservatives openly yearning for disaster to strike on the theory that that 'll show the liberals or boost Republican electoral fortunes .
Meanwhile , if I were Barack Obama I 'd be trying to think of a plan to counter the fact that not only does al - Qaeda scaring people serve GOP interests , but Republicans keeping power also serves al - Qaeda 's interest in pushing the West into conflict with a broader circle of Muslims .
According to Ron Suskind , the CIA 's view was that bin Laden released a tape shortly before the 2004 election specifically in order to boost George W. Bush 's re-election fortunes and there 's no particular reason to think that that sort of tactic wo n't come back into play .

Piazza San Marco - Venezia St. Mark's Square Venice - Markuspladsen
There are 120,000 pigeons in Venice which is twice the amount of people .
They are a threat against the historic buildings and a rising danger to people by transferring parasites and bacteria .
Since 1997 feeding them has been a crime and is punished with a fine of 500 euros .
Except in St. Marc 's square where 18 licensed sellers of birdseed are permitted .
But this is now history .
From May 1 2008 it 's over .
Feeding the birds is now banned also on St Mark's

This really grinds my gears …
As reported here in the past , Mass Effect for PC contains a new type of SecuROM which will be present in all future EA / Maxis games .
What does it do ?
Not only does it install itself to your computer without a word of notification as well as disable your firewall , dvd drives and cd/ dvd burning software .
It limits you to installing your game on your PC up to 3 times .
This can be triggered via using up your 3 activations and each time you change a piece of hardware , reformat your computer or install / upgrade a new operating system , it takes up one of the activations .
This is proven to be true by a guy over at the Mass Effect forums .
He registered and started to play the game ( Activation # 1 ) .
Well , when he tried to play the game he had strange artifacts on his screen .
Thinking it was an OS - related issue , he reinstalled XP and reinstalled the game ( Activation # 2 ) .
Finding out that it did n’t help the problem , he soon figured out it was his graphics card struggling .
Well , he bought a brand new card and that solved the problem ( this triggers Activation # 3 ) .
Game ran fine for a short period of time ( 2 days ) and he played thru it and completed the game .
Well , a week after that , he decided he wanted to run thru the game again .
This is where he stumbles upon this error :
“ The game can not start .
For security reasons , only a limited number of machines can ever be licensed by a single purchase .
This limit has been reached .
Please purchase another registration code , reinstall , and then try again . ”
There is no doubt that EA will try to include this new version of SecuROM on Spore and possibly The Sims 3 …. and if it is , we are going to encounter some very serious problems .
Heck , I ca n’t even count the times I had to reinstall the games , upgrade my hardware and reformat …
You know , come to think of it …EA is doing this to prevent piracy of their games , but it ’s only hurting us legal customers .
Look at this :
If you are a Pirate :
BAD : You do have the same bugs that those with legal copies have , plus new ones depending on how the cracked copy was programmed .
You do have the same bugs that those with legal copies have , plus new ones depending on how the cracked copy was programmed .
GOOD : Unlimited Activations !

No SecuROM to deal with GOOD & BAD :
It ’s free , but illegal
If you are a Legal Customer :
BAD : Limited to 3 Activations

Honestly … what looks better to you ?

Just got a note from someone I trust that a massive QTL for IQ has been discovered , on the order of 10 points in effect for a substitution of the the major allele for the minor ( it 's additive and independent , so homozygote minor allele ~ 20 points greater than homozygote major allele ) .
The novel variant is found in an ethnic - religious minority population and no other phenotypic effects are discernble for those who carry the IQ boosting polymorphism .
Everything is very preliminary at this point ... but they 've checked and re-checked and this seems to be real .
There are two genes previous implicated in neurological pathologies in this region of the genome , so a molecular genetic & physiological story should be easy to extract .

Outstanding Guidelines on Drones You Need to Have
If you ’re looking to buy your first drone , you most definitely are not alone .
The US drone market recently ballooned to $ 5.8 billion a year , with exponential growth predicted in the years ahead .
Whether it ’s for personal photography projects , work - related activities , or just for fun , drones have become a must - have for millions of people around the world .
That being said , it is also a crowded field , with a huge number of companies now claiming to sell the best devices on the market .
That ’s why learning what the best indoor drone your money can buy requires some professional help .
Read this essential drones guide to find out which ones are the best on the market right now .
1. Holy Stone HS170
For anyone wondering ‘ what is a drone capable of in 2020 ? ’ , the Holy Stone HS170 should be able to answer your questions comprehensively .
This lightweight device regularly features on tech guides as the best indoor drone on the market right now , and it ’s not hard to see why .
With an intuitive controls system that makes it ideal for beginners and propeller guards that protect it from damage , this drone is hard to fault .
What ’s more , it can be charged via a standard USB port in 30 minutes , allowing for 8 hours of flight time .
Astonishingly , the drone retails for a mere $ 25 .
2. DJI Mavic Air
This one is most definitely for the more discerning drone pilot , given that it retails at $ 800 upwards .
However , you can quickly see where that money is going .
With a 360 - degree camera that takes flawless photos and videos in 4 K , this is one drone that can easily compete with the film industry devices that often sell for thousands of dollars apiece .
Another interesting drones info tidbit is that it also comes with inbuild object avoidance sensors , reducing the risk of a costly mid-flight crash .
3. Ryze Tech Tello
This beginner - level drone may not be as good value as the HS170 , retailing at $ 100 a pop , but it is hard to dispute that it offers serious value for money .
Weighing only 3 ounces and clocking in at 6×6 inches in size , this is one of the most compact devices on the market right now .
It can also be programmed with the e-learning software Scratch , meaning that the drone doubles up as a learning tool .
However , it ’s worth noting that the battery life for this one comes in at a measly 5 minutes , meaning that some users may find this one limiting .
4. Cheerson CX - 10
This tiny quadcopter drone , which measures just 5 cm in diameter , may well be the cheapest device on the market right now .
The Cheerson CX - 10 can be yours for as little as $ 16 .
If you know anything about drones at all , you ’ll know that this is a ridiculously low price .
This indoor drone comes fully equipped with LED lights for flying in the dark , as well as a three - gear anding system that makes this a breeze to fly for beginners .
In addition , the maximum flight time of 8 minutes is formidable for a drone of this size .

One Saturday morning earlier this month I was running an errand at the Barnes & Noble in the guts of Baltimore ’s Inner Harbor outdoor / indoor mall and though it was drizzling the streets and retail outlets were packed with baseball fans , the majority of whom were wearing Boston Red Sox t- shirts or caps .
The Sox were in town for a four - game series at Camden Yards against the Orioles and , as has been the custom since 2004 on such occasions , you could n’t walk 10 feet without hearing snippets of conversation from New Englanders on a short jaunt south , nattering about the pros and cons of area hotels , the cheaper prices in Baltimore and what an awful shortstop the reigning world champs have in Julio Lugo .
This was all fine by me : as a devoted Sox partisan I greatly enjoyed engaging the visitors , who , by and large , were exceedingly polite and revved up for the games , although some were perplexed by the dichotomy of my older son wearing a classic O’s hat with the cartoon bird and his younger brother sporting a red Coco Crisp shirt .
Frankly ,
Sox fans are on better behavior when they swarm the cities of opposing teams than at Boston ’s Fenway Park , where you can get your head bitten off for the slightest infraction .
What ’s different this season is that the Orioles faithful — put to a test worthy of Hercules since the team ’s last winning season in ‘ 97 — have , mostly , accepted that when Boston comes to town their Camden Yards is transformed into , as the local sportswriters say , “ Fenway South . ”
Mind you , O ’s owner Peter Angelos has never publicly complained about this spectacle — if you ’re at a concession stand during the game and the crowd roars , it ’s impossible to tell what team has scored — since he obviously prefers a sold - out stadium instead of 12,000 people showing up for a game against even strong teams like the Minnesota Twins .
Yet in a wholly unexpected twist , the rebuilding O’s , dismissed by almost everyone as a last - place team in April , have a winning record and are a real factor in the A.L.
East division race , just seven games out of first place as of this writing .
I watch a lot of O ’s games on television and a month ago it was really irritating to hear MASN broadcaster Gary Thorne repeat the mantra after another come - from - behind win by the seemingly rag - tag , no - name club , “ This team never quits . ”
Yet , although it ’s escaped the mainstream sports media ( on the June 22 Baseball Tonight , the O ’s - Brewers game was n’t even included in the hour - long wrap - up ) , I ’ve come to realize it ’s true .
Almost no lead , as the Houston Astros found out last week , is safe against the Birds .
The Tampa Bay Rays are hogging all the “ Cinderella team ” commentary in 2008 , with good reason since that historically wretched franchise is now a very legitimate contender for the postseason , but I ’d bet that when September comes the Orioles will have overtaken the young Rays in the standings .
O ’s manager Dave Trembley is n’t the flashiest guy in town , but I ’d agree with The Sun ’s Rick Maese that at least so far he has to be considered for Manager of the Year in the American League .
Maese says , “ [ I ] f you told me in the spring that the Orioles would above .500 in June , I ’d have immediately ordered whatever filled your glass .
Would ’ve made it a double even . ”
Ever heard of relievers Jim Johnson and Matt Albers ?
Maybe not , but I ’d sure like to have them in the Sox pen , letting veteran Mike Timlin retire with some dignity and not suffer any more immediate meltdowns on the mound .
Winning ballgames is a balm for fans , and maybe that ’s why people in Baltimore just shrug now when the bandwagon jumpers and pink - hatted ladies who comprise “ Red Sox Nation ” come to town .
( It also helps that attendance , suddenly , is surging . )
So what ’s the excuse for the spate of baseball columnists — exacerbated during inter-league play — who are apparently just realizing that the Sox , finally shorn of the “ lovable chokers ” label that the New England intelligentsia reveled in romanticizing for so many years , are , at least temporarily , a draw in whatever city they play ?
A week ago , The Philadelphia Inquirer ’s Bob Ford ranted about the interlopers who came to see the Sox play the Phillies in a three - game series at Citizens Bank Park , lamenting that the “ casual fans who [ want ] to glom on the gravy train ” were wreaking havoc in his city .
He wrote : “ Once , there was something appealing about the passion that that Boston fans brought to the team that had broken their hearts on such a regular basis …
The team offered a counterbalance to the corporate machine of the New York Yankees . ”
Hey , Bob , stick it up your ass .
As a Sox fan since the mid-60s when I was a squirt , there was nothing “ appealing ” about losing the World Series in ’ 67 , ’75 and , especially , in ’ 86 .
It sucked .
When the Yanks ’ Aaron Boone took Tim Wakefield deep in the seventh game of the ALCS in 2003 , I simply turned off the tube and went to bed , hardly surprised and certainly not “ heartbroken . ”
One of my nephews , who grew up not far from Fenway and went to Boston College , was devastated after the ’03 loss , which makes sense since he was a toddler when Bucky Dent became a household name in New England in 1978 .
I did n’t share his pain , and I doubt anyone who remembers Frank Malzone did either .
Anyway , Ford continued on about the “ cloying , self - important , pompous , overly loud ” Red Sox Nation ( an admittedly annoying term , although you ca n’t blame the current owners and marketing team for trying to squeeze out every last nickel they can ) , who have the audacity to root for Manny Ramirez instead of Ryan Howard .
“ There ’s nothing cuddly or cute about a team with a $ 133 million payroll .
You ca n’t be an underdog if you spend like the Kennedys .
[ T ]he Red Sox … who were once a cold - water walk - up on Kenmore Square , they are now a gated compound on the Cape . ”
Now , the Yanks , New York Mets and Detroit Tigers all have a higher payroll than the Sox , but since none of those teams have been well - acquainted with first place this season , I guess Ford gives them a pass .
And by the way , the Phils ’ payroll is also over $ 100 million .
Never mind that Phillies ’ fans are the worst I ’ve encountered — a family trip to Citizens Bank two years ago was marred by a drunk , his young daughter seated next to him , screaming obscenities at me for standing up when David Ortiz hit a double — since when is it unseemly for an owner to actually spend money and increase his team ’s chances of winning ?
The Cards came to Boston this past weekend ( and took two of three from the Sox ) , and it was an opportunity for Bernie Miklasz , of The St. Louis Post - Dispatch , to dump on fans of every single Boston franchise , chucking in some mild Irish slurs while he was at it .
He said , “ At first it was kind of cute .
When the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series at Busch Stadium , I was happy for their fans .
Boston is a passionate and traditional baseball town , and Red Sox Nation endured considerable angst throughout the decades … ”
Bernie ’s no longer amused , teeing off not only on Sox fans , but those of the Patriots and Celtics .
“ Hey , Sully — I did n’t see you kick the field goal .
That was Vinatieri .
So quit rolling around in the end zone .
Yo , Murph , yeah you in the Bird Jersey , bum - rushing the floor at the [ Boston ] Garden on Tuesday night when the Celtics destroyed the Lakers to win the NBA championship .
Yeah , you .
That ’s right .
You are n’t even Eddie Bird ( Larry ’s brother ) , so get off the basketball court and let the Celtics players celebrate .
They should rename Boston ’s ‘ Big Dig ’ and call it ‘ Dig Me ’ . ”
Enough , fellas .
Although personally I ’d like nothing better than for the Sox to build a dynasty to rival that of the Yanks in the 50s or late - 90s — and what fan of any team would n’t ?
— it ’s not likely .
Odds are that Red Sox Nation will have another couple of years as a sports economic powerhouse and then another team will capture the public ’s imagination .
And when that happens , I ’m looking forward to when the likes of Ford and Miklasz whine about the Orioles ’ juggernaut called “ Birdland ” from coast to coast
A group of Muslim workers allege they were fired by a New Brighton tortilla factory for refusing to wear uniforms that they say were immodest by Islamic standards .
Six Somali women claim they were ordered by a manager to wear pants and shirts to work instead of their traditional Islamic clothing of loose - fitting skirts and scarves , according to the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , a civil liberties group that is representing the women .
The women have filed a religious discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
" For these women , wearing tight - fitting pants is like being naked , " said Valerie Shirley , a spokeswoman for the Minnesota chapter of CAIR .
" It 's simply not an option . "
CAIR issued a press release calling on Mission Foods to reinstate the women in their jobs .
However , the group declined to disclose the names of the women and would not make them available for interviews Tuesday .
Gruma Corp. , the Irving , Texas - based parent company of Mission Foods , released a written statement Tuesday denying that any employees were terminated or disciplined at the New Brighton plant .
However , the company made clear the six women have been relieved of their responsibilities for the time being , and may ultimately lose their jobs if they do n't wear uniforms .
" Should these employees choose to adhere to the current Mission Foods uniform policy , they may return to their positions with the company , " the company statement said .
" However , these positions will need to be filled as soon as possible and cannot be held indefinitely . "
A company spokeswoman said she could not provide photographs of the uniforms .

DMX Slapped With Dogfighting , Drug Charges
The SWAT team arrested the rapper after he barricaded himself in his Ariz . home .
PHOENIX -- May 9 , 2008  -- Rapper DMX was arrested for the second time in a week Friday , this time after he was indicted on felony drug possession and misdemeanor animal cruelty charges .
A SWAT team with the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office raided DMX's north Phoenix home at about 3 a.m. to serve arrest and search warrants and take him into custody on the indictment , sheriff 's spokesman Capt .
Paul Chagolla said .
DMX , whose real name is Earl Simmons , tried to barricade himself in his bedroom as a SWAT team entered but then came out .
He made an initial court appearance Friday where bail was sent at $ 7,500 , said his local attorney , Cameron Morgan .
Morgan said he expected bail to be posted quickly .
The indictment stems from an August search of the rapper 's home prompted by reports of dogs being abused on his property .
Detectives seized 12 pit bull dogs and dug up the remains of three others on the rural property .
Detectives also said they found marijuana .
During Friday 's raid , officials said more drugs were found and weapons seized and additional charges were possible .
Simmons ' New York lawyer , Murray Richman , said he told his client to expect such a raid after his efforts to make DMX available to law enforcement were rebuffed .
" I anticipated it , I explained to my client what was going to happen , " Richman said .
" I think that the animal cruelty is not going to be able to be established and I think that this is Sheriff Joe 's moment . "
Sheriff Joe Arpaio has made stopping animal cruelty a major issue .
He converted one of the county 's air - conditioned jails into an animal shelter and moved the inmates into tents .
" A guy like this DMX character with all his money and fame has no excuse for not providing proper care for his animals , " the sheriff said in a statement .
Sheriff 's deputies made a series of visits to the rapper 's home in August after receiving reports of neglected pit bulls .
They found a caretaker who had been hired to care for the animals .
Richman said that DMX was not in Arizona in the weeks leading up to the initial raid .
The rapper has had previous run-ins with the law , including an arrest Tuesday by the Arizona Department of Public Safety after speed - enforcement cameras captured him going 114 mph on a suburban Phoenix freeway .
In June 2006 , Scottsdale police cited him for carrying a concealed handgun outside a nightclub .
He also served 70 days in jail in 2005 for violating his parole following a 2004 incident in which he posed as an undercover federal agent and crashed his sport utility vehicle through a security gate at Kennedy International Airport .
DMX recorded the 1999 hit single " Party Up ( Up in Here ) . "
His last album , " Year of the Dog ... Again , " was released last year .
One of Buckminster Fuller ’s earliest inventions was a car shaped like a blimp .
The car had three wheels — two up front , one in the back — and a periscope instead of a rear window .
Owing to its unusual design , it could be maneuvered into a parking space nose first and could execute a hundred - and - eighty - degree turn so tightly that it would end up practically where it had started , facing the opposite direction .
In Bridgeport , Connecticut , where the car was introduced in the summer of 1933 , it caused such a sensation that gridlock followed , and anxious drivers implored Fuller to keep it off the streets at rush hour .
Fuller called his invention the Dymaxion Vehicle .
He believed that it would not just revolutionize automaking but help bring about a wholesale reordering of modern life .
Soon , Fuller thought , people would be living in standardized , prefabricated dwellings , and this , in turn , would allow them to occupy regions previously considered uninhabitable — the Arctic , the Sahara , the tops of mountains .
The Dymaxion Vehicle would carry them to their new homes ; it would be capable of travelling on the roughest roads and — once the technology for the requisite engines had been worked out — it would also ( somehow ) be able to fly .
Fuller envisioned the Dymaxion taking off almost vertically , like a duck .
Fuller ’s schemes often had the hallucinatory quality associated with science fiction ( or mental hospitals ) .
It concerned him not in the least that things had always been done a certain way in the past .
In addition to flying cars , he imagined mass - produced bathrooms that could be installed like refrigerators ; underwater settlements that would be restocked by submarine ; and floating communities that , along with all their inhabitants , would hover among the clouds .
Most famously , he dreamed up the geodesic dome .
“ If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone , a piano top . . . that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver , ” Fuller once wrote .
“ But this is not to say that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top .
I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday ’s fortuitous contrivings . ”
Fuller may have spent his life inventing things , but he claimed that he was not particularly interested in inventions .
He called himself a “ comprehensive , anticipatory design scientist ” — a “ comprehensivist , ” for short — and believed that his task was to innovate in such a way as to benefit the greatest number of people using the least amount of resources .
“ My objective was humanity ’s comprehensive success in the universe ” is how he once put it .
“ I could have ended up with a pair of flying slippers . ”
Fuller ’s career is the subject of a new exhibition , “ Buckminster Fuller : Starting with the Universe , ” which opens later this month at the Whitney Museum of American Art .
The exhibition traces the long , loopy arc of his career from early doodlings to plans he drew up shortly before his death , twenty - five years ago this summer .
It will feature studies for several of his geodesic domes and the only surviving Dymaxion Vehicle .
By staging the retrospective , the Whitney raises — or , really , one should say , re-raises — the question of Fuller ’s relevance .
Was he an important cultural figure because he produced inventions of practical value or because he did n’t ?
Richard Buckminster Fuller , Jr. — Bucky , to his friends — was born on July 12 , 1895 , into one of New England ’s most venerable and , at the same time , most freethinking families .
His great - great - grandfather , the Reverend Timothy Fuller , a Massachusetts delegate to the Federal Constitutional Assembly , was so outraged by the Constitution ’s sanctioning of slavery that he came out against ratification .
His great - aunt Margaret Fuller , a friend of Emerson and Thoreau , edited the transcendentalist journal The Dial and later became America ’s first female foreign correspondent .
Growing up in Milton , Massachusetts , Bucky was a boisterous but hopelessly nearsighted child ; until he was fitted with glasses , he refused to believe that the world was not blurry .
Like all Fuller men , he was sent off to Harvard .
Halfway through his freshman year , he withdrew his tuition money from the bank to entertain some chorus girls in Manhattan .
He was expelled .
The following fall , he was reinstated , only to be thrown out again .
Fuller never did graduate from Harvard , or any other school .
He took a job with a meatpacking firm , then joined the Navy , where he invented a winchlike device for rescuing pilots of the service ’s primitive airplanes .
( The pilots often ended up head down , under water . )
During the First World War , Fuller married Anne Hewlett , the daughter of a prominent architect , and when the war was over he started a business with his father - in - law , manufacturing bricks out of wood shavings .
Despite the general prosperity of the period , the company struggled and , in 1927 , nearly bankrupt , it was bought out .
At just about the same time , Anne gave birth to a daughter .
With no job and a new baby to support , Fuller became depressed .
One day , he was walking by Lake Michigan , thinking about , in his words , “ Buckminster Fuller — life or death , ” when he found himself suspended several feet above the ground , surrounded by sparkling light .
Time seemed to stand still , and a voice spoke to him .
“ You do not have the right to eliminate yourself , ” it said .
“ You do not belong to you .
You belong to Universe . ”
( In Fuller ’s idiosyncratic English , “ universe ” — capitalized — is never preceded by the definite article . )
It was at this point , according to Fuller , that he decided to embark on his “ lifelong experiment . ”
The experiment ’s aim was nothing less than determining “ what , if anything , ” an individual could do “ on behalf of all humanity . ”
For this study , Fuller would serve both as the researcher and as the object of inquiry .
( He referred to himself as Guinea Pig B , the “ B ” apparently being for Bucky . )
Fuller moved his wife and daughter into a tiny studio in a Chicago slum and , instead of finding a job , took to spending his days in the library , reading Gandhi and Leonardo .
He began to record his own ideas , which soon filled two thousand pages .
In 1928 , he edited the manuscript down to fifty pages , and had it published in a booklet called “ 4D Time Lock , ” which he sent out to , among others , Vincent Astor , Bertrand Russell , and Henry Ford .
Like most of Fuller ’s writings , “ 4D Time Lock ” is nearly impossible to read ; its sentences , Slinky - like , stretch on and on and on .
( One of his biographers observed of “ 4D Time Lock ” that “ worse prose is barely conceivable . ” )
At its heart is a critique of the construction industry .
Imagine , Fuller says , what would happen if a person , seeking to purchase an automobile , had to hire a designer , then send the plans out for bid , then show them to the bank , and then have them approved by the town council , all before work on the vehicle could begin .
“ Few would have the temerity to go through with it , ” he notes , and those who did would have to pay something like fifty thousand dollars — half a million in today ’s money — per car .
Such a system , so obviously absurd for autos , persisted for houses , Fuller argued , because of retrograde thinking .
( His own failure at peddling wood - composite bricks he cited as evidence of the construction industry ’s recalcitrance . )
What was needed was a “ New Era Home , ” which would be “ erectable in one day , complete in every detail , ” and , on top of that , “ drudgery - proof , ” with “ every living appliance known to mankind , built - in . ”
Not coincidentally , Fuller was working to design just such a home .
One plan , which never made it beyond the sketching stage , called for ultra- lightweight towers to be assembled at a central location , then transported to any spot in the world , via zeppelin .
( Fuller envisioned the zeppelin crew excavating the site by dropping a small bomb . )
A second , only slightly less fabulous proposal was for what Fuller came to call the Dymaxion House .
The hexagonal - shaped , single - family home was to be stamped out of metal and suspended from a central mast that would contain all its wiring and plumbing .
When a family moved , the Dymaxion House could be disassembled and taken along , like a bed or a table .
Fuller constructed a scale model of the house , which was exhibited in 1929 at Marshall Field ’s as part of a display of modern furniture .
But no full - size version could be produced , because many of the components , including what Fuller called a “ radio - television receiver , ” did not yet exist .
Fuller estimated that it would take a billion dollars to develop the necessary technologies .
Not surprisingly , the money was n’t forthcoming .
Fuller was fond of neologisms .
He coined the word “ livingry , ” as the opposite of “ weaponry ” — which he called “ killingry ” — and popularized the term “ spaceship earth . ”
( He claimed to have invented “ debunk , ” but probably did not . )
Another one of his coinages was “ ephemeralization , ” which meant , roughly speaking , “ dematerialization . ”
Fuller was a strong believer in the notion that “ less is more , ” and not just in the aestheticized , Miesian sense of the phrase .
He imagined that buildings would eventually be “ ephemeralized ” to such an extent that construction materials would be dispensed with altogether , and builders would instead rely on “ electrical field and other utterly invisible environment controls . ”
Fuller ’s favorite neologism , “ dymaxion , ” was concocted purely for public relations .
When Marshall Field ’s displayed his model house , it wanted a catchy label , so it hired a consultant , who fashioned “ dymaxion ” out of bits of “ dynamic , ” “ maximum , ” and “ ion . ”
Fuller was so taken with the word , which had no known meaning , that he adopted it as a sort of brand name .
The Dymaxion House led to the Dymaxion Vehicle , which led , in turn , to the Dymaxion Bathroom and the Dymaxion Deployment Unit , essentially a grain bin with windows .
As a child , Fuller had assembled scrapbooks of letters and newspaper articles on subjects that interested him ; when , later , he decided to keep a more systematic record of his life , including everything from his correspondence to his dry- cleaning bills , it became the Dymaxion Chronofile .
“ It did n’t have to end like this . ”

All the Dymaxion projects generated a great deal of hype , and that was clearly Fuller ’s desire .
All of them also flopped .
The first prototype of the Dymaxion Vehicle had been on the road for just three months when it crashed , near the entrance to the Chicago World ’s Fair ; the driver was killed , and one of the passengers — a British aviation expert — was seriously injured .
Eventually , it was revealed that another car was responsible for the accident , but only two more Dymaxion Vehicles were produced before production was halted , in 1934 .
Only thirteen models of the Dymaxion Bathroom — a single unit that came with a built - in tub , toilet , and sink — were constructed before the manufacturer pulled the plug on that project , in 1936 .
The Dymaxion Deployment Unit , which Fuller imagined being used as a mobile shelter , failed because after the United States entered the Second World War he could no longer obtain any steel .
In 1945 , Fuller attempted to mass - produce the Dymaxion House , entering into a joint effort with Beech Aircraft , which was based in Wichita .
Two examples of the house were built before that project , too , collapsed .
( The only surviving prototype , known as the Wichita House , looks like a cross between an onion dome and a flying saucer ; it is now on display at the Henry Ford Museum , in Dearborn , Michigan . )
Following this string of disappointments , Fuller might have decided that his “ experiment ” had run its course .
Instead , he kept right on going .
Turning his attention to mathematics , he concluded that the Cartesian coördinate system had got things all wrong and invented his own system , which he called Synergetic Geometry .
Synergetic Geometry was based on sixty - degree ( rather than ninety - degree ) angles , took the tetrahedron to be the basic building block of the universe , and avoided the use of pi , a number that Fuller found deeply distasteful .
By 1948 , Fuller ’s geometric investigations had led him to the idea of the geodesic dome — essentially , a series of struts that could support a covering skin .
That summer , he was invited to teach at Black Mountain College , in North Carolina , where some of the other instructors included Josef Albers , Willem and Elaine de Kooning , John Cage , and Merce Cunningham .
( “ I remember thinking it ’s Bucky Fuller and his magic show , ” Cunningham would later recall of Fuller ’s arrival . )
Toward the end of his stay , Fuller and a team of students assembled a trial dome out of Venetian - blind slats .
Immediately upon being completed , the dome sagged and fell in on itself .
( Some of the observers referred to it as a “ flopahedron . ” )
Fuller insisted that this outcome had been intentional — he was , he said , trying to determine the critical point at which the dome would collapse — but no one seems to have believed this .
The following year , Anne Fuller sold thirty thousand dollars ’ worth of I.B.M. stock to finance Bucky ’s continuing research , and in 1950 he succeeded in erecting a dome fifty feet in diameter .
The story starts in the White House , where Monsanto often got its way by exerting disproportionate influence over policymakers via the “ revolving door ” .
One example is Michael Taylor , who worked for Monsanto as an attorney before being appointed as deputy commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 1991 .
While at the FDA , the authority that deals with all US food approvals , Taylor made crucial decisions that led to the approval of GE foods and crops .
Then he returned to Monsanto , becoming the company ’s vice president for public policy .
Thanks to these intimate links between Monsanto and government agencies , the US adopted GE foods and crops without proper testing , without consumer labeling and in spite of serious questions hanging over their safety .
Not coincidentally , Monsanto supplies 90 percent of the GE seeds used by the US market .
Monsanto ’s long arm stretched so far that , in the early nineties , the US Food and Drugs Agency even ignored warnings of their own scientists , who were cautioning that GE crops could cause negative health effects .
Other tactics the company uses to stifle concerns about their products include misleading advertising , bribery and concealing scientific evidence .
Monsanto's background
Monsanto was founded in 1901 as a chemical company .
Its history is intimately linked to the production and promotion of highly toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange ( used as a chemical weapon in the Vietnam war ) and PCBs ( widespread toxic pollutants ) .
Robin ’s movie reveals that Monsanto already knew about the “ systematic toxic effects ” of PCBs for decades , but instructed its salespeople to stay silent because , “ we ca n’t afford to lose one dollar . ”
More recently Monsanto received a bad reputation for the promotion of growth hormones from GE organisms known as rBGH , which the company sells in the US under the brand name Posilac .
Monsanto claims that Posilac holds , “ benefits to consumers ” .
The reality is that , rBGH growth hormones were banned in Europe and Canada after the authorities found out about the health risks resulting from drinking milk from cows treated with rBGH hormones .
Monsanto's way of " addressing " this problem was to sue the Oakhurst dairy company in the state of Maine ( US ) - attempting to force them , and other dairies , to stop labelling diary products “ rBGH - free ” and “ rBST - free ” .
Global reach , control
Over the last decade , Monsanto aggressively bought up over 50 seed companies around the globe .
Seeds are the source of all food .
Whoever owns the seeds , owns the food .
The process of genetic engineering allows companies , such as Monsanto , to claim patent rights over seeds .
Ninety percent of all GE seeds planted in the world are patented by Monsanto and hence controlled by them .
Patents on seeds give companies like Monsanto unprecedented power .
Monsanto prohibits farmers saving patented GE seeds from one crop to replant the next season , an age - old practice .
To ensure that farmers do not reuse seeds , Monsanto created its own ' gene police ' , and encourages farmers to turn in their neighbors .
Even farmers that do not use GE seeds are not safe .
According to an investigative report by the Centre for Food Safety ( CFS ) farmers have even been sued for patent infringement after their field was contaminated by pollen or seed from someone else ’s GE crop .
But Monsanto ’s influence does n't stop at the US border .
“ The world according to Monsanto ” , documents the devastating impact of Monsanto 's malpractices around the world .
Among others , it includes the real - life stories of cotton farmers in India that ended up in hopeless debts after using Monsanto genetically engineered ( so called Bt ) cotton , and of a family in Paraguay , South America whose dreams have turned to nightmares after their farm became surrounded by fields planted with Monsanto ’s GE soya .
A much needed expose
Monsanto would n’t address these issues on camera for Robin , instead referring to the " Monsanto Pledge " posted on their website ( which we debunk here ) .
The movie was shown for the first time on ARTE TV ( in German and French ) on Tuesday 11 March .
You can order a DVD of it ( in English , French and Spanish ) here .
Update 9 - Sept -2010 :
the purpose would be to help in the battle against world hunger , and towards a cleaner environment ;
the second generation of the seeds should be fertile , and free to use in the conventional way to increase the permanent independence of small farmers on the seed providers ;
the price should be regulated versus the standard seeds ;
proper and independent verification of the impact and risks on humans , plants and animals should be done by a panel of experts .
The monitoring data should be made available for public scrutiny ;
there should be no intellectual property rights on the seeds ;
there should be no random hybrid offspring possible between natural and GM crops ;
... any more ideas ?

Reading through all the news about the global food crisis , I lacked one thing : the solution to this problem or even the slightest hint to one .
In many discussion fora and through comments on social bookmarking sites , it was often suggested that genetically modified ( GM ) crops , said to yield a higher production , and to be more pest - resistant , could mean the solution to world hunger .
I started to search around for more info on genetically modified organism ( GMO ) or genetically engineered organism ( GEO ) , and came across several posts referring to a video called " The World According to Monsanto " by a French independent filmmaker , Marie - Monique Robin .
The movie researches the credibility of ( or rather lack thereof ) US based Monsanto , one of the biggest chemical companies in the world and the provider of the seed technology for 90 percent of the world ’s genetically engineered ( GE ) crops .
Here is what Greenpeace has to say about the movie , and the company : I went out to look for the video on the Internet , and came across many dead links .
It looks like the video was uploaded to many video and file sharing sites , but later revoked .
I did find an upload which had the movie broken down in 12 parts .
I show the first one , and the links to the following ones on Youtube .
I have updated the links again as YouTube keeps on removing the links , so here is ...( after part 1 , it will autostart the 2nd ) .
You can also find the video on BitTorrent After watching the video , I hope you will agree with me that commercially modified GM or GE crops are not the solution to world hunger nor the current food crisis , but probably the cause for much more damage than we can expect .
Certainly when left in the hands of large corporations like Monsanto , and without proper government regulation and monitoring for the sake of profit .
I would say there are ways ( either through natural selection or through gene manipulation ) where we can change seeds to an extend they produce healthier plants and products , but then we should have different goals and means in mind :
If you are in Europe , you can join Greenpeace 's action against the introduction of the current commercial GM crops in Europe , by writing a postcard to Mr Stavros Dimas , the European Commissioner for the Environment .
Not to be a know - it - all or anything , actually in the 1945 incident , the rescuers ( firemen I think ) told the woman to go into the elevator after the crash to get out of the building .
The wires were weakened , so the expected " SNAP " came sometime after the doors closed .
Blame / thank Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader for my knowledge of that .
And all this talk about freefalling elevators ever makes me think about nowadays is perhaps the coolest elevators I 've ever seen in the Tower of Terror rides .
Otis was shocked when Disney turned to them for help !
Scott McClellan 's new book called " What 's Happening , " is making heads of former and current BushCo. loyalists explode .
I always enjoy that .
Fran Townsend was on CNN this morning killing Scotty .
Dan Bartlett joined Wolfie .
Karl Rove was on H&C and says he 's irresponsible in his behavior and compliments Scotty by saying he sounds like a left wing blogger .
Thanks Karl , that 's quite a compliment .
You see , truth and honesty are now associated to left wing blogs and lying , distorting and Stepford like behavior is now what Conservative Republicans represent .
He certainly is touchy about the Valerie Plame affair .
He clams up about it because there 's a civil lawsuit .
OK , then why are you on our airwaves ?
He denies leaking the name of Valerie Plame too ...

At the end of the clip he says this ...
Hannity :
Why did n't he leave earlier ?
Rove :
Two things .
First of all this does n't sound like Scott , it really does n't , not the Scott McClellan I known for a long time .
Second of all , it sounds like somebody else , it sounds like a left wing blogger .
Karl Rove denies every charge leveled by Scott , including the famous photo of Bush looking at NOLA from his plane .
The administration is coming out full force on Scotty .
On the Situation Room , Bartlett said this via CNN :
BLITZER : He writes this in the book about the president : " He and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war . "
Now he does n't flatly say the president was lying to the American people , but that is the upshot .
BARTLETT : Well , I think this is the part that gives me the biggest concern about this book , because to give credibility to such an outrageous accusation that mostly was coming from the left wing of the Democratic Party is really disappointing .
And Billw wonders if Bush still stands by his man :
BUSH : It 's going to be hard to replace Scott .
But nevertheless , he 's made the decision , and I accept it .
One of these days , he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary .
And I can assure you , I will feel the same way then that I feel now , that I can say to Scott , " Job well done . "
MCCLELLAN : Thank you , sir .
BUSH : You bet .
Appreciate you .
The Liberal Media Myth .... Hahaha ...
All over the world , prices for basic foods -- barley for beer , milk for cheese , corn for tortillas , and the rice that serves as a staple for more than half the world ’s population -- are soaring .
But farmers are n’t rushing to cash in on the boom by planting more of the crops .
The amount of corn planted in the U.S. is expected to dip this year .
Rice acreage in California , which sells as much as half its crop overseas , is predicted to increase by only a small amount .
Instead , farmers are planting cheaper - to - grow wheat and soy .
They say the reason is simple .
The cost of planting some crops is rising as fast as their prices , and sometimes faster , leaving little incentive to increase production of some foods that remain in high demand around the world .
Farmers typically plant their crops once a year and not all of them cost the same to produce .
Both corn and rice , for example , require more fertilizer to grow and fuel for farmers to tend than other crops .
As the prices of those supplies rise faster than the prices of some commodities , farmers are shying away from some expensive crops .
Advertisement
The little - noticed development could keep the price of some foods at their current high levels , or send them even higher , until worldwide supply can catch up with demand , economists say .
“ The price of crops drove what farmers did last year , ” said Chad Hart , an Iowa State University agriculture economist .
Now “ it ’s costs , and that ’s prompting farmers to reevaluate how they allocate their land this year . ”
The cost of farming an acre of corn , for example , has risen almost 47 % over the last year , according to Wells Fargo & Co. estimates , outpacing the 35 % increase in the price of corn in the same period .
It ’s the same with rice .
The price on the futures market of U.S. - grown long grain rice -- the type that is in short supply worldwide -- has risen 64 % this year to $ 22.74 per one hundred pounds .
( Such a move also pushes up the price of medium grain rice , which makes up most of what is grown in California . )
Still , farmers are expected to plant 549,000 acres of California rice this year , up less than 3 % from last year , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .

Charlie Hoppin , who farms 3,200 acres scattered across Yolo and Sutter counties , is one farmer opting for a crop other than corn .
He figures that safflower will be just as profitable , if not better , and a whole lot easier to farm .
“ At today ’s prices , corn brings in roughly $ 1,200 an acre .
Safflower will bring in $ 750 .
But fertilizer is less than half the cost , the seed is less and I wo n’t need the same irrigation or pesticides , ” Hoppin said .
He planted 370 safflower acres this year , up from none last year , and he does n’t plan to put any corn in the ground after planting 500 acres a year ago .
“ I will know if I made the right decision about next December , but that ’s the nature of farming , ” Hoppin said .

Imperial Valley farmer Mark Osterkamp is also paying close attention to his farming costs .
“ We are chasing the tiger .
There ’s a wild grain market , but there ’s also a shortage of all the inputs for agriculture , ” said Osterkamp , who farms about 7,000 acres of wheat , sugar beets , onions and forage crops for livestock .
One problem for all farmers : the rising cost of fertilizer , which has nearly doubled in the last year , according to the Department of Agriculture .
Prices have increased because the world demand for fertilizer is outstripping the supply , said Kathy Mathers , spokeswoman for the Fertilizer Institute , a Washington , D.C. , trade group .
Advertisement
That ’s been made worse by the increased cost in shipping fertilizer around the world and the low value of the dollar , she said .
Many other farming costs are rising too .
The price of the diesel fuel that is used to run combines and tractors has jumped by half from a year ago , according to the USDA .
Seed prices have risen more than 25 % from last year , the USDA said .
Farmers are also dealing with higher rents , as landowners demand their slice of increased food prices .
Advertisement
Indeed , the rent for some of Osterkamp ’s land has jumped to $ 250 an acre this year , up from $ 175 a year ago .
Steve Dennis , who farms 6,000 acres of rice , wheat , almonds and walnuts in Colusa and Glenn counties , is also changing fertilizers in response to soaring prices for farm additives and chemicals .
A year ago , Dennis paid $ 500 a ton for the fertilizer he uses on rice .
He is spending $ 1,300 a ton this year , prompting him to switch to an inferior compound that sells for less .
The switch will save him as much as $ 130,000 this year .
Dennis also is hedging his bets by planting about 500 acres of wheat because it uses less water than rice .

I ’m “ paying a lot closer attention to the numbers , ” he said .
“ I am trying to get by with a little less of this and a little less of that . ”

Stand with Kucinich : Impeach Bush !
by : Rebecca Young
recipient : U.S. House of Representatives
Representative Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) has just introduced articles of impeachment against President George Bush .
Please urge your member of Congress to stand with Kuninich and support impeachment !
Why impeach now ?
Even though President Bush is a lame duck president , the fact remains that he misled our country into an illegal war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people , most of them innocent Iraqi civilians .
He has conducted warrentless surveillance of American citizens and violated the Geneva Convention by approving the use of torture .
He is not fit to be President and should not be allowed to hold this noble seat .
Impeach now !

Justice Antonin Scalia 's majority opinion in yesterday 's Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller is historic in its implications and exemplary in its reasoning .
A federal ban on an entire class of guns in ordinary use for self - defense – such as the handgun ban adopted by the District of Columbia – is now off the table .
Every gun controller 's fondest desire has become a constitutional pipe dream .
Two ...
It is 2 metres ( 7ft ) tall , 1.5 metres wide and a metre deep .
It runs on water and most of the time it is screened off at the back of a lecture room in Cambridge .
But when the nine members of the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee announce their latest decision on interest rates today they will owe a debt of gratitude to the computer built in a garage in south Croydon by Bill Phillips - an engineer turned economist from New Zealand - almost 60 years ago .
A sensation when it was unveiled at the London School of Economics in 1949 , the Phillips machine used hydraulics to model the workings of the British economy but now looks , at first glance , like the brainchild of a nutty professor .
Where the Bank 's team of in - house economists are equipped with state - of - the - art digital computers , the profession 's first stab at modelling was very much a do - it - yourself affair with a whiff of the Heath Robinson about it .
The prototype was an odd assortment of tanks , pipes , sluices and valves , with water pumped around the machine by a motor cannibalised from the windscreen wiper of a Lancaster bomber .
Bits of filed - down Perspex and fishing line were used to channel the coloured dyes that mimicked the flow of income round the economy into consumer spending , taxes , investment and exports .
Phillips and Walter Newlyn , who helped piece the machine together at the end of the 1940s , experimented with treacle and methylated spirits before deciding that coloured water was the best way of displaying the way money circulates around the economy .
Phillips was a far cry from today 's identikit economists , with their mathematical training and obsessions with abstruse theory .
He was born on a farm in New Zealand in 1914 and spent much of the second world war in a Japanese prisoner of war camp after being captured while trying to turn a wrecked bus into a boat to sail to Australia .
While imprisoned , Phillips risked death by stealing components from the camp commandant for a makeshift radio and built an immersion heater that was capable of providing 2,000 PoWs with a cup of tea before bed .
The Japanese never worked out why the lights dimmed every night at 10 pm .
By today 's standards , the Phillips machine was limited .
It made no provision for inflation and , with capital controls in force , had no need to take account of the curse of the modern UK economy - the wild swings in the credit cycle .
Professor Brian Henry , a visiting fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research , said : " It was a child of its time .
It looked at how the economy could be stabilised when people were worried about the stabilisation of aggregate demand .
That is the way things were in the 1950s .
" Things are different now .
There is a different financial system and a completely different global economy .
But Phillips was a brilliant guy .
He came up with interesting ways of providing practical advice on policy . "
Even so ,
Henry says the machine is far more than a museum piece .
Today the Bank of England 's models are supposed to show how shocks affect the economy and the time it takes for a change in policy to have an effect , precisely the sort of problems that the Phillips machine helped identify .
Even with the most up - to - date computers , the Bank is still finding it hard to come up with the right answers .
Indeed , one early demonstration of the machine displayed the difficulties that can arise when monetary and fiscal policy are not synchronised .
Phillips asked one of his students to be chancellor of the exchequer and control taxes and spending ; the other to be governor of the Bank and control interest rates .
Predictably , the policies were uncoordinated and the upshot was that water overflowed on to the floor .
Out of fashion
By the mid-1950s , the Phillips machine was all the rage and after struggling to get a pass in his original subject , sociology , Phillips eventually became a professor of economics at the LSE after demonstrating a relationship between the rate of unemployment and wage inflation .
But as the Phillips curve fell out of fashion after the monetarist backlash of the 1970s , so the machines were mothballed and the one housed in the department of applied economics at Cambridge is the only working model left in the country .
It took a lecturer from the department of engineering , Allan McRobie , to get it up and running again ; no economist could work out quite how Phillips had pieced the original machine together .
McRobie was given a grant from Nesta - the National Endowment for Science , Technology and the Arts - and spent a summer on the restoration project .
The only difference with the original is that McRobie has dispensed with the cochineal because it would stain the Perspex .
" Everything was in the wrong place .
It had been here since the 1950s but everything was connected wrong .
I had to work out what he was trying to do .
Economics is run by people who did n't understand it . "
Early European explorers to the Americas encountered an astounding abundance of marine life .
White beluga whales , now limited to the arctic , swam as far south as Boston Bay .
Cod off Newfoundland were so plentiful that fishermen could catch them with nothing more than a weighted basket lowered into the water .
As late as the mid-19th century , river herring ran so thick in the eastern United States that wading across certain waterways meant treading on fish .
And everywhere sharks were so numerous that , after hauling in their catches , fishers often found them stripped to the bone .
“ It completely bowled me over when I started reading some of these early accounts , ” says Cal­lum Roberts , a professor of marine conservation at the University of York , England , and author of “ The Unnatural History of the Sea , ” which tells much of this tale .
“ The picture painted is one of an abundance of life which is very hard for us to grasp today . ”
Hundreds of years of fishing – and especially the last half century of industrialized fishing – have drastically altered the oceans .
Measured by weight , only 1/10th of the large predators that once swam the seas – the big fish and sharks that shape the entire ecosystem – is estimated to remain .
And many of these changes have occurred relatively recently .
Any middle - aged fisherman will wax nostalgic about the catches of just 20 years ago .
Any marine scientist will glumly check off reefs they once studied that are now bleached and overgrown with algae as a result of overfishing and pollution , and the marine life that ’s simply disappeared .
“ Today ’s oceans have got far less in the way of biomass than they used to , ” says Professor Roberts .
“ We ’re altering ecosystems in a way that reduces the level of productivity they can support . ”
After millenniums of a free - for - all , many foresee the era of open access to the ocean formally coming to a close .
World catches have steadily declined since peaking in the late 1980s .
Everyone , from scientists to fishermen , is alarmed .
And in the US , all quarters are pushing to develop solutions before the problem becomes unfixable .
Fishermen and fishery managers are rethinking management to encourage stewardship .
Scientists now say that fish stocks ca n’t be viewed in isolation ; they must be managed in the context of the greater ecosystem .
Many , even some fishermen begrudgingly , realize the importance of having some areas completely off - limits to fishing in order to keep ecosystems healthy .
And increasingly , a new argument is heard in the debate over fisheries :
Marine ecosystems should be preserved not just for their economic value , but also because , like the wilderness preserved in the national forest system , they are part of humankind ’s natural heritage .
The debate comes at a time when , driven by both health trends and increasing prosperity in countries like China , demand for fish is rising .
In industrialized countries , fish consumption doubled , to 27 million metric tons , between 1961 and 2003 , according to the United Nation ’s Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) .
Per capita , that ’s an increase of one - third , to 29.7 kg ( 65.5 lbs. ) per person yearly .
( Much of the increased demand is being met by a growing aquaculture industry . )
In developing countries , fish continue to provide an important source of protein .
The average African gets 17 percent of his protein from fish ; for Asians , it ’s 26 percent .
The typical North American gets only 7 percent of his protein from fish .
Fishery managers have a name for what can be removed without causing stocks to fall : the maximum sustainable yield .
In theory , a well - managed fishery should provide free food – save for the cost of catching it – year after year .
And yet , even in the US where stocks are on balance in better condition than in other places , 41 of the 244 stocks for which the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) has information are being fished at unsustainable levels , or overfished .
Worldwide , one - quarter of fish stocks are overfished , says the FAO .
Another 50 percent are fished to full capacity ; they can sustain no more .
According to one somewhat controversial analysis , if current fishing trends continue , all the world ’s fisheries will have collapsed by mid-century .
What happened ?
Daniel Pauly , director of the Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia , Van­couver , calls the combined cultural , technological , and economic factors “ the march of folly . ”
It began with a long - held notion of the sea ’s endless bounty .
Until relatively recently , fishermen , fishery managers , and scientists alike thought the sea was so vast , so teeming with life , that human activity simply could n’t diminish it , Mr. Pauly says .
Until the advent of modern fishing technology in the 20th century , it could n’t .
“ The sea was very large compared to the means we had to exploit it , ” Pauly says .
But beginning with steam - powered trawlers more than 100 years ago , and ending with today ’s global - positioning navigational systems , technology has improved fishermen ’s reach and efficiency .
“ We essentially deployed our industrial armada against fish , and obviously we would win :
It ’s a war against fish , ” says Pauly .
Technology made inaccessible fish accessible .
Pristine areas used to constantly replenish adjacent areas that were fished , scientists hypothesize .
But as technology let fleets fish in areas previously unfished due to remoteness or difficult undersea topography , this replenishment failed .
Fish numbers fell , but better fishing technology concealed the trend .
World catches remained stable or increased , suggesting healthy stocks .
Then , when local stocks began to collapse , fleets moved ever farther offshore , leading to what Robert Steneck , a professor of marine biology at the University of Maine , Orono , calls “ roving banditry ” :
High - seas fleets fishing stocks to collapse , then moving on .
Many countries also subsidized their fleets , increasing capacity far beyond what the seas could absorb .
Worldwide , the FAO estimates that by the 1990s , subsidies had pushed fishing capacity some 30 to 50 percent above what the oceans could sustain .
( It has since fallen . )
“ When the biomass goes down because of fishing , in a sense the stock has a message … .
‘ Leave me alone , ’ ” says Pauly .
“ But subsidies , which contribute to the harvesting of fish , enable the fisher to ignore the signal of the stock . ”
In the US , which actively developed its domestic fleet throughout the late 1970s and ’ 80s with low - interest loans and other programs , many thought that fishing overcapacity would self - correct .
If fishermen were just another predator , once fish numbers dropped , fishers would , too .
Equilibrium would be restored .
But the laws of economics led to a different outcome : “ As stocks get rarer and rarer , their prices go up – the so - called ‘ ratchet effect , ’ ” says Steve Murawski , chief scientist at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries in Silver Spring , Md . The incentive to catch the few remaining fish increases rather than decreases .
“ That was n’t well understood , ” he says .
Empty Oceans , a series on the state of the world 's fisheries , will be appearing in the Monitor 's environment section .

The good news is , Bush 's Justice Department offers grants to community programs to address juvenile crime nationwide .
The bad news is , Bush 's Justice Department seems to award the grants based on political connections , not merit .
There 's a program in San Diego , for example , that was ranked # 2 by the DoJ in its category of prevention and intervention .
It did n't get any funding .
But the program that was ranked # 47 did -- because it had connections .
Our friend Murray Waas and ABC News have the story :
A senior Justice Department official says a $ 500,000 federal grant to the World Golf Foundation is an appropriate use of money designed to deal with juvenile crime in America .
" We need something really attractive to engage the gangs and the street kids , golf is the hook , " said J. Robert Flores , the administrator of the Justice Department 's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention .
The Justice Department , in a decision by Flores , gave the money to the World Golf Foundation 's First Tee program , even though Justice Department staffers had rated the program 47th on a list of 104 applicants .
The allegations were first reported earlier this year by the trade journal Youth Today .
Would n't you know it , the honorary chairman of the First Tee program is former President George Bush .
Scott Peterson , who worked in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , said grants were awarded based more on politics than merit .
" This is cronyism , this is waste , fraud and abuse , " Peterson told ABC News , adding , " It 's a lot of our taxpayer money that 's supposed to go for some of our most vulnerable children . "
It 's quite a report .
Read the whole thing .
Murray Waas has more about this on his brand new C&L site .
Murray is the lead investigative reporter on this story featured by ABC .
LOS ANGELES  Nitin Dhopade , the chief financial officer for Micro Solutions Enterprises , was headed toward the accounting department on the afternoon of Feb. 7 to deliver checks he had just signed .
Suddenly , he says , he encountered armed men and women wearing bulletproof vests and uniforms branded with " ICE , " which stands for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Dhopade , 47 , says he and 30 other administrative workers for the Van Nuys , Calif. , company , which recycles used toner and ink cartridges , were marched down a stairwell lined by officers .
The workers were ordered against a wall and told not to touch anything or use their cellphones .
" There was no way you could leave .
You were definitely detained , " he says .
" None of us were in handcuffs , but there was no way you could say ' I 'm leaving . ' "
That marked the beginning of a surprise raid that would result in the arrests of 138 suspected illegal immigrants , about one - fifth of MSE 's workforce .
Also swept up in the same raid were more than 100 U.S. citizens and legal residents , including Dhopade , a naturalized U.S. citizen from India .
They say they were illegally detained at the factory for an hour when ICE agents blocked the doors and interrogated them , forbidding them to leave or go to the bathroom without an escort .
Whether their brief detention was a mere inconvenience or a flagrant violation of their constitutional rights is the subject of a growing debate that seems likely to be resolved in federal court .
Immigration officials , charged with enforcing the law against the estimated 12 million undocumented foreigners in the USA , are mounting more raids at slaughterhouses , restaurants and factories .
Increasingly , U.S. citizens and legal residents who work alongside illegal immigrants are being detained and interrogated , too .
And some , such as Dhopade , are filing claims or lawsuits against the government .
Dhopade says he was a victim of racial profiling by ICE .
An ICE agent questioned him about his immigration status and his ability to speak English " because of my skin color , " he says .
" None of the white folks in the office … that I know of were asked for proof of citizenship .
To be asked for proof of citizenship , in this country , it 's an insult .
This is the United States of America .
This country does not require that . "
In other immigration raids , citizens and legal , permanent residents have been taken to jail .
Jesus Garcia , a former Texas poultry worker , was handcuffed and spent more than 30 hours in ICE custody this year , part of that time in jail .
Two co-workers , both citizens , also were arrested .
No charges were filed against them .
In April , the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law , a public interest law firm here , filed claims for damages on behalf of 114 MSE employees , all citizens or legal permanent residents , also called green - card holders .
The claims allege that they were subjected to " false imprisonment " and " detention without justification " and seek $ 5,000 each in damages from the federal government .
The lawsuits and claims against the government are part of a strategy by immigration lawyers to halt or change workplace raids .
Peter Schey , president and executive director of the center , acknowledges that " we 're hoping the prospect of thousands of U.S. citizens over time filing claims for damages against the United States government might cause ( ICE ) to reconsider how these raids are conducted . "
" You cannot in this country engage in group detentions of large numbers of people because you think a smaller number within the larger group has done something wrong , " Schey says .
At the Van Nuys plant , ICE " created a powerful atmosphere of fear and intimidation .
People felt like they had been taken hostage . "
The rationale for the raids Julie Myers , the Department of Homeland Security 's assistant secretary for ICE , says federal law , Supreme Court decisions and search warrants give ICE the authority to enter workplaces to question " all the people inside , " including citizens .
She declines to discuss the MSE case , citing the ongoing investigation .
But she says ICE agents work fast to separate legal workers from suspected illegal ones .
" When we go in , a lot of people are pretending to be U.S. citizens , and then there are some people who are , " she says .
" Our goal is to make sure we work as quickly and efficiently as we can so that U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents are free to go . "
The stepped - up enforcement protects U.S. workers , she says .
" We 're trying to create a culture of compliance … so that businesses would start to have incentives to hire only people who are legally entitled to work here . "
Workplace arrests by ICE in 2007 were 10 times what they were in 2002 .
Last year , the agency charged 863 people with criminal violations , such as identity theft , and 4,077 for allegedly being in the country illegally .
In 2002 , ICE made 25 criminal and 485 immigration - related arrests .
Workers arrested on criminal charges face jail time ; those accused of being in the country illegally are subject to deportation .
So far this year , ICE has made 850 criminal arrests and detained 2,900 people on immigration violations .
ICE has three primary targets , Myers says : workers who steal the identities of U.S. citizens , such as those who use someone else 's Social Security number to gain employment ; work sites such as airports and naval bases , which could be particularly vulnerable to terrorist threats ; and what Myers calls " egregious employers " — those who knowingly hire illegal workers .
Barbara Coe , chairwoman of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform , says raids " are providing the incentive for at least some of these illegal aliens to get out of here before they are deported .
I do n't think there are enough raids .
There should be more . "
She says she 's sorry legal residents are sometimes questioned during raids but believes ICE needs time to determine who is here legally .
So does Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington .
" It 's not the end of the world , " he says of citizens who are detained .
" These people were briefly inconvenienced .
Too bad . "
' My heart was racing ' Denise Shippy , nine months pregnant the day of the MSE raid , says it was more than an inconvenience .
She had planned to take off that afternoon for parent - teacher conferences and a doctor 's appointment .
But Shippy , 30 , needed to train a receptionist to fill in for her while she was on maternity leave , so she took her two children to the office with her .
The raid occurred as she settled Cassidy , 7 , and Ricky , 9 , into the mailroom for lunch .
As she left the mailroom , Shippy found the lobby filled with ICE agents , and she , the children and co-workers were herded in there .
When Shippy tried to respond to an e-mail , she says , one ICE agent said , " Stop typing . "
" My rights were violated , " Shippy says .
" I am a citizen of this United States .
I was born here .
I 'm not who they 're looking for .
I was n't allowed to leave . …
I could n't go anywhere and could n't do anything .
Neither could my children . "
Although she was upset , she tried to calm her kids , she says .
She needed to use the restroom , but held off because she did n't want an agent to accompany her .
" I did n't want to scare the heck out of my kids , " she says .
" I was trying to be cool and calm for my children .
My heart was racing . "
At one point , agents started escorting handcuffed workers — suspected illegal immigrants — from the factory floor out the front door .
Her children asked why the workers were handcuffed , what they had done wrong and what would happen to them , she says .
" That was when I started getting angry , " she says .
" My kids should not have had to watch these things .
They saw people being led out in handcuffs .
These are people who are recognizable to my children . "
Shippy , who gave birth to a boy on Feb. 19 , returned to work June 9 and says she still feels justified in filing a claim .
" I 'm not some money - hungry person , " she says .
" This is something I 'm pretty passionate about .
It should n't have happened the way it did . "
Debate over the law
As long as ICE has a warrant to enter a workplace , Myers says , agents can conduct what she calls a " survey " to determine the legal status of " anyone within the premises . "
She cites a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that said factory surveys during immigration raids do n't amount to an unconstitutional detention or seizure of those being questioned , even U.S. citizens .
In its ruling , however , the Supreme Court emphasized that the employees in the factory were not prevented from moving around , continuing to work or leaving .
The current raids are different from those the Supreme Court approved , Schey says .
ICE can question workers as long as the interaction is voluntary , " but what they 're doing ( now ) is not that , " he says , because workers think they have no choice except to answer questions — which may incriminate those here illegally .
Many workers caught in raids do n't know they 're not obligated to respond , regardless of their immigration status , says Kevin Johnson , dean of the University of California - Davis , law school .
ICE " can ask people questions .
That does n't mean people have to respond , " he says .
Schey suspects ICE is using search warrants as a pretext to enter workplaces and then arrest as many people as it can to get publicity .
" It 's in effect a group detention , " he says , " not supported by probable cause , … not supported by any law . "
Michael Wishnie , a professor at Yale Law School , argues that ICE cannot legally detain or arrest anyone without reasonable suspicion that a specific person broke the law .
People should not be detained simply because " they work in the same factory as the person " for whom ICE has warrant , he says .
Kris Kobach , who teaches law at the University of Missouri - Kansas City , counters that police sometimes have to detain a large group to find the lawbreakers among them .
He cites , as an example , police looking for two drug dealers in a house where 10 people live .
In such a drug raid , " police will reasonably close the doors to the house and detain everybody , " he says .
The factory 's owners
No fines or charges have been levied against MSE or its managers .
Brothers Avi and Yoel Wazana , immigrants from Israel , started the company in 1994 .
Last year , net revenue was $ 95 million .
At MSE 's headquarters , a 225,000 - square - foot building in Van Nuys , workers clean , disassemble , reassemble and test old printer cartridges .
Before the raid , MSE employed about 700 people here .
Myers declined to say what prompted the raid .
However , ICE began auditing the company in May 2007 , focusing on " I - 9 forms , " which employers use to document employees ' legal status .
As part of the I - 9 process , employers must inspect at least two documents that show identity and legal status , including U.S. passports , Social Security cards or green cards .
MSE was " in compliance with I - 9 requirements , " says Schey , who also represents the company .
" If some of the documents workers presented were fraudulent , " MSE has " no way of determining that . "
The next month , the company voluntarily began using a government database to verify the status of new hires , he says .
Then the company did n't hear from the government for months , Schey says .
" They expected a letter , " he says .
" Instead , on Feb. 7 , ICE comes in like gangbusters . "
About 100 ICE agents raided the factory between 3:30 and 4 p.m. , says Nora Preciado , an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center .
Armed with a federal search warrant , they arrested 130 workers from Mexico , El Salvador , Honduras and other countries on suspicion of being in the country illegally .
ICE also had arrest warrants for eight others , who were picked up at their homes or the factory .
These eight , identified by ICE during the earlier check of documents , face criminal charges for making false claims of U.S. citizenship or presenting false documents .
Five people arrested in the raids have been deported , ICE says .
The others remain , some in detention , some not , while fighting their deportation orders in court .
Avi Wazana did not comment on the cases against his former employees or the methods MSE used to check their immigration status .
In an e-mail after the raid , however , he told some of his customers that " MSE … has rejected hundreds ( possibly more ) of applicants … due to improper documentation . "
The ACLU and other legal aid groups sued ICE , saying the detained MSE workers should have been allowed access to attorneys when they reported for interviews after the raid .
U.S. District Court Judge George
Wu agreed , and ordered ICE to stop interviewing workers .
ICE has since allowed lawyers to be present at any interview with MSE workers .
One of the workers interviewed without an attorney present was Maria , a 39 - year - old Pacoima resident who worked at MSE for eight years .
She asked that her last name not to be used , on the advice of her attorney .
" I felt like I had to answer " questions from ICE , she says .
" I did n't know about my rights . "
Maria was a supervisor in charge of eight line workers .
She says she entered the USA illegally 15 years ago from Mexico so she could give her children a better education .
One of her three children , a 14 - year - old girl , is a U.S. citizen .
Maria says she 'll fight to remain in the USA because she does n't want to be separated from her family , especially her daughter .
The girl 's father , Maria 's longtime partner , is a U.S. citizen and will care for their daughter if Maria is deported .
" She 's not going to leave , " Maria says of the girl , an eighth - grader .
" This is her country . "
Jailed ' over a mistake ' ICE 's raids foster discrimination , says Domingo Garcia , attorney for the League of United Latin American Citizens .
" There 's a lot of racial profiling . …
If you look like a Hispanic , you 're detained or arrested . "
He says he plans to file a class - action , civil rights lawsuit on behalf of legal workers detained in raids , including Jesus Garcia , 27 , a green - card holder from Mount Pleasant , Texas .
Domingo Garcia says he will ask the court to prohibit ICE from conducting raids until it changes its policies to prevent racial profiling .
ICE agents went to Jesus Garcia 's home on April 16 in conjunction with a raid on a nearby Pilgrim 's Pride poultry processing plant , where he worked marinating chicken meat .
Garcia , from Mexico , has been a legal permanent resident for a year and a half .
When about 10 ICE agents and local sheriff 's deputies knocked on his door , they told him he was using the wrong Social Security number , says his wife , Olivia Garcia , a U.S. citizen .
Though Garcia showed the agents his green card , they handcuffed him and jailed him .
He was released a day and a half later after agents told him he was n't the person they wanted , he says .
He had spent the night in jail .
" He said it was pretty bad , " Olivia says .
" People were crying and screaming . "
Jesus Garcia , who has since left Pilgrim 's Pride for another job , says the mishap cost him three days of work .
" I worked hard to get my residency , " he says .
" And to take me to jail just over a mistake ? "

Today , by a vote of 48 - 36 , Senate Republicans successfully blocked a climate change bill that would have put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions across the economy .
Republicans called the bill a tax increase , but Barack Obama said , “ Unfortunately , the Republican leadership in the Senate has chosen to block progress , rather than work in a good faith manner to address this challenge … ”
He said that the nation ca n’t afford to play politics with this issue , “ We ca n’t afford more of the same timid politics when the future of our planet is at stake .
We are already breaking records with the intensity of our storms , the number of forest fires , and the periods of drought .
By 2050 , famine could force more than 250 million from their homes .
And if we do nothing , sea levels will rise high enough to swallow large portions of every coastal city and town . ”
“ This bipartisan legislation establishes an economy - wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions .
It helps states , cities , and towns invest in technologies to reduce energy bills for homeowners , increase energy efficiency , construct green buildings , and expand public transit .
It invests in green technology to help our automakers to retool and our fossil - fuel industries to become clean .
The bill provides real financial relief to working families .
Importantly , the bill restores our great nation ’s international leadership role , while including provisions to ensure that all major emitting nations also take serious action to solve this global problem , ” Obama said .

He did acknowledge that the bill was not perfect , “ Let me clear , this bill is not perfect .
Emissions reductions must reflect the scientific consensus , which are reductions of at least 80 percent 2050 .
We must ensure that more middle - class families reap more of the financial benefits created by this bill .
And we must direct greater resources to the regions of the country that will bear the brunt of this critical transition to a clean energy economy . ”
Climate change is an issue that is custom made for Obama .
For his part , John McCain has chosen to break with George W. Bush on this issue , and his position is n’t much different from Obama ’s in that they both advocate a cap and trade system .
It is almost certain that no matter who wins the election in November , this bill will become law sometime next year .
The real shame in all of this is that the White House and congressional Republicans have chosen to play politics with the health of the planet .

How do we perceive a rainbow ?
And does everyone perceive a rainbow in the same way ?
These seemingly simple questions can reveal some interesting features of the human brain .
For instance , is the “ striped ” appearance of the rainbow — the seven distinct bands of color that we see — a construct of our higher mental processes , or do the mechanics of human color vision determine it at a very early perceptual level ?
If your language does not have separate words for “ blue ” and “ green ” ( and many languages , including Welsh , do not ) , do you perceive these shades as more similar than a speaker of English ?
Searching for answers to these questions , in recent years many scientists have concluded that speakers of languages that label color in ways distinct from those used in English may see a different rainbow from that of English speakers .
Recent studies have claimed that language processing is automatically involved in perceptual decisions about color in the brains of adults , even when hues are visible only briefly ( 100 milliseconds ) or when decisions do not require participants to name colors verbally .
Moreover , these effects are language - specific , so speakers of Russian or Korean show a different pattern of responses to color than speakers of English .
A recent study in PNAS by researchers at the University of Surrey challenges this view , however .
It suggests an intriguing and novel account of color categorization in infants .
In this study 18 English - speaking adults and 13 four - month - old infants were shown a colored target on a colored background .
Adults were faster to initiate eye - movements toward the target when the target and background colors came from different color categories ( for example , blue target , green background ) than when both target and background were the same color ( such as different shades of blue ) .
How Babies See Color
This discrimination advantage for different - category compared to same - category judgments is called Categorical Perception ( CP ) .
It is now clear that the effect in adults is language - driven .
For instance , healthy , right - handed adults only show CP selectively when colors are presented to the right visual field .
It is generally accepted that CP occurs because colors presented to the right visual field preferentially access language - processing areas located in the left hemisphere .
The authors of the new article agree with the current general consensus that CP in adults depends on privileged access to language areas in the left hemisphere .
They also agree that the precise color terms that are represented in language are culturally transmitted during childhood and that there has been no “ nativist , ” or innate , pre-linguistic partitioning by the visual processing pathways into innate color categories in the left hemisphere .
This idea fits with their data demonstrating that four - month - old infants showed no hint of CP when targets were presented in the right visual field .
Because these infants have not yet acquired language , it is unsurprising that they do not show language - driven category effects in the left hemisphere .
So far , so predictable .
What is striking , however , is that the same four - month - old infants did show a CP effect in the right hemisphere , exactly the reverse of the effect shown by adults .
When a green target appeared on a green background in the left visual field ( which has preferential access to the right hemisphere ) , infants were significantly slower to move their eyes toward the target than when a blue target appeared on the same green background .
The authors claim that their results provide some evidence for pre-linguistic partitioning of color categories in four - month - old infants , but only from stimuli that preferentially access the right hemisphere .
Such a result provides some empirical evidence for the existence of an innate pre-linguistic category boundary between blue and green .
If infants show an initial innate organization of color into precise categories in the right hemisphere of the brain , does such organization persist into adulthood ?
The answer to this question appears to be , “ no , it does not . ”
Even when the dominant left - hemisphere system is suppressed by a concurrent task that prevents access to verbal codes in the left hemisphere , ( see here and here , or can not be reached in split - brain patients — people who have had the connection severed between their two hemispheresno trace of categorical organization in the right hemisphere remains .
If the present results are really evidence of some pre-linguistic , and possibly innate categorical organization in the right hemisphere , the pre-linguistic system is not merely overshadowed in the process of language learning .
Rather , it is completely obliterated .
In this case , the power of language to shape our cognitive categories must be enormously strong , and Whorf ’s controversial views about the relationship between language and thought would appear to have been vindicated .
Future Questions
Yet there are several reasons to be cautious about such an interpretation of the present results .
If an innate organization of color categories were present in all humans before language categories are learned , we might expect to find it in our nearest primate relatives as well .
A recent study of baboons has shown this not to be the case , however .
A number of methodological features make the new findings hard to interpret .
Because of the difficulties of carrying out eye - tracking studies with infants , the data came from only half of the 26 infants that they tested .
The colors used for adults were too difficult for infants to discriminate , so the researchers chose a set of just three widely separated colors for the infant testing .
These comprised two targets ( one green and one blue ) and a background color that was just on the green side of the boundary between green and blue .
As a result , there is a larger “ perceptual distance ” between the blue target and the green background than between the green target and the green background .
This greater distinction might be enough to produce differences in the discriminability of the two targets .
No direct comparison with adults can be made to investigate this confounding factor between perceptual distance and color category , because the adults in the study saw a different set of colors .
A small difference in discriminability might affect responses only in the right hemisphere for several reasons .
In terms of the organization of the infant brain , integration of the two hemispheres is generally not complete before two years of age , so little transfer of information from one hemisphere to the other would be expected at four months .
The visual system develops asynchronously across hemispheres , with right hemisphere development preceding left in most humans .
In addition , processing of visual information for color and location may not be fully integrated before 26 weeks , due to the earlier maturation of the parvocellular visual stream , relative to magnocellular stream .
( The parvocellular visual stream is better at perceiving color and fine details . )
The readiness of the two hemispheres to respond to a second stimulus , after exposure to an attention - grabbing stimulus presented in central fixation also differs in young infants .
All these factors might contribute to greater sensitivity to a small difference in the discriminability of target and background in the right hemisphere compared with the left .
The present results deal only with a single category boundary , that between green and blue , so more evidence would be required to infer a complete set of pre-partitioned color categories in the right hemisphere of infants .
More research is also needed to discover what the situation would be for infants born to speakers of the many documented languages that use a single term to describe all those shades that an English speaker would call green and blue .
In conclusion , the new data present a most interesting challenge to researchers in the field but , given the significance of the theoretical consequences of such a powerful relation between language and thought , much wider investigation of the issues seems called for .
It is to be hoped that the new findings will act as a spur to other infant labs to join and broaden the investigation of these fascinating phenomena .

Now , the important thing here is not that waffles are better , but that a bunch of things have changed , and the question is … what was it ?
ruby_diff test_a.rb test_b.rb c Food c Food :: Pancake - Food :: Pancake.build c Food :: Pancake #<< + Food :: Pancake.about +
Food :: PancakeFactory
RubyDiff shows us that the module Food has changed , within it the Pancake class changed .
The class method Pancake . build was removed and a new PancakeFactory class was added .
We also see that the append operator was modified and there is a new class method about .
Great !
Best of all you can run ruby_diff over an entire repository of code , and it even supports git .
For instance to see what changes you have made locally you can do something like :
ruby_diff -- git HEAD -- file ./ ( your amazing changes here )
Or just to be meta , compare two revisions of RubyDiff :
ruby_diff --git HEAD~4 -- git HEAD~3 c CodeChange c CodeChange#initialize c CodeChange#to_s c CodeComparison c CodeComparison #changed c CodeObject + CodeObject#child_signatures c StructureProcessor c StructureProcessor#diff
I ’ll post more about RubyDiff shortly , but the source is available now on rubyforge and you can branch it on github .
It ’s still in it ’s early stages , so I ’d love to hear what you think .
Bug Description
hi this is affecting a lot of users it seems .
whether we all have the same issue or not i do n't know , but a lot of peoples ' systems are crashing , locking up hard so you can't do anything except pull the plug and reboot .
i'm on gutsy amd64 , 4gb ram , nvidia - tried nvidia and nv in xorg .
also tried desktop effects turned on and off .
still locks up after 5 mins or 2 days or anything in between ...
here is a thread with a lot of this going on :

PAT MARFISI carries bales of alfalfa hay and straw into the center aisle of his Hollywood Hills vegetable garden and begins tearing off pieces of the stuff .
He does n’t have any animals to feed , just his “ no - dig ” landscape : raised beds using lasagna - like layers of fodder , bone and blood meal and compost -- and remarkably little water .
Now that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a statewide drought , Marfisi ’s 300 - square - foot patch seems more relevant than ever .
It ’s his personal horticultural laboratory for a low - water , sustainable technique he learned working on organic farms in Australia last year .
Since he began gardening in this fashion , he says , he has been “ inundated ” with food .
With the exception of some recent losses to raccoons drawn to the soil ’s abundant grubs and earthworms , Marfisi ’s garden is thriving with beets , collard greens , chard , celery , tomatoes , chives , peppers , basil , chives , lettuces and leeks .
He estimates he grows enough food to feed three people daily .
When asked how much he waters , Marfisi shoves his hand deep beside some Swiss chard and pulls out moist , decomposed soil laced with remnants of straw .
“ I have n’t watered in 10 days , ” he says .
“ This is what I want people to know :
You can have beauty and abundance without a lot of water . ”
The retired Marfisi came upon the method while working as a volunteer farmhand Down Under , where the technique has been used since the 1977 paperback , “ Esther Deans ’ Gardening Book : Growing Without Digging , ” promoted it as a solution to poor soil , rampant weeds , water shortages and costly food .
“ Today , L.A. faces a lot of the same issues , ” Marfisi says .
“ In addition , we have global warming from pollution , and home gardening is a significant way to reduce transportation cost and related pollution . ”
He points out that noted food and science writer Michael Pollan , author of the recent “ In Defense of Food , ” estimates that the distance traveled by food to the plate of an average American is 1,500 miles .
“ This number is 150 feet for most home gardeners , ” Marfisi says .
“ That is a huge reduction in transport cost and pollution . ”
UNTIL HE had time for hands - on yard work , gardening was a passionate intellectual pursuit for Marfisi , who likes to sit for hours studying bugs with reference books in hand .
But after leaving his job as a management consultant , he enrolled in UCLA Extension ’s horticulture program , which inspired him to dump water - hungry annuals and replace them with California natives .
Then last year , Marfisi , who has a doctorate in economics , decided he wanted to become a farmer .
At age 60 , Marfisi became a WWOOFer -- he joined World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms ( www.wwoof.org), an international cultural exchange program that provides organic farmers free labor in exchange for providing workers with food and lodging .
The former consultant for big - name clients such as Sun- America thought it would be the ultimate work - study program to learn about sustainable farming and lifestyles .
“ The attraction was to get into the heart of the world of permaculture and biodynamics and experience it firsthand , ” he says .
“ Being retired , I had the time .
I thought , ‘ I ’m still healthy and strong . ’
I figured now is the time to do it . ”
( He hopes to join WWOOF again next year in Costa Rica ) .
He started on a farm in New Zealand .
Moving to Australia , he eventually worked on farms in six cities in Tasmania , Southern Australia and the Northern Territory .
His friends thought he was crazy .
“ Here is a guy who made the transition from corporate board rooms to the deserts of Australia and New Zealand to examine horticulture , ” friend Perry Parks says .
“ I could n’t get my head around it initially .
At his age . . . hiring yourself off to various farms ?
Digging fence posts ? ” he says , chuckling .
“ But tracking him through his e-mail messages , it seemed to be a real change of pace and it took on a kind of a meditative quality .
Everything seemed to be slower , simpler and clearer .
He got a lot out of it .
Now he ’s come back and put it into practice , ” Parks says .
THOUGH there is some debate over the origins of the no-dig method -- Ruth Stout ’s “ How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back , ” first published in 1955 , and Masanobu Fukuoka ’s “ One Straw Revolution , ” translated to English from Japanese in 1978 , are other references -- one thing is certain :
It is easy and it works .
Veteran gardeners will say that the greatest amount of work in creating a successful vegetable garden goes into soil preparation .
One of the best things about this sustainable alternative :
You do n’t have to break your back digging and pulling roots .
“ It ’s a wonderful movement , ” says landscape designer and garden writer Rosalind Creasy , author of “ The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping . ”
“ So many gardeners presume you have to start with a rototiller .
That only destroys the soil structure and burns the organic matter . ”
No - dig beds are created by layering organic materials above ground on newspaper .
Marfisi starts with alfalfa hay ( Deans recommends Lucerne hay , but it ’s hard to find locally ) , then straw and finally compost .
Marfisi dusts the newspaper , alfalfa and straw with blood and bone meal .
( Details in accompanying story ) .
The layers then decompose , turning into a nutrient - rich mixture much like compost .
Marfisi says no -dig is more efficient , water wise , because once a plant has a 10 - to 12 - inch root system , the layers of compost and straw keep moisture around the roots .
And you can keep layering it over and over again as the organic matter breaks down .
Aside from its looking a little messy , Creasy finds few negatives to no-dig .
She does urge novice gardeners , however , to learn about soil nutrients that vegetables need .
“ You still have to fertilize , ” she says .
“ You still have to renew the nitrogen .
Peas are legumes and they have nitrogen - mixing bacteria .
Broccoli is a heavy feeder .
You [ also ] have to think about crop rotation . ”
Marfisi concedes that it is harder to get nitrogen and the acidity or alkalinity right in a fresh no - dig bed than in conventional soil .
But once the organic matter has been in for two or three months and fertilizer is added , these imbalances seem to correct themselves , he says , and his harvests have been bountiful .
It seems Marfisi was destined to become a locavore from an early age .
He clearly remembers the first seeds he planted as a 7 - year - old in Missouri .
The simple act of pushing seeds into soil and waiting to see what happened was the beginning of a lifelong yearning that would haunt him until he retired .
“ I was blown away that seeds manufactured flowers , ” he says of discovering pink and orange zinnias weeks later .
“ Even to this day it still amazes me .
. . .
That picture remained in the back of my mind , while I was working 80 hours a week . ”
Now vegetables provide that same fascination .
“ Reconnecting to earth is huge for people who are contemplating retirement . ”

That is truly ironic .
Groundbreaking UC San Diego research study to measure ' how much information ? ' is in the world
Researchers at the University of California , San Diego , today announced a new study to quantify the amounts and kinds of information being produced worldwide by businesses and consumers alike .
The " How Much Information ? " study will be completed by a multi- disciplinary , multi-university faculty team supported by corporate and foundation sponsorship .
The program will be undertaken at the Global Information Industry Center ( GIIC ) at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies ( IR / PS ) , with support from the Jacobs School of Engineering and the San Diego Supercomputer Center .
" Experts say that we live in an information economy , but how much information is there , and do countries count and value information comparably ?
The previous generation of studies have reported information as countable bits and bytes , and documented large growth numbers " said IR / PS Dean Peter F. Cowhey .
" The next generation of studies will count more precisely the impacts and implications of information growth , and do this internationally , " continued Cowhey .
The How Much Information ( HMI ) program is a three - year effort by specialists at University of California , San Diego , MIT and University of California , Berkeley .
Previous theorists involved in developing baseline data are UC Berkeley professors Hal Varian and Peter Lyman , highly regarded for work in this field .
Professor Varian noted " we are very pleased that GIIC is undertaking this next generation of studies . "
Industry experts from AT&T , Cisco Systems , IBM , LSI , Oracle , Seagate Technology LLC , and PARC will work as part of the " How Much Information " team , representing the leading firms in the enterprise software , network and information storage industries .
Each company brings a unique perspective on information growth seen by their professionals in the field and in the use of their information technologies in industry , public sector organizations , and the home .
" We have designed this research as a partnership between industry and academics to take the next steps in understanding how to think about , measure , and understand the implications of dramatic growth in digital information , " said Professor Roger Bohn of UC San Diego , co-leader of the new program .
" As the costs per byte of creating , storing , and moving data fall , the amounts rise exponentially .
We know that overall information technology increases productivity and human welfare , but not all information is equally valuable . "
Bohn 's co-leader , Dr. James Short , noted that recent industry studies have reported larger and larger amounts of information being produced and stored in networks , companies and homes .
" We will continue to document the growth in information , " Short said , " but at the end of the day we are studying how information works .
How information works is about measuring and counting the uses and applications driving the massive increases in networking and data growth , allowing businesses and consumers to use information more effectively to make better decisions . "
Updates on the research will be announced over the course of the next three years , with the initial report slated for publication at the end of 2008 .
At least 66 people were killed in a collision at dawn between two passenger trains in eastern China , state media said .
More than 400 passengers were injured , many of them seriously .
Austrian man Josef Fritzl , 73 , from the town of Amstetten , confessed to imprisoning his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathering her seven children .
Police released photos of the cellar in which they were kept .
They show a concealed network of windowless chambers .
The rooms were equipped for sleeping and cooking , and with sanitary facilities .

Detainee torture : Further proof of US government criminality
By David Walsh
18 June 2008
A damning new study of US treatment of detainees in Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , along with Senate hearings into the origins of the torture inflicted on American - held prisoners , further expose the out - and - out criminality of Bush administration policy and Pentagon operations in Afghanistan , Iraq and around the world .
Despite the efforts of leading Democrats , the revelations also underscore their party ’s complicity in war crimes .
McClatchy Newspapers recently conducted an eight - month review in 11 countries , whose results are being published this week , into the treatment and fate of those imprisoned in Afghanistan , Cuba and elsewhere .
The multi-part series concludes that “ US soldiers beat and abused many prisoners , ” many of whom ( “ perhaps hundreds ” ) were “ wrongfully imprisoned ... on the basis of flimsy or fabricated evidence , old personal scores or bounty payments . ”
McClatchy ’s reporters interviewed 66 former detainees , along with Afghan and US officials and reviewed thousands of pages of US military tribunal documents and other records .
They discovered that most of the detainees they interviewed were “ low - level Taliban grunts , innocent Afghan villagers or ordinary criminals . ”
They also write that , unsurprisingly , “ U.S. detention policies fueled support for extremist Islamist groups .
For some detainees who went home far more militant than when they arrived , Guantánamo became a school for jihad , or Islamic holy war . ”
As a former detainee from Pakistan told McClatchy , “ A lot of our friends are working against the Americans now , because if you torture someone without any reason , what do you expect ? ”
The treatment of prisoners at the Bagram air base north of Kabul in Afghanistan was worse , according to detainees , than anything done at Guantánamo Bay .
Tom Lasseter of McClatchy begins his account of US military conduct at Bagram with these chilling paragraphs , which bring to mind descriptions of the Nazi concentration camps :
“ American soldiers herded the detainees into holding pens of razor - sharp concertina wire , the kind that ’s used to corral livestock .
“ The guards kicked , kneed and punched many of the men until they collapsed in pain .
U.S. troops shackled and dragged other detainees to small isolation rooms , then hung them by their wrists from chains dangling from the wire mesh ceiling . ”
Aminullah , an Afghan imprisoned at Bagram for a little over three months told the reporter , “ At Bagram , when they took a man to interrogation at night , the next morning we would see him brought out on a stretcher looking almost dead . ”
Another Afghan , Nazar Chaman Gul , also held at the hellhole for three months or so , said he was beaten about every five days .
“ American soldiers would walk into the pen where he slept on the floor and ram their combat boots into his back and stomach , Gul said .
‘ Two or three of them would come in suddenly , tie my hands and beat me , ’ he said . ”
Gul ended up in Guantánamo for three years until his release .
He was initially picked up by US soldiers , acting on a tip from a tribal rival who was seeking revenge against another man with a similar name .
At the time he was arrested , Gul was working as a fuel depot guard for the puppet Afghan government .
The reign of brutality at Bagram was so severe that the US military ordered Afghan intelligence officers , hardly known for their sensitivity to civil liberties , out of the facility in mid-2002 .
Mohammed Arif Sarwari , the head of the country ’s national security directorate from late 2001 to 2003 , told McClatchy he considered that to be “ a bad sign : The Americans , he thought , were creating an island with no one to watch over them .
‘ I said I did n’t want to be involved with what they were doing at Bagram — who they were arresting or what they were doing with them , ’ he said in an interview in Kabul . ’ ”
The brutality reached its apparent peak in December 2002 , when , in a now infamous incident , US military personnel “ beat two Afghan detainees , Habibullah and Dilawar , to death as they hung by their wrists . ”
Army Capt .
Christopher Beiring , who commanded the 377th Military Police Company from the summer of 2002 to the spring of 2003 , was “ reprimanded ” for the murders .
Brian Cammack , a former specialist with the 377th , told military investigators , “ Whether they got in trouble or not , everybody struck a detainee at some point . ”
Cammack was sentenced to three months in military confinement and a dishonorable discharge for hitting Habibullah .
According to McClatchy ’s Lasseter , “ Spc. Jeremy Callaway , who admitted to striking about 12 detainees at Bagram , told military investigators in sworn testimony that he was uncomfortable following orders to ‘ mentally and physically break the detainees . ’
He did n’t go into detail .
‘ I guess you can call it torture , ’ said Callaway , who served in the 377th from August 2002 to January 2003 . ”
Capt .
Carolyn Wood , who led the interrogators at Bagram , was then sent to Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and led interrogation operations there .
Lasseter comments laconically , “ Wood remains an active - duty military intelligence officer . ”
The McClatchy series , for all intents and purposes , accuses the Bush administration of war crimes .
It notes : “ The mistreatment of detainees at Bagram , some legal experts said , may have been a violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on prisoners of war , which forbids violence against or humiliating treatment of detainees .
“ The U.S. War Crimes Act of 1996 imposes penalties up to death for such mistreatment .
“ At Bagram , however , the rules did n’t apply .
In February 2002 , President Bush issued an order denying suspected Taliban and al Qaida detainees prisoner - of - war status .
He also denied them basic Geneva protections known as Common Article Three , which sets a minimum standard for humane treatment . ”
The Pentagon refused to reply to a series of 15 detailed questions posed by Lasseter about the abuse at the facilities at Guantánamo , Bagram and Kandahar , nor did they make any personnel , including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs Sandra Hodgkinson and former Department of Defense general counsel William Haynes , available for interviews .
Material released by the Senate Armed Services Committee , in conjunction with its hearing Tuesday , underscores the gangster character of the Bush administration and its CIA and military accomplices .
The hearing , chaired by Michigan ’s Democratic Senator Carl Levin , was scheduled to receive testimony “ on the origins of aggressive interrogation techniques , ” the US political establishment ’s euphemism for torture .
Levin charged , on the basis of documentary evidence , that the office of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld began canvassing military commands for harsher interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , sensory deprivation and stress positions , in July 2002 .
This contradicts previous claims that the techniques were proposed months later , by lower - level officers .
In fact , William Haynes , the Pentagon ’s chief counsel , asked in July 2002 whether Guantánamo interrogators could borrow tactics from a military training program , designed to prepare US military personnel to resist interrogation if captured , known as Survival Evasion Resistance Escape ( SERE ) .
The brutal techniques , listed in an attachment to a July 26 , 2002 memo directed to Haynes ’ office , included “ Facial Slap , ” “ Walling , ” “ Finger Press , ” “ Water , ” “ Waterboard , ” “ Cramped Confinement ( ‘ the little box ’ ) , ” “ Immersion in water / Wetting down , ” “ Isolation , ” “ Degradation , ” “ Sensory overload , ” “ Disruption of sleep and biorhythms ” and “ Manipulation of diet . ”
The documents made public by Levin include the minutes of a meeting at Guantánamo in October 2002 that discussed the techniques proposed and their legal ramifications .
The tone and content of the meeting are conspiratorial and criminal in character .
At one point , Lt. Col.
Diane Beaver , the top military lawyer at the Cuban base at the time ( and one of the witnesses at Tuesday ’s hearing in Washington ) , comments , “ We may need to curb the harsher operations while ICRC [ International Committee of the Red Cross ] is around .
It is better not to expose them to any controversial techniques . ”
Another participant points out that “ sleep deprivation ” is widely used at Bagram .
Beaver continues , “ True , but officially it is not happening .
It is not being reported officially .
The ICRC is a serious concern .
They will be in and out , scrutinizing our operations , unless they are displeased and decided to protest and leave . ”
Chief counsel to the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center Jonathan Fredman then intervenes , arguing that the language of the international statutes on torture “ is written vaguely .
...
Severe physical pain described as anything causing permanent damage to major organs or body parts .
Mental torture described as anything leading to permanent , profound damage to the senses or personality .
It is basically subject to perception .
If the detainee dies you ’re doing it wrong . ”
After Fredman concludes , Beaver puts in , “ We will need documentation to protect us . ”
Fredman : “ Yes , if someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used , regardless of cause of death , the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental .
Everything must be approved and documented . ”
Videotaping the “ harsh techniques ” is ruled out , because “ Videotapes are subject to too much scrutiny in court . ”
A discussion ensues about the “ wet towel ” technique , during which the “ lymphatic system will react as if you ’re suffocating , but your body will not cease to function . ”
In an email dated October 28 , 2002 , Mark Fallon , deputy commander of the Criminal Investigation Task Force at Guantánamo , commented about the minutes of this discussion , “ This looks like the kinds of stuff Congressional hearings are made of . ”
Fallon notes that Beaver ’s comments “ give the appearance of impropriety ” and that “ Other comments ... seem to stretch beyond the bounds of legal propriety . ”
Fallon goes on , “ Talk of ‘ wet towel treatment ’ which results in the lymphatic gland reacting as if you are suffocating , would in my opinion , shock the conscience of any legal body ...
Someone needs to be considering how history will look back at this . ”
Tuesday ’s Armed Services Committee hearing , before which most of the military and Bush administration officials called to testify simply stonewalled , was a thoroughgoing fraud .
Levin and the Democratic Party are accomplices of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the torture and abuse that have inevitably accompanied them .
In a venomous and reactionary editorial Tuesday , the Wall Street Journal rails against Levin and the Democrats for daring to question Bush administration officials about its “ aggressive interrogations , ” but the Journal quite rightly notes the hypocrisy and faintheartedness of the Democrats .
The editorial points out , “ The intelligence committees in both the House and Senate have been briefed on the specific contents of those memos , including the legal rationale for using harsh interrogation techniques in certain circumstances , as well as the techniques that were in fact used .
“ Seven years later , Democrats claim to be especially offended by ‘ waterboarding , ’ which the CIA says was done to only three of the worst al Qaeda suspects .
But both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Intelligence Chairman Jay Rockefeller knew all about waterboarding at the time , and did n’t object . ”
The Washington Post reported in December 2007 that the CIA had provided 30 private briefings , “ some of which included descriptions of that technique [ waterboarding ] and other harsh interrogation methods . ”
The Post wrote that “ The lawmakers who held oversight roles during the period included Pelosi and Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif . ) and Sens. Bob Graham ( D - Fla . ) and John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , as well as Rep. Porter J. Goss ( R - Fla . ) and Sen. Pat Roberts ( R - Kan ) . ”
It seems highly unlikely that Levin , a leading member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees , was unaware of what was going on .
There has been bipartisan support for the so - called “ war on terror ” since its inception .
Every Democratic senator but two voted for the Patriot Act in October 2001 ; the majority of Democrats in the Senate voted in October 2002 to authorize the invasion of Iraq ; Democratic votes made possible the passage of the Military Commissions Act in September 2006 , which denied detainees the right of habeas corpus .
And , of course , the Democrats have made possible the continued allocation of hundreds of billions of dollars for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since they took control of Congress in 2006 .
Okay ; this ’ll be fun .
What ’s the most creative abuse for this that you can think of ?
Previous studies have shown that participants in “ trust games ” took greater risks with their money after inhaling the hormone via a nasal spray .
In this latest experiment , published in the journal Neuron , the researchers asked volunteer subjects to take part in a similar game .
They were each asked to contribute money to a human trustee , with the understanding that the trustee would invest the money and decide whether to return the profits , or betray the subject ’s trust by keeping the profit .
The subjects also received doses of oxytocin or a placebo via a nasal spray .
After investing , the participants were given feedback on the trustees .
When their trust was abused , the placebo group became less willing to invest .
But the players who had been given oxytocin continued to trust their money with a broker .
“ We can see that oxytocin has a very powerful effect , ” said Dr Baumgartner .
“ The subjects who received oxytocin demonstrated no change in their trust behaviour , even though they were informed that their trust was not honoured in roughly 50 % of cases . ”
In a second game , where the human trustees were replaced by a computer which gave random returns , the hormone made no difference to the players ’ investment behaviour .
“ It appears that oxytocin affects social responses specifically related to trust , ” Dr Baumgartner said .

PHILADELPHIA - CLASSROOM
MARK WAHLBERG teaches SCIENCE to a classroom full of middle school students .
It 's exactly as believable as it sounds .
STUDENT
Hey Mr. Wahlberg , how come bees have been dying off in record numbers lately ?
MARK WAHLBERG
Well , you see , it 's an act of nature that nobody will ever understand .
Those crazy scienticians will come up with something just to put it in a book , but ultimately they 're just chumps .
STUDENT
What ?
Who wrote this script , Kirk Cameron ?
MARK'S friend , JOHN LEQUIZAMO , enters the classroom .
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
Hey , there 's a suicide epidemic in New York .
People think terrorists are releasing some toxin in the air that 's causing people to kill themselves .
MARK WAHLBERG
Awesome , disasters in movies tend to serve little purpose other than to unite families with problems .
Perhaps this can fix my rocky marriage .
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
This is serious .
This toxin does n't just make you stop breathing or anything , it makes you go far , far out of your way to kill yourself in the goriest , most dramatic way possible .
To illustrate this , JOHN and MARK watch a high - resolution video on top of a color printout of a hand holding an iPhone , which depicts a guy getting lions to rip his arms off at the zoo .
MARK WAHLBERG
Holy shit , did I really just watch a guy perform Jax 's fatality on himself ?
Are we in Toxic Avenger 5 or something ?
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
We need to get out of the city .
Go home and get your increasingly distant wife and meet me at the train station .
We need to get on a train , because if there 's one place we know terrorists wo n't attack , it 's a vehicle carrying hundreds of people .
MARK goes home to find his wife ZOOEY DESCHANEL .
MARK WAHLBERG
( yawning )
Hey honey , let 's go to the train station to awkwardly progress the story forward without any character motivation .
Or whatever .
Is it lunchtime yet ?
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
Alright , but only if I can pretend I have depth by illuminating a completely superfluous side story about a guy I met at work .
They meet JOHN LEQUIZAMO and travel by train out of the CITY .
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
I can't get my wife on the phone .
I need you to take care of my daughter while I go look for her .
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
No problem , I 'd love to help .
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
I was n't talking to you , you cum - guzzling cunt .
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
My apologies .
I 'll just politely ignore your rudeness and take care of your daughter anyway .
MARK WAHLBERG
And I 'll go ahead and not even defend my wife like the whiny little bitch I am .
JOHN LEQUIZAMO
It 's a good thing you guys are such likable protagonists instead of , for example , completely uninteresting assholes that audiences would hate watching for two hours .
MARK WAHLBERG
Good luck finding your wife .
Make sure to drive everywhere with the windows down since we know that this is an airborne toxin .
He DOES , then listens to MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE and CUTS HIMSELF .
MARK , ZOOEY and JOHN'S DAUGHTER take refuge in an abandoned house for a minute , then for some reason decide to go back outside where the DEADLY TOXINS are .
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
Look , I need to come clean with you .
I ... I had dessert with some guy I met at work .

Oh my God !
Is ' dessert ' some kind of euphemism for letting him take a shit in your mouth after he fucks you or something ?!
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
Er , no .
We had cheesecake .
MARK WAHLBERG
Oh .
Well I 'm going to go ahead and act like it was the other thing !
MARK and ZOOEY sleepwalk their way through some more scenes as the plot progresses itself forward without their involvement .
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
You know , for a movie called ' The Happening , ' there is surprisingly little actually going on .
MARK WAHLBERG
No shit .
Alright , Shyamalan .
Where does this painfully boring roller coaster take us next ?
M NIGHT SHYAMALAN
Let 's see here .
The next thing that happened in " War of the Worlds " was Tom Cruise finding that crazy hermit guy .
I guess we should do that for a few minutes , since I 'm such a fucking hack .
MARK , ZOOEY and JOHN'S DAUGHTER try to outrun the air and eventually make it to a boarded - up HOUSE with a CRAZY HERMIT and stay with her for a bit .
CRAZY OLD BAT
Woohoo , tiger stream junket floating can purse lily munch !
Turd fighter glass breaking eardrum turnip , John !
MARK WAHLBERG
I wonder what totally unexpected twist will happen as a result of your wackiness !
NOTHING happens , and eventually the CRAZY OLD BAT dies .
MARK WAHLBERG
Oh .
I guess her only role was to illustrate that the deadly toxin is , in fact , deadly .
Go close the doors and windows , Zooey .
ZOOEY DESCHANEL
( quizzically )
Why ?
MARK WAHLBERG
Why ?
Did you seriously just ask me that ?
Are you watching a different movie or something ?
Listen up ...
( pause )
The fucking air .
It fucking kills you .
It 's fucking deadly .
Do n't fucking breathe it .
Was this script written by a fucking monkey ?
Suddenly , THE HAPPENING stops HAPPENING , largely because the audience members left to go get a REFUND .
An EXPERT comes on TELEVISION to explain the movie for the benefit of any RETARDED PEOPLE in the AUDIENCE .
TV EXPERT
You see , it seems that plants became tired of the way we treat our environment , so they started releasing a deadly toxin .
TV ANCHORMAN
Why did n't they just stop producing oxygen ?
TV EXPERT
Well where 's the unwatchable pile of garbage of a film in that ?
MARK WAHLBERG
I do n't get it .
We found out it was plants like an hour ago .
Are n't M. Night Shyamalan movies supposed to have some crazy surprise at the end ?
M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN
Surprise , I managed to make a movie worse than " Lady in the Water " !

Wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago , off the west coast of Canada 's British Columbia , will be extinct within 10 years due to parasite contamination from fish farms , according to a study published in the journal " The impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon populations is threatened , " said lead researcher Martin Krkosek , from the University of Alberta .
"
The probability of extinction is 100 percent , " Krkosek said , " and the only question is how long it is going to take .
" Researchers compared the population numbers of different groups of salmon between 1970 and the present , depending on whether they had been exposed to aquaculture salmon farms or not .
Using a computer model of population change over time , the researchers were able to show that exposure to fish farms was causing population growth of wild salmon to be " severely depressed .
"
The effect comes from sea lice , a parasite that naturally infects adult salmon in the open ocean .
The lice infest the skin and muscle of salmon , and adult fish can carry them without suffering serious harm .
Juvenile fish , however , have little defense against such infection and often become seriously sick or die as a result .
" Salmon farming breaks a natural law " by massing adult salmon in large open nets just offshore , said study co-author Alexandra Morton , director of the Salmon Coast Field Station .
"
In the natural system , the youngest salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon that carry the parasite are offshore .
But fish farms cause a deadly collision between the vulnerable young salmon and sea lice .
They are not equipped to survive this , and they don't , " Morton said .
Young wild salmon are exposed to sea lice when they swim past salmon farms on their way from rivers to the open sea .
The researchers concluded that if measures are not taken to stop exposing young fish to sea lice , such as moving fish farms away from the paths of wild fish , wild salmon will be extinct in the archipelago within eight to 10 years .
Among all the people relaxing on the beach at Marco Island , Fla. , earlier this month , Chuck Casto might have ranked as one of the happiest .
And why not ?
His five - day trip with his wife and 7 - year - old daughter marked his first major vacation in nearly seven years .
" It was a great opportunity for us to recharge and spend time together as a family , " says Mr. Casto , a vice president at CSN Stores in Boston , a Web - based business selling home goods .
" The weather was good .
It was just what we needed . "
Casto's vacationless years began when he worked for advertising agencies .
" There 's no break in the action , " he says .
" You just keep going . "
He continued the pattern when he ran his own consulting firm for nearly four years .
" When you 're your own boss , it 's very difficult to carve out time to take a break . "
Now he revels in working for a company that actively encourages people to use their allotted three weeks of time off .
" It 's one of the strong benefits that everyone takes advantage of , " he says .
Other businesses are sending similar messages .
This month PricewaterhouseCoopers , a professional - services firm , kicked off a 10th - anniversary celebration with a day called " Take Your 10 , " urging employees to take their 10 paid holidays , as well as vacation .
To emphasize the importance of time away , the firm distributed a booklet , " Rest and Relaxation : The Value of Time Off , " to all 30,000 employees .
The company 's website also offers suggestions about how to use that time .
Vacation has even become an issue on performance reviews .
" Managers would receive reports about members of their team who had stopped earning vacation because they had reached their cap , " says Michael Fenlon , managing director of people strategy .
" We wanted to change that and build a culture in which uninterrupted work - free vacations were more the norm than the exception . "
For several years , Scott Stevenson , director of advisory practice at Pricewaterhouse­Coopers , did not take all of his vacation days .
" There was almost a feeling of guilt when you took time off , " he says .
Now Mr. Stevenson uses almost all of his allotted four weeks , some of it in half - day increments .
Although he concedes that he still has " a twinge of guilt sometimes , " he says , " I do credit the firm for having us talk about it more , and the need for it , and the value of it to the work we do . "
Although staffing is tight at TripAdvisor , a website in Newton , Mass. , the company encourages all employees to take their vacation .
It even added four summer Fridays to everyone 's holiday schedule .
" The bosses are leading by example , promising to take them all , " says spokesman Brian Payea .
" Everyone gets a minimum of three weeks ' vacation at the start , plus the new summer Fridays . "
The decision by some worker to endure years of vacation deprivation may be extreme , but they symbolize a pattern common to many American workers – a reluctance to take all the vacation days they have earned .
A new poll estimates that 47 million employees will forgo some vacation time in 2008 .
That adds up to 460 million unused days , an average of three " wasted " days per worker , according to Expedia , a travel website .
More than half of respondents to a Yahoo !
HotJobs survey plan to skip their vacation this year to save money .
During a bad economy , in particular , workers may be concerned that going away will make them expendable in the boss 's eyes .
" I do n't think most employers alter vacation policy in light of economic times , " says Kevin Oakes , CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity in Seattle .
" But many employees alter how they take vacations ... because of concern about how their vacation may be viewed by senior management . "
Vacation policies are governed by state laws , not federal .
" Problems come up where the right to the vacation is not well defined in the policy , " says Bruce Clarke , president of Capital Associated Industries , a nonprofit employers ' association .
" Sometimes the language in these policies is ambiguous .
Did they earn it ?
Do they get to keep it when they quit ? "
Some companies adopt a strict use - it - or - lose - it policy , setting a maximum amount of vacation workers can carry over .
In California , that is illegal .
" Workers accrue time pro rata by law , " says Kenneth Sulzer , an attorney at Seyfarth Shaw in Los Angeles .
" People end up with substantial banks of vacation pay .
When they leave , they are entitled to all unused vacation at their current pay rate .
Some of our clients are making people take time off as a way of reducing this big collective vacation bank .
That 's one way the recession is impacting employees ' vacations . "
Whatever a company 's policies or practices , Casto , rested and relaxed after his Florida vacation , remains an enthusiastic convert to the idea that all employees should take their vacation .
He says , " Even those of us who are big workaholics still need that time to regroup and recharge , to get back to being very productive . "
A common phrase that 's bandied about when talking about DomainSpecificLanguages ( or indeed any computer language ) is that of noisy syntax .
People may say that Ruby is less noisy than Java , or that external DSLs are less noisy than internal DSLs .
By Syntactic Noise , what people mean is extraneous characters that are n't part of what we really need to say , but are there to satisfy the language definition .
Noise characters are bad because they obscure the meaning of our program , forcing us to puzzle out what it 's doing .
Like many concepts , syntactic noise is both loose and subjective , which makes it hard to talk about .
A while ago Gilhad Braha tried to illustrate his perception of syntactic noise during a talk at JAOO .
Here I 'm going to have a go at a similar approach and apply it to several formulations of a DSL that I 'm using in my current introduction in my DSL book .
( I 'm using a subset of the example state machine , to keep the text a reasonable size . )
In his talk he illustrated noise by coloring what he considered to be noise characters .
A problem with this , of course , is this requires us to define what we mean by noise characters .
I 'm going to side - step that and make a different distinction .
I 'll distinguish between what I 'll call domain text and punctuation .
The DSL scripts I 'm looking at define a state machine , and thus talk about states , events , and commands .
Anything that describes information about my particular state machine - such as the names of states - I 'll define as domain text .
Anything else is punctuation and I 'll highlight the latter in red .
I 'll start with the custom syntax of an external DSL .
events doorClosed D1CL drawOpened D2OP lightOn L1ON end commands unlockDoor D1UL lockPanel PNLK end state idle actions { unlockDoor lockPanel } doorClosed => active end state active drawOpened => waitingForLight lightOn => waiting ForDraw end
A custom syntax tends to minimize noise , so as a result you see relatively small amount of punctuation here .
This text also makes clear that we need some punctuation .
Both events and commands are defined by giving their name and their code - you need the punctuation in order to tell them apart .
So punctuation is n't the same as noise , I would say that the wrong kind of punctuation is noise , or too much punctuation is noise .
In particular I do n't think it 's a good idea to try to reduce punctuation to the absolute minimum , too little punctuation also makes a DSL harder to comprehend .
Let 's now look at an internal DSL for the same domain information in Ruby .
event : doorClosed , " D1CL " event : drawOpened , " D2OP " event : lightOn , " L1ON " command : lockPanel , " PNLK " command : unlockDoor , " D1UL " state : idle do actions : unlockDoor , : lockPanel transitions : doorClosed => : active end state : active do transitions : drawOpened => : waitingForLight , : lightOn => : waitingForDraw end
Now we see a lot more punctuation .
Certainly I could have made some choices in my DSL to reduce punctuation , but I think most people would still agree that a ruby DSL has more punctuation than a custom one .
The noise here , at least for me , is the little things : the " : " to mark a symbol , the " , " to separate arguments , the ' " ' to quote strings .
One of the main themes in my DSL thinking is that a DSL is a way to populate a framework .
In this case the framework is one that describes state machines .
As well as populating a framework with a DSL you can also do it with a regular push - button API .
Let 's color the punctuation on that .
Event doorClosed = new Event ( " doorClosed " , " D1CL " ) ; Event drawOpened = new Event ( " drawOpened " , " D2OP " ) ; Event lightOn = new Event ( " lightOn " , " L1ON " ) ; Command lockPanelCmd = new Command ( " lockPanel " , " PNLK " ) ; Command unlockDoorCmd = new Command ( " unlockDoo r " , " D1UL " ) ; State idle = new State ( " idle " ) ; State activeState = new State ( " active " ) ; StateMachine machine = new StateMachine ( idle ) ; idle .addTransition ( doorClosed , activeState ) ; idle .addCommand ( unlockDoorCmd ) ; idle .addCommand ( lockPanelCmd ) ; activeState .addTransition ( drawOpened , waitingForLightState ) ; activeState .addTransition ( lightOn , waiting ForDrawState ) ;
Here 's a lot more punctuation .
All sorts of quotes and brackets as well as method keywords and local variable declarations .
The latter present an interesting classification question .
I 've counted the declaring of a local variable as punctuation ( as it duplicates the name ) but it 's later use as domain text .
Java can also be written in a fluent way , so here 's the fluent version from the book .
public class BasicStateMachine extends StateMachineBuilder { Events doorClosed , drawOpened , lightOn ; Commands lockPanel , unlockDoor ; States idle , active ; protected void defineStateMachine ( ) { doorClosed . code ( " D1CL " ) ; drawOpened . code ( " D2OP " ) ; lightOn . code ( " L1ON " ) ; lockPanel . code ( " PNLK " ) ; unlockDoor . code ( " D1UL " ) ; idle .actions ( unlockDoor , lockPanel ) .transition ( doorClosed ) .to( active ) ; active .transition ( drawOpened ) .to( waiting ForLight ) .transition ( lightOn ) . to ( waiting ForDraw ) ; }
Whenever two or three are gathered together to talk about syntactic noise , XML is bound to come up .
< stateMachine start = " idle " > < event name= " doorClosed " code= " D1CL " /> < event name= " drawOpened " code= " D2OP " /> < event name= " lightOn " code= " L1ON " /> < command name= " lockPanel " code= " PNLK " /> < command name= " unlockDoor " code= " D1UL " /> < state name= " idle " > < transition event= " doorClosed " target= " active " /> < action command= " unlockDoor " /> < action command= " lockPanel " /> </ state > < state name= " active " > < transition event= " drawOpened " target= " waiting ForLight " /> < transition event= " lightOn " target= " waiting ForDraw " /> </ state > </stateMachine >
I do n't think we can read too much into this particular example , but it does provide some food for thought .
Although I do n't think we can make a rigorous separation between useful punctuation and noise , the distinction between domain text and punctuation can help us focus on the punctuation and consider what punctuation serves us best .
And I might add that having more characters of punctuation than you do of domain text in a DSL is a smell .

guest post by Tim Silverman
I want to discuss in more detail the modular curves X ( N ) X ( N ) , X 1 ( N ) X_1 ( N ) and X 0 ( N ) X_0 ( N ) , that is , the quotients of the upper half plane H H by Γ ( N ) \ Gamma ( N ) , Γ 1 ( N ) \ Gamma_1 ( N ) and Γ 0 ( N ) \ Gamma_0 ( N ) respectively ( with cusps filled in ) .
These are charismatic entities — for example , you may have seen Greg Egan ’s movie of X ( 7 ) X ( 7 ) , also known as Klein ’s quartic curve :
I also want to talk about the actions of the Hecke operators < d > < d > and T p T_p on modular forms — or at least the corresponding actions on modular curves .
Alas , I do n’t think I ’m going to get there in this post , but I can at least make a start .
But before I talk about all that , I want to talk about Farey sequences !
I was introduced to Farey sequences by a maths teacher at school , when I was about 13 or so , one afternoon when I ’d done all my work and was feeling bored .
They ’re a simple and cute idea , and I found them kind of fascinating , but , not being much of a number theory person , I never looked into them all that deeply .
But one stumbles across these things in the oddest places .
What is a Farey sequence ?
It ’s very simple .
Take all the reduced fractions from 0 to 1 ( inclusive ) with denominators no larger than some maximum n n .
Now arrange them in order of increasing value .
And that ’s a Farey sequence .
Thus Farey sequences include
0 1 , 1 1 \frac{0}{1} , \frac{1}{1}
0 1 , 1 2 , 1 1 \ frac{0}{1} , \frac{1}{2} , \frac{1}{1}
0 1 , 1 3 , 1 2 , 2 3 , 1 1 \ frac{0}{1} , \frac{1}{3} , \frac{1}{2} , \frac{2}{3} , \frac{1}{1}
and so on .
Here ’s the ninth Farey sequence :
0 1 , 1 9 , 1 8 , 1 7 , 1 6 , 1 5 , 2 9 , 1 4 , 2 7 , 1 3 , 3 8 , 2 5 , 3 7 , 4 9 , 1 2 , 5 9 , 4 7 , 3 5 , 5 8 , 2 3 , 5 7 , 3 4 , 7 9 , 4 5 , 5 6 , 6 7 , 7 8 , 8 9 , 1 1 \ frac{0}{1} , \frac{1}{9} , \frac{1}{8} , \frac{1}{7} , \frac{1}{6} , \frac{1}{5} , \frac{2}{9} , \frac{1}{4} , \frac{2}{7} , \frac{1}{3} , \frac{3}{8} , \frac{2}{5} , \frac{3}{7} , \frac{4}{9} , \frac{1}{2} , \frac{5}{9} , \frac{4}{7} , \frac{3}{5} , \frac{5}{8} , \frac{2}{3} , \frac{5}{7} , \frac{3}{4} , \frac{7}{9} , \frac{4}{5} , \frac{5}{6} , \frac{6}{7} , \frac{7}{8} , \frac{8}{9} , \frac{1}{1}
There are some curious facts about Farey sequences .
Here ’s one : if a b \frac{a}{b} and c d \frac{c}{d} appear adjacent to one another in some Farey sequence , then bc − ad = 1 bc - ad=1 .
Here ’s another : if a b \frac{a}{b} and c d \frac{c}{d} appear adjacent to one another in some Farey sequence , then the next fraction which gets inserted between them , as you work your way through the successive Farey sequences , is the fraction a + c b + d \ frac{a+c}{b+d} .
This funny combination is called the mediant of a b \frac{a}{b} and c d \frac{c}{d} , since it always lies between them .
By repeatedly taking mediants , we build up all Farey sequences , and hence get each rational number from 0 0 to 1 1 exactly once .
We can indicate the way that the mediant derives from two parent fractions by drawing lines from the parents to their mediant :
Farey Sequence as tree 0/1 1/1 1/2 1/3 2/3 1/4 3/4 1/5 4/5 2/5 3/
5
A Farey sequence in tree form
Additionally , one of the parents must always derive from the other — it must have been inserted as a mediant itself at some earlier time .
So if a fraction is connected to its parents by a pair of lines , the parents must also be connected to each other .
So these lines actually make up a bunch of triangles , except at the top of the picture where everything starts .
Taking the three numbers at the vertices of a triangle , any one of them can be derived from the other two either as their mediant , a + b c + d \ frac{a + b}{c+d} , or as what we might call their ‘ mediant difference ’ , | a − b c − d | \left \vert \ frac{a - b}{c - d}\right\vert .
In fact every pair of numbers joined by a line belongs to two triangles ( one on either side of the line joining them ) , and one of the triangles will contain their mediant as its third point , while the other will contain their mediant difference instead !
So , can the Farey tree be extended to include fractions outside the interval [ 0 , 1 ] [ 0 , 1 ] ?
That ’s something we might be wondering , and the answer is Yes !
In fact , this would have happened already if we had n’t foolishly forgotten something : we ’ve included fractions with denominators of 1 1 , 2 2 , 3 3 , etc , but we ’ve forgotten to include fractions with denominator 0 0 !
How could we have been so careless ?
Let us remedy this oversight at once !
Including the fraction 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} right at the top of the tree , it turns out that we can actually derive 1 1 \ frac { 1} {1} from this together with 0 1 \ frac{0} {1} , as their mediant , and then we can get 2 1 \ frac { 2} {1} from 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} and 1 1 \ frac { 1}{1} , and so forth , and by building up mediants , we can get all non-negative rational numbers that way .
The whole tree is called the Stern - Brocot tree .
Stern - Brocot tree 1/0 0/1 1/1 2/1 1/2 3/2 1/3 2/3 4/3 5/3 1/4 3/4 5/4 7/4 1/5 4/5 2/5 3/5 6/5 9/5 7/5 8/

Once we ’ve made these extensions , and added an edge connecting 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} and 0 1 \ frac{0} {1} , we see that every fraction in the tree , including the ones right at the top , belongs to a triangle — in fact , it belongs to an infinite number of triangles !
We can just keep forming new mediants from it with its new neighbours forever .
However , an infinite number of triangles hanging off every vertex is rather unmanageable .
Is there some way we can get a toy version , with only a finite number of triangles instead ?
For instance , suppose we mod out the fractions by some natural number N N ?
That is , we mod out both numerator and denominator by N N , taking care not to forget that a b = − a − b \ frac{a} { b}= \ frac{ - a}{ - b} ?
Then many different ℤ \mathbb {Z} - fractions will map to the same ℤ / ( N ) \ mathbb {
Z}/(N ) - fraction , and if we identify the corresponding points , and also , of course , identify the corresponding edges connecting corresponding points , then we will get something finite .
For instance , suppose we take the above tree mod 3 3 ( reducing the fractions where necessary to their lowest form , and bearing in mind that 1 = − 2 1= - 2 , so 1 2 = − 1 − 2 = 2 1 \ frac{1}{2}=\frac{-1}{-2}=\frac{2}{1} ) .
We get this :
Stern - Brocot Mod 3 1/0 0/1 1/1 2/1 2/1 0/1 1/0 1/0 1/0 1/0 1/1 0/1 2/1 1/1 2/1 2/1 1/1 0/1 0/1 0/1 2/1 1/

Or reducing mod 4 4 ( and bearing in mind that − 1 = 3 - 1=3 and − 2 = 2 - 2=2 , we get this :
Stern - Brocot Mod 4 1/0 0/1 1/1 2/1 1/2 1/2 3/1 2/1 0/1 2/1 1/0 1/0 1/0 1/0 1/1 0/1 2/1 3/1 2/1 3/1 3/1 0/

The rule about mediants and mediant differences still applies , but sometimes , with all the swapping of signs , we ’ve switched around which fraction relates to which how !
Anyway , with these trees in hand , all we need to do is identify the vertices and edges correctly , and we ’ll get something interesting and finite .
In fact , while we ’re about it , why not fill in those triangles ?
Then we ’ll get a compact surface !
It will be triangulated , and in fact each vertex will be the apex of just N N triangles ( this is completely obvious in the case of the vertex 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} , but it applies to all vertices ) .
Or , dually , every vertex will stand at the centre of an N N - gon , while each of the triangular faces gives rise , dually , to a vertex at which 3 3 N N - gons meet .
Wait a minute …
That sounds familiar …
Could it be … ?
Yes it is !
The compact surface we have just constructed is none other than X ( N ) X ( N ) , the quotient of H H by Γ ( N ) \ Gamma ( N ) .
Quel surprise !
The fractions mod N N correspond to the cusps , and we can make the dual tiling completely regular if we pick the right constant - curvature metric ( which will need positive curvature for N < 6 N < 6 , negative curvature for N > 6 N>6 , and will have to be flat for N = 6 N=6 ) .
In fact , this also works for the full Stern - Brocot tree , without any modding out , with fractions over all integers .
We can see this either arithmetically or geometrically .
Arithmetically , replace the fraction a b \frac{a}{b} by the element ( a b ) \ left ( \array{a\\b}\right ) in ℤ 2 \ mathbb {Z}^2 .
Of course , SL ( 2 , ℤ ) SL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) acts on this by ordinary matrix multiplication ; indeed , PSL ( 2 , ℤ ) PSL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) acts on it too , more nicely , since switching the signs of both numerator and denominator does n’t affect the value of the fraction .
In particular , if we pick an element of PSL ( 2 , ℤ ) PSL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) such as
( a b c d ) , \ left ( \array{a&b\\c&d}\right ) ,
then those two starting fractions at the top of the tree , 0 1 \ frac{0}{1} and 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} , will get sent , under the action of that group element , to a pair of fractions a c \frac{a}{c} and b d \frac{b}{d} such that a d − b c = − 1 a d - b c= - 1 .
( That minus sign is a result of listing the fractions the ‘ wrong ’ way around ) .
This same relation holds true of any two adjacent elements in a Farey sequence , and since some member of PSL ( 2 , ℤ ) PSL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) is available to send 0 1 \ frac{0} {1} and 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0 } to any adjacent pair , we get all Farey sequences in this way — over all integers , not just in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] [ 0 , 1 ] .
Now , 0 1 \ frac{0}{1} and 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} are joined to each other by an edge , and , being adjacent elements of a Farey sequence , so will their images be .
In addition , each of 0 1 \ frac{0}{1} and 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} is also joined by an edge to 1 1 \ frac { 1} {1} , their mediant .
But the mediant of fractions corresponds simply to the sum in ℤ 2 \ mathbb {Z}^2 ( considered as a ℤ \ mathbb{ Z} - module ) .
And obviously the sum relation is preserved by PSL ( 2 , ℤ ) PSL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) .
So if 0 1 \ frac{0} {1} gets sent to a c \frac{a}{c} and 1 0 \ frac { 1}{0} gets sent to b d \ frac{b}{d} , then 1 1 \ frac { 1} {1} gets sent to the mediant of a b \frac{a}{b} and c d \frac{c}{d} , meaning that the other two sides of that top triangle 0 1 \ frac{0} {1} - 1 0 \ frac{1}{0} - 1 1 \ frac {1}{1} are also preserved — sent to sides of a triangle in the image .
So triangles are sent to triangles .
Moreover , since the relation of being the mediant ( or sum ) of the other two vertices — as opposed to their mediant difference ( or difference ) — uniquely picks out one vertex of a given triangle , and since the sign of the determinant — or , more simply , which of the parent vertices is larger — uniquely picks an orientation of the triangle , each triangle is sent to another triangle in only one way .
So PSL ( 2 , ℤ ) PSL ( 2 , \ mathbb {Z} ) acts freely on the set of triangles , and of course preserves their relations .
Geometrically , as we can see from Don Hatch ’s nice Hyperbolic Tesselations web page , the tilings of the hyperbolic plane by regular n n - gons , 3 3 meeting at each vertex , have a limiting case with a tiling by what one might call regular ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gons , or regular ∞ \infty - gons , with an infinite number of sides !
They appear in the website as {infinity , 3} :
Dually , we get a tiling by triangles , an infinite number of which meet at the ‘ centre ’ of each ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gon .
These triangles correspond precisely to the triangles in the Stern - Brocot tree .
Rather confusingly , however , in the Poincaré disk model , the ‘ centre ’ of a ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gon appears at the edge of the disk — that ’s the sort of thing that happens when you have an infinite number of sides and are trying to show them all in a bounded region .
If we compare the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane with the ‘ upper half - plane ’ model , we see that the real line of the latter goes to the boundary circle of the former .
The ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gons , drawn in the Poincaré disk , are all tangent to the boundary circle , each with its own distinct point of tangency , and these points correspond precisely to the rational numbers ( together with ∞ \infty ) .
In turn , these rational numbers are the ones in the Stern - Brocot tree , i.e. at the vertices of the triangles , which can also be seen as tiling the hyperbolic plane , dually to the ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gons .
In this way , we also get to label each ℤ \mathbb {Z} - gon by a unique rational number , and this is inherited when we go over to the version mod N N — fractions also being reduced mod N N .
Given all this , one way to try and understand the way that geometry and arithmetic interact in X ( N ) X ( N ) is by working our way down the Stern - Brocot tree mod N N , which will correspond to working our way outward from one of the N N - gons in X ( N ) X ( N ) .
What we ’re going to see is a series of concentric circles of fractions with successively incrementing denominators .
But that , I think , is something for another post .

When Senior Assistant Attorney General Christopher Krueger was leaving home to represent the state in opposing same - sex marriage during a historic hearing before the California Supreme Court in March , his wife kissed him on the lips and said , " Good luck , but I hope you lose . "
He did .
The justices voted 4 - 3 in May to strike down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage .
Since then , some of Krueger 's colleagues have teased him with remarks like , " Congratulations .
We know you lost , but we liked the result . "
These ideological fissures in Krueger 's household , among his co-workers in the attorney general 's office and even within the gay community itself echo society 's deep split over same - sex marriage .
This evening , some county clerks in California will stay open late to start issuing marriage licenses and officiating the exchange of vows for gay and lesbian couples - the first of thousands of same - sex marriages expected in the coming days .
It 's a bold step that has been hailed by many gay - rights advocates as a significant milestone while being attacked by opponents as an unmistakable sign of societal decay .
As of Friday evening , 646 same - sex couples had booked appointments to get marriage licenses at San Francisco City Hall over the next 10 days - one couple will be wed just after 5 p.m. today , and there are 165 appointments and dozens of same - sex marriage ceremonies at City Hall set for Tuesday .
Gay - rights leaders hope the landmark California Supreme Court decision will set off a chain reaction that will influence other states to legalize gay marriage .
But the latest wave of same - sex marriages may be short - lived .
The court 's ruling could be undone when California voters are asked on Nov. 4 to decide an initiative sponsored by conservative religious and legal organizations .
It would revise the California Constitution to prohibit same - sex marriages by defining marriage as a union " between a man and a woman . "
It is , and will continue to be , one of the most politically volatile debates of our time .
Change came slowly
For generations , homosexuality in America was ignored , ridiculed or whispered about - producing a climate of fear , hatred and sometimes violence .
When it was discussed , the resulting arguments sometimes tore families , churches and communities apart .
Many gays and lesbians lived in fear of exposure , harassment and assault .
The shunning of homosexuals - along with the stigma attached to gay and lesbian couples - fueled hate crimes , despair and suicide .
In recent decades , gay - rights advocates argued that a whole class of people - gay men , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender people - were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation .
Over the past 30 years or so , that view won increasing acceptance in the Bay Area and other metropolitan regions , yet many people in California and other states are reluctant to embrace the concept of same - sex marriage .
Defenders of traditional family values , including representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian groups , have sponsored a long - running effort to win over Americans - hoping to convince voters that the sacred union of marriage holds little or no room for same - sex couples .
A recent Field Poll showed that a slim majority of state voters - 51 percent - said same - sex marriage should be legal in California .
It was the first time in 30 years of polling that a Field Poll showed supporters of same - sex marriage commanding a majority .
But the California electorate is fickle , and polls provide only a snapshot of public sentiment .
" Californians today are deeply divided on this issue and have very strong differences along party lines , " said Mark Baldassare , president of the Public Policy Institute of California .
" Bay Area residents , more than any other region in the state , are supportive of same - sex marriage .
Younger voters are more likely to support same - sex marriage than older voters .
So there is definitely a generational difference . "
Gay rights leaders believe that a slow - brewing cultural shift has occurred in America , resulting in greater acceptance of gay and lesbian couples .
TV tells the tale
" When I was a kid , you did n't see the word ' gay ' or ' homosexual ' in the newspaper .
You did n't see gay people on TV , and it just was n't talked about , " said Howard Bragman , a longtime Hollywood publicist and founder of Fifteen Minutes , a public relations firm .
" You 'd come home from school and watch ' Leave it to Beaver ' or ' My Three Sons . '
But now kids are coming home and watching openly gay characters on ' Will & Grace ' or MTV . "
Sparked by the gay pride movement in the 1970s , legal protections for gays , lesbians and bisexuals have increased - especially in places like California , which adopted state domestic partnership laws in 1999 and 2003 , and Massachusetts , whose high court has upheld the right of same - sex couples to marry .
" Suddenly we were n't invisible , and the most powerful act you could do was to come out of the closet , " Bragman said .
" We know it sends a message to young people that they are not alone , that they have positive role models .
Now , you have gay clubs in high schools .
... I 've seen remarkable progress .
We have made remarkable strides . "
Increased media exposure of gays and lesbians on TV , including reports about the lesbian daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney , the growing political and economic clout of the gay community , the accelerating influence of the Internet , and the movement of gay couples to the suburbs have all contributed to greater tolerance for gays and lesbians .
Comedian Ellen DeGeneres , pop singer Elton John , pro tennis player Martina Navratilova , Massachusetts politician Barney Frank and actress / talk show host Rosie O'Donnell are among the big - name celebrities who have come out , while others have chosen to protect their privacy .
DeGeneres was nearly blackballed from television after declaring that she was lesbian , but has since thrived as the host of her own TV talk show .
Soon after the state high court cleared the way for same - sex marriage , DeGeneres announced her engagement to her longtime partner , Portia de Rossi .
" We are all the same people , all of us .
You 're no different than I am .
Our love is the same , " DeGeneres told Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive GOP presidential nominee , when she needled him about his views on same - sex marriage during his guest appearance on her show .
" When someone says , ' You can have a contract , and you 'll still have insurance , and you 'll get all that , ' it sounds to me like saying , ' Well , you can sit there , you just ca n't sit there . ' "
When the Arizona senator disagreed with her , DeGeneres joked : " So , you 'll walk me down the aisle ?
Is that what you 're saying ? "
McCain backs the November ballot measure to limit marriage to a man and a woman .
It still takes acts of courage for gays and lesbians to come out .
About 30 states do not have laws on the books that protect gay employees from being fired because of their sexual orientation .
Fear of exposure is " an everyday worry for gay and lesbian people , " said John Amaechi , a retired NBA basketball player who wrote a book about his homosexuality titled " Man in the Middle . "
" The only two groups of people in which hate crimes have increased in recent history have been people who have been perceived to be gay and people who have been perceived to be Middle East in origin , " Amaechi said .
" Whilst many have become more reasonable , many have become more militant . "
Religious opposition
Opponents of same - sex marriage have framed various religious , social , moral , legal and economic arguments why the institution of marriage should be limited to opposite - sex couples .
They hold that marriage has always been defined as being for a man and a woman , and has been afforded special legal status , because it is the most effective way for society to foster the procreation of children and the best prescription for raising children .
" Why do we have to change our historical understanding of marriage ? " asked Everett Rice of the California Family Council , a nonprofit lobbying group that focuses on helping families stay together .
" Those who advocate for changing the definition of marriage are actually asking us to change that which we as a society have held to be valid since the beginning of this nation . "
Rice dismissed the notion that the state should endorse same - sex marriage to avoid discriminating against gay and lesbian couples .
" In California , every specific benefit is already granted to a homosexual couple .
The state has already sanctioned their relationship , " he said .
Benjamin Lopez , a lobbyist for the Traditional Values Coalition of interdenominational faiths , including 8,300 churches in California , said permitting same - sex marriage is likely to result in churches being " forced to fall on their knees to perform services that the state deems politically correct and churches would find morally reprehensible . "
Lopez accused the gay community of hypocrisy , advocating for the separation of church and state when it is convenient , but insisting that the state legalize same - sex marriage .
" All this time , the gay community has beaten on the drum of , ' Get out of our bedrooms , stay out of our lives .
We just want to live our lives in peace , ' " he said .
" But now you 're going to find those same people meddling in the affairs of the church . "
Lopez also said that " it 's very important for kids to be raised in an environment where there is a father and a mother in the home . "
" That is the nurturing bond that keeps families and communities together , and it also produces the best form of a productive citizen that any society deserves , " he said .
" There is no true substitute for a mother and no true substitute for a father .
As loving as two men or two women purport themselves to be , there will always be that void and vacuum to be filled that only the opposite sex can bring . "
Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , agreed .
" It all comes down to one thing :
What is in the best interest of children - not what is in the best interest of adults .
That 's narcissistic , " Donohue said .
Some gays oppose the court 's decision , but for different reasons .
Gay - rights activists Leland Traiman and Stewart Blandon submitted a legal brief supporting the state attorney general 's position , based on the argument that allowing same - sex marriages would precipitate a political backlash against gay and lesbian couples .
" The push for marriage per se is a disastrous strategy for our community , " Traiman said in an interview .
" The bubbling , irrational exuberance of gay men in lining up to be married will be paid for by the loss of rights of other lesbians and gay men in other states of our country .
The better strategy is to be working for federal civil unions , which would give us all the federal rights of marriage . "
State Supreme Court Justice Carol Corrigan , who was among the three dissenters in the court 's ruling , agreed with the state attorney general 's position that same - sex marriage rights were best conferred by the people and not the courts .
" When ideas are imposed , " she wrote , " opposition hardens and progress may be hampered . "
' Only a matter of time '
Supporters of the court 's decision insist that conservatives are missing the point .
Publicist Bragman , who plans to soon marry his longtime partner , horse trainer Chuck O'Donnell , sums up the campaign by conservatives against same - sex marriage as " fear and ignorance . "
Contrary to the views of conservatives , he said , providing marriage licenses to same - sex couples will result in " more love and commitment in society , " not less .
" During the Civil War , some people used the Bible to defend holding slaves .
That does n't make it right , " Bragman said .
" Even if same - sex marriage is repudiated by the voters , I take comfort in the fact that it 's going to happen .
It 's only a matter of time . "
Bragman noted that the state Supreme Court 's 121 - page majority opinion striking down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage was written by Chief Justice Ronald George , a Republican , whose majority opinion was joined by three other Republicans .
He also stressed that same - sex couples have been denied the legal rights of marriage under federal law , including tax benefits received by traditional married couples .
" I do n't want partial civil rights .
I want the whole kit and caboodle , " Bragman said .
" I want every right that everyone else has , because I pay as much or more in taxes as everyone else does . "
He and other gay leaders stress that procreation has never been the sole purpose of state marriage laws , and that opposite - sex couples are permitted to marry whether or not they plan to have children .
Politicians tread carefully
Same - sex marriage remains a politically treacherous minefield .
In March 2000 , California voters approved Proposition 22 - a ballot initiative that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman - by a landslide of 61 percent to 39 percent .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 's 2004 decision to issue about 4,000 marriage licenses to same - sex couples was a risky move that , depending on how the marriage issue plays out , could buoy or sink his greater political ambitions .
Sen . Barack Obama of Illinois , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , supports civil unions and equal rights for same - sex couples , but has said that marriage itself should be between a man and a woman .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has also straddled the dicey issue of same - sex marriage - voicing support for civil unions for gay and lesbian couples , but taking switchbacks along the way .
The governor , known for his " Do n't be girlie men " taunt to state legislators for not passing the budget , urged state Attorney General Bill Lockyer in 2004 to intervene immediately to stop same - sex marriages in San Francisco .
In 2005 , Schwarzenegger vetoed a same - sex marriage bill , saying the matter should be decided not by the state Legislature but by either the courts or another vote by the people .
More recently , the governor has reiterated his opposition to a constitutional amendment that would overturn the court 's decision .
" I was comfortable with defending the marriage laws because California is not a state that hates gay people , " said Krueger of the state attorney general 's office .
" If this was a state that not only excluded gays and lesbians from marriage , but also deprived them of the rights and benefits of marriage such as everything from child custody to the right to have their unions recognized , it would have been hard to defend . "

I ’ve been seeing a lot of scantily - clad people in mainstream media and it got me thinking , what exactly do people consider sexy ?
I mean , I know “ sex sells ” , but sometimes mainstream media ’s just taking it too far , to the point that people themselves apply this belief on a daily basis , making it seem like everything is alright indecent or otherwise .
I might sound like I ’m whining , but it seems like this kind of lewd sexiness is being extremely sensationalized in television , the magazines and even in video games , and even if it ’s appealing , too much of it will have repercussions .
Call me old - fashioned , but actresses like Audrey Hephburn , Cate Blanchet and Kate Beckinsale are ladies who I find as sexy , as opposed to someone who ’s scantily - clad ( which most people would consider sexy nowadays ) .
Their beauty enchanced by the way they carry themselves with their grace and elegance is what I consider ‘ true sexiness ’ .
Sadly I ’m afraid that sooner or later this kind of beauty will be all but forgotten thanks to what people percieve as ‘ sexy ’ .
I just hope it ’s not too late to change it .

It was near midnight at the Railway Club , a posh spot at the train station in Gorakhpur , close to the Nepal border .
Hundreds of guests had gathered four hours earlier to eat made - to - order dosas and Indian - Chinese fusion finger - foods , to watch green , red and gold fireworks explode over palm trees and to dance to bass - heavy Bollywood tracks .
My cousin ’s wedding would soon begin .
A family astrologer had recommended the date and advised that the wedding start after 10 p.m. and conclude before 4 a.m .
Those last hours would end six days of ceremonies , the first reunion of my maternal family in two decades and my first full Hindu wedding .
They would also end my uncle ’s efforts to arrange a marriage , and a future , for my cousin .
All of it -- the years spent selecting a suitor , the final minutes of anticipation , the newness of the couple , a man and woman not shaped by former loves and heartbreaks -- was romantic in a way I had n’t expected .
Growing up in America for all my 25 years , I ’d long ago given up on the tradition , but by midnight , I had started to wonder .
Advertisement
What I never realized , as a googly - eyed adolescent who had imagined eloping with a George Clooney type , was that “ love marriage , ” as many Indians call it , is the aberration .
Arranged marriages are common in countries and cultures that came belatedly to Romanticism and rock ‘ n ’ roll and whatever else gave rise to what we call youth .
It ’s difficult to quantify them because the term is such a broad one -- encompassing a childhood betrothal and a parent ’s mere suggestion of a vetted match .
My cousin ’s arrangement was closer to the latter .
Her father found Vishal through one of my paternal cousins .
Shockingly for this conservative swath of north India , sometimes called the “ cow belt , ” he set a date for them to meet without a chaperon .
“ He looked better in person than in photographs , ” Garima Upadhya , 26 , said , recalling their first meeting .
“ He was always laughing and joking . ”
Advertisement
They next met at their engagement party in Gonda , Garima ’s hometown .
Two months after that they would be married ; the all - nighter wedding would be the most time they ’d spent together .
That ’s still more time than my mother had with my father before marrying him in 1969 , in the same house where Garima was raised .
They met face to face when my father looped a garland around my mother ’s neck at their wedding .
They moved to the U.S. within months .
My father attended school while my mom improved her spoken English by watching daytime television , the teacher to so many immigrant women .
Whereas Garima called her sister ’s cellphone only hours after driving off with her husband , my mother had to save up for a short , staticky call home .
Advertisement
She tried to hold on to her old life and customs , but when she patted the part of her hair with sindoor , a red powder many Indian women wear to denote their marital status , Americans worried that she was bleeding .
She wears it only for special occasions now , and so , for Garima ’s wedding , she applied sindoor and piled on the other many accessories of married Indian women : thick gold bangles , anklets , toe rings , a wedding ring and a mangal sutra -- a gold - and - black beaded necklace .
Beside her , I felt nakedly unmarried and young .
For five nights , the guests arrived at dusk at the house in Gonda .
Advertisement
The first ceremony was the sangeet , a sort of bachelorette party .
A crowd of 200 women drummed tablas , danced and sang funny ad - libbed songs about the groom .
I had seen one sangeet in the U.S. , performed on a stage by a handful of women .
It was more a folk art display than a boisterous , inclusive party .
Still , it was something .
The next day brought a ceremony that ’s rare in India because it requires a body of water within walking distance .
A nain -- a jack - of - all - female - trades hired to preside -- began the ceremony by painting in red ink a thick line around each woman ’s feet , in the manner of Hindu goddesses and old - time Bollywood actresses .
The ink would last longer than the days of celebration .
She made sure to break mine at the heel , signifying that I was unmarried .
Then the nain led us , a line of singing , sari - clad women darting between motorcycles and rickshaws , to the nearest pond .

There , my mother dug a mound of dirt that we would take back to Garima .
In an earlier time , Garima would have sculpted it into a hearth for her new home .
My grandfather explained the ritual .
“ The bride is being uprooted from her family , ” he said in his nimble English .
“ And so the women uproot the soil . ”
While we sang and prayed , Garima packed and gabbed constantly with her future husband on her cellphone .
Despite her unabashedly joyful voice , I still found myself wondering why she decided to have an arranged marriage .
All our cousins had had “ love marriages ” and had still won parental approval , however reluctant .
My parents have never expected me to have an arranged marriage , even if they praise the practice and occasionally name - drop eligible bachelors .

Garima was never the shrinking Indian ideal of a girl .
She was brash and essentially American like me , and always had been .
When I visited India every two or three summers , we were inseparable .
At about age 5 , in matching miniature bridal saris , we vied to see who would receive more compliments .
A few years later , we were disrespectful to our elders ; we talked back and threw tantrums .
As teens , we bragged about boys , despite our meager experience with them .
She was mostly obedient to her father , who forbade her from talking to boys out of earshot .
I was shy , studious and either was ignored or mocked by boys .
Now , Garima was lecturing me on love .
Advertisement
“ Swati , ” she explained to me in her slightly patronizing English , “ love grows with time .
You do n’t just fall into it . ”
It did n’t matter that I had been in love before -- the kind you fall into , the kind that does grow with time , but breaks , perhaps because no arrangement , no contract , no children held it together .
It did n’t count because it was unsanctioned by marriage .
My grandfather made this clear when he sat idly reading my palm one afternoon , a small - time hobby for him , an 84 - year - old criminal defense attorney .
He observed the two creases between my pinky and heart line .
“ And you will have one great love , ” he said .
Advertisement
“ But there are two lines , ” I said .
He paused , raising my hand to his glassy brown eyes , and stared hard at the unmistakable pair of lines .
“ I see only one , ” he said .
“ And it is yet to come . ”
By my family ’s standards , my spinsterhood is imminent .
An arranged marriage had always been an appealing Plan B -- if I failed at romance or a career , if I got tired of being alone and wanted a family , my parents could simply find me a gainfully employed man , as long as I was still fairly young and decent - looking and virginal , not too tan or too irreligious , not a smoker or a drinker .
( I have trouble with some of those ; I wo n’t say which . )

Garima explained why she opted for an arranged marriage one afternoon , after we had spent some time recalling the boys she had crushes on in high school .
“ I know Papa would never choose anyone but the best husband for me , ” she said .
I had heard the reasoning before -- from my parents , mostly .
It assumes that one ’s parents know one best .
That might have been true for Garima , who had never lived apart from family , who had never had an actual boyfriend and had few secrets to keep .
But by accident of birth , I had been an American child and dorm - dwelling student , a great keeper of hidden diaries , a believer in privacy .
Since I was 18 , I had scrupulously hidden parts of my life from my family , collecting and losing loves , as it seems women must to grow up .
But why should I believe that the secrets I keep are what make me most me ?
When I ’m in India , surrounded by the comfort and community of my big family , by Garima ’s glowing youth and uncanny wisdom , that seems too American a notion .

For two hours before her wedding , Garima waited for her groom .
She wore her wedding lehnga , a deep - magenta full skirt and fitted blouse , all embroidered with silver and gold thread and blue , pink and silver beads .
She sat still so as not to upset her veil , or her heavy gold - and - ruby nose ring , a hoop the size of a silver dollar connected to matching earrings with a chain across her cheek .
A necklace dripped from her collarbone to her waist , and a dozen bangles were stacked on each arm .
She was overwhelmingly beautiful , and seeing her made me indulge in a girlish daydream of my future wedding , which as a child I envisioned as white , but which I had years ago started to see in pink and red and gold .
Garima , her sister and her female cousins were hiding , waiting for the baraat -- the groom ’s party -- to arrive .
We peeked through curtained windows , hoping to catch a glimpse of the men dancing down the red carpet , and the groom emerging from his horse - drawn carriage .

When the baraat finally arrived , as fireworks erupted and spelled , in English , “ Garima Weds Vishal , ” my family greeted them , offering the groom sweets and a quick prayer .
We women stayed hidden , holding Garima ’s train above the dusty floor as she extended a solitary arm out a tinted glass door to toss rice toward the groom .
Finally , when she appeared , she looked dutifully melancholy .
As the couple stood onstage before the crowd and exchanged flower garlands -- like exchanging wedding rings -- she had only the faintest flicker of a smile .
Vishal ’s grin was broad , but mostly , Garima ’s lips were pouted , her head bowed .
That expression held as the bride and groom walked seven times around the fire , as the groom ’s sister tied a knot with their two scarves , as their parents washed the couple ’s feet .
I was sure it was exhaustion , the oppressive weight of her clothes , nerves , an act -- as the good , sad daughter .
It could n’t be what my mother had felt at her wedding .
I wondered as a child , seeing my mom ’s expression in photographs , if she had been forced into marriage , if she loved my dad , if they should divorce .
But by the time the wedding ended at 4 a.m. , it became clear to me how sincere Garima ’s sadness was .
She had one journey to make alone , while her husband waited in his car .
It was the bidai -- the parting .

The family lined up to say goodbye .
Garima ’s tears , initially just shining around her eyes , began to fall thickly .
Her shoulders heaved , and soon she was wailing , a long , loud , high wail , bursting forth from a sadness I could n’t understand .
It scared the emotion out of me ; I felt like an alien American , who would never know this strange mix of pain and exhilaration that all the women in my family had known .
Just before Garima reached me , just as I had finished rehearsing what I would say to her in the most profound Hindi I could muster , she cried for her sister , who rushed to her .
She sobbed for her father to take her home , but instead , they walked her to the car .
Outside , the sun was rising .
Usually , I am the one embracing a line of tearful relatives to say goodbye .
This is what I did the day after the wedding , except Garima was n’t there .
There was little crying -- the wedding had exhausted us .
I thanked my grandfather for teaching me about some ceremonies .
He replied in short , sharp English : “ Do n’t write about it .
Do it . ”

It might have been a simple nudge toward marriage , but I could n’t help but hear the same infuriating drop - your - job , find - a- man advice of too many bestselling American books .
My grandfather , with his broad shoulders and bullhorn voice , just needed fewer words .
And they cut more deeply , because I knew that I could n’t just “ do it . ”
It ’s too late for me to have a rite of passage that combines a wedding , prom and first date and moving out of your parents ’ house and in with a man .
I moved down the rest of the line thinking deeply on the tradition I was rejecting by living the way I do .
Seeing that tradition as a boisterous , living spectacle had made it harder to dismiss , and harder to see my choices as inevitable or obvious or easy .
Garima ’s younger sister was last in line .
We were now the only unmarried ones in the family .
Though that status signified so much for me -- ambition and freedom , failure and loneliness -- for her it was an unremarkable fact .
At 23 , she could switch it off like a light by asking her father to find someone .
Advertisement
She gave me a long hug , and I asked jokingly when I should book my next ticket , for her wedding .
She smiled and uttered the most reassuring words I ’d heard in a while :
“ Do n’t wait for a wedding . ”
Epilogue : After a honeymoon in Goa and a month getting to know the in - laws in Gorakhpur , Garima moved to Vishal ’s apartment in Gurgaon , a rich , sprawling New Delhi suburb .
He works as a computer engineer while she gets to know her new city and circle of friends .
She seems happy .
For me , returning to the United States always requires forgetting the realities of my Gonda days -- that pink can be worn with orange ; that hot showers are a luxury ; that marriages can be made by people other than those doing the marrying .
It took a few weeks to readjust to my life here , but now that I have , only with deliberate effort can I recall what appealed to me about my cousin ’s way of marriage .
But then I imagine myself in her place , and it is not unappealing .

A drug already on the market for a completely unrelated condition could be used to treat a form of mental retardation linked to autism — if the results of a study in mice hold up , researchers report .
Scientists used rapamycin — a medication doctors prescribe to patients who have had transplants to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organs — to treat learning disorders associated with a disease called tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) in mice .
TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes brain tumors , seizures , learning disabilities , skin lesions and kidney tumors in the 50,000 Americans and one million people worldwide who have the disease .
Half of those with TSC are autistic , and as many as one in five people with the condition also suffer from mental retardation , so the hope is that rapamycin may be used to treat learning disabilities and short - term memory deficits in all kinds of autism as well , says neurobiologist and co-author of a study in Nature Medicine , Alcino Silva of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Silva and his colleagues created mice with TSC by removing one copy of the gene TSC2 .
( If researchers delete both copies of the gene , the resulting mice die shortly after birth . )
When the both copies of the gene are turned on in either mice and humans , they produce and regulate proteins that help strengthen connections between nerve cells , which the brain needs to remember and learn .
The TSC mice performed poorly in various learning tests , such as recalling where a platform was in a pool of water and distinguishing between cages based on what was inside them .
In the mice , Silva says , " learning and memory are disrupted just like they [ are ] affected in most patients with tuberous sclerosis . "
So why try rapamycin ?
The team got the idea , Silva says , after they realized the drug regulates one of the proteins that the TSC gene does , just in different parts of the body .
When they tried the experiment in animals three to six months of age — well into adulthood for mice , according to Silva — rapamycin leveled the playing field between normal and TSC mice in as little as three days .
" What was surprising is that we could give rapamycin to adult mice and reverse their condition , " Silva explains .
" We did not know … that this drug would be equally effective for the learning disabilities " as it is for tissue rejection .
Rapamycin costs about $ 1,000 per month for transplant recipients .
It suppresses the immune system in the body — which is necessary to thwart tissue rejection .
There are , however , the expected side effects from a drug that suppresses the immune system : impaired wound healing , infections , mouth sores and , in rare instances , skin cancer .
In addition to the learning deficits , Silva says his team has " early , positive signs " from mouse models that rapamycin may also be able to treat the kidney tumors , skin lesions , brain tumors and epilepsy associated with TSC .
David Franz , director of the Tuberous Sclerosis Clinic at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , adds that the drug reduced kidney and brain tumors in small clinical trials he has conducted .
The results of the new work are similar to findings in two other diseases related to autism — fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome .
Scientists were able to reverse mental retardation in mice suffering both of those illnesses , as well .
Put together , Silva says , these results suggest that researchers are beginning to find brain malfunctions that cause autism — and may be possible to reverse .
These studies " suggest that we 're about to have a paradigm shift in how we look at developmental disorders , like autism , " he explains .
These illnesses should no longer be viewed as something a person is born with , according to Silva , who believes these disorders can be eliminated by altering the brain 's biochemistry .
Franz agrees that rapamycin can profoundly modify TSC — but , he notes that the mice in this study only show some of the learning disabilities seen in the disease .
He thinks , however , that Silva may be overreaching in extending its benefit to all autism sufferers .
" You might make them better , " he says , " but I do n't think you 're going to normalize them . "
The next step , Silva says , is a clinical trial of rapamycin in humans with TSC .
That study is already underway at the University of Cambridge in England .
Mozilla issued its 13th update to alternative browser Firefox 2 , fixing six issues , two of which the company called critical .
" Some vulnerabilities and weaknesses have been reported in Mozilla Firefox , which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions , disclose potentially sensitive information , conduct cross-site scripting and phishing attacks , and potentially compromise a user 's system , " security firm Secunia said of the fixes .
According to advisories , some of the problems also affect Thunderbird and SeaMonkey .
Of the critical issues , " several " issues were fixed that appeared to be memory corruption issues .
Mozilla presumes that arbitrary code could be executed with enough effort .

That issue , as well as the other critical update which deals with privilege escalation and code execution risk in Mozilla products , can be exploited through JavaScript .
Scripts could be run with elevated privileges and the browser could be used to run cross - site scripting and code execution , it said .
Two high priority fixes were also issued , which dealt with an XUL popup spoof , an a Java issue that could allow for the opening of arbitrary ports on a user 's system .
Those issues only affected Firefox and SeaMonkey ,
Other than that , a moderately rated fix was issued for an HTTP referrer spoofing risk , and a low - priority fix for a privacy issue with SSL client authentication .

Boris Johnson has won the race to become the next mayor of London - ending Ken Livingstone 's eight - year reign at City Hall .
The Conservative candidate won with 1,168,738 first and second preference votes , compared with Mr Livingstone 's 1,028,966 on a record turnout of 45 % .
He paid tribute to Mr Livingstone and appeared to offer him a possible role in his new administration .
Lib Dem Brian Paddick came third and the Greens ' Sian Berry came fourth .
Mr Johnson is expected to stand down as MP for Henley , triggering a by - election .
' Exuberant nerve '
After signing his official declaration of office at City Hall , he urged people to help build upon the " very considerable achievements of the last mayor of London " .
In his victory speech , he described Mr Livingstone as " a very considerable public servant " .
FIRST AND SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES Boris Johnson : 1,168,738 Ken Livingstone : 1,028,966
Analysis : Boris 's big win The Boris Johnson Story He added : " You shaped the office of mayor .
You gave it national prominence and when London was attacked on 7 July 2005 you spoke for London . "
Mr Johnson also paid tribute to his " courage and the sheer exuberant nerve with which you stuck it to your enemies , especially in New Labour " .
Mr Johnson told Mr Livingstone he hoped to " discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London " .
Mayoral voting by constituency
He said he would work to earn the trust of those that had opposed him , or who had hesitated before voting for him .
" I will work flat out to repay and to justify your confidence .
We have a new team ready to go into City Hall .
" Where there have been mistakes we will rectify them , where there are achievements we will build on them , where there are neglected opportunities we will seize on them . "
Livingstone ' sorry '
He promised to focus on crime by promoting 24 - hour policing , transport , including promoting cycling , green spaces , affordable homes and getting value for money for taxpayers .
Mr Johnson 's victory crowns the Conservative Party 's May Day local election wins in England and Wales .
FIRST PREFERENCE VOTES Boris Johnson ( Tory ) : 1,043,761 Ken Livingstone ( Lab ) : 893,877 Brian Paddick ( Lib Dem ) : 236,685 Sian Berry ( Green ) : 77,374 Richard Barnbrook ( BNP ) : 69,710 Alan Craig ( Christian Choice ) : 39,249 Gerard Batten ( UKIP ) : 22,422 Lindsey German ( Left List ) : 16,796 Matt O'Connor ( Eng Democrats ) : 10,695 Winston McKenzie ( Ind ) : 5,389
Livingstone 's highs and lows
He said he hoped it showed the party had changed " into a party that can be trusted after 30 years with the greatest , most cosmopolitan , multi-racial generous hearted city on earth " .
Mr Livingstone 's defeat ended what Gordon Brown called a " bad " day for Labour , in which it suffered its worst council results for 40 years .
Asked by the BBC what his views were on the poor Labour showing , Mr Johnson said : " The smart thing for Labour to do would be to quietly to remove Gordon Brown and install [ Foreign Secretary David ]
Miliband , is my view , but I do n't think they 'll do it . "
In his speech after the result was declared at City Hall , Mr Livingstone thanked the Labour Party for all its help with his campaign .

" There is absolutely nothing that I could have asked from the Labour Party that it did n't throw into this election , from Gordon Brown right the way down to the newest recruit , handing out leaflets on very wet , cold days .
" I 'm sorry I could n't get an extra few points that would take us to victory and the fault for that is solely my own .
You can't be mayor for eight years and then if you do n't at third term say it was somebody else 's fault .
I accept that responsibility and I regret that I could n't take you to victory . "
However , Justice Secretary Jack Straw said Labour as a whole should shoulder the blame for Mr Livingstone 's loss .
He told BBC News : " I disagree with Ken in one particular only , that we all share the responsibility for the defeat that he suffered yesterday . "
Mr Straw admitted that the row over the 10 p tax rate had left some voters " understandably very upset " .
The government would get behind Londoners ' decision at the polls , he added .
Conservative Party leader David Cameron praised Mr Johnson for a " serious and energetic campaign " and said his party was " winning the battle of ideas " .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Scientific detective work has uncovered a decades - old glitch in ocean temperature measurements and revealed that the world ’s seas are warming and rising faster than previously reported .

An international team of scientists , reporting their findings on Thursday in the journal Nature , looked at millions of ship - based measurements taken since 1950 , but particularly from 1960 , and revealed an error in data from a common probe called an XBT .
Correcting the error in data running over decades as well as applying a complex statistical analysis to sea temperature data , the team came up with a global estimate of ocean warming in the top layers down to 700 meters ( 2,300 feet ) as well as how fast oceans are rising .
“ We show that the rate of ocean warming from 1961 to 2003 is about 50 percent larger than previously reported , ” said team member Catia Domingues , from the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research .
Fellow report author John Church said he had long been suspicious about the historical data because it did not match results from computer models of the world ’s climate and oceans .
“ We ’ve realigned the observations and as a result the models agree with the observations much better than previously , ” said Church , a senior research scientist with the climate centre .
“ And so by comparing many XBT observations with research ship observations in a statistical way , you can estimate what the errors associated with the XBTs are . ”
This was crucial because the oceans store more than 90 percent of the heat in the planet ’s climate system and can act as a buffer against the effects of climate change , Domingues said .
Water also expands the warmer it becomes , pushing up sea levels , in addition from run-off from melting glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and parts of Antarctica .
Church said the global average surface warming between 1961 to 2003 was about 0.4 degrees Celsius according to his team ’s estimates and that seas rose on average 1.6 millimeters a year during this period .
RISING SEAS
But Church said that since 1993 , sea levels had been rising more than 3 mm a year as the world consumes ever greater amounts of fossil fuels .
XBTs were widely used by commercial vessels but have since been largely replaced by satellites and permanent probes in the ocean .
The disposable XBTs were thrown over the side with a wire attached to measure temperatures as it sank .
“ If you miscalculate how quickly the instrument falls through the water column , you miscalculate the depth and therefore the temperature at that depth and that ’s the prime source of error , ” said Church .
So a colleague , Susan Wijffels and other associates , figured out a mathematical formula to correct the error .
That , combined with a wider statistical analysis of global ocean temperature data , revealed a clearer picture that better matched widely used computer models that project how the climate and oceans behave because of global warming .
“ Now we see a more steady rate of warming and an increased trend in that warming , ” Church told Reuters .
“ It builds confidence in the models that we use for projecting the future , ” adding that observations also indicated that the actual sea level rise was tracking on the upper end of those projections .
The U.N. Climate Panel ’s latest global assessment last year estimated sea levels could rise by up to 80 cm by the end of 2100 unless carbon dioxide levels were reined in .

Fathers get the baby blues too and , if they do , it can be bad news for their children ’s language development .
Two - year - olds have a smaller vocabulary if their fathers have depression than if their mothers do .
Postnatal depression in women is widely recognised and linked to emotional and behavioural difficulties in their children .
Less well known is that some men also become depressed soon after a child is born .
To explore the effects of paternal depression , a team led by paediatric psychologist James Paulson at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk surveyed about 5000 families enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , which is backed by the US Department of Education and records symptoms of depression in parents .
When the children were 9 months old , 14 per cent of the mothers and 10 per cent of the fathers were clinically depressed – about twice the rates in the general population .
The surprise came when the researchers looked at whether this affected what proportion of 50 common words the children were using at 2 years of age .
On average , the kids used 29 .
But significantly , while postnatal depression had no effect on vocabulary , 9 - month - olds with depressed dads went on to use 1.5 fewer words at age 2 than those whose fathers were fine .
Other studies have found that maternal depression can also slow speech development , but Paulson is the first to suggest that paternal depression has the bigger effect .
Advertisement
A likely explanation , says Paulson , is that depression in mothers did not reduce the time they spent reading to their 9 - month - old baby , but depressed dads read 9 per cent less often than those who felt fine .
Paulson presented his findings on 6 May at the annual American Psychiatric Association meeting in Washington DC .
He hopes they will encourage depressed dads to get treatment .
“ Men may not be likely to seek help for themselves but when other people who depend on them become affected , that may change the landscape . ”

The Decline of an American Export Western Democracy Loses Ground to Autocrats
It 's the best of all bad forms of government , but for many it 's no longer good enough .
Today democracy leaves lots of people cold , and in Asia and Africa , many prefer autocratic systems .
Damaged by Bush , Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib , few are interested in the model of democracy exported by the United States .

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is calling for $ 10 million in emergency farming equipment and seeds for parts of southern Burma devastated by Cyclone Nargis , to help plant the next rice crop .
Meanwhile the UN ’s World Food Programme has stopped emergency food shipments to the disaster zone after the country ’s military dictators impounded the first shipment on arrival .
Cyclone Nargis , which hit southern Burma last Saturday , devastated the delta of the Irawaddy River , the country ’s main rice growing region .
Up to 100,000 may have been killed , and hundreds of thousands are homeless .
The WFP has said it will not deliver emergency relief unless it can supervise its distribution to ensure it reaches those most in need .
The Burmese government , which violently suppressed popular protests of high food and fuel prices last September , is insisting on distributing foreign aid itself .
Opposition campaigners fear the junta will give the aid preferentially to its supporters .
Burma ’s people are among Asia ’s poorest , and dependent on rice as a staple food .
People in Asia on average consume 7 kilograms of rice per month , getting the rest of their nutrition from other foods .
The Burmese eat on average 20 kg of rice a month , yet recent surveys found a third of children are malnourished , a third of those severely .

No harvest
The FAO says the storm washed away rice stores from the recent harvest , on which the many subsistence farmers depend .
It warns that Burma is due to plant its next crop when monsoon rains start in June , but people have no equipment to do it .
“ The hardest - hit villages lost all their farming assets , as well as the food stored for the rest of the year , ” says Anne Bauer , head of emergency operations at FAO headquarters in Rome , Italy .
“ These poor farmers will not have sufficient resources to purchase seed and fertilisers , protect surviving livestock and replace lost ones . ”
Rice prices on international markets hit all - time highs this month after increased worldwide demand and speculation on international commodities markets trebled the price , making it difficult even for the WFP to buy the rice it needs .
The survivors could soon be facing disease , too .
Disaster experts say that contrary to popular belief , dead bodies do not spread disease .
But Robert Hodgson of RedR , a British disaster relief charity , predicts that because of the high water table in the affected delta region , decomposing human and livestock remains will be hard to bury safely and could pollute water supplies .
Water - borne diseases from the survivors , meanwhile , might be a worse problem .
Cholera , typhoid and dysentery are all present in Burma .
Hurricanes – awesomely destructive , and they may be getting worse .

There are thousands of masts in Britain
Dr Roger Coghill , who sits on a Government advisory committee on mobile radiation , has discovered that all 22 youngsters who have killed themselves in Bridgend , South Wales , over the past 18 months lived far closer than average to a mast . [ > [>
He has examined worldwide studies linking proximity of masts to depression .
Dr Coghill ’s work is likely to trigger alarm and lead to closer scrutiny of the safety of masts , which are frequently sited on public buildings such as schools and hospitals . [> [>
It is also likely to fuel more campaigns against placing masts close to public places on health grounds . [>
[> Dr Coghill said last night there was strong circumstantial evidence that the masts may have triggered depression in those from Bridgend who took their lives . [ > [>
They include Kelly Stephenson , 20 , who hanged herself from a shower rail in February this year while on holiday in Folkestone , Kent . [> [>
Dr Coghill said : “ There is a body of research that has over the years pointed to the fact that exposure to mobile radiation can lead to depression .
There is evidence of higher suicide rates where people live near any electrical equipment that gives off radio or electrical waves . ” [ >
[>
There are now 70 million mobile phone handsets in the UK and around 50,000 masts .
Both emit radio signals and electromagnetic fields that can penetrate the brain , and for many years campaigners have argued that this could seriously damage people ’s health . [ > [>
The national average for proximity to a mobile phone transmitter varies depending on the type of mast .
The latest masts are far more powerful so they can transmit more sophisticated data , such as photos and videos for people to download on internet phones . [ >
[> Masts are placed on average 800 metres away from each home across the country .
In Bridgend the victims lived on average only 356 metres away . [> [>
The national average distance from a new powerful mast is a kilometre while in Bridgend it is 540 metres .
Three transmitters were within 200 metres , 13 within 400 metres and as many as 22 within 500 metres of victims ’ homes .
Carwyn Jones , 28 , who hanged himself last week , was the third young person in his street to commit suicide . [>
[> Research shows young people ’s brains are more susceptible to radio wave energy .
Only two weeks ago a report identified mobiles as having an effect on sleep patterns . [ > [>
Dr Coghill added : “ What seems to be happening is that the electrical energy is having an effect on the chemistry of the brain , depleting serotonin levels .
We know that in depression serotonin levels are low and that a standard treatment for depression is to give drugs to boost serotonin levels .
As they begin to work , the patient ’s depression lifts . ” [ >
[>
He said urgent research was needed because Britain was now covered with thousands of masts , many close to homes , schools and offices . [ > [>
Since January 5 , 2007 , there have been 22 deaths of young people in the Bridgend area .
Some believe the suicides are linked but so far experts have failed to find a common cause . [ > [>
Thomas Davies , 20 , hanged himself in February 2007 .
Last night his brother Nathan , 19 , welcomed Dr Coghill ’s research .
“ As far as this family is concerned nothing can bring Tom back , ” he said .
“ But if there is a link found and something can be done then it could prevent further suicides . ” [ >

Will The RIAA Sue Judge Kozinski For Sharing MP3s ?

While judge Alex Kozinski is getting a ton of press for accidentally sharing pornographic images from his webserver , Justin Levine notes that the report concerning what was on the server also found music MP3s from musicians like Johnny Cash , Bob Dylan and Weird Al Yankovic .
Levine wonders if the RIAA will now sue this federal judge as well .
In fact , things could get tricky in that some research suggests not only was Kozinski storing MP3s , he may have actively been sharing some of those MP3s as well .
That same link mentions that in one of many copyright infringement lawsuits concerning the company Perfect 10 , Kozinski wrote a dissenting opinion suggesting that facilitating copyright infringement should be seen as infringement as well :
There 's a lot more involved in his opinion , which really focuses on credit card companiesfrom infringement -- but considering how he much he writes against those who help others infringe , it 's probably not a wise idea that he was out there sharing music files himself .
However , to be fair , as the details come out , this whole thing is quite clearly a witch hunt by someone who seriously dislikes the judge .
As we noted when the story broke , it 's perfectly ridiculous to try to suggest this makes him any less qualified to judge cases .
And , indeed , as the details come out about the content on his server , it 's becoming clear that it is , as he noted " funny " stuff .
It 's all basically the sort of silly viral content that gets passed around all the time , much more for the amusement factor than any sort of titillation .
This post certainly is n't to slam Kozinski , who seems like a genuinely thoughtful judge -- with a sense of humor to boot ( he famously nominated himself for a mocking " Judicial Hottie " contest run by a blog , noting : " While I think the list of female candidates is excellent , the list of male candidates is , frankly , lacking .

Open - source solutions used to be adopted quietly by company boffins who snuck in an Apache Web server or an open - source development tool suite under the philosophy " It 's easier to get forgiveness than permission " ( not to mention " It 's easier to do it with open - source tools than to get an IT budget " ) .
That 's no longer the case , according to a survey of IT and business executives and managers , conducted in late April 2008 by CIO.com .
The survey , collecting data from 328 respondents , showed that more than half the respondents ( 53 percent ) are using open - source applications in their organization today , and an additional 10 percent plan to do so in the next year .
For nearly half , 44 percent , open - source applications are considered equally with proprietary solutions during the acquisition process .
Among those currently employing open - source solutions , the primary uses are operating systems such as Linux ( 78 percent ) , infrastructure applications , such as back - end databases and Web servers ( 74 percent ) , and software development tools like Eclipse ( 61 percent ) .
Those may sound fairly geeky , but business application use is n't far behind .
Nearly half of the survey respondents , 45 percent , are using desktop applications such as OpenOffice.org , and 29 percent use open - source enterprise applications .
The most popular of those enterprise applications are collaboration tools , customer relationship management ( CRM ) tools and ERP applications .
Moreover , open - source solutions are generating confidence .
Close to three in five respondents , 58 percent , strongly agree or agree with the statement that Linux is reliable enough to depend upon for mission - critical applications .
Remarkably , that confidence is highest among IT executives and managers : 62 percent say Linux is ready for prime time .
Respondents to the survey ranged from IT executive or manager ( 59 percent ) and business executive or manager ( 13 percent ) to IT professionals ( 20 percent ) and business professionals ( 8 percent ) .
For contrast : Three - quarters ( 77 percent ) of software developers responding to the last Evans Data Open Source Software / Linux Development Survey absolutely or probably have enough confidence in Linux to use it for mission - critical applications .
Take that with a grain of salt :
By their qualifications for participation in that market research study , those developers are tipped in favor of using or writing open source ( if not Linux ) , so a higher ranking is not surprising .
What Makes Open Source Appealing — and Not
The primary reasons enterprise IT departments adopt open source are financial .
Lower total cost of ownership ( 59 percent ) and acquisition costs ( 56 percent ) lead the pack .
But money is n't everything .
Greater flexibility was cited as a primary reason by 32 percent of respondents , and access to source code is a motivation for one in three ( 30 percent ) .
Attributes of the source code itself are n't key drivers ; better - quality code is a primary reason for adoption by just 12 percent , and product functionality by 22 percent .
Greatest Barriers to Open - Source Software Adoption at Your Company ?
Source : CIO.com survey of 328 IT and business executives and managers , April 2008 .
Up to three items selected .
Percent Product support concerns 45 % Awareness / knowledge of available solutions 29 % Security concerns 26 % Lack of support by management 22 % Licensing or legal concerns 21 % Investment in architecture from other vendor (s ) 20 % Software quality issues 20 % Customization concerns 15 %
Not relevant to our product or service 7 % Pressure on open - source providers by commercial vendors 5 % Software cost allocation policies 2 % Other 9 %
While it 's good news ( at least to its proponents ) that nearly two - thirds of companies are using open source today or plan to use it soon , there are still barriers to adoption .
The primary reason is product support concerns ( 45 percent ) ; enterprises clearly want assurance that someone will answer tech support calls .
Secondary issues are the awareness or knowledge of available solutions — that is , the ease of learning that an open - source application is available to scratch that particular IT itch ( 29 percent ) , security concerns ( 26 percent ) and lack of support by management ( 22 percent ) .
Again , you 'll notice that the qualities of the open - source applications themselves are n't as big a deal .
Software quality issues are cited as a primary barrier to adoption by 20 percent and customization concerns by 15 percent .
So if you 're trying to sell the boss on the virtues of open source , spend more time on reassurance about tech support availability and quality than you do on customization opportunities .
Companies that use ( or plan to use ) open source generally have the same concerns as do companies that stick with proprietary solutions .
The main exception is open source 's top sticking point .
Half the respondents whose companies use open source today ( 52 percent ) cite product support concerns as the greatest barrier to entry .
A third ( 33 percent ) of those who do n't use open source identified this as a primary problem .
Product support is still their top item - just with less urgency .
In other words , the folks who are using this stuff know that it 's a problem ; those who are n't using it simply expect it to be .
One item that may quell the fears of enterprises contemplating open - source solutions :
Once you have the software in - house , code quality concerns become far less important .
Enterprises that are n't using open source cite code quality as the third - highest issue ( after product support and security concerns ) , but it 's number 7 ( of 12 ) for those who have been working with the applications .
Once you have your hands on the code , apparently , you discover the situation is better than you imagined .
Open - source developers have somewhat different priorities than do their managers .
According to the Evans Data survey , the biggest obstacles to adoption are a corporate preference for proprietary software , lack of device drivers and the need to learn a new set of skills .
The quality of support was the biggest obstacle to only 15 percent of developers .
Developers have plenty of reason to pay attention to open source .
For example , see Open Source as An Easy Answer for Better Developer Visibility ( and Career Opportunity ) .
Making Open Source Work In - House
About a quarter of corporations ( 27 percent ) have a formal policy in place regarding open - source applications , though 18 percent expect to adopt such a policy in the next 12 months .
Of those with open - source policies , 45 percent feel their policies are very effective and 46 percent somewhat so .
Presumably , the " somewhat so " respondents are thinking about the amount of open - source software that 's been installed by IT staff and developers without company approval ; one in five ( 21 percent ) admits to it ( often or sometimes ) .
While more than half of enterprises use open source today , the degree of intimacy with the philosophy varies quite a bit .
Companies may often ( 43 percent ) or sometimes ( 24 percent ) treat such applications as , well , just free software ; they run the application but do n't even look at the source code .
Although they can access the source code , it is n't common for enterprise IT departments to use open - source modules in their own code , whether or not they make code changes .
For example , 18 percent often use unchanged code modules as though the modules are a free source library , and 36 % do so occasionally .
Still , half , 49 percent , often or sometimes report bugs or contribute their changes back to the open - source community ; 11 percent have open - source committers on their staff .
Once open source was rejected as appropriate for enterprise use .
Clearly , that 's no longer the situation today .

The first couple of tapes were nothing special but the third looked like the camera had been set up in a hotel room .

Antifascist Calling …
Move over Herman Kahn .
Forget the “ missile gap . ”
The latest “ crisis ” facing U.S. “ warfighters ” in their noble quest to defend the “ homeland ” and dominate the “ battlespace ” is … the sleep gap !
That ’s right .
According to a newly disclosed report by The MITRE Corporation ’s defense science advisory panel know as JASON , the United States must continue investigating the potential by America ’s adversaries “ to exploit advances in Human Performance Modification , and thus create a threat to national security , ” Secrecy News reveals .
According to Steven Aftergood ,
Their report examined “ the present state of the art in pharmaceutical intervention in cognition and in brain - computer interfaces , and considered how possible future developments might proceed and be used by adversaries . ”
Among their findings was the under - appreciated significance of sleep and the possibility of a “ sleep gap ” ( a term not used in the report ) .
“ The most immediate human performance factor in military effectiveness is degradation of performance under stressful conditions , particularly sleep deprivation . ”
( “ JASON Warns of Threat from Sleeping Enemies , ” Secrecy News , June 5 , 2008 )
Though its hard to take Strangelovian madness such as this seriously , the investigation of military applications of “ Human Performance Modification ” is no laughing matter .
Undoubtedly , the Office of Defense Research and Engineering , the Pentagon agency that commissioned the study , are n’t laughing either .
When JASON researchers conclude , “ If an opposing force had a significant sleep advantage , this would pose a serious threat , ” its difficult not to crack a smile .
That is , until one considers that the The MITRE Corporation , a McClean , Virginia - based “ not - for - profit corporation , ” was formed in 1958 when “ several hundred employees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Lincoln Laboratories came to MITRE to create new technology for the Department of Defense–specifically the Semi-Automated Ground Environment , which used brand new digital computers . ”
Currently fronting 6,700 scientists and “ support specialists , ” MITRE “ customers ” include the Air Force , Army , Navy , Marine Corps , Defense Information Systems Agency , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , Missile Defense Command , Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Office of the Secretary of Defense , Military Intelligence Agencies , as well as “ other members ” of the “ National Security Community . ”
Additionally , MITRE ’s “ Homeland Security customers ” include the full panoply of agencies under the ( dark ) wing of the Department of Homeland Security : the Directorate for Science & Technology , the Directorate for National Protection & Programs , Office of Intelligence and Analysis , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services , U.S. Coast Guard , U.S. Customs & Border Protection ( Secure Border Initiative ) and U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) .
According to researcher Nick Turse in his book The Complex , “ MITRE brought in a cool $ 275,384,277 ” in research , development , test and evaluation money from the Pentagon in 2005 .
All in all , MITRE is one of the spookiest corporations you ’ve never heard of .
As a leading provider of technical researchers for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , MITRE behavioral scientists are on the “ cutting edge ” of what Pentagon war criminals have euphemistically designated an “ Enhanced Human Performance Project . ”
Among the more frightening aspects of this venture , DARPA claims they will “ exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger , more alert , more endurant , and better able to heal . ”
In other words , a warfighting “ Terminator ” in the service of corporate power .
These developments are further along than you might think .
As Nick Turse revealed :
Right now , researchers are already growing insects with electronics inside them .
They ’re creating cyborg moths and flying beetles that can be remotely controlled .
One day , the U.S. military may field squadrons of winged insect / machine hybrids with on - board audio , video or chemical sensors .
These cyborg insects could conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions on distant battlefields , in far - off caves , or maybe even in cities closer to home , and transmit detailed data back to their handlers at U.S. military bases .
Today , many people fear U.S. government surveillance of email and cell phone communications .
With this program , the Pentagon aims to exponentially increase the paranoia .
Imagine a world in which any insect fluttering past your window may be a remote - controlled spy , packed with surveillance equipment .
Even more frightening is the prospect that such creatures could be weaponized , and the possibility , according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project , that these cyborg insects might be armed with “ bio weapons . ”
( “ Weaponizing the Pentagon ’s Cyborg Insects , ” TomDispatch , March 30 , 2008 )
Called HI -MEMS ,
Turse reports that DARPA aims to transform “ insects into unmanned air - vehicles . ”
HI - MEMS program manager Armit Lal , an associate professor on leave from Cornell University described the research thusly at DARPA ’s annual symposium , DARPATech :
“ [ T ] he HI - MEMS program seeks to grow MEMS and electronics inside the insect pupae .
The new tissue forms around the insertions , making the bio-electronic interface long - lasting and reliable . ”
In other words , micro-electronics are inserted at the pupal stage of metamorphosis so that they can be integrated into the insects ’ bodies as they develop , creating living robots that can be remotely controlled after the insect emerges from its cocoon .
And , as with all military research aiming to weaponize all aspects of the natural world , MITRE scientists and their DARPA “ customers ” cloak their devilish tinkering as purely “ defensive ” moves designed to impede an unseen , but nevertheless cunning and ruthless “ adversary . ”
Thus we read in JASON ’s bizarre executive summary :
1. Maintain a strong internal research activity , with concomitant personnel expertise , because this is crucial for evaluation of potential threats based on the activity of adversaries in human performance modification .
2 . Monitor enemy activities in sleep research , and maintain close understanding of open source sleep research .
Use in - house military research on the safety and effectiveness of newly developing drugs for ameliorating the effects of sleep deprivation , such as ampakines , as a baseline for evaluating potential activities of adversaries .
3 . Develop a corps of trained analysts capable of evaluating technical developments in human performance modification .
These analysts should be trained in assessing the meaning of statistical metrics , and also in assessing the experimental methods and results of the original scientific literature on which claims are based .
( E. Williams , et.al. , Human Performance , JASON , The MITRE Corporation , March 2008 , JSR - 07 - 625 )
And what conclusion can we infer from JASON ’s recommendation that the U.S. develop a “ technical knowledge base ” in “ behavior modification ” ?
The US military will certainly test whether , and to what extent , the new lessons of neuroscience can be used in military training , and it is reasonable to expect that adversaries will do so as well .
We do not expect the development of super - soldiers as a result of improved training , although enhanced military capability can certainly be expected .
However , unexpected adversarial behavior could result if training included behavior modification ( e.g. , for increased aggressiveness or decreased empathy ) .
Thus one strong recommendation of this study is that the US should develop a technical knowledge base concerning scientifically based training tools , especially as applied in behavior modification .
This knowledge base should be combined with information - gathering and analysis concerning the training techniques ( both civilian and military ) in adversaries ’ cultures .
Simply put , psychoanalysis describe such notions as projection : the process whereby what is inside is misunderstood , consciously or otherwise , as originating outside the self or body politic .
In its most malignant , pathological form–as is in the self - interested mendacities of corporate and political elites –projected attitudes seriously distort the object on whom they are projected , as in the branding of x , y , or z as a “ new Hitler , ” as a defense mechanism to mask one ’s own aggression .
Interestingly enough , the Nazi ’s genocidal project to eradicate the Jewish people was thusly theorized as a “ defense ” of Germanic culture against a “ Jewish - Bolshevik conspiracy . ”
So it is today , with JASON ’s obsession with the “ training techniques ” in “ adversaries ’ cultures ” allegedly “ training for increased aggressiveness or decreased empathy . ”
What is this if not a descriptive catalogue of the horrors visited on the Iraqi people by an “ imperialism gone wild ” ?
As the history of the U.S. Government ’s earlier experiments in “ behavior modification ” demonstrate , building on the “ skill - sets ” acquired from vanquished Nazi and Japanese war criminals , The MITRE Corporation and their DARPA “ customers ” are following along the path blazed decades earlier by the CIA and the Pentagon .
Sporting esoteric names and “ above top secret ” pedigrees , projects such as ARTICHOKE , MKULTRA , MKDELTA and MKNAOMI embodied the 1950s “ cutting edge ” zeitgeist of science , academia , military heavy - lifting , covert operations and expanding “ business horizons . ”
While America ’s Cold War vision was guided by anticommunist paranoia , consumerism and its accompanying cult of the “ normal , ” as well as the “ can - do ” optimism of “ winnable ” nuclear war , its ideological hubris arose in the political - economic context of an American superpower that had annihilated its German and Japanese capitalist rivals .
As America ’s permanent war and surveillance society morphs into the dystopian phantasmagoria of Philip K. Dick ’s The Minority Report , technological optimism–as is inevitable in kleptocracies such as the United States–is harnessed and reified by bio- behavioral modification engineers , sociopaths in lab coats , who populate outfits such as The MITRE Corporation like so many poisonous intellectual mushrooms .
Imagining monstrous hybrids fueled by perverse fantasies of swarming cyborg - insects that “ dominate the battlespace ” or morals - free imperialist “ Terminators ” jacked - up by “ pharmaceutical enhancements ” and “ invasive brain - computer interfaces , ” the JASONs , like their Hollywood namesake –the masked killing machine who ran amok in a score of popular slasher films–are , in the end , not harbingers of a bright , shining globalized future but rather , its terminal end point : the corporatist Borg hive where resistance is futile .
NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Kenya should reverse a decision to grow biofuel crops which will threaten wild life on an important coastal wetland , two conservation groups warned on Monday .
File image shows a worker harvesting sugarcane , June 30 , 2005 .

More than 80 square miles of the Tana River Delta will be planted with sugarcane , threatening 350 species of birds , lions , elephants , rare sharks and reptiles , Britain ’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) said .
“ This decision is a national disaster and will devastate the Delta , ” Paul Matiku of Nature Kenya said in the same statement .
“ The Tana ’s ecology will be destroyed yet the economic gains will be pitiful .
It will seriously damage our priceless national assets and will put the livelihoods of the people living in the Delta in jeopardy . ”
The RSPB said the proposal was approved by the Kenyan government ’s National Environment Management Authority , which it accused of ignoring an environmental assessment that showed irrigation in the area would cause severe drainage of the Delta .
Matiku said that would also leave hundreds of local farmers with nowhere to take their livestock for dry - season grazing .
Kenyan officials were not immediately available for comment .
The RSPB said a report it commissioned in May with Nature Kenya found that the biofuel plans overestimated profits , ignored water use fees and pollution from the sugarcane plant , and disregarded the loss of income from wildlife tourists .
It said developers estimated income from sugarcane farming at 1.25 million pounds ( $ 2.5 million ) over 20 years , but that their report showed revenues from fishing , farming , tourism and other lost livelihoods would be 30 million pounds over the same period .
“ This decision is a very serious blow to Kenyan wildlife and to wildlife worldwide since many migrating species use the Tana Delta in internationally important numbers , ” said Paul Buckley , an Africa specialist with the RSPB .
The society said targets set by Western governments to increase their biofuel use as part of plans to fight climate change were actually driving the destruction of valuable environments .
European Union leaders have agreed renewable energy sources -- such as ethanol made from grains and sugar crops -- should make up 10 percent of road transport fuels in the bloc by 2020 .
But the plan has been attacked by some scientists , politicians and conservationists who say growing biofuel production is curbing food supply at a time of soaring prices .
Critics say fuels derived from crops compete with produce from farmland and helped to push up food prices .

Battle of the Spouses : A Bit Better for Obama Poll : Edge is Michelle Obama's , but plenty of room to move for Cindy McCain .
June 18 , 2008  --
In the battle of the spouses the early edge is Michelle Obama's , in favorable views and intensity of sentiment alike .
But there are sharp differences among groups , and plenty of room to move for the less well - known Cindy McCain .
Forty - eight percent of Americans in a new ABC News / Washington Post poll see Obama favorably , vs. 39 percent for McCain , a 9 - point Obama advantage .
Slightly more , though , also view Obama unfavorably – 29 percent vs. McCain 's 25 percent .
Substantially more , 36 percent , have n't yet formed an opinion of McCain , vs. 23 percent in Obama 's case .
For both , those are sizable numbers who 've yet to make a judgment .
The popularity of presidential candidates ' spouses does not drive vote preferences .
But in contests where every advantage can count , spouses do play a very public role .
Cindy McCain is highlighting her support for children 's charities with a visit to Vietnam this week , while Michelle Obama hosts the ABC program " The View " on Wednesday .
DIFFS –
There are big differences among groups in views of the two women , mainly driven by political partisanship .
Obama 's favorable score is 14 points higher among women than McCain's , 54 percent vs. 40 percent ; as in many of Obama 's other best groups , the chief reason is simply because women are more apt to be Democrats .
An even more striking gap may cut to Obama 's independent persona ; among the two in 10 Americans who call themselves feminists ( men and women alike ) , 60 percent view her favorably .
That drops to 45 percent among non-feminists – who are twice as apt as feminists to see her unfavorably .
Obama 's ratings peak at 84 percent favorable among African - Americans , 66 percent among liberals and Democrats alike and 61 percent among young adults , age 18 - 29 .
Not surprisingly , those are among her husband 's core groups ; indeed it's his support that seems largely to drive views of his wife .
Among people who prefer Barack Obama for president vs. John McCain , 73 percent like Obama 's wife , too .
McCain 's support , naturally , inclines the other way .
Though the difference is less striking , she 's better rated by non-feminists ( 41 percent favorable ) than by feminists ( 33 percent ) .
She does best with Republicans ( 62 percent favorable ) and with her husband 's supporters ( 56 percent of whom like her , too ) .
But her favorability rating among conservatives ( 46 percent ) is a full 20 points below Obama 's among liberals .
Obama also inspires stronger opinions :
The number of Americans who have a " strongly " favorable opinion of her is double the number who say so about McCain , 21 percent vs. 10 percent .
On the negative side , 18 percent see Obama strongly unfavorably , as do 12 percent for McCain .
In only a few groups does either of these women 's unfavorable ratings outscore their favorables .
More African - Americans , under 30s and Democrats see McCain unfavorably than favorably ( it 's close among liberals ) ; and more Republicans and conservatives see Obama unfavorably than favorably ( with seniors about evenly split ) .
Finally , in a hangover from the hard - fought primary campaign , Obama 's favorable rating is a good deal higher from her husband 's primary supporters – 74 percent – than from Hillary Clinton 's , 51 percent .
VOTE – Again , views of the candidates ' spouses do not significantly influence vote choices .
In a regression analysis – a way of sorting out the independent influence of various factors – support for Barack Obama is predicted by partisanship , preference for him over John McCain on personal attributes , preference for Barack Obama to handle top issues and favorable views of him – but not by favorable views of his wife .
The same holds true for Cindy McCain in predicting support for her husband 's candidacy .
A result from an ABC / Post poll in December pointed the same way : Sixteen percent said that in deciding their vote they give a " great amount " of weight to the candidates ' spouses ; by contrast 65 percent put a great amount of weight on the issues , 58 percent on the candidates ' personal qualities and 54 percent on their professional ability .
METHODOLOGY - This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone June 12 - 15 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,125 adults , including an oversample of African Americans ( weighted to their correct share of the national population ) , for a total of 201 black respondents .
The results from the full survey have a 3 - point error margin .

Arsenal face an exodus if they do n't pay us more , warns top Gunner Van Persie
Robin van Persie has warned Arsenal they could lose all their star players if they do n't change their financial structure during the summer .
Van Persie is currently discussing a new deal , but knows the north London club are not in line with other big teams in Europe when it comes to paying players ' salaries .
Arsenal fans were disappointed to see Mathieu Flamini leave the club at the end of the season after he failed to agree a new contract and was able to join AC Milan as a free agent .

Firing a warning : Van Persie says Arsenal risk the squad breaking up
Uncertainty continues to surround the long - term futures of Alexander Hleb , Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor , and Van Persie worries that the team could break up if the Arsenal board do not review their contract negotiations .
Van Persie said : " They should make sure that these players stay .
Arsenal have a policy in which they will not go over a specific amount of money when agreeing the salary of a player .
Ready for action : Van Persie trains with Holland ahead of Euro 2008
" They wo n't pay enormous amounts of money .
I think that they should go to a higher level of salary .
" If you want to keep the group together , you have to keep them happy .
If you are 27 or 28 , I can understand that you would make the decision to go elsewhere if you can earn three or four times as much .
" If that sort of money was also paid here , I 'm sure that person would stay . "
Van Persie has a contract with Arsenal until 2011 and is not in a hurry to put pen to paper .
The Holland international says it is not all about money and that he loves playing for Arsenal in the Premier League .
But he also knows that other clubs are paying their players a lot more and does not want to see his side lose their best players and fail to challenge for silverware next season .
Van Persie , speaking from the Holland training camp in Hoenderloo , added : " It is the principle .
It is very important that Arsenal keep these guys .
This group is unique .
If a number of them leave , it will be different .
" I think of myself as an Arsenal man but Arsenal should also try to make sure that we all grow together . "
The nationwide survey , which is based on telephone interviews with more than 35,000 adults from May 8 to Aug. 13 , 2007 , is the second installment of a broad assessment Pew has undertaken of trends and characteristics of the country ’s religious life .
The first part of the report , published in February , depicted a fluid and diverse national religious life marked by people moving among denominations and faiths .
According to that report , more than a quarter of adult Americans have left the faith of their childhood to join another religion or no religion .
The survey indicated that the group that had the greatest net gain was the unaffiliated , accounting for 16 percent of American adults .
The new report sheds light on the beliefs of the unaffiliated .
Like the overwhelming majority of Americans , 70 percent of the unaffiliated said they believed in God , including one of every five people who identified themselves as atheist and more than half of those who identified as agnostic .
“ What does atheist mean ?
It may mean they do n’t believe in God , or it could be that they are hostile to organized religion , ” Mr. Green said .
“ A lot of these unaffiliated people , by some measures , are fairly religious , and then there are those who are affiliated with a religion but do n’t believe in God and identify instead with history or holidays or communities . ”
The most significant contradictory belief the survey reveals has to do with salvation .
Previous surveys have shown that Americans think a majority of their countrymen and women will go to heaven , and that the circle is wide , embracing minorities like Jews , Muslims and atheists .
But the Pew survey goes further , showing that such views are held by those within major branches of Christianity and minority faiths , too .
Scholars said such tolerance could stem in part from the greater diversity of American society : that there are more people of minority faiths or no faith and that “ it is hard to hold a strongly sectarian view when you work together and your kids play soccer together , ” Mr. Lindsay said .
But such a view of salvation may also grow out of doctrinal ignorance , scholars said .
“ It could be that people are not very well educated and they are not expressing mature theological points of view , ” said Todd Johnson , director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon - Conwell Theological Seminary .
“ It could also be a form of bland secularism .
The real challenge to religious leaders is not to become more entrenched in their views , but to navigate the idea of what their religion is all about and how it relates to others . ”
A protein that helps combat stress on cells caused by environmental influences like rising ambient temperatures appears to block the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , at least in a mouse model of the neurodegenerative illness .
Commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's disease ( after the famed New York Yankee slugger who succumbed to it in 1941 at age 37 ) , ALS is a poorly understood , incurable disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons ( nerve cells that control voluntary motion ) .
Signals from these cells to the muscles weaken in victims , resulting in atrophy , speech disruptions and , eventually , total loss of control over movement .
About one in every 50,000 people in the U.S. is diagnosed with the debilitating condition annually ; it typically strikes between the ages of 40 and 60 and leads to respiratory failure and death within five years of onset .
ALS ravages two distinct populations of motor neurons — one in the brain , the other in the spinal cord .
The endings of the spinal cord cells interface with neighboring muscle cells , normally signaling muscles to contract or relax to create motion .
But researchers at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston ?
Salem , N.C. , found that ALS - affected neurons undergo a process known as " denervation " that severs the connection .
The scientists report in The Journal of Neuroscience , however , that they were able to preserve these neuromuscular links in mice genetically engineered to develop ALS by injecting heat protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) into their backs , thus delaying the onset of the disease .
This protein is secreted in large quantities by neurons in response to stressors .
Hsp70 maintains proper nerve cell function by binding to the neurons and chaperoning proper protein folding inside .
Previous models of ALS demonstrated that neurons sustain damage when stressed , because Hsp70 levels do not rise to corresponding levels .
" By keeping [ muscle and nerve ] cells talking to each other , you keep both cells healthy , " says study co-author Carol Milligan , an assistant professor of neurobiology at W.F.U. Medical Center .
" That keeps the motor neurons healthier longer . "
She notes that most existing and developing ALS therapies target cell bodies as opposed to the neuromuscular junction .
Genetic analyses have shown that 90 percent of ALS cases are caused by spontaneous mutations that are not inherited .
In the 10 percent of inherited cases , a common mutation occurs in the gene superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , which is the gene that the Wake Forest team altered in its mouse model .
Fifty days after the mice were born , one group was injected three times a week with Hsp70 and another received Riluzole , the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to combat ALS .
The mice that received Riluzole lived , on average , one day longer than those that received no treatment .
In contrast , those that received Hsp70 lived 10 days longer .
At the neuromuscular juncture , where muscle and nerve cells meet , the researchers noted the Hsp70 mice had 20 percent more neurons in communication with muscle cells than the untreated control group .
" When we injected the protein , it tended to work more peripherally at the neuromuscular junction , and perhaps that is the difference , " Milligan says .
" We were assuming that it would go into the spinal cord and have an effect on the motor neuron cell body . …
It suggests optimal treatment should be looking both at the periphery and at the spinal cord . "
Milligan and her team now will attempt to uncover the mechanism by which the Hsp70 influx aids the so - called innervation of neurons and muscle cells .
They will also explore therapeutic cocktails that include Hsp70 to target the neuromuscular juncture and at least one other component to attend nerve cell bodies .
In addition , they plan to replicate the results of this study and test new drug combinations against the disease in various animal models in which other genes are changed .
" I think testing reagents in multiple [ disease ] models may give a better indicator of what would be effective in the patient population , " Milligan says .
Browser vulnerabilities are nothing new , and they are constantly popping up no matter what software you ’re using .
Today , however , there ’s an especially eerie one that Ghacks found which currently affects almost all versions of Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , and 8 .
It ’s capable of recording all of your keystrokes even after you ’ve left the site that you were visiting .
Update ( 6/27/2008 @ 1:34 PM CST ) :
As some commenters have pointed out this vulnerability does affect Firefox 3 users as well .
How does it work ?
First the user must click on a malicious link that uses JavaScript to open a URL in a new window / tab .
The site that you were expecting to open will be displayed without any issues , and you ’ll likely assume that you ’ve completely left the referring site .
Once the JavaScript code finishes executing it will hijack the first iframe that it finds on the website , and it will begin capturing any of your keystrokes .
Want some proof ?
This site has an example link to demonstrate how it works .
To show just how versatile this is I modified a small portion of the code so that it opens our homepage , and takes over the first iframe that appears at the very top .
Here ’s what the code looks like , and click on it to see what I ’m talking about :
If you are using a susceptible browser you should have noticed that the iframe at the top of the page turned solid red , and anytime you pressed a key on the keyboard it displayed in the box :
I did n’t modify our site ’s code in any way to get this to work , and any site you visit that uses iframes are susceptible to being a host for the vulnerability .
That means it could easily steal login credentials or credit card information assuming an iframe is available on the page .
Scary , huh ?
As of right now a proof - of - concept is only available for Internet Explorer , but with a little more work it ’s possible that it could also affect other browsers .
I have verified that the current method works in Internet Explorer 6 , and it does n’t work in Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 , and Safari 3 .
Here ’s more information on how the vulnerability operates .
Scientists can grow tissue in their laboratories , so why not make tons of meat in a big vat ?
It would spare the lives of animals , and cut down on the environmental problems — like carbon emission — that are associated with farming .
As I explained in April , PETA has issued a $ 1 million dollar challenge to the first business that brings artificial meat to the market .
A new public television show , Your Week , asked a bunch of people if they would eat the stuff .
Unfortunately , their headline , Would You Eat Frankenmeat ? has a pretty negative connotation .
Hopefully , subtle jabs like that will not bias the public against these new products , which already seem a bit hard to swallow .

When the United States invaded Iraq in order to destroy a nonexistent nuclear threat there were national and world protests .
Opposition to that war was loudly voiced by American politicians and world leaders , as well as in mass demonstrations across the globe .
Despite the protests , the war proceeded as planned .
Today it seems that it is generally agreed that the Iraq invasion and subsequent occupation were catastrophic mistakes .
Now the same people that gave us Iraq , and remain just about the only supporters of their own failed policy there , are signaling that it is necessary to destroy the Iranian nuclear threat .
And again , one problem is that this threat may not exist .
This time , however , the opponents of the threatened attack are surprisingly few , even as the signs of a coming air assault on Iran continue to increase .
This lack of articulated opposition to military action against Iran , especially by members of the Democratic Party and their supporters , increase the chances that the Bush / Cheney administration will widen the war in the Middle East either directly or by using Israel as a proxy .
“ Israelis are mounting a full court press to get the Bush administration to strike Iran ’s nuclear complex , ” according to David Martin of CBS News .
Martin quotes Michael Oren , a CBS analyst , who is an American - born Israeli and well - connected to his government ’s reliable sources , as stating , “ [t ] he Israelis have been assured by the Bush administration that the Bush administration will not allow Iran to nuclearize [ sic ] . ”
While Israel pressures the Americans via diplomatic and military channels , the U.S. Congress will shortly give its overwhelming support to two identical non-binding resolutions that will demand that President Bush impose a military blockade on Iran .
H.Con Res. 362 , the House version , and S. Res. 580 , the Senate version , demand :
[ T ] hat the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , inter alia , prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program . . .
These resolutions are a direct result of the efforts of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , who shortly after their annual convention in early June , deployed 5000 activists to 500 separate meetings on Capitol Hill , using their vast influence to promote this anti-Iranian legislation among U.S. lawmakers .
Both resolutions will have the wide bipartisan support in both branches of Congress that AIPAC - sponsored bills invariably receive .
Even if the idea of the blockade goes nowhere , the resolutions signal that the vast majority in Congress will either support or will not object to military action against Iran .
Rumors and threats of either an imminent U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran have been increasing during the past month .
According to the Jerusalem Post , Israeli Army Radio quoted an unnamed senior member of President Bush ’s entourage as saying , during the President ’s visit to Israel , that Bush and Cheney were “ of the opinion that military action against Iran was called for . ”
The White House immediately denied the report .
President Bush had just given a particularly bellicose speech to the Israeli Knesset where he bluntly pledged that the U.S. would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
Reminiscent of his “ Axis of Evil ” speech , the President listed Iran , Syria , Hamas , Hezbollah and Al Qaeda as enemies and spoke about a “ battle of good and evil . ”
The Asia Times claimed that Bush plans an air attack in Iran before August .
The source is an unnamed former assistant U.S. Secretary of State who is active in the foreign affairs community .
The article goes on to say that Senators Diane Feinstein and Richard Lugar have been briefed about the planned attack .
Both Senators denied receiving any briefing , but since the information is classified it would be impossible for them to verify the existence of such a plan without violating the law .
According to the Asia Times , the target of attack would not be the Iranian nuclear installations but rather the Quds force , which are the elite forces of the Iranian army .
Time magazine in an article titled , “ A Clamor for War , ” treats the possibility of an attack against Iran as worrisome and real .
The piece says that many in the Congress think that the administration will “ bomb Iran between November and January . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had a 90 - minute meeting with President Bush in Washington at the beginning of June .
It had been widely reported that Olmert would make the case for an American air attack against Iran .
After their talk Olmert proclaimed , “ we reached agreement on the need to take care of the Iranian threat .
I left with a lot less [ sic ] question marks [ than ]
I had entered with regarding the means , the timetable restrictions and American resoluteness to deal with the problem .
George Bush understands the severity of the Iranian threat and the need to vanquish it and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term in the White House . ”
When Michael Gordon reported in the New York Times on June 20 , that Israel had a dress rehearsal for an attack on Iran that involved 100 fighter planes using NATO airspace off the coast of Greece , neither the U.S. nor Israel denied the report .
Prior to that report Shaul Mofaz , the Israeli Transportation Minister , who is in the inner defense cabinet , told the Israeli daily , Yedioth Ahronoth , that Israel would attack Iran since the sanctions are not working .
One thing is certain : there is a clear possibility of a strike against Iran in the near future .
The CBS story claims that Israel is now telling the United States , either you do it or we will .
Unfortunately , whoever does it is courting a major disaster .
An attack on Iran could provoke a retaliation that could quickly widen into a third American war in the region .
Vulnerable targets include Israel , shipping in the Gulf , and American troops in Iraq .
The reasons for attacking Iran are clearly less about that country ’s nuclear threat and more about the neo-con project for American hegemony in the region , as well as what the current Israeli government perceives as its security interests .
It is all too reminiscent of the false reasons given for invading Iraq .
Unfortunately , just as before the Iraq war , many American political opposition voices are reluctant to criticize an aggressive Iran initiative for fear of being labeled weak or unpatriotic .
It is disappointing that the Democrats who came to power in 2006 by purporting to be antiwar , are proving yet again that just as they have been incapable of stopping the Bush / Cheney debacle in Iraq , they are equally ineffectual in opposing the looming next war , the one with Iran .
Freya Valentine said she had not heard of supermarkets running out of carrots A teenager could be behind a surge in global carrot sales after setting up a popular Facebook page as a joke , urging people to " panic buy " the vegetable .
Supermarkets are bracing themselves after more than 230,000 people joined Freya Valentine 's group .
It urges people to " go out and buy a load of carrots " on 15 May .
Ms Valentine , of Goring , Oxfordshire , who is celebrating her 19th birthday , said the interest highlighted the power of social networking sites .
She said she had the idea in January on a night out and within weeks her group had about 60,000 members .
To be honest , I wish I could say something really good , like I 'm trying to make a political point but I 'm not
Freya Valentine
" It all went a bit quiet in April but suddenly it got really massive again , " she told the BBC News website .
" I certainly was n't expecting the response I 've got and for people to be so interested . "
Ms Valentine , who is on a gap year before starting university , said there was not real point to the exercise other than " the fact that a global shortage of carrots would be quite a laugh " .
The date was chosen because it was her birthday .
She added that she would be popping out to buy some carrots in a couple of supermarkets in her nearest town of Reading , Berkshire , later in the day .
Carrot facts
The average person will consume 10,866 carrots in a lifetime
The longest carrot recorded was 5.14 m ( 16ft 10.5 in ) in 1996 Carrots were first grown as a medicine not a food Carrots are not always orange and can also be found in purple , white , red or yellow
The carrot is a member of the parsley family including species such as celery , parsnip , fennel , dill and coriander Source : www.carrotmuseum.co.uk
" To be honest , I wish I could say something really good , like I 'm trying to make a political point but I 'm not .
" But it does demonstrate the power of social networking site that there are more than 200,000 plus members . "
She said there had been media interest in her campaign from around the world , as far away as New Zealand and Australia .
When asked how many carrots she expected each person to buy , she said : " A trolley full of carrots is probably a bit much to expect . "
But other Facebook groups ask people not to take part in the prank .
One says : " This group is in response to Facebook junkies who have dedicated their precious May 15th to panic buying carrots in an attempt to deprive Britain ( and heaven knows how many other countries ) of vital vitamins and orangey goodness that comes only from everyone 's favourite vegetable !
Other Facebook groups urge against panic buying carrots " If you see anyone irresponsibly filling a shopping trolley with copious amounts of carrots , stop them and question them as to why they need to buy so many carrots . "
So far , Ms Valentine said she had not heard of any supermarkets running out of the vegetable .
A spokesman for one of the UK's top four supermarkets , Asda , said he did not think the prank would have too much of an effect .
" I 'm sure they 'll be a short uplift but nothing we can't cope with , " he said .

What are these ?
Mr McClellan criticised the way in which officials attacked his book A former White House press secretary has said he does not know whether White House officials broke the law when they leaked a CIA agent 's identity .
He also alleged President Bush and Vice President Cheney had asked him to say an aide to Mr Cheney had not leaked the name , a claim which later proved false .
Scott McClellan 's remarks came during testimony before a US congressional committee about the White House 's role .
Mr McClellan also criticised aides ' reaction to his book about the affair .
White House officials had been " misrepresenting what I wrote and seeking to discredit me though inaccurate personal attacks , " he told the US House of Representatives ' Judiciary Committee .
And he called on President George W Bush to embrace " openness and candour ... and constantly strive to build trust across the aisle " .
Leak inquiry Mr McClellan was being questioned by the committee about his role in the 2003 leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plame 's covert status .
In his testimony , Mr McClellan asserted that the White House has " refused " to tell the whole story about administration officials ' role in the Plame affair , despite having " promised or assured the American people that at some point when this was behind us [ it ] would talk publicly about it " .
Mr McClellan 's book caused a storm on publication last month for its revelations about the CIA leak case .
In the book , Mr McClellan stated that he had " unknowingly passed along false information " , when he had announced in a press conference that two White House officials - Karl Rove and Lewis " Scooter " Libby - were " not involved " in leaking Ms Plame 's identity .
WHAT IS CIA LEAK CASE ABOUT ?
Libby was found guilty of lying to the FBI and a grand jury over revelations about CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity Critics said the White House leaked Ms Plame 's identity to undermine her husband , ex-ambassador Joseph Wilson
He had publicly cast doubt on the Bush administration 's case for war in Iraq
The alleged cover - up , rather than the leak itself , was the subject of the Libby trial
Q&A : CIA leak case
And he alleged that " five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice - president , the president 's chief - of - staff , and the president himself . "
He later stressed that he was not suggesting Mr Bush deliberately lied .
Libby , Vice - President Dick Cheney 's former chief - of - staff , was the only person charged over the affair .
He was sentenced to 30 months in jail for obstructing an inquiry into the leaking of the identity .
However , Mr Bush intervened in July 2007 to prevent Libby from serving a prison term .
Later that month , a judge dismissed a civil lawsuit brought by Ms Plame against Mr Cheney and other Bush administration officials .
She maintained her cover had been blown after her husband , Joseph Wilson , a former ambassador , said the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence on Iraq to back its case for war .

Data maturity in New Zealand : Most businesses are on the low end
Israel " will attack " Iran if it continues to develop nuclear weapons , one of prime minister Ehud Olmert 's deputies warned yesterday .
Shaul Mofaz , a former defence minister and a contender to replace the scandal - battered Olmert , said military action would be " unavoidable " if Tehran proved able to acquire the technology to manufacture atomic bombs .
Mofaz is Israel 's transport minister , but he is also a former chief of staff , privy to secret defence planning as a member of the security cabinet , and leads regular strategic talks with the US .
He implied that any attack on Iran would be coordinated with Washington .
" If Iran continues with its programme for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it , " he told the Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot .
" The UN sanctions are ineffective . "
Mofaz was born in Iran , giving his remarks extra edge after repeated threats against Israel from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has also denied the Nazi Holocaust .
Ahmadinejad " would disappear before Israel does " , Mofaz said .
Mofaz 's remarks came at the end of a week of intense US - Israeli talks on Iran .
They were also the most explicit threat yet against the Islamic Republic from a member of the Israeli government , which , like the Bush administration , has preferred to hint at force as a last resort should UN sanctions be deemed to have failed .
Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential candidate , told pro-Israeli lobbyists this week that the military option against Iran remained on the table , though he also offered " meaningful concessions " if it bowed to international demands .
Ehud Barak , the defence minister and Labour party leader , said Israel needed to do everything possible to ensure that the Iranians did not obtain nuclear power .
Javier Solana , the EU foreign policy chief , is shortly to lead a team of high - ranking diplomats from Britain , France , Russia , China and Germany , who will present a package of incentives to persuade Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran has rejected it in advance .
Experts doubt whether Israel could destroy Iran 's extensive and heavily defended nuclear facilities without American help .
In 1981 Israel bombed and destroyed Iraq 's nuclear reactor .
Last September its planes bombed a site in Syria that the US said was a nuclear reactor built with North Korean help .
Syria denied having any such facility .
Israel is believed to have an arsenal of 150-400 nuclear warheads .
Unlike Iran , it has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
Iran denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons and insisted it would not abandon enrichment .
But the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , has demanded " full disclosure " from Tehran over allegations that it covertly studied how to design a nuclear weapon .
Iran has dismissed intelligence on this as baseless , forged or irrelevant .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said on Sunday he expects Democratic superdelegates to reveal their choice for presidential nominee soon after the final primary in June and that Hillary Clinton will then have to quit the race .
In an interview with Sky News , Carter said he did not think Clinton was achieving anything by staying in the fight .
“ I think not .
But of course she has the perfect right to do so , ” he said while attending a literary festival in Britain .
“ I ’m a superdelegate ... I think a lot of the superdelegates will make a decision quite , announced quite rapidly , after the final primary on June 3 , ” he told Sky News .
“ I have not yet announced publicly , but I think at that point it will be time for her to give it up , ” Carter said .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is seen as front - runner .
He holds a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the party ’s August nominating convention after months of contests that began in January .
Clinton has refused to quit until the last votes are cast and counted and the Democratic nominee is likely to be decided by the nearly 800 “ superdelegates ” -- members of Congress and other party insiders -- free to vote for whomever they want .
The Democratic candidates need 2,026 delegates to be nominated to run against Republican John McCain in the November 4 U.S. presidential election .
According to estimates by MSNBC , Obama now has 1,954 while Clinton has 1,783 .
There are 86 delegates left to be chosen in the state - by - state contests .

At first glance , the Atomium looks like a candidate for the World 's Largest Roadside Attractions .
And why not ?
It puts the World 's Largest Baseball Bat and the World 's Largest Bicycles to shame .
Yet the city fathers of Brussels would hasten to tell you that , far from being an example of kitsch , the Atomium is a lasting symbol of the 1958 Brussels World 's Fair and Belgium 's answer to the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty .
Tastes obviously differ regarding the aesthetic appeal of a giant molecule .
Still , the Atomium is an impressive structure when viewed from close up .
It stands 332 feet ( 102 meters ) high and consists of nine spheres of 59 feet ( 18 m ) diameter connected by tubes measuring 94 feet ( 29 m ) in length and 10 feet ( 3 m ) thick .
Escalators connect the spheres , most of which contain science exhibits .
An elevator ( said to be Europe 's fastest ) leads to an observation gallery and restaurant in the topmost atom .

Hi folks , Opera has a proposal for a specification that would revive ( and supersede ) the file upload API that has been lingering so long as a work item .
In a nutshell , it provides the ability for a web application to get a filespace , by asking the user to identify such a space , and making it available to that application something like a virtual file system .
Use cases include single or bulk file upload ( e.g for images , a set of files , etc ) , as well as allowing the creation of widgets that use a set of local files .
For example , you could make a music player widget by giving access to a mountpoint that contains music files , and you could add music to that directory which would also be available to traditional applications on the system .
This is a draft , and we expect it to change .
Opera has implementation of this , and we will make available some experimental builds for people to play with in the near future .
We hope that the working group will take this as a replacement for file upload so it can develop as a useful interoperable standard .
A draft is at http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/fileio/fileIO.htm
so you can have a look .
All manner of feedback is of course welcome ... cheers Chaals -- Charles McCathieNevile Opera Software , Standards Group je parle français -- hablo español -- jeg lærer norsk http://my.opera.com/chaals

Only several days have passed since Starbucks and AT&T officially made available free Wi-Fi to US customers ( upon purchase , registration , and use of a Starbucks Card with corresponding rewards program ) , and already T - Mobile , the coffee chain ’s pre-existing wireless Internet service partner , has presented a lawsuit in New York state court .
Reuters reported on T - Mobile ’s filing Friday evening , in which the company claims that Starbucks “ secretly colluded with AT&T to offer free Wi-Fi Internet access in its cafes despite an exclusive agreement with T - Mobile . ”
T - Mobile is said to be “ seeking unspecified damages against Starbucks for breach of its contract and unfair competition . ”
Upon announcement of the new deal , Starbucks said that it ’s long - standing arrangement with T - Mobile would be phased out in 2008 , a plan T - Mobile allows is true , though it says that the stipulations of said plan was that the original provider for Starbucks was to maintain “ the exclusive right to ‘ sell , market and promote its services ’ in Starbucks stores until those stores were fully converted to the AT&T system . ”
The suit goes on to allege in greater detail that “ Starbucks stores would be transitioned ( away from T - Mobile ) ‘ on a market - to - market basis . ’ ”
T - Mobile stated that , as of Thursday , the original date of the suit , only locations within San Antonio , TX , and Bakersfield , CA , had completely made the transition .
Though T - Mobile may claim Starbucks has breached their previous agreement , it seems that the coffee giant can perhaps slide past negative judgement in court - if the case is to proceed that far .
T - Mobile ’s admittance that a gradual , market - to - market transition may well give Starbucks a wide enough window to respond with the technical argument that has followed those rules .
It could be exceedingly difficult - save for a good supply of evidence of conflicting transgressions - for T - Mobile to secure a win .
AT&T and other telecommunications companies are being sued for allegedly allowing federal au ­ thorities to tap phone lines for years without a warrant .
President George W. Bush wants Congress to grant the companies retroactive immunity , and the Senate has agreed .
But I think such a grant of blanket immunity would be a big mistake .
To be sure , this is a thorny issue that pits concerns over civil liberties and privacy against national security and government secrecy .
Available information says the government wanted the wiretaps to catch communications with overseas terrorists shortly after 9/11 .
And certainly it was a frantic , desperate time .
But the whole point of laws is to ensure that we -- and more important , our government -- act with regard for both safety and essential freedoms at just such periods .
So you should care about how these cases are settled .
Here 's the main issue : Class - action lawsuits claim the companies broke the law by allowing the government to implement wiretaps without a warrant or special certification .
The companies say they acted in " good faith " -- and there 's no denying that they acted in response to requests from the highest levels of government .
Was the surveillance legal , though ?
Under existing wiretapping law , companies have legal cover against lawsuits when they receive a warrant or a certification from the attorney general .
But the administration has classified any such documents that they may have given the companies as " state secrets , " preventing the firms from showing them .
So the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , which reports it has reviewed letters given to the companies by the administration , says the businesses involved should re ­ - ceive retroactive immunity because they can't properly defend themselves .
That kind of catch - 22 logic concerns me .
For the sake of argument , let 's say sensitive information in these seven - year - old documents could hurt current surveillance efforts .
Luckily , a rival bill passed by the House has a solution .
The House bill says the businesses involved can present a received certification , letters , or other documents in a secret session before a judge , without the plaintiffs present .
If , as the Senate report states , letters and documents given to the telephone companies " stated that the activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney General , " then a judge could consider that a strong defense , and companies would likely and justifiably escape penalty .
But if one or more of these companies broke the law and handed over our data without a warrant or legal certification , they should be held accountable .
These were n't emergency wiretaps to forestall an immediate threat ( in which case existing legal provisions allow the government to wiretap right away and get a warrant afterwards ) , but were longstanding surveillance programs .
Company lawyers likely knew the legal ramifications of these programs by heart and had plenty of time to either request and receive a warrant or certification , or refuse the request .
( One company -- Qwest - - says that it did refuse when the government did n't offer a warrant . )
Congress may debate these bills for some time , but we need to get to the bottom of this and determine whether these companies that are custodians of our communications are doing what they are legally obligated to do to protect our privacy .
And if these companies broke the law and handed over our data without legal justification , they should pay .
I think the courts are exactly the right place for that determination .

Bernie Ward , the most prominent liberal voice on Bay Area talk radio for more than two decades , admitted Thursday to distribution of child pornography by e-mail in a plea deal that will send him to federal prison for at least five years .
Ward , 57 , a former Roman Catholic priest , was a fixture on KGO - AM 810 for three hours every weeknight , known in recent years for his fervent denunciations of President Bush and the war in Iraq during his news talk show .
He also hosted " God Talk , " a Sunday morning program on religion , and was a prolific fundraiser for the station 's charity drives .
But his career disintegrated Dec. 6 with the unsealing of a federal grand jury indictment , issued three months earlier , that charged him with two counts of distributing and one count of receiving Internet images of child pornography .
KGO fired him Dec. 31 .
At a 30 - minute hearing in federal court in San Francisco , Ward admitted he was guilty of a single charge of distributing child pornography , saying it involved " exchanging an image of a minor engaged in sexually explicit activity " in December 2004 .
The plea agreement he signed , quoted in court , contained an admission that he had sent between 15 and 150 pornographic images via e-mail .
Delay in accepting plea
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker said he was satisfied that Ward was voluntarily admitting guilt , but he granted defense lawyer Doron Weinberg 's request to delay accepting the plea until a sentencing hearing Aug. 28 .
If the plea had been formally entered Thursday , Ward could have been sent to prison immediately .
Ward exchanged hugs with family members and friends before and after the hearing .
Wearing a suit and tie and looking grim , he described his conduct succinctly to Walker , showed little hesitation when the judge asked him about waiving his right to go to trial , and said of his guilty plea , " I worked it out in conjunction with my attorney . "
As part of the deal , Weinberg said outside court , federal prosecutors agreed to drop two additional child pornography charges and ask for a sentence of no more than nine years .
The maximum under the law is 20 years .
The case was prosecuted by the Justice Department in Washington , D.C. , after the U.S. attorney 's office in San Francisco bowed out for unstated reasons .
The department issued a brief statement describing Ward 's plea agreement and had no further comment .
Ward initially pleaded not guilty and said he had downloaded a few pornographic images over several weeks as research for a book on hypocrisy among Americans who preach morality in public .
But he was confronted by a federal law that flatly prohibits possessing , receiving or distributing child pornography - regardless of intent - and requires at least five years in prison for each conviction .
His hopes of maintaining a defense based on a constitutional right to research taboo subjects appeared to be weakened further when police in Oakdale ( Stanislaus County ) released transcripts in February of a series of online sex chats between Ward and a dominatrix in December 2004 and January 2005 .
The transcripts quote Ward as fantasizing about naked children with no apparent reference to any subject he was researching .
Police said he had sent photos to the woman that showed children engaged in sexual activity .
' Role playing ' alleged
Weinberg said outside court Thursday that his client had been " playing roles " in the message exchange .
Weinberg said he would argue for a five - year sentence for Ward rather than the nine years that prosecutors are seeking .
He said a five - year term could be reduced by about nine months for good behavior in prison .
" In terms of his freedom , his future , he 's lost almost everything , " Weinberg said .
" He 's not going to be able to come out ( of prison ) and return to the work he does so well . "
In a preview of arguments at the sentencing hearing , Weinberg told the judge that Ward was " a man with an impeccable record of service to his community " and that the crime involved " an error of judgment rather than sexual proclivities . "
Since his indictment was unsealed , Ward has been confined to his San Francisco home , with electronic monitoring , as a condition of $ 250,000 bail .
He has been allowed to leave only to work , to drive his children to and from school , and to go to church .
Ward , a San Francisco native , went to St. Ignatius High School and the University of San Francisco , and earned a master 's degree in theology from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley .
He was ordained to the priesthood with the Society of the Precious Blood in 1977 but left two years later , explaining afterward that he wanted to marry and have children .
He has four children .
After the priesthood , Ward worked as a schoolteacher , served as legislative assistant for then - Rep. Barbara Boxer for three years and was hired by KGO in 1985 .
As an investigative reporter , he won a national award for a series of stories in the mid-1990s , in partnership with the San Francisco Examiner , that exposed financial and sexual improprieties in the San Francisco Archdiocese .
As a talk show host since 1992 , Ward was called the " lion of the left " by KGO and had a devoted following .
His " God Talk " show , which he described as the work closest to his heart , included discussions of the Christian mission to help the poor and of misconduct in organized religion , especially in his own Catholic faith .
Strict federal law
Ward 's indictment , and his claim that he was a researcher rather than an exploiter of children , focused attention on the strict federal law , which considers motive and intent to be irrelevant .
The rationale is that anyone who possesses child pornography adds to the national market for a product that degrades youth .
In court papers , Weinberg had urged Walker to allow him to argue to the jury that Ward had a " First Amendment - protected right to research and comment upon societal mores , " which included viewing pornographic images .
No court has recognized such a right , however , and a federal appeals court in Virginia rejected it in a 2000 ruling upholding a journalist 's conviction .
Justice Department lawyer Steven Grocki said in a filing in Ward 's case that the defense asserted by Weinberg " would invite every defendant charged with child pornography crimes to suddenly become a legitimate researcher educating the masses via their blogs . "
After Thursday 's hearing , Weinberg said he still believes Ward had a legitimate defense but one that was too risky to pursue .
Any leniency that prosecutors are now offering would disappear after a trial and conviction , he said , and the price would be an additional " five or six years of a man 's life . "
new study has revealed that Indians belonging to higher castes are genetically closer to Europeans than are individuals from lower castes , whose genetic profiles are closer to those of Asians .
The study compared genetic markers located on the Y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA  between 265 Indian men of various castes and 750 African , Asian , European and other Indian men .
To broaden the study , 40 markers from chromosomes 1 to 22 were analyzed from more than 600 individuals from different castes and continents .
The comparison of the markers among these groups confirmed that genetic similarities to Europeans increased as caste rank increased .
The study , led by Michael Bamshad of the University of Utah , in Salt Lake City , and his colleagues , is reported to be the most comprehensive genetic analysis to date of the impact of European migrations on the structure and origin of the current Indian population .
The article appears in the current issue of Genome Research .
The caste system , defined in ancient Sanskrit texts , determines a person 's rank in society :
The Brahmin , who were traditionally priests and scholars , held the highest rank in Hindu society .
Warriors and rulers made up the Kshatriya who were the next in line to the Brahmin .
Merchants , traders , farmers , and artisans were the third caste called the Vysya .
The Shudra were the fourth rank and consisted of laborers .
Because of strict rules forbidding marriage between men and women of different castes , these four classes remained distinct for thousands of years .
Bamshad 's team found that Y chromosomes from the Brahmin and Kshatriya closely resembled European Y chromosomes rather than Asian Y chromosomes .
The Y chromosomes from the lower castes bore more similarities to the Asian Y chromosome .
The mitochondrial DNA showed the same pattern .
The authors believe their results support the notion that Europeans who migrated into India between 3,000 and 8,000 years ago may have merged with or imposed their social structure on the native northern Indians and placed themselves into the highest castes .
Analysis of the paternally transmitted Y chromosome among Indians in general indicated that the Y chromosome had a more European flavor .
Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA among Indians is more Asian than European .
This suggests that the Europeans who entered India were predominantly male .

Number Munchers was an educational game created by MECC to teach basic math skills in the 1980s to 1990s .
About Number Munchers ( wikipedia )
This site is dedicated to the classic game that helped me learn my multiplication tables .
A simple 5 k version of the game as a DHTML page was created for a 5 k contest and then not entered .
Some friends actually enjoyed playing it again so I decided to not let it go to waste and here it is ... from over a decade ago .
Sorry for the downtime in 2017 , somebody attacked the site with unsubstantiated claims and I had to deal with a less than helpful hosting provider .
I was busy and forgot ...
Would have been nice if some of the people who used this kept my contact info and bothered me ...
I suppose a better version of the game should be created given that I used to have a fair amount of people using it but the lack of reaction to this situation makes me wonder if it is worth my time ( or that of my CS students ... many have started but none have completed something I can publish here .
I realize github exists but I was hoping this could give a student something they made for a portfolio . )

Diary of a Failed Startup
This was a self - funded startup that a college friend and I worked on for a year and a half .
We launched 3 websites in that time .
It ended up going nowhere , but there seems to be a lot of folks asking for stories of startups that just fade away , so I made this blog public anyway .
Wikispaces was founded in 2005 and has since been used by educators , companies and individuals across the globe .
Unfortunately , the time has come where we have had to make the difficult business decision to end the Wikispaces service .
We first announced the site closure in January 2018 , through a site - wide banner that appeared to all logged - in users and needed to be clicked on to dismiss
During the closure period a range of banners were shown to users , including a countdown banner in the final month .
Additionally , the home page of Wikispaces.com became a blog , detailing the reasons for the closure .
Private Label Site Administrators were contacted separately regarding the closure
As any self - respecting geek would know , there have been some pretty wild ideas for science fiction TV shows .
It must have taken a certain warped genius to come up with Doctor Who , Quantum Leap , Lost or The 4400 .
Of course , those were hits .
But some weird ideas did n't catch on so well .
Take K - 9000 ( 1990 ) , about a cop who is telepathically linked to a talking , bionic police dog .
Or L.A.X. 2194 ( 1994 ) , a sitcom starring the not - yet - famous Matthew Perry and Ryan Stiles as baggage handlers at Los Angeles Airport , 200 years into the future .
Strangely , neither of those made it beyond a pilot episode .
The following shows did n't last so long , either .
But when you read about them , you can't help thinking " What a wild idea ! " 
( or perhaps " How did they expect anyone to watch that one ? "  )
1. My Living Doll ( 1964 -1965 )
How 's this for an idea ?
Build a shapely female robot and give her to a lady - killing military psychiatrist so he can teach her how to be ( ahem ) a perfect woman .
Despite that foolproof concept , this sitcom about Rhoda ( played by Julie Newmar , TVs first Catwoman ) , who lives with Bob McDonald ( Robert Cummings ) and avoids the lecherous advances of their neighbour , Peter Robinson ( Jack Mullaney ) , only lasted one season .
It was long enough for Bob to leave the series , so that Rhoda was placed in the care of " ¦
Peter !
Naturally , the best man for the job is the guy who spent all his time leering at her .
Of course , the joke was on him .
How could you have a relationship with a machine ?
( Of course , as this was a sixties sitcom , they never really covered that " ¦ )
2. Alternative 3 ( 1977 )
Even in the seventies , people were worried about global warming .
With this in mind , Alternative 3 was about a secret colony on Mars , built by American and Russian scientists because planet Earth was a lost cause .
( The title came from the three alternatives : cut population , cut consumption , or the one they eventually chose : cut and run . )
Not a bad idea for a TV series , perhaps .
But no , the makers of this one - off British special decided to do it as a mockumentary .
The result : thousands of panicking viewers phoned the production company , demanding to know how long they had left to change planets .
Writer David Ambrose was unrepentant , saying that he was " constantly amazed at the gullibility of people . " 
American networks turned it down , remembering the panic that happened when Orson Welles scared the U.S. public with his 1938 War of the Worlds radio play .
3. The Ultimate Impostor ( 1979 )
Another pilot that did n't hit the big time .
In this one , a secret agent 's brain is erased by the Russians .
As a replacement , a computer is implanted into his skull that programs him with a new personality each week .
But he has limited time to use each personality , as they fade after 72 hours .
If this had been a series , it might have been a great role for a versatile character actor , who would basically get to play a different character each episode .
As it was , it did n't turn lead actor Joseph Hacker into a star " “ and neither did anything else .
Still , he 's been busy ever since , playing numerous character roles .
So maybe he could have done it " ¦
4. Cold Lazarus ( 1996 )
Dennis Potter was known to many in Britain as the Shakespeare of television writers .
His miniseries , like Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective ( both turned into Hollywood movies ) , were critically acclaimed — and to be honest , downright weird .
But his last miniseries ( filmed after his death ) was possibly the weirdest .
Set 400 years into the future , it was about a virtual reality environment created from the visions and memories of playwright Daniel Feeld ( Albert Finney ) .
The thing is , Feeld has been dead for years , so the scientists take all of his visions from his disembodied and cryogenically frozen head .
Raising the question : did Potter intend to put his own head in deep freeze ?
5. Day Break ( 2006 )
Remember Groundhog Day , the classic 1992 comedy in which Bill Murray lives the same day over and over again ?
How about Groundhog Day : The Series — minus the laughs .
Yes , really .
In Day Break , Taye Diggs played a police detective framed for a murder , who relives the same day in each episode , always getting closer to finding the real murderer .
You might not think that this idea can sustain a whole series " ¦ and you might have a point .
It was pulled after six episodes due to dismal ratings .
The ABC put the remaining seven episodes on its website , so that fans ( few as they were ) could relive the day a few more times .
6. Gilligan's Planet ( 1982 -1983 )
Everyone knows Gilligan 's Island , that 1960s sitcom about seven people stranded on a desert island .
Sadly , while they seemed to know their location , none of them — not even the Skipper or the all - knowing Professor — was able to build a boat .
An animated sequel , however , made a logical suggestion : they built a spaceship ( out of trees , coconuts , the usual stuff ) and blasted off , hoping to return home .
Instead , they went off - course , crashing on an alien planet , where they would be stranded .
Hoo boy .
Strangely , this possibly was n't the dumbest idea for a cartoon based on a sitcom .
It might come a close second to The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang ( 1980 ) , in which Richie , the Fonz and their pals get stuck in a time - machine and have adventures in different times while trying to return home to the Milwaukee of 1957 .
Yeesh !
Do n't believe us ?

S.F. cracks down on car break - ins Hundreds per month - laptop left on seat is n't there for long
It took just 90 seconds .
San Francisco police , concerned about a rash of auto break - ins near St. Mary 's Cathedral , parked a nice , shiny car on nearby Cleary Court one morning last month , complete with a laptop and GPS device visible in the front seat .
They set up a video camera and waited , but it did n't take long .
A man loitered around the bait car , briefly walked away when a patrol car drove by , then came back and threw a spark plug through the window and made off with the loot , police said today .
Elapsed time from parking to window smashing : a minute and a half .
The suspect was followed by an unmarked police car and quickly arrested .
Jason Robinson , 25 , was jailed for violating terms of the probation he received for a conviction for burglary and receiving stolen property in 2006 , authorities said .
There are nearly 1,000 car break - ins every month in the city , said Lt. Mike Biel of the police auto section .
Officers showed the video they made of the undercover sting today with a warning to people who park in the city - keep valuables out of sight , even power cords that suggest there are expensive devices in the car .
Car break - ins are down slightly from last year , but they are still epidemic in several places in the city , police said .
Those include the Embarcadero from Fisherman 's Wharf to Howard Street , the Western Addition and along the beach near the Great Highway .
Police say car burglaries are " 99 percent preventable . "
Deputy Chief David Shinn said motorists have to protect themselves by keeping their property out of view .
" They are very good at what they are doing , " he said of the thieves .
Another deputy chief , Kevin Cashman , said thieves do n't hang onto the loot for very long .
" Typically , it is stolen and sold within the hour , " he said .

I first saw a Lego Imperial Star Destroyer at the Power House Museum during the Star Wars Magic of Myth exhibition .
Of course I immediately wanted one .
But it would take nearly two years before the dream became a reality .
After much drooling over sets that went on ebay , I finally took the plunge on a buy - it - now set .
I then waited the two full months for the surface mail package to arrive .
And what a package it was .
According to the packing slip , 21 pounds worth of lego and cardboard .
Out of the external packing box , I weighed it on an old bathroom scale , and it came to about 18 pounds .
10030 box , with ruler for scale
Inside the outer box , there are four smaller boxes , stuffed full of lego , and a * massive * instruction manual - over 1 cm thick !
I laid out all the baggies alongside each box :
I weighed just the Lego in the baggies - it came to 5.3 kg !
( that 's nearly 12 pounds ! ) .
And it took ten minutes just to flick through the instruction manual from end to end !
This site has an extremelly cool animation of the construction of the ship as recorded by a webcam every five seconds , and then put together into a four minute avi file .
And this one has Darth Vader supervising gungans building it .
This is an Aussie dude who made one .
This is where I found out that there are two identical copies of the internal A - frame .
This guy made the two A - frames concurrently , and I decided to do the same thing .
He also made the Tantive IV ship first , which I was planning to do also .
And he had a good idea for making the 32 little detail strips , will probably do that too .
So Thursday night I sat down to begin .
I cleared a space on my desk , and opened the whopping instruction manual .
As you can see from the above picture , I did n't have much room to work with once the intruction manual was opened and I had the baggies of smaller pieces spread around .
This is fine for working on small sections of lego , but I had real problems with the wings .
I 'd recommend a space three times the size of the A3 - sized manual , such as a dining table .
I also kept all the Lego in the baggies they came in , and did n't empty them out .
This seemed to work fairly well , once I started to remember which pieces were in which bags .
I began with the Tantive IV ship , thinking I 'd rather finish on the big ship not the little one .
The reasoning was ok , except that until I had a feel for which baggies all the pieces were in , I was doing a lot of hunting and gathering just to find the small numbers of pieces needed for the tiny ship .
I would have been better off leaving it til the end I think .
So as it was it took me nearly an hour to make the Tantive IV and the name plate .
Next came the twin A - frames .
Having been warned by reading other sites that there were two to make , I decided to make them simultaneously .
Fast forward to Saturday morning , 20.11.04 .
I also followed this dude 's suggestion of mounting the 16 ( x2 ) identical detail panels to a lego plate and building them there .
There 's a mistake in the frames when I photographed them , which I did n't discover until I went to mount the wings :)
Next came the mounting stand , which is built into the infrastructure of the ship itself for stability .
Until the engines are mounted though , it 's rather nose - heavy and tilts down .
Some closeups of the engines .
It seems very strange making engines out of wheels and barrels .
Once attached , the whole engine structure looks like this :
I ran into space problems when I began to assemble the " wings " .
The table was n't big enough to spread out the instructions next to the wings , so I was building the wings on top of the intructions .
But you have to change pages every three or four pieces , before they 're properly fastened , so I was constantly having to move everything and realign everything .
So I gave up and moved to the floor .
This presented its own problems , as the floor is n't solid , and you can't press big plates together very easily , as they just sink into the carpet .
The wings are cleverly held on by three 2x2 plates at the outer edges , and four magnets on the inner edge .
So it 's very easy to flip open the wings to see the interior .
Not that you can flip the bottom edges very far , and another magnet or two may be useful to prevent the bottom wings just falling off .
By dinner time on Saturday I had all four " wings " completed ( I was n't working all day ! ) .
There 's a gaping hole with an angled mounting frame for the rest of the ship .
The mounting frame is hinged at one end , and to lift the bottom of the ship , simply lift this frame up , then stick your hand into the depths of the ship to grab hold of the chassis .
It 's quite sturdy and you can carry all of the ship at this stage around very easily .
Next came the " body " of the ship .
This section is bristling with grilles , cones , taps , levers , clips , and right angled panels .
The interior is all technic beams and pins , and lets the side parts angle down .
There 's also a whopping great blue tower in the middle , for lining up the bridge section with , and for use as a handle :)
Moving up , we have the back " spine " that leads up to the command decks .
The command deck section is rather weird , and is n't solid , but the panels actually wiggle significantly when touched .
The command deck slots into the spine , which then slots into another layer of the body of the ship .
These three components then sit atop the main body .
When I 'd finished , I ended up with the standard number of extra pieces , as well as one extra wing .
So I poked my head around the superstructure ( fortunately it 's perfectly symmetrical ) and finally found where I 'd forgotten to attach it .
I also ended up with four extra magnets , which are n't listed on Peeron as being extra .
But there were no mounting brackets , so I guess those must be spares also .
And so twelve hours after I began , we have the Imperial Star Destroyer .
I spent very approximately 12 hours building this set :
Tantive IV and name plate : 1 hour
A - frame structure : 1 3/4 hours
A - frame detail : 3/4 hour
Frame attachment and stand : 3/4 hour
Engines : 1/2 hour
Wings : 3 1/2 hours
Main body : 2 1/4 hours
Spine : 1/4 hour
Command deck : 3/4 hour
Last layer of body : 1/4 hour
And definitely worth it :)
Had various friends and kids over to have a look at it today ( Sunday ) .
Although the kids were far more interested in playing with the Harry Potter lego I had out .
Oh well :)
There 's something about a treehouse that appeals to all of us .
Maybe it 's the view , or getting close to nature , or reliving childhood memories .
There are many ways to enjoy treehouses , no matter what age you are .
A Treehouse Protest
Beginning in 1997 , Julia Butterfly
Hill spent two years in a treehouse , 180 feet up in a tree named Luna to protest old - growth logging .
Her treehouse was only a 6x8 foot tent , but she had plenty of visitors and conducted interviews via cellphone .
Luna was estimated to be somewhere between 600 and 1,000 years old !
Hill 's protest drew the support of Earth First ! and other environmental organizations .
Hill finally came down from the tree on December 18 , 1999 when Pacific Lumber Company agreed to spare the tree and a three - acre buffer area .
In 2001 , the tree was damaged by someone with a chain saw who cut a 32 - inch deep gash around the trunk .
Guy wires were added for support , and the tree survives today .
The Treehouse as Art
The Steampunk Tree House is a 30 - foot - tall interactive work of art first exhibited at Burning Man .
It is made of recycled wood and metal , and outfitted with steam pipes , which can exude puffs of steam when needed .
There are solar panels included , which power LED lights .
The Steampunk Tree House will appear at the Coachella 2008 music festival next weekend and the Stagecoach music festival in May , both in Indio , California .
Hotels
Sanya Nanshan
You can find treehouse hotels all over the world .
Sanya Nanshan Treehouse Resort and Beach Club offers four treehouses as vacation rentals near the beach near Nanshan Mountain in south China .
The Tree Houses Hotel
The Tree Houses Hotel is a bed and breakfast in Costa Rica , in the rain forest near Arenal Volcano .
Cedar Creek Treehouse
Cedar Creek Treehouse at Mt. Ranier in Washington is a cabin 50 feet high in a giant cedar tree .
Climb a spiral staircase around a nearby fir tree and cross a swinging bridge and you can see the view from an observatory 100 feet in the air !
Permanent Homes
If you want to live in a treehouse all the time , there are ways to do it .
Finca Bellavista Rainforest
Village is a permanent community of treehouses at the base of a rain forest mountain in Costa Rica .
The goal of the community is to preserve rain forest acreage and promote sustainable living arrangements .
Grownup Retreats
Treehouse Teahouse
Japanese professor of architecture Terunobu Fujimori built his boyhood dream in his father 's garden in 2004 .
It 's a teahouse on stilts !
They call it the " Too High Teahouse "  .
Free Spirit Spheres
You do n't have to build your own treehouse .
There are several companies who will do it for you .
Free Spirit Spheres will deliver a ready - made pod to your forest and install it safely .
For Kids
Kevin McKinney built a treehouse for his two daughters on top of an 8 foot wide Giant Redwood stump .
The house has a cantilevered porch , observation deck , sink , closet , and interior stalactites !
Ground Level Tree Bar
A Baobab tree in Limpopo , South Africa is so big that it 's been made into a bar !
The tree has a 155 - foot circumference and is hollow .
The bar can seat 15 people comfortably , and once held 54 people ( although not comfortably ) .
Baobabs begin to hollow out at about a thousand years of age ; this tree is estimated to be 6,000 years old .
When owners Doug and Heather van Heerden set up the pub in the late eighties , they found artifacts indicating that Bushmen and Dutch pioneers had been inside , and had possibly lived in the tree .
Tree Tent
The Treepee is a tent that hangs from a tree !
You can use it as a trampoline that you can't fall out of ( unless you leave the door open ) , or a swing .
Tether the corners to the ground for more stability .
If you hang it high , use the pulley that comes with it to haul up provisions .
The floor is much softer than the ground , for either sleeping or sitting .
This is just an overview of different kinds of treehouses .
You can see quite a few more in the articles Incredible Treehouses and Universally Accessible Treehouses .

June 23 , 2008 --
After the publication of the original article ( see below ) , Movement for Democratic Change presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai held a press conference at which he issued a statement to the effect that the MDC is pulling out of the presidential run-off election because conditions for a free and fair election do not exist , [ due to the ] the massive violence against his party and civic society .
The press conference followed the disruption of his final rally in Harare by ZANU - PF vigilantes on June 22 .
Tsvangirai stated that the MDC was to carry out further consultations and would announce the details of the way forward .
We welcome the position taken by the MDC , and initial reports indicate that this position has been accepted by MDC and civic society activists and supporters .
However , this decision needs to be followed by quick and concrete steps on the way forward , based on a united - front and mass - action strategy , as indicated [ in the earlier article below ] .
We are [ aware ] that sections of the bourgeoisie , the Rhodesian right wing and the imperialist West will not be happy with this decision , seeing it as a premature surrender and may even put pressure on the MDC to rescind the decision .
Taking advantage of the USA ’s presidency of the UN Security Council this month , they might want to see a few more bodies in the streets ahead of the election to justify their likely escalation of siege of the Mugabe regime .
But the MDC must resist this .
Its activists and supporters , as well as those in civic society , desperately need breathing space to retreat in order , reorganise and begin the fightback .
To wait for a sure defeat come June 27 will make it that much more difficult to mobilise the necessary program of civil disobedience , mass action and delegitimisation of the regime .
Indeed , the economic situation in the coming few weeks is going to see us descend to the parameters of hell as the West and big business escalate pressure on the regime , economically and politically , to force it into a neoliberal power - sharing government of national unity ( GNU ) deal with the opposition .
This has put the regime in a quagmire but it is likely to continue with its sham election to gain legitimacy .
Legally , it may invoke provisions of the electoral laws which stipulate that withdrawal can be no later than 21 days before the election and that in any case standing in the run - off is by law for the top two contesting candidates .
The key therefore is to launch an immediate political program of delegitimisation of the run-off election , locally , regionally and internationally .
Regroupment of civic groups and the establishment of the united front of resistance of the opposition and civic society has therefore now assumed paramount importance .
This is more so because of the massive likely pressure on the MDC to now enter negotiations for a government of national unity from South African president Thabo Mbeki , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the UN and the capitalist and imperialist forces .
This is no solution for working people and must be resolutely rejected .
But given the MDC ’s history of prevarication and the strong influence of capitalist elites within its leadership , it may not surprise if it ends up capitulating again .
The lessons from Kenya are that united , resolute and autonomous activities and mobilisation by a united front of civic society can stop this and embolden the more radical sections of the opposition to fight rather than capitulate to the regime .

Precarious security situation – reign of terror
June 20 , 2008 --
As the nation gears up for the presidential run-off election on June 27 , the regime of Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe has unleashed a reign of terror across the country .
The level of violence and political intimidation now far exceeds that of before the 2000 elections .
The economic collapse is severe and unprecedented .
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono ’s floating of the Zimbabwe dollar has led to its collapse to ZW $ 6 billion to US$ 1 , and inflation now at more that 2 million per cent , with prices going up twice a week .
The Zimbabwe people are truly suffering .
Since May 1 there have been arbitrary arrests of civic leaders , starting with the two - week detention of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union ’s president and secretary general .
Fourteen WOZA [ Women of Zimbabwe Arise ] leaders were detained for nearly a month for protesting the delay in releasing the election results .
Two of their leaders , Jenni Williams and Magodonga Mahlangu , remain detained in Chikurubi Prison .
Also arrested and harassed are church , student and NGO leaders and teachers .
NGOs and social movements have effectively been closed down by the regime , despite assertions to the contrary .
Over the past week , state agents have moved door to door at NGO offices , forcing them to close or confiscating computers and files .
[ There have been raids ] on the offices of ZimRights , the National Constitutional Assembly ( NCA ) , Zimbabwe national Students ’ Union ( ZINASU ) , Padare / Enkundleni / Men ’s Forum on Gender ( Padare ) , Bulawayo Agenda , the Crisis Coalition , the Combined Harare Residents ’ Association ( CHRA ) and the International Socialist Organisation ( ISO ) .
Humanitarian NGOs providing food relief , medicines and support to HIV - AIDS patients have been particularly hit .
ZANU - PF bases have been set up in townships where MDC and civic groups activists are being forced to attend night vigils and / or assaulted .
Several of our ISO members from Mbare , Sunningdale , Epworth and Chitungwiza have had their houses raided , forcing them to flee while others have been brutally assaulted .
Tec Bara , the ISO Harare gender coordinator and Zimbabwe Social Forum national deputy convenor for gender , is currently hospitalised after being brutally assaulted at her home .
Three of our Mutare comrades were also assaulted and brutalised .
A Women Coalition ’s hostel in Kambuzuma housing fleeing women and their children was raided and people forced to flee .
In Budiriro , the national deputy leader of the ``war veterans ’’ , Joseph Chinotimba has turned an HIV - AIDS clinic into a war chamber .
The MDC is receiving the brunt of the attacks .
Tsvangirai has been repeatedly arrested , his rallies banned and campaign buses and vehicles impounded .
The MDC is totally blacked - out from the state - controlled daily newspapers , radio stations and TV , while under Operation Dzikisai Madhishi , people are being forced to remove satellite dishes from their homes .
Detained MDC secretary general Tendai Biti faces treason charges , carrying the death penalty .
This past week in Harare , the wife of the MDC mayor - elect of Harare was abducted and killed , houses in townships fire - bombed with four people killed , and 20 houses in the Chipinge rural village of NCA chairperson Lovemore Madhuku were torched .
The attorney general has said no bail will be granted to those facing ``political violence ’’ charges ( virtually all from the opposition ) , while Patrick Chinamasa , the minister of legal and parliamentary affairs , said he will be declaring a general amnesty for all petty criminals to create room for political prisoners .
Operation MakaVhoterapi
ZANU -PF has virtually closed off the rural areas from the opposition under Operation MakaVhoterapi ( `Operation Where Did You Vote ’ ) .
As presidential spokesperson , G. Charamba put it :
`` Fundamentally , MDC cannot win the runoff ; will not win it …
Unlike in March , rural Zimbabwe is now another country for MDC … and Tsvangirai will be lucky to find even election agents .
In towns , yes , but nowhere else .
From end of 1976 , l saw war and the making of structures that nourish it .
There are many in Tsvangirai ’s camp old enough to interpret the times for him .
I am sure they have seen what is happening in the country side , watched and correctly read the furrowed foreheads of those who will take the necessary decisions should and when that becomes necessary .
Enough hints have been dropped regarding what will wash and will not wash come the morning after June 27 .
A mere twiddle by a blunt pen cannot return this country to bondage ”
There are three basic objectives behind the regime ’s crackdown .
First , so ZANU - PF can win the crucial presidential elections by any means necessary .
As we previously argued in September 2007 : ``the chances of an opposition victory are slim … as in 2002 and 2005 , the opposition is deluding itself .
The playing field is so stacked against them and they have very little counter measures to these , as ZANU - PF itself for instance had in 1980 .
The entire state machinery , including the media , is being mobilised to ensure a ZANU - PF victory by hook or crook … war veterans and chiefs are being mobilised to make the rural areas a no - go area for the opposition . ’’
Will ZANU - PF ’s strategy work ?
Increasingly , over the last few weeks , an election that MDC was clearly poised to win has turned and a Mugabe ``victory ’’ is now the most likely result as the MDC structures are decimated and the rural population bludgeoned and starved into submission .
Peasants are correctly aware that the ward - based system of voting will make it easy for ZANU - PF to identify villages that vote against them and exert revenge .
Various reports indicate the game plan .
Known MDC activists will be forced to plead illiteracy and be accompanied by senior ZANU - PF village leaders , who will ``assist ’’ them in voting .
The day after elections , all villagers [ will be ] ordered to assemble near counting stations and await results so that it can be confirmed that they have truly repented .
This is exactly what Charamba means , when he says the structures of war have now been resuscitated in the countryside .
The crackdown is also designed to neutralise any potential centres of resistance to a Mugabe ``victory ’’ , which this time will be quickly announced .
The MDC and civic society are paying a heavy price for failing to heed warnings not to take the election route as their principal strategy for achieving change rather than a central strategy of mass action centred around a fighting united front of the opposition , civic society and the labour movement demanding a new democratic constitution before any elections .
The ZAPU [ Zimbabwe African People ’s Union ] was only able to withstand Gukurahundi because of structures rooted in a committed core of cadres and not protest voters .
[ Mugabe launched a brutal war of terror on the Ndebele people , who were assumed to be ZAPU supporters and therefore dissidents .
In what became known as Gukurahundi , between 1983 and 1985 , up to 20,000 people died in the Matabeleland and Midlands regions . ] .
At best , elections should only have been used as a secondary tactic to mobilise people for the central strategy of mass action .
Capitalist elites who have used their money to commodify our struggles and worm their way into leadership positions in the opposition and civic society stopped this and built false illusions around the elections and marginalised the activists who built the party and are today sorely needed .
Even if ZANU - PF loses , Mugabe has declared that he will not hand over power to the MDC but rather go to war -- Hatingaregi nyika yakauya neropa ichitorwa ne penzura , tinoda kuona kuti chakasimba chii gidi kana penzura ( `` We can not let go a country that we won through the barrel of a gun by a simple vote – we will see which is stronger – the gun or a pencil . ’’)
A radio report on Power FM quoted Mugabe declaring at a rally -- `` If you thought Hitler is gone , then you are mistaken , because Hitler is not only back but back here in Zimbabwe . ’’
The second objective is to recapture the parliamentary majority for ZANU - PF by convicting MDC - elect MPs or forcing them to flee .
As Charamba says : `` They are on the run , but will not run much longer .
That may mean several by - elections which ( Tsvangirai ) knows he will not win . ’’
Indeed it is likely that by the time parliament convenes , enough opposition MPs will either be in detention or have fled to give ZANU - PF the majority to elect both the speaker of the House of Assembly and president of Senate despite being the minority party .
The third objective is preparation for a ZANU - PF - dominated but neoliberal and pro-business government of national unity with the MDC after the elections .
In our September 2007 perspective we stated that because of the imploding economic crisis and ``despite his rhetoric , Mugabe is now ready to capitulate and enter into an elitist compromise deal with the MDC , the West and business .
But only after the 2008 elections , which he hopes to use to legitimise his party ’s claim to being the senior player in such alliance , deal with his party ’s succession problem as well as protect his legacy , person and family besides his little burial plot at Heroes Acre . ’’
Many of his top officials have indeed been quoted suggesting the GNU is an indispensable option to deal with the Zimbabwean crisis .
The crackdown is designed to force the MDC into such a GNU and preempt any potential resistance from its radicals or civic society .
This is worsened by power struggles in the opposition ahead of its congress next year .
Today many of the cowardly elites who have wormed their way to the top in the opposition will , as we have been warning for over two years , gladly accept the GNU , with the support of business , Mbeki , SADC and most of the West , fearful of the further radicalisation of the Zimbabwean crisis .
ZANU - PF tactics are thus working .
Already the MDC is now totally silent , even in its urban township strongholds , as ZANU - PF holds sway .
As one comrade said , “ ve MDC tapeta miswe ” ( the MDC has put its tail behind its legs ) .
Even civic groups that have not been raided are now stampeding to close down their offices .
Fear stalks the nation one week before the election .
Way forward : Mobilise for united front for democracy and mass action
The first and most important thing is to confront the veil of fear that threatens to suffocate us .
The defiance of the closure of offices by several NGOs is correct .
Even if the regime closes our offices , we must not allow it to close down our movements -- underground alternatives must be urgently built .
But no one group can withstand this pressure alone .
We need a united collective response .
This is why for the last three years and at the People ’s Convention we were calling for the need to build a radical united front of civic groups , the labour movement and the anti-capitalist movement , autonomous of the MDC , even if working with it .
One capable of initiating united front - based mass actions without necessarily being subordinated to the MDC .
And one based on a pro-working people and anti-neoliberal / capitalist ideology .
At the Convention we unfortunately allowed our tactical differences on whether to support or boycott the March elections to divide us and stop us from the bigger project of building such united front .
Today we all pay a heavy price .
But it is not too late to regroup , reorganise and offer leadership in action along with the MDC .
Even under this crackdown we can regroup , initially on a defensive program of solidarity for those under attack and in self - defence and counter - attacks where necessary .
Most urgently we call for a summit of leaders of the opposition and civic society to set up a united front of resistance .
We believe that such united front must be totally rooted in and organise around the bread and butter concerns of working people , including peasants and the unemployed , as opposed to the wealthy capitalist elites in business , locally and internationally .
Indeed the very origins of the MDC ( and similar movements in the global South ) lie in the massive protests of the late 1990s against poverty induced by the Mugabe regime ’s neoliberal capitalist program of ESAP ( structural adjustment ) .
A new and powerful aspect of the MDC ’s campaign in the March elections was an emphasis on such bread and butter issues of the ordinary people .
Any struggle against the regime that fails to do this will be outflanked on its left by this crafty regime , which has shown , most powerfully around the land question , a strong capacity to cynically manipulate the poor ’s concerns to remain in power and demonise the opposition as a stooge of the West and the business class .
Without such a united front and a pro-poor , pro-working people and anti-capitalist ideology we shall not prevail against this regime .
The Peoples Charter of the People ’s Convention offers a powerful starting point .
One of the first things to do is to convene a massive united front rally for democracy in the centre of Harare a few days before the election or the week after , to be convened by the opposition - led by the MDC , civic groups , trade unions and the churches .
If possible the unions must call for all workers in Harare not to go to work but to attend the rally .
The purpose of the rally is first to fight the veil of fear and rebuild confidence in our movements .
Second to send a message to the dictatorship that we will not be cowered ; that we demand an immediate cessation of the reign of terror , compensation of all victims , immediate release of all political prisoners .
It would send a warning to the regime that the people will not accept its June 27 circus and that the struggle will only accelerate after June 27 to include general strikes , stayaways , class boycotts and civil disobedience .
On the election , our preferred position as the ISO has been to boycott any fake elections without a new constitution and deny the regime ’s elections any legitimacy .
The alternative is for a regrouped united front of civic society and the opposition to launch a serious and determined program of civil disobedience and mass action , supported by regional and international solidarity from working peoples and progressive movements .
Indeed over the next week the MDC leadership has a huge decision to make about whether to continue participating in a sham election designed to clothe a dictatorship in legitimacy , or withdraw , regroup and lead a fightback of mass action and civil disobedience .
However , if the MDC still decides to continue running .
The ISO , in view of MDC ’s massive performance in the March parliamentary and presidential elections and the desire of many Zimbabweans to vote , has now modified its position to call for unconditional but fraternally critical support to Tsvangirai .
Our criticism is what we perceive as the increasing domination of the party leadership by capitalist and Western elites and the marginalisation of workers and radicals .
This will lead to its likely pursing a neoliberal capitalist agenda if it assumes power , to the detriment of working people .
And secondly its disastrous strategy of relying on the electoral route rather than mass action .
But the Mugabe regime is driving us into hell and the people need some breathing space in order to reorganise and resume our battle for real democracy and against the capitalist and imperialist bloodsuckers .
We therefore urge all our members , supporters , allies and working people in general to defy the regime ’ intimidation and go out and vote in the election for Tsvangirai .
However voting must only be seen as a tactic to keep the flames of the movement alive and to use the space to organise and mobilise for all out people ’s mass action before and after June 27 , and not as the central strategy for change .
The defeat of ZANU - PF in March shows how much the masses now want change .
Even today in the midst of the onslaught , opposition activists at the local level have organised themselves and are fighting back in places like Epworth , Bikita , Zaka and Chimanimani .
But these are isolated actions , easily crushed unless more central leadership is offered .
The spirit to fight in civic society is still there .
Indeed , when an ISO delegation visited the imprisoned WOZA leaders this week , we were impressed by their high spirits despite the very harsh conditions , including being denied jerseys [ jumpers ] in this biting winter .
Or the many maimed and displaced MDC activists who are vowing that despite all they are still going to vote against the regime come June 27 .
At the same time under no circumstances must we agree to the GNU sell - out idea .
There can be no marriage with such a murderous regime -- we must consign it to its true destiny -- the dustbin of history .
The GNU is a project for the dictatorship to perpetuate itself and for the capitalist and the imperialist elites to ensure that the poverty that the capitalist ZANU - PF government started with its ESAP is perpetuated forever , but now buttressed by a working - people supported MDC .
It ’s time we allow the ordinary people to take charge of the struggle that is rightfully theirs and ensure an outcome that achieves real democracy , economically and politically , for the majority and not just the political and capitalist elites as we have seen so many times in recent history in the region and internationally -- in Zambia , Malawi , Kenya , Nigeria , South Africa and Eastern Europe .
As our brothers and sisters in Latin America are pushing ahead we say no to capitalism and yes to international socialism as the way forward for humanity .
Finally , ISO wishes to express our utmost gratitude to all those who have sent solidarity messages and donations to us and other organisations and still make a further urgent appeal for assistance .

It ’s been five years since residents of the poor community of Phiri ( Soweto ) were first confronted with the practical consequences of the City of Johannesburg ’s corporatisation and commodification ( read : privatisation ) of water delivery .
That was when Phiri was chosen as the first community in the Johannesburg Metro to ``benefit '' from the implementation of its Operation Gcin’amanzi .
What subsequently happened has now been well documented many times over : the surreptitious and forcible installation of pre-paid water meters under the pretext of fixing ageing infrastructure ; the victimisation and cutting - off of supply to those who refused ; and , sustained resistance pitting community residents – organised through the Anti-Privatisation Forum ( APF ) and the newly formed Coalition Against Water Privatisation ( CAWP ) -- against an ``unholy alliance '' of Johannesburg Water , the City of Johannesburg , state prosecutors , the South African Police Services and private security firms .
Given such an overwhelmingly uneven contest of power / resources , the resistance forces were never going to halt Operation Gcin’amanzi ( the first of its kind in post - apartheid South Africa ) in its tracks and gain an outright victory in their struggle for accessible / sufficient free water and human dignity .
Those on the left who at the time ( and have since ) argued for continuous physical resistance were and are not the ones on the receiving end of what was arguably the most sustained , sophisticated , resourced and vicious attack by combined state - corporate forces on one poor community in South Africa since 1994 .
Many Phiri residents paid an enormous personal price for physically resisting and standing up for their rights and dignity .
Besides helping to re-invigorate the tactic of re-appropriation of a public resource turned into a privatised commodity ( through destroying and / or by - passing pre-paid water meters ) , the battle of Phiri marked another new watershed in post - 1994 water struggles .
It served to not only further focus South African and international ( critical ) attention on the practical character and consequence of the African National Congress ( ANC ) government ’s neoliberal ( water ) policy onslaught , but also opened the door to testing the stated water service delivery commitments of relevant state policies / legislation and South Africa ’s constitution .
For left / anti-capitalist activists , it is never an easy thing to adopt tactics that do not appear to fit into pre-configured , historically located understandings and approaches to such struggle ( although it deserves mention that this does not , historically , apply in equal measure to those whom such activists claim to represent / struggle with ) .
And so , it was in 2005 - 2006 , with a great deal of trepidation and initial half - heartedness , that the APF and CAWP ( with the assistance first of the Freedom of Expression Institute and subsequently the Centre for Applied Legal Studies ) entered into the institutional - legal terrain of class struggle , assisting five representative Phiri residents to prepare and file a case in the Johannesburg High Court challenging the legality and constitutionality of Operation Gcin’amanzi ’s limitation of the free - basic supply of water and the installation of pre-paid water meters .
The case was seen as a tactic , part of a larger , long - term strategy seeking to use all means available to ensure that water itself is seen and treated as a public resource , that water service providers remain publicly owned , managed and run and that water service delivery provides adequate , accessible and quality water to all through an in - built redistributive framework .
An excerpt from the founding affidavit of one of the applicants , Lindiwe Mazibuko , reveals the dire material and human situation that is the lot of so many Phiri residents and which is also representative of millions of other poor households across the country :
“ Of the 20 people who are part of our household , one is a pensioner , 3 are small babies and six go to school .
I suffer from arthritis and high blood pressure .
My mother suffers from diabetes , high blood pressure and has a history of cardiac arrest .
My sister … suffers from a stroke .
She moved in with us with her four children for us to take care of them .
My mother is retired and receives a pension grant of R820 per month .
The rest of us are unemployed . ”
Other applicants tell the story of what it has meant to live without adequate and accessible amounts of the most basic of all needs in life - water – simply because they are poor .
Jennifer Makoatsane describes the burden of washing nappies for her new - born baby , of trying to clean her father 's gangrenous foot and of running out of water during the funeral for her father .
Sophia Malekutu reveals the immense technical difficulties she has had with the pre-paid water meter , paying various monies to get it fixed without receiving water .
And , Vusimuzi Paki relates the tragic experience of how , when a backyard shack on his property burnt down , he was unable to put out the fire because the water ran out ( from the pre-paid meter ) .
As a result , two young children – two - year old Katleho Tamane and nine - year old Dimpho Tamane – burnt to death inside the shack .
Such have been the ``benefits '' of Operation Gcin’amanzi and its cynical propaganda of ‘ water conservation ’ for the benefit of ``the people ' ' .
The case was filed in July 2006 and eventually heard – over three days – before Johannesburg High Court Judge M.P. Tsoka , in early December 2007 .
Over four months later , on 30th April 2008 , in a historic and ground - breaking judgement , Judge Tsoka declared that the City of Johannesburg ’s forcible installation of prepaid water meters in Phiri is both unlawful and unconstitutional .
The judge ordered that the limitation of free basic water to the present 6 kilolitres per household per month , be set aside and that the City of Johannesburg and Johannesburg Water must supply Phiri residents with 50 litres per person per day .
Furthermore , the court declared that the choice given to residents of either a prepaid meter or a standpipe for water provision in Phiri is also unlawful and directed the city to provide residents of Phiri the option of an ordinary credit metered water supply .
The City of Johannesburg was also ordered to bear all the legal costs of the applicants since 2006 .
The judgement ranks as one of post - apartheid South Africa ’s most important legal victories for poor communities and all those who have been struggling against unilateral and profit - driven neoliberal basic service policies .
As CALS stated soon after the judgement , this is the first time , “ in which the constitutional right to water has explicitly been raised ” .
Judge Tsoka however , went beyond the legal points , recognising the racial , class , administrative and gender - based discrimination underlying the City of Johannesburg ’s water policy .
The judge explicitly rejected the arguments for restricting the water usage of poor communities : “… to expect the applicants to restrict their water usage , to compromise their health , by limiting the number of toilet flushes in order to save water is to deny them the rights to health and to lead a dignified lifestyle . ”
The judge labelled the so - called ``consultation '' with the Phiri community as , “ more of a publicity stunt than consultation ” and criticised the city ’s “ big brother approach ” .
The greatest credit for this extraordinary legal victory must go to the residents of Phiri that resisted the installation of the pre-paid meters , and to all the other residents of poor communities , both in Johannesburg and across the country , who have been fighting for accessible , affordable and sufficient water provision / delivery .
While the judgement has already been appealed by the respondents , and will most probably go all the way to the Constitutional Court , this does not detract from the political and social significance of this victory .
It is a case which does not only have applicability to South Africa but which , by its very character , enjoins the attention and direct interest of billions of poor people around the world who are suffering under neo-liberally inspired water policies , alongside the governments that are implementing such policies and their corporate allies who seek to turn water into nothing less than another profit - making stock market option .
The CAWP and its allies are confident that the High Court judgement will be upheld and that water provision will now no longer be delivered in a discriminatory , patronising and inhumane manner .
While legal avenues of redress are inherently slow and the ‘ justice system ’ rarely provides any meaningful justice to the poor , it is important to make use of the legal space to expand , advance ( and even further clarify ) the base struggles on the ground .
In the meantime , the struggle against all forms of water privatisation continues .
Numerous mass actions ( pickets , marches , door - to - door campaigns etc. ) have been undertaken over the last year by various community structures allied to the APF and CAWP .
In Kliptown , the struggle against the continuation of the bucket system , suspect water quality ( attributable to a death by cholera just last week ) and lack of infrastructural development has intensified .
In the informal shack settlement of Boiketlong ( in the Vaal ) the community has been on the offensive against an almost complete lack of water and sanitation infrastructure , a struggle that is slowly but surely forcing the municipality to concretely respond .
In nearby Sebokeng ( Zone 20 ) , residents have begun to mobilise the community and make their demands heard , despite heavy police repression which has already resulted in the death of a community activist last seen in the company of the police .
And earlier this year , action by residents of the Kwa - Masiza Hostel , under the banner of CAWP , who had been without water since 2001 , succeeded in forcing the water service provider – Metsi A Lekoa – to restore water supplies to the hostel .
Outside of Gauteng , the CAWP and APF remain actively involved in organising , mobilising and assisting communities in both water and other basic service struggles in Rammolutsi ( Northern Free State ) , Khutsong ( North West ) and in and around Queenstown ( Eastern Cape ) .
Besides South Africa - specific work and activism , the CAWP has also been central in the formation and ongoing work of the newly formed African Water Network and its activists have participated in numerous regional and international social fora and meetings with allied movements and progressive NGOs .
The collective impact of various forms of water privatisation on the majority of South Africans continues to wreak havoc and misery .
Occasional cholera outbreaks / deaths persist , inadequate hygiene and ‘ self - serve ’ sanitation systems lead to continuous exposure ( especially for children ) to various preventable diseases and uncontrolled effluent discharges and scarcity of water for food production intensifies environmental pollution and degradation .
The human dignity of entire communities continues to be ripped apart , as the right to adequate , accessible free water is sacrificed at the altar of commodified privilege and profit .
Yet despite this , the struggles against water privatisation have already achieved advances for the poor and have begun to place increasing socio-political - legal pressure on government .
Crucially , these struggles continue to plant the seeds of an alternative , seeds that can be found in the organised ability of poor communities to both politically and physically undermine privatised delivery at the point of ‘ consumption ’ .
Not only is this an act of self - empowerment at the most basic level of reproductive life , but provides the foundation upon which the majority of South Africans can pursue the demands for policy and structural changes in the ownership , management and distribution of water and other basic services essential to life .

Mozilla has announced that June 17 is the official date of the much - anticipated Firefox 3 release .
Developers and open source software enthusiasts are planning parties all over the world to celebrate the occasion .
I 'll be covering the release from Mozilla headquarters in Mountain View at the official Camp Firefox event .
Mozilla is encouraging users to participate , too , by helping the Firefox team set the record for the most software downloaded in 24 hours .
The total number of unique downloads that take place on release day will be submitted for potential inclusion in the Guinness World Records .
Over a million users have already signed up to pledge their support .
Many readers have asked about the status of Firefox 3 add - on compatibility and some have indicated that they wo n't be ready to upgrade until their favorite add - ons are supported .
Mozilla Product Manager Alex Polvi has written a brief overview that explains the current status of the most popular add - ons .
Some of my favorites , like Greasemonkey , Firebug , and Stylish are now all compatible with Firefox 3 .
Unfortunately , Google Browser Sync is being discontinued and will no longer be supported .
Google recommends that users adopt Mozilla Weave or Foxmarks .
Mozilla 's add - on team has been hard at work getting a new version of the add - on web site ready in time for the release .
The new site includes a theme browser that displays thumbnails and a new advanced search system , as well as numerous improvements for developers .
Planning is already in progress for Firefox 3.1 , which is codenamed Shiretoko .
Although still in the early stages of planning , the schedule indicates that alpha releases could be available as early as July .
Prominent user interface features planned for the 3.1 release include tab previews and tag auto - completion .
Developers also plan to add several new features to Firefox 's Gecko rendering engine such as the HTML 5 video element and CSS text shadows .
We have closely followed Firefox 3 development since the earliest prereleases in 2006 .
Our extensive testing has revealed that Firefox 3 delivers significant improvements to resource efficiency and ease of use in addition to countless feature enhancements .
For more details , check out our coverage of the prereleases : ( a1 a5 a6 a 7 a 8 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 rc1 ) .
IN WONKISH circles , energy efficiency used to be known as “ the fifth fuel ” : it can help to satisfy growing demand for energy just as surely as coal , gas , oil or uranium can .
But in these environmentally conscious times it has been climbing the rankings .
Whereas the burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases , which contribute to global warming , and nuclear plants generate life - threatening waste , the only by - product of energy efficiency is wealth , in the form of lower fuel bills and less spending on power stations , pipelines and so forth .
No wonder that wonks now tend to prefer “ negawatts ” to megawatts as the best method of slaking the world 's growing thirst for energy .
Almost all blueprints for tackling global warming assume that energy efficiency will have a huge role to play .
Nicholas Stern devoted a whole chapter to it in the report he wrote on climate change for the British government .
In the greenest of futures mapped out by the International Energy Agency , a think - tank financed by rich countries , greater efficiency accounts for two - thirds of emissions averted .
The McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) , the research arm of the consultancy , thinks that energy efficiency could get the world halfway towards the goal , espoused by many scientists , of keeping the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere below 550 parts per million .
MGI is particularly enthusiastic because it believes that unlike most other schemes to reduce emissions , a global energy - efficiency drive would be profitable .
The measures it has in mind , all of which rely on existing technology , would earn an average return of 17 % and a minimum of 10 % .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of scientists advising the United Nations on global warming , makes a similar point .
It believes that profitable energy - efficiency investments would allow Pakistan to cut its emissions by almost a third , Greece by a quarter and Britain by more than a fifth .
In other words , big investments in energy efficiency would more than pay for themselves , and fairly fast .
Although a lot of money would have to be spent — $ 170 billion a year until 2020 — by MGI 's reckoning that is only 1.6 % of today 's global annual investment in fixed capital .
Moreover , with ample profits to be made , financing should be easy to attract .
Yet if there are so many lucrative opportunities to improve efficiency , why are investors not already taking advantage of them ?
To a degree , they are : in America , for example , “ energy intensity ” — the amount of energy required to generate each dollar of output — is falling by about 2 % a year ( see chart 1 ) .
This is only partly because America 's factories , houses , cars and appliances are becoming more efficient : it is also because energy - guzzling factories have moved to cheaper spots such as China .
But globally , too , energy intensity is falling by around 1½ % a year .
That decline is not predestined .
Before the first oil shock , in 1973 , America 's energy intensity was falling by only 0.4 % a year .
At that languid pace , America would now be spending 12 % of GDP on energy instead of 7 % , according to Art Rosenfeld , an efficiency pioneer and a member of the California Energy Commission , which sets efficiency standards and other energy policies for the state .
Simply by buying more efficient fridges over the years , he reckons , Americans have come to save more than 200 terawatt - hours ( TWh ) annually , or roughly 80 power plants ' worth .
But as McKinsey points out , there are still hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of unfulfilled but potentially profitable opportunities in energy efficiency available to households and companies .
What is holding investors back ?
One answer is price .
In the eyes of many consumers , electricity and fuel are often too cheap to be worth saving , especially in countries where their prices are subsidised .
Industrialists in Russia are profligate with natural gas , because it sells there at a quarter of the international price .
Drivers in Qatar have little incentive to scrimp on petrol when they pay barely a dollar a gallon for it .
By and large , energy intensity is , not surprisingly , lower in countries where electricity prices are higher .
It is no coincidence that Denmark has both high power prices and an energy - efficient economy .
Among American states , for every cent per kilowatt - hour by which prices exceed the national average , energy consumption drops by about 7 % of the average .
George David , the boss of United Technologies , a conglomerate that makes air - conditioners , lifts and aircraft engines , among other items , argues that higher fuel and power prices are the only motor needed to drive energy efficiency .
But there are still plenty of profitable investment opportunities in energy efficiency , even in the places with the most expensive power .
David Goldstein , author of a recent book on energy efficiency , points out that until recently businesses in New York lit their premises more brightly than did those in Seattle , despite New York 's much higher power prices .
And Hawaii , the American state with the dearest power , is not the most efficient ( although the one with the cheapest , Kentucky , does come bottom of the efficiency table ) .
The problem , analysts explain , is a series of distortions and market failures that discourage investment in efficiency .
Often , consumers are poorly informed about the savings on offer .
Even when they can do the sums , the transaction costs are high : it is a time - consuming chore for someone to identify the best energy - saving equipment , buy it and get it installed .
It does not help that the potential savings , although huge when added up across the world , usually amount to only a small share of the budgets of individual firms and households .
Despite recent price increases , spending on energy still accounts for a smaller share of the global economy than it did a few decades ago .
For all these reasons , homeowners , as Lord Stern pointed out in his climate - change report , tend to demand exorbitant rates of return on investments in energy efficiency — of around 30 % .
They generally want new boilers or extra insulation to pay for themselves within two or three years , says Mark Hopkins , of the United Nations Foundation , an NGO .
Businesses are not quite so demanding , he says , but they still tend to put greater emphasis on increasing revenues than on cutting costs .
Similar stories crop up in the markets for new homes and offices , appliances and vehicles .
Builders are not the ones who end up paying the utility bills , so have little reason to add to the construction costs — and hence the price of a home or office — by incorporating energy - saving features .
The makers of appliances and cars also know that not all consumers and drivers will think as carefully about running costs as about the purchase price .
By the same token , landlords have scant incentive to invest in energy efficiency on their tenants ' behalf .
And power companies are usually keen to encourage their customers to consume as much power as possible .
Financing energy - efficiency investments can also be difficult .
In the developing world , capital can be scarce .
In rich countries , the savings from making individual homes more efficient are too small and the overheads involved too high to be of much interest to most banks .
The scent of savings
Despite these obstacles , as energy prices rise and more countries adopt limits on greenhouse - gas emissions , banks and consultancies are beginning to sniff an opportunity .
Firms that help businesses and families to trim their energy bills have become common enough to earn an acronym : ESCos , or energy - service companies .
Their industry group in America says business , which had been growing at 3 % a year in the early part of this decade , is now increasing by 22 % a year .
The total revenues of the 46 ESCos it surveyed were about $ 3.6 billion in 2006 , about three - quarters of which came from energy efficiency .
Typically , an ESCo designs a scheme to reduce a building 's energy bill , borrows money to pay for the kit it needs , and installs and maintains it over a fixed period .
Clients do not need to provide any cash up front : the ESCo's reward comes from retaining most of the savings — out of which it must repay the loan .
The revenues are steady and predictable enough to allow ESCos to unburden their balance sheets and lower their borrowing costs by securitising them .
Hannon Armstrong , one of the financial - service firms involved , says it has arranged more than $ 1.5 billion - worth of such securities .
The hitch is that 80 % of ESCos ' customers in America are from the various branches of the government , along with schools , hospitals and universities .
Small businesses and households would provide a much bigger market , but they tend to be less creditworthy and to move more often .
Moreover , the transaction costs tend to outweigh the savings .
Jeff Eckel , of Hannon Armstrong , believes it is possible to overcome these problems by aggregating many similar properties and by drawing up clever contracts .
The Clinton Climate Initiative , a charity set up by the former American president , is thinking along the same lines .
It has persuaded the local authorities in 40 big cities around the world to co-ordinate their investments in energy efficiency .
It then used the allure of such a big market to persuade the makers of energy - efficient goods , the ESCos that will install them and the banks that will finance them to reduce their margins .
The cities with which the charity has linked up include Chicago , London and New York .
Most governments , however , do not seem convinced that businessmen and do - gooders are capable of overcoming the impediments to energy efficiency on their own .
So they are intervening in markets .
The variety of methods they use hints at the difficulties .
The simplest tactic is to try to get the public to think .
Britain set up a body called the Energy Saving Trust in 1993 ; America has a similar outfit , called Energy Star .
Among other things , it helps consumers identify energy - efficient products and houses through a voluntary labelling scheme .
The European Union goes slightly further , with compulsory labelling of goods such as fridges , washing machines and dishwashers ; and Britons selling a home must now have its energy efficiency assessed .
But consumers often ignore such labels or at least do not give them as much weight as price , appearance or convenience .
So governments sometimes try to make efficient appliances more appealing through financial incentives .
America 's federal government , for example , offers a tax credit to makers of extremely efficient appliances — and several states give rebates , income - tax credits or sales - tax exemptions to anyone who buys them .
China has just said it will subsidise makers of compact fluorescent light - bulbs , which are four or five times more efficient than the cheaper incandescent sort .
Other governments blanch at bribing people to do something that is already in their interest .
Australia has proposed banning incandescent light - bulbs outright .
Many have adopted building codes and appliance standards that dictate minimum levels of efficiency .
Several tighten the standards regularly , to foster constant improvement .
Japan 's Top Runner scheme , for example , identifies the most efficient appliances on the market in different categories , and then requires all competing brands to improve on them within four to six years .
Those that fail face fines .
Businesses often complain that such tough measures impose undue costs , which they must then pass on to consumers as higher prices .
They also argue that their customers should be free to buy bigger or more powerful devices if they want , even if that makes them relatively inefficient .
Notably , America 's carmakers have used such arguments to resist increases in fuel - economy standards .
When Congress raised standards last year it tried to address these complaints by setting different targets for heavy and light vehicles .
Each firm 's target is an average across all the cars it sells , not a model - by - model limit , so there is still scope to make the odd guzzler .
Anyway , environmentalists dispute the notion that energy - efficiency standards drive up prices .
The average price of fridges in America has fallen by more than half since the 1970s , even as their efficiency has increased by three - quarters , according to Mr Goldstein .
Those gains have come in spite of steady increases in the size of the average unit ( see chart 2 ) .
Governments are also obliging utilities to get involved in the business of energy efficiency .
Some , including many American states , add an extra sum to electricity bills to finance investments in energy efficiency .
Others specify the amount of energy to be saved , rather than the amount to be spent .
France , for example , requires gas and electricity suppliers to invest enough over three years to reduce projected demand by 54TWh .
Britain and Italy have similar schemes , although the targets are expressed in tonnes of carbon and barrels of oil , respectively .
External auditors verify the savings , and the “ white certificates ” they issue when they have done so are tradable .
The intention is to keep the cost of the scheme low by allowing those that can achieve reductions most cheaply , including ESCos , to do so on behalf of less expert participants .
The idea is also spreading in America : Connecticut , Nevada and Pennsylvania have all adopted it .
A sparky divorce
But a white - certificate scheme would have to be very demanding to outweigh a utility 's incentive to sell more power .
So other American states have gone further , and attempted to “ decouple ” utilities ' profits from their sales .
Regulators forecast demand and allow utilities to charge a price that would recoup their costs and earn a fixed return on the basis of that forecast .
If demand turns out to be lower than expected , the regulator lets prices rise so that the utility can make the mandated profit ; if it is higher , the regulator cuts prices to return the excess to customers .
California , predictably , has gone further still .
It first decoupled sales and profits for gas in 1978 and for electricity in 1982 .
Last year , it adopted a scheme called “ decoupling plus ” , which aims to make investments in energy efficiency more profitable for utilities than new power stations would be .
Fees to finance energy - saving measures are added to each bill , and utilities spend the money in pursuit of targets set by the regulator , the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) .
The commission then calculates the savings from these investments , compared with the cost of new power plants .
If a utility achieves between 85 % and 100 % of the target , it is allowed to keep 9 % of these savings .
If it exceeds the regulator 's target , it gets 12 % , more than it would earn from building new infrastructure .
Between 65 % and 85 % it does not earn any return at all , and below 65 % it pays a fine for every kilowatt - hour by which it has fallen short .
This complicated system is designed to make sure utilities spend more on energy efficiency , but do not waste billpayers ' money on investments of dubious merit .
California 's private utilities now spend about a $ 1 billion every year on energy efficiency .
In July the CPUC will announce their energy - savings targets as far as 2020 .
The state , says Dian Grueneich , one of the commissioners , hopes to meet half of all projected demand growth through increased energy efficiency .
Less dainty governments just oblige the most energy - hungry firms to cut back .
The 13,000 factories in Japan with the highest energy use are required to improve their efficiency by 1 % a year .
Those that fail to do so are fined .
China 's central government has followed suit , setting energy - efficiency targets for the country 's 1,000 biggest firms .
That step , in turn , has spawned similar initiatives in the provinces .
Overall , the Chinese government hopes that energy intensity will be 20 % lower in 2010 than it was in 2006 .
However , no matter what methods governments adopt to encourage energy efficiency , the results may not be as impressive as they imagine .
The culprit is something called the “ rebound effect ” .
Falling demand for electricity or fuel brought on by an efficiency drive should lead to lower prices .
But cheaper energy , in turn , is likely to prompt greater consumption , undermining at least some of the original benefits .
What is more , consumers with lower electricity or fuel bills often put the money they have saved to some other use , such as going on holiday or buying an appliance , which is likely to involve the consumption of fuel and power .
Economists disagree about the size of the rebound effect , which is hard to measure .
The British government commissioned two studies of the effect , from two different universities .
The first found that it cancelled out roughly 26 % of the gains from energy - efficiency schemes ; the other put the figure at 37 % .
Either way , negawatts are worth pursuing .
But they are unlikely to satisfy the world 's thirst for energy to the extent their advocates assume .
How Good Are Experienced Presidents ?
Suppose you had to choose between two Presidential candidates , one of whom had spent 20 years in Congress plus had considerable other relevant experience and the other of whom had about half a dozen years in the Illinois state legislature and 2 years in Congress .
Which one do you think would make a better President ?
If you chose # 1 , congratulations , you picked James Buchanan over Abraham Lincoln .
Your pick disagrees with that of most historians , who see Lincoln as the greatest President ever and Buchanan as the second worst ever , better only than Warren " Teapot Dome " Harding .
Both served in what was probably the most difficult period in American history , where slavery and secession tore the nation asunder .
Before becoming President , Buchanan had served 6 years in the Pennsylvania state legislature , 10 years in the U.S. House of Representatives , 4 years as ambassador to Russia , 10 years in the Senate , 4 years as Secretary of State , and 4 years as Ambassador to England .
Talk about experience , Buchanan did just about everything except serve on the Supreme Court , a job he was offered by President Polk and refused .
Yet by any measure , he was n't up to the job as President .
In contrast , Abraham Lincoln served 8 years in the Illinois legislature and one term in the U.S. House ( 1847-1849 ) , a decade before becoming President .
The rest of the time he was a lawyer in private practice , a bit thin one might say .
Of course , these are only two data points .
What about all the other Presidents ?
Were n't the experienced ones the better Presidents ?
Fortunately , there have been a number of surveys of presidential greatness , some by professional historians and some by the general public .
Many of these are given in the Wikipedia page on Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents .
The amount of experience each President had before taking office is well known since the lives of all Presidents have been extremely well documented .
Thus the basic data -- years of experience and ranking -- are available making a statistical analysis of experience vs. greatness possible .
David A. Levine of New York has collected the data from Wikipedia and done some analysis of it .
Let 's start with a table of the Presidents listed in order of their consensus rank in the 12 surveys given in the above Wikipedia page .
President Rank Age VP Gov Senate House State Leg General Cabinet Sum Party Abraham Lincoln 1 52 2 8 10 R Franklin D. Roosevelt 2 51 4 2 6 D George Washington 3 57 16 8.5 24.5 F Thomas Jefferson 4 57 4 2 3 4.25 13.25 DR

Harding 42 55 6.25 4 10.25 R
As practically everyone knows , the current President is often called Bush 43 ( to distinguish him from his father , Bush 41 ) .
But there have only been 42 Presidents .
Stephen Cleveland ( commonly known as Grover ) won the popular vote three times , in 1884 , 1888 , and 1892 , but lost the electoral college to Benjamin Harrison in 1888 .
Having actually won two consecutive elections , he ran again ( with Adlai E. Stevenson , grandfather of the 1952 and 1956 Democratic candidate , as his running mate ) in 1892 and won , making him the 22nd President and also the 24th President .
In the table above , the top quartile ( actually 11 ) are colored deep green , 2nd quartile ( actually 10 ) is colored light green , the 3rd quartile ( actually 11 ) is colored light red , and the bottom quartile ( actually 10 ) is colored deep red .
Recent Presidents have not been included in all the historical surveys , so their rankings should be taken with a grain ( or better yet , a metric ton ) of sodium chloride .
Bush 43 , for example , was rated only twice and one of the ratings was by the Wall St. Journal .
Rankings of recent Presidents will no doubt change in future years when the wisdom of their decisions ( or lack thereof ) becomes more apparent .
All experience is not the same .
How do you compare being governor of a small state with being governor of a big state ?
Is being Vice President worth a pitcher of warm beer or any other fluid ?
Is being a state senator more or less relevant to being president than being Secretary of Commerce ?
Impossible to say for sure , so I have justed added up the total number of years of experience as a proxy for experience .
If you want to weight the columns differently , the data are available in both Excel format and .csv format so you can slice and dice them as you wish .
Before becoming a data analyst though , you should a first read the Notes on presidential experience document David wrote .
Now for the test .
In the table below , the Presidents are sorted on experience .
The most experienced President was James Buchanan , with Lyndon Johnson and Jerry Ford getting the silver and bronze medals , respectively .
Chester A. Arthur had a mere 1.5 years experience before he was elevated to the Presidency upon the asassination of President Garfield .
If experience and greatness correlate , one would expect the top half of the table ( the most experienced Presidents ) to be mostly green ( good ) and the bottom half ( inexperienced ) to be mostly red ( bad ) .
If there is no correlation , the red and green should be random .
Indeed , the latter seems to be the case .
The top half in terms of experience ( above the gray bar ) has 11 bad Presidents and 10 good ones , essentially no correlation between greatness and experience .
If you do n't like this result and want to try for a better one , just get the spreadsheet and start weighting the columns .
Undoubtedly you will be able to get a different result if you try hard enough .
But the point remains , the Presidents with a lot of experience have not been more outstanding than those with little experience .

Here is a scatterplot of rank vs. experience .
If more experience makes you a better President , the dots , each of which is one President , should fall somewhere along the blue theoretical curve -- more experience gives you a higher rank ( 1 being the highest rank ) .
The two Bushes and Clinton are not shown since it is much too early to draw historical judgments on them .
One needs a very vivid imagination to perceive the data points falling along the blue line .
There does not appear to be any relation between experience and greatness .
Here is the same scatterplot , but now with the Presidents labeled .
The Presidents ( way ) under the line might be regarded as overperformers .
They did n't have much experience going into office , but did pretty well once there .
The ones ( way ) above the line had lots of experience but were not good Presidents .

A copyright is supposed to protect a creator 's intellectual property and ensure that the copyright holder 's work is n't nefariously misappropriated .
However , they do n't always work so well ; just ask anyone who has fond memories of Napster circa 2000 .
Not all copyright battles are Metallica - initiated , though .
Take , for example , these three instances of infringement .
Those Freeloading Girl Scouts
When you own the copyright for a song or other original work , you do n't just have the exclusive right to record it and create other tangible reproductions .
You also own the sole rights to broadcast or perform the song in public .
Technically , then , any band or group performing a cover version of one of your songs owes you royalties , as does any hold music an office might play over its phones , which counts as a broadcast .
Since it would be logistically impossible for each band or composer to collect its own royalties from these performances , intermediaries known as performance rights organizations exist .
These organizations , the largest two of which in the U.S. are the non-profits BMI and ASCAP , manage huge portfolios of songs , collect royalties from music venues , bars , restaurants , and other places live covers or recorded music are played , and then reimburse the copyright holders .
This system 's interesting , to be sure , but what does it have to do with the Girl Scouts ?
In 1995 , ASCAP decided that summer camps were getting away with publicly performing copyrighted campfire songs without paying any licensing royalties .
From a legal standpoint , ASCAP was within its rights , but its request that even large non-profit camp directors pay annual fees of as much as $ 1400 or face six - figure fines or a year in prison did n't sit well with the public .
Girl Scout camps were hit particularly hard , and TV reports and a major story in the Wall Street Journal recounted tales of young lasses having to learn the Macarena in silence .
Public opinion swayed against ASCAP as further tales recounted birthdays passing with no singing of " Happy Birthday "  lest a camp director be forced to spend hard time , and the copyright holders eventually relented .
ASCAP now charges the Girl Scouts $ 1 a year to license its portfolio , a symbolic compromise that reasserts the group 's ability to demand these kind of fees .
Apple Gets Less Creative
In June 2007 , the beloved Apple Computers had a copyright tiff of its own .
Photographer Louis Psihoyos claimed that the tech giant , which has been praised for its creative and clever advertising , ripped off his image of a wall of video screens in a spot for Apple TV .
The two images were uncomfortably similar : Psihoyos ' depicted a seated figure surrounded by a wall of videos , whereas Apple 's was pretty much the same save that it did n't include the figure .
Worse still for Apple , Psihoyos ' lawyer claimed that Apple had been in negotiations to license the image , then reneged on the potential deal and used the image anyway .
Psihoyos filed suit against Apple in U.S. District Court , but in December he reversed field and withdrew the action .
However , the suit was dropped with prejudice , meaning that the artist could still receive a settlement .
When Chuck Berry Became a Beach Boy
If you think wholesale pilfering of songs began when Vanilla Ice swiped the bass line from David Bowie and Queen 's song " Under Pressure "  for " Ice , Ice Baby , "  think again .
Far more revered artists have given in to the temptation to lift more than a chord or two .
Take , for instance , the Beach Boys ' classic anthem " Surfin ' USA . " 
The 1963 hit single listed Beach Boy Brian Wilson as the sole composer of the track , but the melody was a complete replication of Chuck Berry 's " Sweet Little Sixteen . " 
You can judge for yourself :
When Chuck Berry accused Brian Wilson of bogarting his melody , the Beach Boys ' manager , Wilson 's father Murray , gave Berry the copyright to the tune .
He did n't tell the members of the band , however , who supposedly only learned 25 years later that they were n't getting royalties from this song and that Berry now receives credit for writing it .
Berry , for his part , supposedly enjoyed " Surfin ' USA . " 

That 's the uncomfortable verdict for these two Web outlets rendered this morning by the just - released " ForeSee Results Top 100 Online Retail Satisfaction Index . "
PCMall and PCConnection not only bring up the rear among computer and electronics sites , they bring up the rear , period .
From the ForeSee report : " Thirteen points separate category leaders Apple and Newegg from laggards PCConnection and PCMall , whose scores of 67 ( out of a possible 100 ) put them at the bottom of the computer and electronics category and of the entire Index for the second year in a row . "
Emphasis mine .
And the entire index -- based on the methods behind the University of Michigan 's decade - long American Customer Satisfaction Index ( ACSI ) -- represents 100 sites that sell , in addition to the tech stuff , everything from books and clothing to sporting goods and home furnishings .
Netflix , QVC and Amazon lead the overall pack .
Anyone can have a bad year .
Two in a row at the bottom of this e-commerce barrel represents a trend .
What do the " laggards " have to say for themselves ?
Neither publicly traded company has responded to inquiries I sent them Tuesday afternoon .
( The PCConnection site is particularly unsatisfying from a journalist 's perspective in that I could find no public relations contact and was relegated to e-mailing the webmaster and sales department in the hope that someone might direct my inquiry to the appropriate someone . )
Larry Freed , president and CEO of ForeSee Results , did answer my questions regarding his company 's survey and virtual condemnation of PCMall and PCConnection :
Does the data reveal any reasons for the relatively poor performances of those two sites ?
There are four primary elements that drive customer satisfaction for the Web sites : brand ( how well the site communicates the brand attributes , is consistent with the image of the brand , etc. ) ; site experience ( navigation , organization , features , etc. ) ; merchandise ( variety , desirability , availability ) ; and price ( suitability and competitiveness ) .
We do n't disclose the details at the element level for individual companies .
However , it is reasonable to say that PCConnection and PCMall have an opportunity to improve across all of those elements .
Across the group of companies measured , typically we see brand as the highest impact element .
In other words , if companies can improve customer perception of the brand element , it will have the biggest possible impact on their satisfaction and purchase behavior .
Site experience is typically the second biggest impact , followed by merchandise and then price .
The good news for these two sites is that there is great upside opportunity if they improve the satisfaction of their site visitors .
What conclusions , if any , can an online shopper draw from the disparity between the best and the worst performers on this index ?
The wide range in scores between the companies indicates that there are strong leaders in this category and other sites that are struggling .
They will have to raise the customer satisfaction level or will continue to see significant pressure on their ability to be successful and grow .
What advice would you give these two that might help drag their ratings out of the cellar ?
My advice would be to listen to your customers .
There is no more important voice that you should be hearing than that of your site visitors .
And to remember that satisfaction is a combination of what consumers get and what they expect .
It is important to manage their expectations .
It is a mistake for retailers to exaggerate marketing claims or set an expectation during the site experience that can not be met .

The South African government has lost more than £ 12 m ( 199 m Rand ) over the last three years thanks to a cybercrime syndicate using spyware .
The scam has been running since 2005 and is still going on despite the arrest of 32 people .
Thieves have targetted various government departments in four provinces .
A number of civil servants have also been sacked .
Crooks are using corrupt government officials and suppliers to fix a small piece of kit the size of a memory stick to PCs .
This can then access saved and unsaved information , according to South Africa 's Mail & Guardian .
The paper said it has taken so long to sort out the problem because officials were originally concentrating on finding the crooks , but now they are focussed on stopping it happening again .
The gang is also believed to have targeted banks in the country .
Geoff Sweeney , CTO with security firm Tier - 3 , said that spyware attacks are hard to stop because of their unpredictable nature , and because of convergance between viruses , trojans and other malware .
" These fraudsters appeared to be using a sophisticated combination of attacks that consisted of a physical device and a malware component , as witnessed by the fact they have been getting away with their crimes for nigh on three years . "
Sweeney said such attacks showed the need for several layers of defences . ®
MESEBERG , Germany ( CNN ) -- U.S. President Bush claimed Wednesday that he had no regrets about the decision to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 and reiterated his determination to force Iran to halt its nuclear program .
U.S. President Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel walk in the garden at Schloss Meseberg Palace .
Bush , making the final official visit to Europe of his presidency , spoke at a news conference in Germany after talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel .
He said he had told Merkel that diplomacy remained his preferred choice for dealing with Iran .
But he added that " all options are on the table " and said Tehran needed to " verifiably suspend " its uranium enrichment program .
Iran maintains that its nuclear ambitions are peaceful .
" The message to the Iranian government is very clear : that there 's a better way forward than isolation and that is for you to verifiably suspend your enrichment program and the choice is theirs to make , " Bush said .
On Tuesday , the U.S. and the European Union issued a joint declaration urging tougher action against Iran over its nuclear program .
It said the U.S. and EU would implement previously passed Security Council resolutions on Iran and stood " ready to supplement those sanctions with additional measures . "
Sanctions in place should be enforced , Bush said , and allies should work together for additional sanctions if Iran " ignores the demands of the free world . "
Merkel said further sanctions would follow if Iran failed to meet its commitments .
" We again said we want to give room for diplomatic solutions , we want to give diplomacy a chance , but we also have to stay on that particular issue . "
She added that she believed diplomatic pressure had already had an impact .
" If you look at the situation in Iran on the ground , you see that quite clearly .
These efforts can have a success , but this presupposes , obviously , that the global community is sort of unified , " she said .
Merkel said there must be a " common approach " toward Iran in the world community .
Leaving Germany on Wednesday , Bush flew on to Italy , where he was to hold talks with Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi and visit the Vatican to meet Pope Benedict XVI on Friday .
Bush can expect a warm reception from Berlusconi , a staunch U.S. supporter who committed Italian troops to Iraq in the aftermath of the invasion and who returned to power in elections this year .
Paying tribute to Bush in an article for Time magazine 's list of the world 's 100 most influential people , Berlusconi wrote : " Personally , I will always remember him as a friend . "
Read the article at Time.com
Asked about Iraq , Bush said that " substantial " progress had been made in helping the country , adding that efforts in Iraq would " change the Middle East for the better . "
" Removing Saddam Hussein made the world a safer place , " Bush said .
But he admitted once again that he regretted the tough rhetoric he had used in the run-up to the conflict which had made it appear he was eager to go to war .
In an interview with UK's Times newspaper Wednesday , Bush said that using phrases such as " dead or alive " and " bring them on " had not created an impression of a man of peace .
He also said he had found it painful " to put youngsters in harm 's way , " adding that he had an obligation to make sure lives had not been lost in vain .
" One of the lessons of Iraq is that in order for a democracy to develop or for an economy to develop there has to be a measure of security , which is now happening , " he said .
Bush said he also believed that the U.S. would develop a bilateral strategic agreement relationship with Iraq , a pact now under negotiation .
He said reports that the United States wanted to develop permanent bases in Iraq were " erroneous . "
" I think we 'll get the agreement done , " he said .
" This will not involve permanent bases , nor will it bind any future president to troop levels . "

Details given to us last night about Valve 's rumored casting of the sequel ( or prequel ) to its Orange Box hit Portal hinted at a big role for Aperture Science 's founder Cave Johnson .
The potentially spoiler - iffic painted portrait and brief bio of the possible Portal 2 antagonist led us to believe that the sequel may take place prior to the original .
Maybe not , based on some rumored dialogue that a source passed on .
Advertisement
Warning :
It 's all spoiler territory from here on ...
The script samples we saw for the Cave Johnson role indicate that the Aperture CEO and " eccentric dead billionaire " is , well , already dead , living on in simulated computer form .
He tells an unnamed rookie test subject via loudspeaker that " As of this mornin ' yer old buddy Cave has been resurrected inside of a computer .
And I never felt better ! " acting as this entry 's GlaDOS — possibly that prototypical GlaDOS , as theorized earlier — encouraging the player to continue the testing while waxing philosophical about the afterlife .

" I been thinkin , " the script reads , " Heck , suspended as I am in this inky purgatorium , I got nothin ' to do but think .
What if them engineers did n't do me no favors pourin ' me into a computer ?
What if they denied me my final reward ? "
No telling if this internal conflict is the catalyst for Johnson " [ losing ] his grip on humanity as the story progresses " but if things go wonderfully wrong as they did in the first , it would certainly make for a compelling narrative .

It looks like BMW is bringing back the M1 , the legendary mid-engined two - seater that redefined the supercar and proved a BMW could run with the best from Porsche , Ferrari and Lamborghini .
The company once again has those marques – and Audi , which knocked one out of the park with the incredible R8 – in its sights and believes a car based on the M1 Hommage it unveiled last month is just the weapon to bring them down .
" We have the know - how , we have the right engine , we even have the infrastructure to build such a car , " company board member Herbert Diess says .
The M1 that Giorgetto Giugiaro designed for BMW was a seminal car .
It was smooth , it was quick and it was easy to drive – impressive given that it was a race car homologated for street use .
Top Gear called it " civilized " and " the world 's first truly user - friendly mid-engined supercar . "
The car gave rise to BMW 's M cars and its six - cylinder engine went on to appear in the M3 and M5 .
BMW hand - built just 456 M1s between 1978 and 1981 , and they command top - dollar these days .
Adrian van Hooydonk floated the idea of developing a supercar concept five years ago to mark the M1's 25th anniversary , but then - chairman Helmut Penke shot it down .
Norbert Reithofer is in charge now , and he embraced the idea of marking the M1's 30th anniversary with the Hommage .
Although it 's only a styling exercise – there 's nothing under the hood or behind those black windows – it was designed with the idea it might be built .
Britain 's CAR Magazine says it almost certainly will be , and Auto Express says the project 's been approved .
According to CAR , BMW 's engineers are looking at a three - part structure for the chassis consisting of a front subframe with suspension , passenger cell and rear subframe with suspension and drivetrain .
They 'll most likely be fabricated from aluminum , although a carbon fiber passenger cell is possible .
As for the engine , CAR says anything in the BMW lineup will fit but the most likely candidate is a 3.0 - liter straight six with three turbos and about 450 horsepower .
Auto Express will come with either the six or the 4.0 - liter V8 from the M3 .
That would give it about 400 horsepower .
Whatever it gets , look for a 0 - to - 60 time of around 4 seconds and a top speed just north of 200 .
A diesel and hydrogen version also are possible .
The production car will build on Benoit Jacob 's design for the Hommage , and BMW Group chief designer Chris Bangle tells CAR , " the car 's exterior will go through at least one more revision , for both aesthetic and engineering reasons . "
So when would it be built ?
If BMW goes full bore , CAR says it could be ready by 2010 but 2013 is more likely .
" Done right , " Diess told the magazine , " I believe we can only benefit from such a car . "

Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
Roland Martin says we all like preferential treatment if we can get it .
( CNN ) --
Be honest :
How many of you are really shocked to find out that a bunch of Washington insiders were part of a VIP program coordinated by mortgage giant Countrywide Financial ?
The story was first reported by CondeNast 's Portfolio magazine , and everyone else has jumped on it since .
Based on what we know , folks like former Housing and Urban Development honcho Alphonso Jackson , Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Connecticut , Sen. Kent Conrad , D - North Dakota , and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala got favorable loan terms from the mortgage behemoth .
My first reaction was , " Man , these folks are dumb to think they could get away with it ! "
But as I was preparing to go on CNN Tuesday , it dawned on me that if most folks were in the same situation , and it was n't illegal , they would love to have the hookup !
We are a nation that loves anything VIP .
Come on , do n't sit there and try to be so righteous .
If you had an opportunity to be a part of the program , you would jump at it .
OK , fine .
Let 's do something on a smaller scale .
Do you remember when you were in high school and you found out that you had a buddy working at the movie theatre , your first thought had to be , " Cool !
I get to get in free ! "
You could apply that same response to a girlfriend working at the fast food restaurant .
" Uh , oh , free burgers every Friday night ! "
We are a nation that likes free stuff .
And if we can bypass a line in order to feel privileged , we 'll do it .
Ever been to a club and you were one of the unfortunate folks standing behind the velvet rope ?
It must burn you up to see these flashy folks walk to the front of the line and have the beefy security guard , who unceremoniously turned you away , welcome them with open arms .
That , folks , is the VIP treatment .
And no one standing in that line likes it .
But in their minds they are saying , " Now what do I need to do to be like them ? "
Professional athletes ?
They get the hookup all the time .
TV and big - screen stars ?
Oh , you know they are always getting the preferential treatment .
This is in no way an effort to excuse the behavior of these politicos .
They are undoubtedly using their positions as elected officeholders to get something the average Joe can't .
But do n't average Joe and Jane like it when they also get something by virtue of their connections ?
I just want us to be honest about all of this .
A lot of times when stories like this come out , we get hot and bothered , angered about the have and have nots in our society , but they exist on every level .
Right now , in some small town , suburb or big city , there are star athletes who get free meals and other perks from local establishments for doing well on the field or the court .
Should they ?
According to the rules , no .
But how many parents are quick to say , " Oh , no , do n't do that .
It 's just not right " ?
Again , be honest .
This is what some call situational ethics .
Depending on the situation , and what side of the wall you 're on , you might think it 's wrong and outlandish to get the VIP treatment .
But if you somehow ascend to that VIP class , your philosophy will likely change .
Just admit it !
Just watch a lot of media folks -- radio talk show hosts , TV pundits , and newspaper columnists -- decry these Washington insiders for getting the hookup , but if you get the truth from them , they 'll have to confess that even they have received benefits by virtue of their " celebrity " status .
So , before everyone goes off the deep end , just make sure you 're not being a hypocrite and judging someone else for something you have accepted or would readily accept if you were also a VIP .

WASHINGTON --( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- The Corn Refiners Association ( CRA ) today announced it is launching a multi-media advertising and public relations campaign to change the conversation about high fructose corn syrup , which has been the subject of considerable attention and misinformation .
“ There are so many myths , inaccuracies and untruths associated with this sweetener that we felt it was necessary to set the record straight , ” said Audrae Erickson , president , Corn Refiners Association .
“ We hope to provide balanced information about high fructose corn syrup to allow consumers to make informed decisions based on science . ”
Most of the problem , according to Erickson , stems from the confusion about what high fructose corn syrup really is .
“ Scientific research continues to confirm that high fructose corn syrup is no different from other sweeteners .
It is essentially the same as table sugar and honey , and has the same number of calories , ” she said .
Consumer Awareness of HFCS Facts Low
A recent national survey1 indicates that the myths associated with this sweetener have led many consumers to believe that it is different from table sugar .
The survey revealed that two - thirds of household shoppers are aware of high fructose corn syrup , yet they are not aware of the similarities between high fructose corn syrup and table sugar .
More than two - thirds of consumers surveyed do not know that high fructose corn syrup and table sugar have the same number of calories
Only 19 percent of survey respondents understand that table sugar and high fructose corn syrup have the same sweetness
Almost two - thirds of those surveyed do not understand that high fructose corn syrup contains the same simple sugars – glucose and fructose – as table sugar
Campaign Busts Common Myths
Among the frequently published myths , high fructose corn syrup is often labeled unnatural and is accused of being uniquely responsible for obesity .
High fructose corn syrup meets the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ’s guidelines for the use of the term natural .
“ HFCS , like table sugar and honey , is natural , ” Erickson said .
“ It is made from corn , a natural grain product and contains no artificial or synthetic ingredients or color additives . ”
Additionally , there is no scientific evidence to suggest that high fructose corn syrup is uniquely responsible for the country ’s obesity rates .
In fact , a recent decision by the American Medical Association concluded that “ high fructose corn syrup does not appear to contribute more to obesity than other caloric sweeteners . ”
“ No single food or ingredient is the cause of obesity , ” said James M. Rippe , cardiologist and biomedical sciences professor at the University of Central Florida .
“ Eating too many calories and getting too little exercise are primary causes . ”
The caloric density of high fructose corn syrup and sugar are equal – four calories per gram .
“ There is no difference in how the body metabolizes these sweeteners , ” Rippe said .
“ They ’re indistinguishable once they reach the bloodstream . ”
Consumption of high fructose corn syrup has been dropping in recent years , yet the rates of obesity and diabetes in the U.S. continue to rise , Rippe added .
“ And in many other parts of the world , obesity and diabetes are on the rise despite having little or no high fructose corn syrup . ”
Campaign Shares Facts
CRA ’s new campaign will seek to communicate the facts about HFCS to consumers and opinion leaders .
Newspaper , magazine and television advertisements will be a central component of the campaign , along with on - going outreach efforts to health professionals .
Consumers can find science - based information about high fructose corn syrup at www.sweetsurprise.com.
CRA is the national trade association representing the corn refining ( wet milling ) industry of the United States .
CRA and its predecessors have served this important segment of American agribusiness since 1913 .
Corn refiners manufacture sweeteners , starch , oil and other products from corn .

Logical Algorithms , Harald Ganzinger and David McAllester .
ICALP 2002 .
It is widely accepted that many algorithms can be concisely and clearly expressed as logical inference rules .
However , logic programming has been inappropriate for the study of the running time of algorithms because there has not been a clear and precise model of the run time of a logic program .
We present a logic programming model of computation appropriate for the study of the run time of a wide variety of algorithms .
So , there are two main styles in logic programming .
The first is Prolog - style goal - directed , or backwards , search .
The idea is that you have a set of rules , and a goal , and you nondeterministically choose rules that might have proven that goal , trying to find a sequence of deductions that could have proven this goal .
It 's called backwards search since you are trying to reason backwards from the goal towards a full proof .
The other style is , naturally , called forwards search ( confusingly , this is also called the inverse method in theorem proving ) .
The idea is that you have a goal , and some rules , and a starting set of facts .
You then apply the rules to the facts you have , enlarging your database of facts and enabling more deductions .
You keep doing this until either you discover the goal you were trying to prove in the database of facts , or the database saturates ( ie , no more deductions are provable ) and the goal is unprovable .
The idea is that your database is an implicit data structure , which you update as part of the search .
This makes forwards search a particularly natural method when you 're trying to compute closures -- graph algorithms , dataflow analyses , that kind of thing .
While we 've discussed applications of forward logic programming before , I thought it might be good to link to a discussion of the methodology of how to specify algorithms as forward logic programs and analyze their complexity .
The language in this paper permits deletion of facts from the database , which is unfortunately a non-logical operation -- in clasical and intuitionistic logic , deduction can only increase the number of facts you know .
But with a change of logic , it can be made logical .
That 'll be the next paper I post a link to . :)
Saakashvili ( left ) and Medvedev held their first presidential meeting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned Georgia and Ukraine of serious consequences if they press ahead with plans to join Nato .
Mr Medvedev and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Georgia 's president that joining the alliance would lead to a " spiral of confrontation " .
Mr Medvedev said Ukraine would be in breach of a friendship treaty if it joined Nato , Mr Lavrov said .
The leaders are at a summit of 12 ex-Soviet states in St Petersburg .
Conflicts Georgia has been pushing for entry to Nato and the European Union , straining relations with Russia .
Tensions have also grown over Russia 's support for separatists in Georgia 's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Both Russia and Georgia have accused each other of preparing for war in Abkhazia .
" We reiterated our strong interest in seeing those conflicts resolved , " Mr Lavrov said , following the meeting with Mr Saakashvili at the Commonwealth of Independent States informal summit .
" We stated this could not be achieved by moving Georgia artificially into Nato because this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area . "
The Georgian president played down talk of confrontation , saying the problem could be resolved with " goodwill " .
' Security risks '
Analysts had been waiting to see if Mr Medvedev 's relations with Ukraine and Georgia would be warmer than those under his predecessor , Vladimir Putin .
Ukraine and Russia have a history of disputes over gas
But the new president stuck to the same line as Mr Putin when he met President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine on Friday .
He pointed to a 1997 friendship treaty between Russia and Ukraine .
" The treaty ... contains the obligation on the two parties not to do anything which would create threats or risks for the security of the other party , " Mr Lavrov told reporters .
" This was reiterated by President Medvedev , that we do not believe Nato membership for Ukraine would serve ... the interests of the two countries . "
Mr Medvedev also warned Mr Yushchenko not to expel the Russian navy from the base it leases at Sevastopol on Ukraine 's Black Sea coast , as it has threatened to do .
And he said Russia would almost double the price it charges neighbouring Ukraine for gas from 1 January , 2009 .
Mr Lavrov denied the move was political , saying it was forced by increasing costs in Central Asia .
The two countries have had several recent disputes over gas , with Russia cutting supplies and Ukraine alleging Moscow uses gas as a political weapon .

TEHRAN , IRAN — Illyas , 20 , precariously straddles two worlds .
At home with his family , he 's a devout Christian who wears a silver cross around his neck , devotionally reads the Bible , and , on the Sabbath , hums hymns of praise to Jesus .
Easter and Christmas are celebrated with homemade grape wine , even though alcohol is banned in Iran .
Publicly , though , Illyas is a devout Muslim .
Before leaving home to attend university classes , he removes the cross .
He falsely tells his teachers about reading the Koran regularly since , he says , expressing fealty to Islam is necessary to land a good job in Iran .
And he regularly goes to Friday prayers at Tehran University , where , if necessary , he joins in chants of Marg - bar Amrika ( Death to America ) — although he says that he does n't hate America and , in fact , hopes to move there someday .
Illyas and his mother and stepfather — for their safety , their family name cannot be revealed — had been Muslims ( as are 98 percent of the nation 's 66 million citizens ) .
That changed a year ago , when they were drawn to a seductively passionate voice on a satellite TV channel imploring Iranians to embrace Christianity .
On hearing the voice , Illyas 's mother called the channel 's hotline number .
She prayed with the counselor on the phone , she says , making a personal commitment to Jesus as her savior .
Later , Illyas and his stepfather did the same , as the counselor from California 's Iran for Christ Ministries led them in prayer .
The counselor was able to put Illyas in touch with some local Iranians — also discreet believers — who could provide a copy of the Bible .
" We were looking for a faith that offered the reassurance of freedom , '' says Illyas , who asked to be interviewed in a public restaurant in Tehran instead of his house .
Islam is the state religion of Iran , governing most aspects of life since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
But , exasperated with the obsessive atmosphere of Islamic purity in Iran since the revolution and the subsequent curbing of social freedoms , Illyas says , his family felt compelled to look for other spiritual answers , even at considerable risk .
Leaving Islam for another religion , or apostasy , has long invited reprisals from the Iranian government , forcing the likes of Illyas and his family into absolute secrecy , practicing their new beliefs only in the privacy of their home .
In Iran , Christians are prohibited from seeking Muslim converts , although there has been tolerance for those who are born into Christian families .
The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has introduced legislation before the Iranian Majlis that would mandate the death penalty for apostates from Islam , a sign that it will brook no proselytizing in the country .
" Life for so - called apostates in Iran has never been easy , but it could become literally impossible if Iran passes this new draft penal code , " says Joseph Grieboski , the president of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy in Washington .
" For anyone who dares question the regime 's religious ideology , there could soon be no room to argue — only death . ''
Minorities .
Grieboski points out that the text of the draft penal code uses the word hadd ( prescribed punishment ) , which explicitly sets death as a fixed , irrevocable punishment .
He worries that it could be applied to religious and ethnic minorities like Christians , Bahais , Jews , and Azeris by treating them as apostates .
Articles 225 to 227 of the draft penal code define two kinds of apostates : fetri , or an innate apostate — who has at least one Muslim parent , identifies as a Muslim after puberty , and later renounces Islam ; and melli , or parental apostate — who is a non-Muslim at birth but later embraces Islam , only to renounce it again .
The draft code says outright that punishment for an innate apostate is death .
However , parental apostates have three days after their sentencing to recant their beliefs .
If they do n't , they will be executed according to their sentence .
It is n't clear when this bill will be passed , though Grieboski says , " International pressure and attention — in large part due to our work — has significantly slowed the parliament 's progress . ''
In the past , apostasy could draw a range of punishments , from imprisonment to death , under legal practices that were more ambiguous than the draft statutes .
In one instance that drew international attention , Mehdi Dibaj , an Iranian convert , was held in prison for his Christian beliefs for 10 years starting in 1984 .
He received the death sentence at the end of 1993 .
But he was released from prison in January 1994 after an international publicity campaign by Haik Hovsepian Mehr , a prominent Christian pastor in Iran .
A few days after Dibaj 's release , Hovsepian Mehr was abducted in Tehran , and his body , with 26 stab wounds , was found secretly buried in a Muslim graveyard .
Six months later , Dibaj , freed but still under a pending death sentence , was abducted and murdered .
Considering the perils , Muslim Iranians turn to satellite television ( though officially prohibited ) , radio , and the Internet to talk about faiths other than Islam .
Some names include the Iranian Christian Television Channel , run by a registered charity based in the United Kingdom ; Radio Mojdeh ; and Iranian Christian Radio .
SAT - 7 PARS , a Middle Eastern Christian satellite station headquartered in Cyprus , began broadcasting in Farsi to Iran in the fall of 2002 , under the name of Iranian Christian Broadcasting .
In late 2006 , it launched the 24 - hour Farsi - language satellite television channel .
SAT -7 PARS says it receives hundreds of letters and E - mails every week from Iranian viewers — many of them young — expressing interest in Christianity .
David Harder , the communications manager at SAT - 7 in Cyprus , says the channel tries to answer all questions , but it is a nonproselytizing entity .
" Iranian Christians themselves often have very little access to teaching materials that can help them in their spiritual growth , " says Harder .
" Satellite television provides a means through which Iranians , who have often never had the opportunity to enter a church or even to know a Christian , can learn more about this faith . "
Despite the Koran 's injunction that " there is no compulsion in religion , " issues of religious freedom have persisted since the Islamic revolution of 1979 , and that is driving the young away from Islam , says Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a reformist cleric and former vice president of Iran .
" If you force religion down people 's throats , it makes them less religious , not more . "
Another analyst based in Tehran agrees but senses a western conspiracy in proselytizing through mass media .
He blames satellite television channels for emotionally manipulating Iranian viewers into changing their religion .
" Iranians are looking for a balm , and proselytizers are taking advantage of that , '' he says .
" There 's a vicious western plot to foment a wider cultural East - West war and demonize Islam in the process . ''
Demonizing Christianity .
Ironically , these days , a recent Iranian film , Jesus , the Spirit of God , is being accused of demonizing Christianity .
It 's a new film on Jesus told from an Islamic perspective .
Jesus , regarded as only a prophet , did not die on the cross and was not resurrected .
The disciple Judas Iscariot is crucified in his place , according to the film .
This premise is based on the teachings of the Koran and the Gospel of Barnabas , a book not included in the Christian Bible and in which the prophet Muhammad appears .
The $ 5 million film , funded by Iranian state broadcasting , is intended to promote a dialogue between Muslims and Christians , according to director Nader Talebzadeh .
It received a tepid reception in theaters across Iran and will now be recycled as a 20 - episode series on state - run national television this year .
Mona , a 24 - year - old Assyrian Christian residing in more affluent northern Tehran , saw the film and said its " jaundiced ' ' interpretation made her cringe .
She 's not very religious , she says , though she acknowledges there is enough freedom to practice her faith because she was born into a Christian family .
But she remains disillusioned with the fact that Islam pervades almost every aspect of normal life in Iran .
She says she was recently rejected for a job as a flight attendant with Air Iran , the state - run airline , because she had n't ever read the Koran .
" Religion without the freedom to reject it is not a true religion , " she says in her living room , her head bereft of a scarf .
" It makes life very claustrophobic . "

But why is Ivy Leaguer and east coast elitist William Kristol , who never served in the United States military himself , whining about what Obama says in respect to the U.S. military ?
Apparently we must weigh in the fact that William Kristol , and his father , are ardent neo-conservatives whose ideological founder was Leo Strauss .
More importantly we need note that Leo Strauss was a fascist political philosopher who taught at the University of Chicago .
Neoconofascism Manipulate U.S. Via Mainstream Media :
By Ben Frank
Recently neoconofascist William Kristol , from the New York Times News Service , as syndicated right - wing power broker , complained that Barack Obama did not mention military service , at a commencement speech , in which he discussed other forms of service to our country .
But why is Ivy Leaguer and east coast elitist William Kristol , who never served in the United States military himself , whining about what Obama says in respect to the U.S. military ?
Apparently we must weigh in the fact that William Kristol , and his father , are ardent neo-conservatives whose ideological founder was Leo Strauss .
More importantly we need note that Leo Strauss was a fascist political philosopher who taught at the University of Chicago .
Anyone who knows anything about politics knows that the neocons are not conservatives rather they are radical extremists who have already engaged in damaging civil liberties here in the United States not to mention playing a crucial role of manipulating our country into war with Iraq .
Secondly we note that many of the power brokers of the neoconservative movement are right - wing Jewish Americans with some right - wing secular and Christians smattered in as well .
This is no small detail that is that they have been working , along with their cohorts at AIPAC , for U.S wars in the Middle East .
They actively worked to bypass our CIAs more tentative and contrary assessments about WMD while they created their own  Office of Special Plans within the Pentagon .
Yes it was three more rightwing NeoCons , Abram Shulsky and Douglas Feith , that used this specially created Paul Wolfowitz aberration of a temporary center to distort intelligence assessments that went to the President circumventing the establishment .
The fact is that Saddam Hussein , despite his political style , empathized with the Palestinians .
Israels right wing wanted the U.S. to attack Iraq .
And despite the fact that oil , the oil industry , and the petrodollar weigh heavily in this war Israels manipulations do equally as catalyst .
In fact the strategy of Israeli influence here in America , via their operatives in Washington , the mainstream media , and Hollywood , and very likely some of the rumors and reporting of covert false flag operations , have engaged in a long war of manipulating both Christian fear and hatred of Muslims and Arabs with their constant soundbites on terrorism  and  Islamofascism  and not surprisingly radical extremism  when real extremism comes from their own camp .
There has been a constant propaganda attack on the American people to have various wars of a  Clash of Cultures  while depicting the Muslim counties as backward and barbarian .
Meanwhile there was no acknowledgement that Israel is too a theocracy , that acts as a barbarian state , that discriminates against people of other religions .
So again we ask : what motivates this neoconfascist Kristol to want to discuss military service ?
How much war does he envision for the sake of Israels inability to get along with its neighbors and its continuous usurping of Palestinian property rights ?
Why should American soldiers continue to fight peoples who are sympathetic with the Palestinians such as many Iranians .
Currently the people fighting in our military are from the lower classes and middle classes while kids of the wealthier classes , whose parent s may invest for profits from the war machine , continue to send their kids to college .
Why should kids from the heartland and deep south , who religious affiliations are more evangelical and Baptist or other lower socio- economical layers , fight a war for those whose religious affiliations are from other sociological sectors ?
The United States has paid an extreme and detrimental price being loyal to Israel which is not much loyalty is made in return .
And funny how these neoconfascists are supporting McCain whose father helped cover up Israels attack on our naval ship the USS Liberty while they deliberately killed our U.S. sailors .
Meanwhile why should Obama go before an AIPAC convention and promise unconditional loyalty for nothing in returnas if the AIPAC were some sort of divine assembly from God ?
More importantly , since when has Israel , or their handlers here in the U.S. , been particularly loyal to the United Statesor even halfway loyal ?
The United States needs to step back from such a close and suffocating relationship so as to be able to see and act independently .
This current relationship of coercive blackmail has to end .
Granted Americas foreign policies have had many faults and corruptions but this current partnership with Israel and its neoconfascism collaborators here within the U.S. is not healthy .

Newsweek ’s Howard Fineman just said on MSNBC at 8:35 pm
Eastern that the Clinton campaign is demanding that Hillary be offered the VP position , which she will then decline , and then Fineman quotes the Clinton campaign as saying “ do n’t you dare offer it to another woman . ”
Is n’t that special .
Apparently , Hillary was only planning on breaking her own personal glass ceiling .

“ I do n’t think the campaign will have any positive effect .
Now if you did this in the United States , there would be benefits , since there are many Americans who weigh more than 100 kilograms , ” or about 220 pounds , Mr. Ogushi said .
“ But the Japanese are so slender that they ca n’t afford to lose weight . ”
Image A poster at a public health clinic in Japan reads , " Goodbye , metabo , " a word associated with being overweight .
The Japanese government is mounting an ambitious weight - loss campaign .
Credit ... Ko Sasaki for The New York Times
Mr. Ogushi was actually a little harder on Americans than they deserved .
A survey by the National Center for Health Statistics found that the average waist size for Caucasian American men was 39 inches , a full inch lower than the 40 - inch threshold established by the International Diabetes Federation .
American women did not fare as well , with an average waist size of 36.5 inches , about two inches above their threshold of 34.6 inches .
The differences in thresholds reflected variations in height and body type from Japanese men and women .
Comparable figures for the Japanese are sketchy since waistlines have not been measured officially in the past .
But private research on thousands of Japanese indicates that the average male waistline falls just below the new government limit .
That fact , widely reported in the media , has heightened the anxiety in the nation ’s health clinics .
In Amagasaki , a city in western Japan , officials have moved aggressively to measure waistlines in what the government calls special checkups .
The city had to measure at least 65 percent of the 40 - to 74 - year - olds covered by public health insurance , an “ extremely difficult ” goal , acknowledged Midori Noguchi , a city official .
When his turn came , Mr. Nogiri , the flower shop owner , entered a booth where he bared his midriff , exposing a flat stomach with barely discernible love handles .
A nurse wrapped a tape measure around his waist across his belly button : 33.6 inches , or 0.1 inch over the limit .
“ Strikeout , ” he said , defeat spreading across his face .
The campaign started a couple of years ago when the Health Ministry began beating the drums for a medical condition that few Japanese had ever heard of  metabolic syndrome  a collection of factors that heighten the risk of developing vascular disease and diabetes .
Those include abdominal obesity , high blood pressure and high levels of blood glucose and cholesterol .
In no time , the scary - sounding condition was popularly shortened to the funny - sounding metabo , and it has become the nation ’s shorthand for overweight .
Now you should have the basic shape of your card , with two flaps that overlap in the centre .
Take the top flap and draw the outline of a face on it .
Make sure that the lips of the face are slightly open and are on a part of the flap that overlaps with the one underneath .
Once you have your face outline , cut it out and close the card up again .
Now lightly trace the outline of the top face 's lips and nose onto the lower flap .
Draw a face on the second flap , using the line you just traced as a guide for the mouth and nose .
Again , make sure the lips are slightly open .
Cut the second face out and close the card up again , only this time make it so that the faces kiss .
Hopefully they will stay that way .
If they spring apart then try to keep them together by playing with the creases , and the size of the gap in the lips .
If that fails it probably was n't meant to be .
You may have to cut your card in two and let each half go their separate ways .
Throw this into the running for " dumbest newspaper editorial ever " , by the NY Sun :
Senator McCain has been coming in for some mockery lately for having answered the " Mac or PC ? " question from Politico.com with , " Neither , I am an illiterate . "
But before writing off the likely Republican nominee as a Luddite or an old fogey , allow us to contemplate the idea that Mr. McCain might be smarter than we all think [...]
He does n't have to suffer through reading and deleting silly jokes and pictures forwarded from distant relatives .
He does n't have to spend time reading status updates of Facebook " friends " who are really just remote acquaintances .
He does n't have to worry about what the bloggers are saying about him .
He saves a lot of money on all the online shopping he is n't doing .
He does n't have to worry about his stock portfolio by checking it incessantly online ; he can just think about it when his monthly or quarterly statement arrives in the mail .
He does n't have to worry about accidentally sending the confidential memo to the whole staff .
He also does n't have to worry about what is happening around the world .
He can get that stuff filtered by his yes - men staff .
He does n't have to worry about educating himself about pesky things like which ones are the Sunnis , and which ones are n't .
He certainly can avoid YouTube , lest he discover that everyone who creates videos loves Obama and hates him .
And yeah , it 's great avoiding the blogs .
It would suck if he found out what people were saying about him ( and I 'm not talking about the liberal ones ) .
Living in a bubble is all the rage in some circles these days , apparently .
So many advantages !
Feel free to add more .
PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
What 's plaguing the financial markets these days is not a lack of liquidity but a lack of confidence and this wo n't be restored unless and until policymakers address its root cause : falling home prices .
As I have said many times before , policymakers are treating the symptoms when instead they should be trying to cure the disease .
The Federal Reserve 's offer to swap Treasury securities for certain types of mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) is the latest example .
This arrangement may temporarily boost prices of these MBSs by taking some of the supply off the market , but it wo n't last for two reasons : ( 1 ) the central bank plans to hold these securities for only 28 days and ( 2 ) the home values that form the basis for these securities are still declining .
Until home prices stop falling , MBS values wo n't stabilize .
And until MBS values do stabilize , lenders will continue to be wary since they will remain unsure of this and just about every other form of collateral save for the safest Treasuries .
To stabilize home prices , I suggested in my column of Feb.
4 that the government step in and split the difference between prices sellers are charging and those that buyers are willing to pay .
See related column .
While the notion of stabilizing home prices has been accepted , my suggestion has been criticized for a number of reasons .
Either it was misunderstood , was viewed as unattractive politically , or was seen as a bailout for sellers .
To address these issues , I have come up with another idea .
Washington should form an agency akin to the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation of the 1930s , an agency that refinanced homes during the Great Depression in an effort to prevent foreclosures .
While some people were able to hang onto their homes , many defaulted and the HOLC wound up owning these homes .
However , it sold them and by the time this agency closed its doors in the early 1950s , it actually returned a small profit to the government .
I envision HOLC II offering to buy all houses for sale at a price not more than three times the median household income in each market .
It would then offer to sell these homes to prospective buyers .
This could not be construed as a bailout , since many sellers would take a loss -- how much depending on when they bought and how overheated their particular market became .
Also , it would not rescue homeowners who bought more house than they should have or took out one home - equity loan too many and are now " upside down " ( they owe more than their house is worth ) .
But by returning home prices to a more normal ratio relative to incomes , it would make housing affordable once again .
This would get buyers back into the game , but even more important , it would establish a basis for valuing the plethora of mortgage - backed securities that have permeated the financial markets .
The markets might be able to do this on their own , but as we saw this week , it could be painful -- not to say prolonged -- and it runs the risk of overshooting .
For this gambit to work , HOLC II would not have to buy every house that 's up for sale .
Indeed , its very offer to buy might be sufficient to end housing 's downward spiral -- even with the large number of unsold homes still overhanging the market .
And if the lower price this agency does offer causes demand to exceed supply , HOLC II , like its predecessor , might even be able to make a profit for the government .
Who says history does n't repeat itself ?
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
All Lyle Petersen wanted to do was get his mail .
Lyle Petersen , a CDC expert who was infected with West Nile virus , says , " it will ruin your summer . "
In the time it took him to walk down his driveway in Fort Collins , Colorado , chat briefly with a neighbor and return to his house , Petersen got infected with a potentially serious mosquito - borne illness called West Nile virus .
Within hours of being bitten , he said , he began to feel symptoms he recognized .
And how was he sure so quickly ?
Petersen , as director of the division of vector borne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , is one of the foremost experts in the world on the condition .
A blood test confirmed his suspicion .
" From my own experience , I can tell you it 's not a very mild illness , " Petersen cautioned .
" It will ruin your summer . "
Experts are expecting another epidemic of the disease this summer .
The incidence of West Nile virus has remained the same for the past four years , and Petersen says he does n't expect this year to be any different .
It should reach its peak between mid-July and mid-September .
Health Minute : More on West Nile virus risk »
" People tend to discount this as a significant problem , " Petersen said , " but more than 1.5 million people have been infected so far in the United States , and about 300,000 have had West Nile fever . "
West Nile virus emerged in the U.S. nine years ago .
The virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito .
Mosquitoes contract the illness by feeding on infected birds .
The CDC reported that in rare cases , West Nile virus has spread through blood transfusions , organ transplants and breastfeeding .
The disease is not spread through casual contact .

The symptoms range from mild to severe and typically develop between three and 14 days after a person is bitten .
Explainer : West Nile 101 »
Debbie Koma , a 50 - year old hairdresser from Atlanta , Georgia , developed West Nile virus two years ago .
She described it as " unlike anything that I ever had before .
I was sick as a dog . "
She recalled being hospitalized for three days with a high fever , a horrible headache and body aches .
After 14 days , she was strong enough to get out of bed , but she says her strength did n't fully return for three months .
Petersen had a similar experience when he was stricken five years ago .
" I discovered I had West Nile virus because I am a long - distance runner , " he said .
" About halfway through one of my runs , I felt terrible .
Within a couple of hours , I was lying in bed with severe headaches , eye pain , muscle pain and fever , which lasted about a week .
I basically could n't get out of bed for a week . "
It was n't just Petersen who became sick , but his daughter and the neighbor were complaining of West Nile virus symptoms hours after being swarmed by mosquitoes at the mailbox .
A medical doctor , Petersen actually tested his own blood in the laboratory and diagnosed his own illness .
Do n't Miss Health Minute archive
Like Koma , he was sick for a couple of months .
His chief symptom : severe fatigue .
" I could barely walk up the stairs , " he said .
" This is not a mild illness , and people should try to avoid it . "
Petersen mentioned that some patients with West Nile virus can develop a severe neurological disease that can be fatal .
There is no effective treatment for the virus .
In more serious cases , the CDC recommends that patients be hospitalized so they can receive supportive care with intravenous fluids .
Researchers are working to develop a vaccine , but Petersen notes that it will be years before it is available to humans .
The best way to stop the spread of West Nile virus is through prevention , he said .
" Wear mosquito repellent , especially around dawn and dusk , which are peak mosquito biting times , " Petersen suggests .
He says bug sprays that contain concentrations of the chemical DEET up to 50 percent work the best .
Be sure to read the label or check with a doctor regarding the acceptable concentrations for children .
Spraying repellent that contains permethrin on clothing is another option .
Experts caution not to put the chemical directly on exposed skin .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : West Nile virus
Petersen added that a natural product such as oil of lemon eucalyptus CQ may also be effective .
The CDC says vitamin B and ultrasonic devices do not work in preventing mosquito bites .
Another way to reduce the risk of getting bitten by a mosquito is to get rid of standing bodies of water around the house , Petersen said .
" The mosquitoes that spread West Nile virus often breed around people 's homes in small containers like flower pots , rain barrels and bird baths , " he explained .
Even by taking precautions , Petersen concluded , the disease wo n't be eradicated in the U.S. anytime soon .
" I think West Nile virus is here to stay , and I can't tell you how many cases will occur this summer , but there will be epidemics . "

BY NORM DIXON
“ Throughout the world ... its agents , client states and satellites are on the defensive — on the moral defensive , the intellectual defensive , and the political and economic defensive .
Freedom movements arise and assert themselves .
They 're doing so on almost every continent populated by man — in the hills of Afghanistan , in Angola , in Kampuchea , in Central America ...
[ They are ] freedom fighters . ”
Is this a call to jihad ( holy war ) taken from one of Islamic fundamentalist Osama bin Laden 's notorious fatwas ?
Or perhaps a communique issued by the repressive Taliban regime in Kabul ?
In fact , this glowing praise of the murderous exploits of today 's supporters of arch - terrorist bin Laden and his Taliban collaborators , and their holy war against the “ evil empire ” , was issued by US President Ronald Reagan on March 8 , 1985 .
The “ evil empire ” was the Soviet Union , as well as Third World movements fighting US - backed colonialism , apartheid and dictatorship .
How things change .
In the aftermath of a series of terrorist atrocities — the most despicable being the mass murder of more than 6000 working people in New York and Washington on September 11 — bin Laden the “ freedom fighter ” is now lambasted by US leaders and the Western mass media as a “ terrorist mastermind ” and an “ evil - doer ” .
Yet the US government refuses to admit its central role in creating the vicious movement that spawned bin Laden , the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalist terrorists that plague Algeria and Egypt — and perhaps the disaster that befell New York .
The mass media has also downplayed the origins of bin Laden and his toxic brand of Islamic fundamentalism .
Mujaheddin
In April 1978 , the People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) seized power in Afghanistan in reaction to a crackdown against the party by that country 's repressive government .
The PDPA was committed to a radical land reform that favoured the peasants , trade union rights , an expansion of education and social services , equality for women and the separation of church and state .
The PDPA also supported strengthening Afghanistan 's relationship with the Soviet Union .
Such policies enraged the wealthy semi-feudal landlords , the Muslim religious establishment ( many mullahs were also big landlords ) and the tribal chiefs .
They immediately began organising resistance to the government 's progressive policies , under the guise of defending Islam .
Washington , fearing the spread of Soviet influence ( and worse the new government 's radical example ) to its allies in Pakistan , Iran and the Gulf states , immediately offered support to the Afghan mujaheddin , as the “ contra ” force was known .
Following an internal PDPA power struggle in December 1979 which toppled Afghanistan 's leader , thousands of Soviet troops entered the country to prevent the new government 's fall .
This only galvanised the disparate fundamentalist factions .
Their reactionary jihad now gained legitimacy as a “ national liberation ” struggle in the eyes of many Afghans .
The Soviet Union was eventually to withdraw from Afghanistan in 1989 and the mujaheddin captured the capital , Kabul , in 1992 .
Between 1978 and 1992 , the US government poured at least US $ 6 billion ( some estimates range as high as $ 20 billion ) worth of arms , training and funds to prop up the mujaheddin factions .
Other Western governments , as well as oil - rich Saudi Arabia , kicked in as much again .
Wealthy Arab fanatics , like Osama bin Laden , provided millions more .
Washington 's policy in Afghanistan was shaped by US President Jimmy Carter 's national security advisor , Zbigniew Brzezinski , and was continued by his successors .
His plan went far beyond simply forcing Soviet troops to withdraw ; rather it aimed to foster an international movement to spread Islamic fanaticism into the Muslim Central Asian Soviet republics to destabilise the Soviet Union .
Brzezinski's grand plan coincided with Pakistan military dictator General Zia ul - Haq 's own ambitions to dominate the region .
US - run Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe beamed Islamic fundamentalist tirades across Central Asia ( while paradoxically denouncing the “ Islamic revolution ” that toppled the pro-US Shah of Iran in 1979 ) .
Washington 's favoured mujaheddin faction was one of the most extreme , led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
The West 's distaste for terrorism did not apply to this unsavoury “ freedom fighter ” .
Hekmatyar was notorious in the 1970s for throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil .
After the mujaheddin took Kabul in 1992 , Hekmatyar 's forces rained US - supplied missiles and rockets on that city — killing at least 2000 civilians — until the new government agreed to give him the post of prime minister .
Osama bin Laden was a close associate of Hekmatyar and his faction .
Hekmatyar was also infamous for his side trade in the cultivation and trafficking in opium .
Backing of the mujaheddin from the CIA coincided with a boom in the drug business .
Within two years , the Afghanistan - Pakistan border was the world 's single largest source of heroin , supplying 60 % of US drug users .
In 1995 , the former director of the CIA 's operation in Afghanistan was unrepentant about the explosion in the flow of drugs : “ Our main mission was to do as much damage as possible to the Soviets ...
There was a fallout in terms of drugs , yes .
But the main objective was accomplished .
The Soviets left Afghanistan . ”
Made in the USA
According to Ahmed Rashid , a correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review , in 1986 CIA chief William Casey committed CIA support to a long - standing ISI proposal to recruit from around the world to join the Afghan jihad .
At least 100,000 Islamic militants flocked to Pakistan between 1982 and 1992 ( some 60,000 attended fundamentalist schools in Pakistan without necessarily taking part in the fighting ) .
John Cooley , a former journalist with the US ABC television network and author of Unholy Wars : Afghanistan , America and International Terrorism , has revealed that Muslims recruited in the US for the mujaheddin were sent to Camp Peary , the CIA 's spy training camp in Virginia , where young Afghans , Arabs from Egypt and Jordan , and even some African - American “ black Muslims ” were taught “ sabotage skills ” .
The November 1 , 1998 , British Independent reported that one of those charged with the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , Ali Mohammed , had trained “ bin Laden 's operatives ” in 1989 .
These “ operatives ” were recruited at the al Kifah Refugee Centre in Brooklyn , New York , given paramilitary training in the New York area and then sent to Afghanistan with US assistance to join Hekmatyar 's forces .
Mohammed was a member of the US army 's elite Green Berets .
The program , reported the Independent , was part of a Washington - approved plan called “ Operation Cyclone ” .
In Pakistan , recruits , money and equipment were distributed to the mujaheddin factions by an organisation known as Maktab al Khidamar ( Office of Services — MAK ) .
MAK was a front for Pakistan 's CIA , the Inter - Service Intelligence Directorate .
The ISI was the first recipient of the vast bulk of CIA and Saudi Arabian covert assistance for the Afghan contras .
Bin Laden was one of three people who ran MAK .
In 1989 , he took overall charge of MAK .

Among those trained by Mohammed were El Sayyid Nosair , who was jailed in 1995 for killing Israeli rightist Rabbi Meir Kahane and plotting with others to bomb New York landmarks , including the World Trade Center in 1993 .
The Independent also suggested that Shiekh Omar Abdel - Rahman , an Egyptian religious leader also jailed for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , was also part of Operation Cyclone .
He entered the US in 1990 with the CIA 's approval .
A confidential CIA report concluded that the agency was “ partly culpable ” for the 1993 World Trade Center blast , the Independent reported .
Bin Laden
Osama bin Laden , one of 20 sons of a billionaire construction magnate , arrived in Afghanistan to join the jihad in 1980 .
An austere religious fanatic and business tycoon , bin Laden specialised in recruiting , financing and training the estimated 35,000 non-Afghan mercenaries who joined the mujaheddin .
The bin Laden family is a prominent pillar of the Saudi Arabian ruling class , with close personal , financial and political ties to that country 's pro-US royal family .
Bin Laden senior was appointed Saudi Arabia 's minister of public works as a favour by King Faisal .
The new minister awarded his own construction companies lucrative contracts to rebuild Islam 's holiest mosques in Mecca and Medina .
In the process , the bin Laden family company in 1966 became the world 's largest private construction company .
Osama bin Laden 's father died in 1968 .
Until 1994 , he had access to the dividends from this ill - gotten business empire .
( Bin Laden junior 's oft - quoted personal fortune of US $ 200-300 million has been arrived at by the US State Department by dividing today 's value of the bin Laden family net worth — estimated to be US $ 5 billion — by the number of bin Laden senior 's sons .
A fact rarely mentioned is that in 1994 the bin Laden family disowned Osama and took control of his share . )
Osama 's military and business adventures in Afghanistan had the blessing of the bin Laden dynasty and the reactionary Saudi Arabian regime .
His close working relationship with MAK also meant that the CIA was fully aware of his activities .
Milt Bearden , the CIA 's station chief in Pakistan from 1986 to 1989 , admitted to the January 24 , 2000 , New Yorker that while he never personally met bin Laden , “ Did I know that he was out there ?
Yes , I did ... [ Guys like ] bin Laden were bringing $ 20 - $ 25 million a month from other Saudis and Gulf Arabs to underwrite the war .
And that is a lot of money .
It 's an extra $ 200 - $ 300 million a year .
And this is what bin Laden did . ”
In 1986 , bin Laden brought heavy construction equipment from Saudi Arabia to Afghanistan .
Using his extensive knowledge of construction techniques ( he has a degree in civil engineering ) , he built “ training camps ” , some dug deep into the sides of mountains , and built roads to reach them .
These camps , now dubbed “ terrorist universities ” by Washington , were built in collaboration with the ISI and the CIA .
The Afghan contra fighters , including the tens of thousands of mercenaries recruited and paid for by bin Laden , were armed by the CIA .
Pakistan , the US and Britain provided military trainers .
Tom Carew , a former British SAS soldier who secretly fought for the mujaheddin told the August 13 , 2000 , British Observer , “ The Americans were keen to teach the Afghans the techniques of urban terrorism — car bombing and so on — so that they could strike at the Russians in major towns ...
Many of them are now using their knowledge and expertise to wage war on everything they hate . ”
Al Qaeda ( the Base ) , bin Laden 's organisation , was established in 1987 - 88 to run the camps and other business enterprises .
It is a tightly - run capitalist holding company — albeit one that integrates the operations of a mercenary force and related logistical services with “ legitimate ” business operations .
Bin Laden has simply continued to do the job he was asked to do in Afghanistan during the 1980s — fund , feed and train mercenaries .
All that has changed is his primary customer .
Then it was the ISI and , behind the scenes , the CIA .
Today , his services are utilised primarily by the reactionary Taliban regime .
Bin Laden only became a “ terrorist ” in US eyes when he fell out with the Saudi royal family over its decision to allow more than 540,000 US troops to be stationed on Saudi soil following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .
When thousands of US troops remained in Saudi Arabia after the end of the Gulf War , bin Laden 's anger turned to outright opposition .
He declared that Saudi Arabia and other regimes — such as Egypt — in the Middle East were puppets of the US , just as the PDPA government of Afghanistan had been a puppet of the Soviet Union .
He called for the overthrow of these client regimes and declared it the duty of all Muslims to drive the US out of the Gulf states .
In 1994 , he was stripped of his Saudi citizenship and forced to leave the country .
His assets there were frozen .
After a period in Sudan , he returned to Afghanistan in May 1996 .
He refurbished the camps he had helped build during the Afghan war and offered the facilities and services — and thousands of his mercenaries — to the Taliban , which took power that September .
Today , bin Laden 's private army of non-Afghan religious fanatics is a key prop of the Taliban regime .
Prior to the devastating September 11 attack on the twin towers of World Trade Center , US ruling - class figures remained unrepentant about the consequences of their dirty deals with the likes of bin Laden , Hekmatyar and the Taliban .
Since the awful attack , they have been downright hypocritical .
In an August 28 , 1998 , report posted on MSNBC , Michael Moran quotes Senator Orrin Hatch , who was a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee which approved US dealings with the mujaheddin , as saying he would make “ the same call again ” , even knowing what bin Laden would become .
“ It was worth it .
Those were very important , pivotal matters that played an important role in the downfall of the Soviet Union . ”
Hatch today is one of the most gung - ho voices demanding military retaliation .
Another face that has appeared repeatedly on television screens since the attack has been Vincent Cannistraro , described as a former CIA chief of “ counter - terrorism operations ” .
Cannistraro is certainly an expert on terrorists like bin Laden , because he directed their “ work ” .
He was in charge of the CIA - backed Nicaraguan contras during the early 1980s .
In 1984 , he became the supervisor of covert aid to the Afghan mujaheddin for the US National Security Council .
The last word goes to Zbigniew Brzezinski : “ What was more important in the world view of history ?
The Taliban or the fall of the Soviet Empire ?
A few stirred up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War ? ”
Director Spike Lee has waded into the ongoing controversy surrounding Jeremiah Wright , the Chicago pastor whose provocative statements have proved a thorn in the side of Democrat frontrunner Barack Obama .
Lee advises the preacher to do the right thing and keep quiet .
" The more he opens his mouth , the more damage he does , " he told the Guardian yesterday .
For good measure , Lee hinted at a political conspiracy behind Wright 's recent , contentious attempts to justify his remarks .
" It looks like he 's being paid to keep talking , " he said .
Wright has attracted criticism for sermons in which he invited God to " damn America " and claimed the US was " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today " .
This has prompted renewed media scrutiny of Obama 's own views .
The Illinois senator was a long - term member of the pastor 's church .
Wright officiated at Obama 's wedding and at the baptism of his two children .
While Obama has attempted to distance himself from the pastor 's views , the row shows little signs of dying down .
Wright was accused of upping the ante earlier this week , telling a press conference that media attacks on him were also an attack on African - American church culture and warning Obama , " I 'm coming after you . "
" Jeremiah Wight needs to be quiet , " Lee said yesterday .
" If he loves Obama he needs to shut up right now .
It makes me question his motives for talking .
I 'm starting to wonder whether somebody has been contributing to the building funds of his church .
Seriously . "
Lee , whose best - known films have frequently tackled the issue of race relations in the US , believes that Obama had hoped to survive the presidential contest without talking about race .
" But now he 's been forced to - by a combination of Jeremiah Wright and the Clintons , " he said .
The director of Malcolm X and When the Levees Broke is an ardent Obama supporter .
" I love him , " he said .
" He 's a unifier .
He 's the one who can get us out of the situation we 're in today , because this country is going to hell in a handcart . "
Lee will be at the Cannes film festival next week as jury president of the Babelgum online film festival .
He will also be promoting his latest feature , Miracle at St Anna , a story of black American soldiers in the second world war .
He compares America 's international standing now with its high water mark in the mid-1940s .
" The way the US is viewed around the world is at its lowest point ever , " he claimed .
" But Obama will change everything . "
STAPLES HUGHES , a North Carolina lawyer , was on the witness stand and about to disclose a secret he believed would free an innocent man from prison .
But the judge told Mr. Hughes to stop .
“ If you testify , ” Judge Jack A. Thompson said at a hearing last year on the prisoner ’s request for a new trial , “ I will be compelled to report you to the state bar .
Do you understand that ? ”
But Mr. Hughes continued .
Twenty - two years before , he said , a client , now dead , confessed that he had acted alone in committing a double murder for which another man was also serving life .
After his own imprisoned client died , Mr. Hughes recalled last week , “ it seemed to me at that point ethically permissible and morally imperative that I spill the beans . ”
Judge Thompson , of the Cumberland County Superior Court in Fayetteville , did not see it that way , and some experts in legal ethics agree with him .
The obligation to keep a client ’s secrets is so important , they say , that it survives death and may not be violated even to cure a grave injustice  for example , the imprisonment for 26 years of another man , in Illinois , who was freed just last month .

McCain Makes Stuff Up
For years now , the U.S. political press corps has traveled with John McCain on his “ Straight Talk Express , ” buying into his image as a paragon of truth - telling .
But the real truth is that McCain routinely makes stuff up , as he did on June 11 in lying about Barack Obama ’s “ bitter ” comment .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly During a political talk in Philadelphia , McCain claimed that Obama had described “ bitter ” small - town voters as clinging to religion or “ the Constitution ” – when the second item in Obama ’s comment actually was “ guns . ”
But the Arizona senator did n’t stop with a simple word substitution .
He added that he will tell these voters that “ they have trust and support the Constitution of the United States because they have optimism and hope . …
That ’s what America ’s all about . ”
In other words , McCain did n’t just make a slip of the tongue .
He willfully accused Obama of disparaging the U.S. Constitution , a very serious point that , if true , might cause millions of Americans to reject Obama ’s candidacy .
Still , when some of the U.S. broadcast networks – including NBC evening news – played the clip of McCain lashing out at Obama ’s purported dissing of the Constitution , they did n’t correct McCain 's falsehood .
That fits with a long - standing pattern of the political press corps giving McCain a break when he makes statements at variance with the truth .
Even in the rare moments when he is caught in an inaccuracy – such as accusing Shiite - ruled Iran of training Sunni extremists in al - Qaeda – the falsehood is minimized as an unintentional gaffe .
However , McCain actually seems to be following a trail blazed by George W. Bush , saying what ’s useful at the time even if it ’s not true and then counting on the U.S. press corps to timidly look the other way .
[ For details on Bush , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Through all his misstatements , McCain ’s “ straight - talk ” reputation survives .
Sweeping Denials
In another instructive case , McCain got away with sweeping denials in his reaction to a New York Times article on Feb. 21 .
The story led with unsubstantiated suspicions among some McCain staffers that their boss had gotten too cozy with female lobbyist Vicky Iseman , but McCain went beyond simply denying any sexual improprieties .
He put out a statement declaring that in his quarter - century congressional career , he “ has never violated the public trust , never done favors for special interests or lobbyists . ”
But that simply is n’t true .
As the Times story already had recalled , McCain helped one of his early financial backers , wheeler - dealer Charles Keating , frustrate oversight from federal banking regulators who were examining Keating ’s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association .
At Keating 's urging , McCain wrote letters , introduced bills and pushed a Keating associate for a job on a banking regulatory board .
In 1987 , McCain joined several other senators in two private meetings with federal banking regulators on Keating ’s behalf .
Two years later , Lincoln collapsed , costing the U.S. taxpayers $ 3.4 billion .
Keating eventually went to prison and three other senators from the so - called Keating Five saw their political careers ruined .
McCain drew a Senate reprimand for his involvement and later lamented his faulty judgment .
“ Why did n’t I fully grasp the unusual appearance of such a meeting ? ” he wrote in his 2002 memoir , Worth the Fighting For .
But some people close to the case thought McCain got off too easy .
Not only was McCain taking donations from Keating and his business circle , getting free rides on Keating ’s corporate jet and enjoying joint vacations in the Bahamas – McCain ’s second wife , the beer fortune heiress Cindy Hensley , had invested with Keating in an Arizona shopping mall .
In the years that followed , however , McCain not only got out from under the shadow of the Keating Five scandal but found a silver lining in the cloud , transforming the case into a lessons - learned chapter of his personal narrative .
McCain , as born - again reformer , soon was winning over the Washington press corps with his sponsorship of ethics legislation , like the McCain - Feingold bill limiting “ soft money ” contributions to the political parties .
However , there was still that other side of John McCain as he wielded enormous power from his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , which helped him solicit campaign donations from corporations doing business before the panel .
The Times story reported that McCain did favors on behalf of Iseman ’s lobbying clients , including two letters that McCain wrote in 1999 to the Federal Communications Commission demanding that it act on a long - delayed request by Iseman ’s client , Florida - based Paxson Communications , to buy a Pittsburgh television station .
Rather than simply acknowledge this fact , McCain ’s campaign issued another sweeping denial of impropriety , calling those letters routine correspondence that were handled by staff without McCain meeting either with Paxson or anyone from Iseman ’s firm , Alcalde & Fay .
" No representative of Paxson or Alcalde & Fay personally asked Senator McCain to send a letter to the FCC , " his campaign said .
McCain ’s Own Words
But that also turned out not to be true .
Newsweek ’s investigative reporter Michael Isikoff dug up a sworn deposition from Sept. 25 , 2002 , in which McCain himself declared that “ I was contacted by Mr. Paxson on this issue . …
He wanted their [ the FCC ’s ] approval very bad for purposes of his business .
I believe that Mr. Paxson had a legitimate complaint . ”
Though McCain claimed not to recall whether he had spoken with Paxson ’s lobbyist [ presumably a reference to Iseman ] , he added , “ I ’m sure I spoke to [ Paxson ] , ” according to the deposition .
[ See Newsweek ’s Web posting , Feb. 22 , 2008 ] McCain ’s letters to the FCC , which Chairman William Kennard criticized as “ highly unusual , ” came in the same period when Paxson ’s company was ferrying McCain to political events aboard its corporate jet and donating $ 20,000 to his campaign .
After the Feb. 21 Times article appeared , McCain ’s spokesmen confirmed that Iseman accompanied McCain on at least one of those flights from Florida to Washington , though McCain had said in the 2002 deposition that “ I do not recall ” if Paxson ’s lobbyist was onboard .
First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams , who conducted the deposition in connection with a challenge to the McCain - Feingold law , asked McCain if the benefits that he received from Paxson created “ at least an appearance of corruption here ? ”
“ Absolutely , ” McCain answered .
“ I believe that there could possibly be an appearance of corruption because this system has tainted all of us . ”
When Newsweek went to McCain ’s 2008 campaign with the seeming contradictions between the deposition and the denial of the Times article , McCain ’s people stuck to their story that that the senator had never discussed the FCC issue with Paxson or his lobbyist .
“ We do not think there is a contradiction here , ” campaign spokeswoman Ann Begeman told Newsweek .
“ It appears that Senator McCain , when speaking of being contacted by Paxson , was speaking in shorthand of his staff being contacted by representatives of Paxson .
Senator McCain does not recall being asked directly by Paxson or any representative of him or by Alcalde & Fay to contact the FCC regarding the Pittsburgh license transaction . ”
That new denial crumbled , too , when the Washington Post interviewed Paxson , who said he had talked with McCain in his Washington office several weeks before McCain sent the letters to the FCC .
The broadcast executive also believed that Iseman had helped arrange the meeting and likely was in attendance .
“ Was Vicki there ?
Probably , ” Paxson said .
[ Washington Post , Feb. 23 , 2008 ]
So , in the months ahead , there ’s urgency for American voters to figure out whether John McCain is the maverick “ straight - shooter ” of his usual press clippings or a sanctimonious phony who ’s just masquerading as the guy who tells it like it is .
Is John McCain like George W. Bush , someone who has learned that the mainstream news media – ever sensitive to accusations of “ liberal bias ” – is hesitant to call a prominent Republican politician a liar , regardless of the facts and the circumstances ?
In this political / media climate , McCain appears to believe he can get away with falsifying key details of something even as heavily reported as Obama ’s infamous “ bitter ” remark .

Greg Costikyan has already said more enlightening things about story and games than I could ever hope to .
http://www.costik.com/gamnstry.html
But I 'll share my thoughts anyhow .
My thoughts on the matter have changed over the years .
When I was a teenager I immediately noticed a difference between games that did n't have stories and games that did - with an endless just - gets - harder game like Defender , you get bored at some arbitrary point and quit playing .
With a game that had even a rudimentary story , say a game like Karateka , the stop - playing point came at the conclusion of the story .
And that was just more satisfying than quitting a game because I was bored or frustrated .
The conclusion ?
Games should have stories , to motivate the player to keep playing .
When playing games I rarely gave a crap about my ' score ' - I just wanted to get to the next level or get to the end .
( No leaderboard servers with your friends ' list highlighted in the 1980s ... )
But that was the problem , right ?
You get to the end of the story and you 're done for a different reason .
The ideal , it seemed to me , would be a game that could generate infinite stories .
I imagined something like * Fable * was supposed to be , the * Fable * that never was , a rich interactive world where story would just happen because of the interactions of intelligent characters .
I did n't stop to think that we already have that , and it 's called " life " , and those storytelling moments , those moments that are worth retelling , they are oh so very rare .
I 've spent a fair amount of time trying to prototype this imaginary game , and what I ended up with was like a fantasy version of * Space Rangers 2 : Attack of the Dominators * , except with relationships .
And whenever I showed it to someone I could n't help but notice that they were underwhelmed .
The final nail in the coffin was discovering * Space Rangers 2 * , which was like seeing my own game with fresh eyes and realizing it just was n't fun .
My prototype was n't much of a storytelling engine either , for that matter .
So I said to myself , " Forget story , let 's just turn this prototype into a fun game . "
And suddenly , boom .
There it is .
Something fun .
( For me , anyway . )
So let 's call that Exhibit A .
Something I asked myself recently was , " What games have stories that were so compelling I 'd want to read the novelization or just watch all the story - moments ( cutscenes etc ) back to back without actually playing it ? "
I can't think of any .
The best I can come up with is there are a handful of games - with - stories which would be impossible to tell as just stories - Bioshock , for one .
Portal .
Soul Reaver , although Soul Reaver had the arrogance to end halfway through with an Empire Strikes Back ending as if it was a sure thing I 'd come back to it for the sequel .
I did , eventually , I think , but by that time I had long since stopped caring so I never did make it to the end of the story .
Let 's call that Exhibit B .
Lately I 've been playing D&D with guys who are firmly in the gamist wedge of the narrativist - gamist - simulationist pie .
I used to think roleplaying games were for ... well , roleplaying .
And storytelling .
And although I had noticed that the times I used roleplaying as an outlet for my frustrated writer 's syndrome were never as satisfying as those times when I was playing some off - the - shelf module or a generic dungeon crawl , I had n't yet drawn the conclusion that storytelling games just are n't that enjoyable for me .
It was n't until , now , playing with these guys that I realize truly that I 'm having more fun moving around the miniatures , rolling dice , and making tactical choices than I ever had playacting a barbarian with a hokey irish accent or playing Universalis .
The real eye - opener was when we took a break from D&D to play various board games like Descent and Hero's Quest - I used to think that these sorts of games , these RPG's without the roleplaying , got it all wrong , " That 's not what RPG's are supposed to be about , " and here I am discovering that they can actually be more fun to play than D&D on a slow night .
So that 's Exhibit C .
When playing almost any game these days I have " story filters " active .
" Just tell me where to go and who to kill and what object to retrieve . "
Some games make it particularly easy by highlighting quest words in the dialog trees .
Others let you button - mash through the dialog trees and it's ok because they 'll pop a quest on your quest list and an arrow for where to go on your HUD .
And you might say , " Sure , but that 's because most games have bad stories . "
But I 'm also talking about some critically acclaimed games where the stories were allegedly excellent .
Exhibit D .
So , over the last 20 years or so I 've gone from " games are a fantastic new storytelling medium " to " Stories just are n't fun .
If you must have story in your game , please keep it to a minimum , and ideally something like * Ico * where you do n't even need any dialog to get it across . "
What really motivates me to get to the conclusions of these games with stories ?
Now I think it has very little to do with wanting to find out how the story ends , but rather it 's coincidental - it 's partly the completionist tendency to want to color in the box completely , clear the pacman maze - and partly because that 's when you get to the end of the game 's content .
The holy grail for me now would n't be the game that can create infinite story - but a game that could procedurally generate infinite interesting content .
Band / artist history
Born in 1959 in Ekaterinburg ( Northern Ural ) , Andrey Vinogradov has studied and been exposed to a variety of musical genres , everything from classical jazz to jazz - rock .
He has now settled down in folky niche , where he creates his classic but unique blend of sounds .
He graduated with highest honors from the Moscow Gnessin Music College and completed his education at Gnessin Academy of Music .
Later , as part of well - known Russian jazz - rock group The Arsenal , directed by revered saxophonist Alexei Kozlov , he recorded two LPs , The Second Wind and Pulse 3 , which were later released on the CDs Time - scorched III and Time - scorched IV ( 1997 -1998 ) .
Ever since his youth , Andrey 's goal has been to create innovative unions between the most diverse of musical genres by combining elements of classical , jazz and folk music .
In 1996 he composed a series of songs to the verses of Russian modernist poets Soloviov , Blok , Voloshin , and Akhmatova among others .
The result was a CD entitled Dryad 's Songs featuring the vocals of Galina Lipina and Ivan Smirnov 's guitar playing .
Since Andrey became interested in Russian traditional folklore , he has restored a lot of unique recordings of anonymous rustic musicians .
The immersion into the depths of the Russian traditional music culture inspired him for an attempt to blend the authentic folklore samples into keyboard - driven electronic - based ambient textures in the Sokol project .
In the CD Iliya Murometz Andrey combines old Russian tunes into neo-traditional compositions , drawing new life from ancient tones .
Here he appears both as an arranger and performer of Russian traditional folk tunes , playing rylia ( Russian hurdy - gurdy traditionally used by strolling beggars ) .
In 2003 Ethnomirages project was created .
It is penetrated with various musical intonations : Arabian , Turkish , Tuvinian as well as Serbian , Celtic and Armenian threaded into modern ethno - techno tissue .
The project Daylight Breath - several preludes for piano & strings - was inspired by Andrey 's Scandinavian journey in 2005 .
Its music is both fascinating and soothing .
The latest project Russian Hurdy - Gurdy Tunes is dedicated to kolesnaya lyra ( organistrum , hurdy - gurdy ) - an old musical instrument used by strolling beggars throughout Ukraine , Byelorussia and some regions of Russia .
This project containes traditional tunes , songs , and sacred chants from various regions of Russia , arranged and performed by Andrey Vinogradov ( voice & hurdy - gurdy ) .

An example of World War 2 " kills " on a fighter plane .
A former US Army tank driver asserts that two figures depicted on the side of an APC SWAT tank that was recently used to protect cops from the deadly threat of women and children during the raid of a West Texas polygamist retreat actually represents the amount of people killed by police .
Gary Roberts , a veteran Army tank driver in the 80’s , relates to us the fact that the two figures etched into the side of the US M113 Armored Personnel Carrier denote " kills , " as in how many people the SWAT unit has killed .
The other image appears to depict a vehicle , according to Roberts .
A close - up of the image on the APC .
Roberts appeared on The Alex Jones Show today to confirm the fact that Midland County police are apparently so proud of the people they have murdered , they feel the need to emblazon it on the side of their souped - up tank .
Bragging about how many victims a militarized police unit has claimed sounds like a story out of Maoist China or a Communist dictatorship like Zimbabwe , but it ’s happening right here in America .
As the Associated Press reported at the time , " Police wore body armor , sported automatic weapons and were backed by an armored personnel carrier for a raid on a West Texas polygamist retreat . "
" A sect member whose wife shot the video said sect members got the impression that state officials " were doing something more than they said they were going to do . "
The man declined to give his name for fear that speaking out would cause problems for his children , who are in state custody , " according to the report .

Like I said before , getting your email protected is a two - step process .
First , we have to get GPG installed on our operating system .
Getting Gmail set up is on the next step .
I got GPG working on Mac OS X without too much trouble .
I used the instructions and downloads at http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/ and summarized the process below .
If you 're on OS X , open that link in another window and get ready .
For other operating systems , you can check the links on http://www.gnupg.org/download/.
Now , start downloading and installing !
I 've adapted the information from the Mac GPG FAQ , so you can also go there for more details .
Here are the things I downloaded ( you should got to the downloads page and get the latest ) :
First , open the DMG for GPG that you downloaded and run the installer .
I just used all the defaults .
This is the actual encryption engine that everything else runs on .
Once the installation is complete , open a Terminal window and type gpg , then hit [ Return ] .
My installation gave me a " Go ahead and type your message ... " which I think means that GPG was up and running , so I ctrl - C'd out of that and closed the Terminal window .
Next , I installed GPG Preferences .
That put a GPG icon in my System Preferences pane ; I did n't change anything .
Finally , I installed GPG Keychain Access .
This was easy : just unzip the ZIP file and drag the application into your Applications folder .
By the way , you can also do all of this from the command line .
Here 's a great tutorial for that Next up : Set up Gmail and start sending seeekrit messages !
Mr. Redleaf bought several large grain elevator complexes from ConAgra and Cargill last year for a long - term stake in what he sees as a high - growth business .
The elevators can store 36 million bushels of grain .

Credit ... Ben Garvin for The New York Times
“ We discovered that our lease customers , major food company types , are really happy to see us , because they are apt to see Cargill and ConAgra as competitors , ” he said .
The executives making such bets say that fears about their new role are unfounded , and that their investments will be a plus for farming and , ultimately , for consumers .
“ The world is asking for more food , more energy .
You see a huge demand , ” said Axel Hinsch , chief executive of Calyx Agro , a division of the giant Louis Dreyfus Commodities , which is buying tens of thousands of acres of cropland in Brazil with the backing of big institutional investors , including AIG Investments .
“ What this new investment will buy is more technology , ” Mr. Hinsch said .
“ We will be helping to accelerate the development of infrastructure , and the consumer will benefit because there will be more supply . ”
Financial investors also can provide grain elevator operators the money they need to weather today ’s more volatile commodity markets .
When wild swings in prices become common , as they are now , elevator operators have to put up more cash to lock in future prices .
John Duryea , co-portfolio manager of the Ospraie Special Opportunity Fund , is buying 66 grain elevators with a total capacity of 110 million bushels from ConAgra for $ 2.1 billion .
The deal , expected to close by the end of June , also will give Ospraie a stake in 57 fertilizer distribution centers and the barges and ships necessary to keep them supplied with low - cost imports .
Maintaining these essential services “ helps bring costs down to the farmers , ” Mr. Duryea said .
“ That has to help mitigate the price increases for crops . ”
First British woman killed in Afghanistan as four soldiers die in secret SAS mission
The first British woman was killed in action in Afghanistan in a blast that also claimed the lives of three other soldiers .
They were taking part in an operation east of Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province when their vehicle was caught in an explosion at about 3.40 pm local time yesterday .
Three of the soldiers were killed in the blast , while the fourth was pronounced dead on arrival at Camp Bastion , the Ministry of Defence said .
They are reported to have been travelling in a snatch Land Rover , which has been criticised for not offering enough protection against roadside devices .
At risk : British soldiers with the International Security Assistance Force are seen at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the city of Kandarhar today
It is understood that the three men were special forces reservists from the 23rd Special Air Service Regiment , which is one of two Territorial Army SAS units .
The woman is believed to have been part of the Army 's Intelligence Corps .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed his ' deepest condolences ' to the families of the four soldiers .
He said : ' They were in the most dangerous of jobs in the most difficult of circumstances .
' I salute not just their bravery , dedication and professionalism but that of all our armed forces .
Our troops are the best in the world and fighting for the noblest of causes . '
A fifth soldier wounded in the attack is said to be in a stable condition .
Nine British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan in nine days , marking a sharp upturn in violence against troops in the troubled country .
Five men from 2 Para , based in Colchester , Essex , died in two separate incidents last week .
Controversial : Snatch Land Rovers are vulnerable to roadside bombs
By contrast , the total death toll for British forces between January and May was 11 .
Yesterday 's incident was the biggest single loss of life for British troops since September 2006 , when 14 personnel were killed when an RAF Nimrod came down near Kandahar .
The deaths take the number of British service personnel who have died in Afghanistan since the start of operations in November 2001 to 106 .
Military leaders and analysts had suggested the tide could be turning in the battle against the Taliban before the recent deaths .
Brigadier Mark Carleton - Smith , the commander of British forces in Helmand , claimed that the fight against insurgents was at a ' tipping point ' .
He said : ' The Taliban are much weaker .
The tide is clearly ebbing , not flowing , for them .
Their chain of command is disrupted and they are short of weapons and ammunition . '
Defence Secretary Des Browne announced on Monday that hundreds more British personnel would be deployed to Afghanistan , taking troop numbers to a record high of 8,030 by next spring .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband today praised the ' extraordinary professionalism , bravery and intelligence ' of Britain 's armed forces .
He said : ' We are in Afghanistan , where there are soldiers , diplomats or aid workers , with a very clear mission to make sure that Afghanistan has its own institution and its own security forces that ensure never again does it become a base for al Qaeda .
' So we are there with a very clear national interest . '

Private Charles David Murray ( left ) , Private Nathan Cuthbertson ( centre ) and Private Daniel Gamble of 2nd Battalion , were among five paratropers killed in Afghanistan last week
Brigadier General Carlos Branco , a spokesman for the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan , said : ' Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with the family and friends of the brave soldiers who were killed today .
' These soldiers died and were wounded trying to help bring peace and security for the Afghan people . '
News of the four deaths came as Afghan and Canadian troops launched an operation to drive Taliban militants out of villages in southern Afghanistan .
Afghan officials said yesterday that 300 to 400 insurgents were operating in the Arghandab region to the north west of Kandahar city .
Nato spokesman Mark Laity said troops exchanged fire with militants during ' a few minor contacts ' early today but there were no immediate reports of casualties .
The Taliban launched their attack on Arghandab three days after freeing 400 of their fighters from Sarposa Prison in Kandahar in a co-ordinated raid .

Mr Browne denied claims that British troops in Afghanistan could start ' losing heart ' after the recent surge in casualties .
He said : ' The military are the people who most understand how important this job is .
They have a tremendous and appropriate sense of pride in what they are doing .
' The last 10 days have been extraordinarily difficult for troops , for the families and for those who support them .
We have now lost nine soldiers in 10 days and every single one of those losses is a tragedy .
I cannot imagine the terrible grief they are going through . '
Sending his condolences to the family , he added : ' This is n't a discretionary task .
When the world met in Paris a few days ago there were 80 countries represented .
They are all involved in one way or another because we cannot allow this country to become a playground for terrorists again .

He added : ' I fully understand that people react in an entirely appropriate and human way to casualties and I 'm no different than anyone else .
I have the same response to that .'
A leading security expert claimed more British troops are being killed in Afghanistan because forces ' failed to get the job done ' before the attacks on Iraq .
Paul Rogers , author of a series of books on the war on terror , claimed the Taliban are getting stronger than they have been since the war began .
He claimed the only end to violence would be to open negotiations with less radical members of the militant group .
' That would be downright impossible under a ( George ) Bush administration , ' he added .
Professor Rogers , from the University of Bradford , said the Taliban are resurgent because Europe and the United States have been distracted by Iraq .
He said : ' Clearly there has been a real upsurge recently .
But the worst thing of all is that this was anticipated .
' The Taliban are stronger than they have been for years - borders with western Pakistan are very loose , they have more money and , most importantly , they have taken full advantage while US and European forces have been distracted by Iraq .
' For the first time in five or six years there are more coalition forces being killed in Afghanistan than Iraq .
' This is simply because the job did not get done .
Afghanistan did not get the help it needed five or six years ago and then the US and Britain took their eyes off the ball . '
He added : ' Almost all colonial wars have only been ended through compromise - and Afghanistan will prove no different .
' I do n't believe that will ever happen under a Bush government which sees only military action as the answer .
I can only see more and more deaths in the short term . '

Many parents wonder ...
How can I introduce knives to my child safely ?
This guide will help do exactly that by providing safety guidelines and some everyday examples of those guidelines being put to good use .
Modeling Good Behavior
The first rule in teaching knife safety , of course , is to practice safe knife usage yourself .
Note how , in the following video , this Mom is showing her kids , up close and personal , how to properly grip and toss a set of throwing knives .
Had she checked in with OnlyKnives first , she might 've chosen a different weapon of choice .
Probably best that she did n't .
Keeping the Knife Out of Harm's Way
Once you 've decided your child is ready to handle a knife , one of the most important rules of knife safety is to make sure the blade is kept safely away from other people .
In this next video , Dad shows his son how to wield a Samurai sword to slice a watermelon clean in half .
Note how the child is observing three important rules of knife safety :
Always keep your eye on the blade to make it remains safely out of harm 's way Always have an adult nearby to supervise Ensure the knife has full clearance from other people throughout its entire range of motion
Knives Are Not Toys
Your child must learn that knives are to be taken seriously .
Knives are not toys to be tossed around carelessly .
The knife owner should have full concentration on the blade at all times .
Note how , in the following example , this fine young knife student is wielding three knives simultaneously while still managing to maintain correct posture , technique and concentration .
Safe Knife Choices
Should you feel your child is ready to own his own knife , do some research to figure out which blade might be best .
The ' Kfitzi ' is an Israeli model that has been marketed for kids .
It might be just the right choice .
Check out the following video from the Kfitzi makers themselves :
Goals
If you follow the rules above , you may find your child can grow up to have a lifelong appreciation for knives and to respect the safety hazard they can be .
With a little luck , you may find your child can accomplish some amazing feats with these tools .
The boy in this final video displays his skills in a martial arts competition -- no doubt a reflection of the responsible parenting provided him .

This eRoadster does n't even pretend to care about golfing needs , going instead for the " neighborhood vehicle " approach .
Depending on the gear ratio , this cart can achieve a top - speed of 45 mph and a range between 25 and 45 miles ( though likely not simultaneously ) .
While there 's no enjoyable exhaust note , there 's also no exhaust smell ... because there is no exhaust .
At just $ 5,950 over the cost of a new cart , it 's still cheaper than most new electric cars .

Three strategic virtualization initiatives were the stars of the show as Linux powerhouse Red Hat opened its Red Hat Summit today in Boston .
What do the Red Hat moves mean to you ?
More options in open source virtualization tools and a new open source effort around virtualization security , for starters .
The Red Hat move that will catch the eye of most users is the Embedded Linux Hypervisor , oVirt .
This is a lightweight , embeddable hypervisor that currently lets you run Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows VMs ( virtual machines ) on Linux .
What makes this more interesting than just another virtualization announcement : you will be able to carry oVirt - customized VMs from PC to server to what - have - you in your pocket on a USB key drive , Red Hat says .
The open - source oVirt hypervisor , now available as a beta , is based on the KVM project .
KVM , in turn , has been an integral part of the Linux kernel since February , 2007 .
In other words , this is not pie - in - the - sky technology .
It 's founded on existing virtualization technologies .
At this point , followers and users of Red Hat Linux may be asking , " What about Xen ? " ( the best - known open - source hypervisor technology to date . )
Red Hat , according to Red Hat executive VP Paul Cormier , will continue to support both Xen and KVM .
But , because " KVM is now baked in to the Linux kernel , it 's very easy for both Red Hat and other developers to work with it , " Cormier says .
For the time being , Xen will continue to be important , but , as time goes by , Red Hat sees KVM becoming the dominant virtualization technology , he says .
The key difference : while Xen works well with Linux , it 's an add - on .
KVM , on the other hand , is an integral part of Linux .
For now , Xen is the more mature of the technologies , but KVM is coming on fast and promises to be more useful for developers , Red Hat is betting .
At the end of the day , Red Hat sees KVM - based Linux distributions replacing operating system distributions , which do n't incorporate virtualization .
In tomorrow 's Linux , Red Hat sees virtualization becoming simply another standard operating system feature .
While the idea of keeping a selection of virtual machines in your pocket is entertaining , Red Hat 's Virtual Infrastructure Management technology is more likely to grab a CIO 's attention .
This set of management technologies for x86 - based Xen and KVM virtualization programs is also available at the oVirt Web site as a beta .
Red
Hat claims that this architecture enables customers to implement cloud , Software as a Service ( SaaS ) , appliance and traditional server infrastructures across one management platform .
Last , but in the long run perhaps the most important of Red Hat 's new virtualization developments : Red Hat is offering virtualization security management technologies .
In the rush to cut data center costs with virtualization , it 's only recently that some CIOs have become painfully aware that they needed management and security tools for their 21st century virtual servers .
Red Hat 's new work in virtualization security is perhaps the least mature of the trio of technologies .
Still , Red Hat is working to make it possible for administrators to manage identity and policy , while simultaneously auditing system resources and application integrity .
Want to know more about this project ?
Check into Red Hat 's newly launched FreeIPA project site .
Red
Hat will be more than happy to have open source community help in creating open - source solutions that could benefit every company that 's packing more and more work into fewer and fewer physical servers .
Looking ahead , Stephen O'Grady , principal analyst with the open - source analysis company RedMonk says , " Much as it has in the operating system and relational database markets , open source is poised to have a disruptive impact on the virtualization space , lowering costs for customers and offering alternatives to proprietary lock - in . "
Based on its announcements today , Red Hat intends to be a player in that disruption .

Drummers are usually credited more for their creative skills than for being brain boxes .
But new research turns that theory on its head - suggesting that those with good rhythm , such as Beatle Ringo Starr , may also be the most intellectual .
The study found that intelligence and good rhythm go hand in hand , after those who performed best at a " drumming " task were also found to have scored the highest in intelligence tests .
Swedish researchers were astonished by the results , as the first task - which involved tapping a drumstick to time - did not require any problem - solving skills .

Ringo Starr in his heyday : Intelligence and rhythm go together , according to research
But Fredrik Ullen , from leading European university the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm , concluded that the study showed a link between intelligence , good timing , and the part of the brain used for problem - solving .
" The rhythmic accuracy in brain activity that is observed when a person maintains a steady beat is also important to the problem - solving capacities measured with the intelligence tests , " he explained .
" It is interesting as the task did n't involve any kind of problem - solving . "
For the study , 34 right - handed men aged between 19 and 49 who were recruited randomly via a newspaper advertisement .
They were first asked to tap a drum stick at variety of different time intervals as accurately as possible .
Secondly , they were asked to complete a " psychometric test " consisting of 60 questions and problems .
When the results were analysed , it was found that the participants who tapped the drumstick with the most accuracy also achieved the highest scores in the intelligence test .
Prof Ullen , who led the study with Guy Madison at Sweden 's Umea University , said the study showed a correlation between high intelligence , an ability to keep good time , and a high volume of " white matter " in the part of the brain linked to planning and managing time .
" We found that people with high general intelligence are also more stable on a very simple timing task , " he said .
" We also found that these participants had larger volume of the white matter in the brain , which contains connections between brain regions . "
John Jenkins , emeritus professor at the University of London , has previously claimed that listening to music by Mozart , which features sound waves repeated regularly in a particular pattern but not close together , can boost children 's powers of intelligence .
Eight years ago , the Education Department went so far as to say listening to the music could help reduce social problems such as teenage pregnancies and drug abuse .
Scans of the brain have also shown that the brain uses a wide distribution of areas to listen to music .
The left side tends to process rhythm and pitch and the right looks after timbre and melody .
With the recent talk of JavaScript 1.9 there ’s been some confusion as to what exactly that version means – especially in relation to other browsers .
Here ’s a quick breakdown :
IE 6 - 7 support JScript 5 ( which is equivalent to ECMAScript 3 , JavaScript 1.5 )
IE 8 supports JScript 6 ( which is equivalent to ECMAScript 3 , JavaScript 1.5 – more bug fixes over JScript 5 )
Firefox 1.0 supports JavaScript 1.5 ( ECMAScript 3 equivalent )
Firefox 1.5 supports JavaScript 1.6 ( 1.5 + Array Extras + E4X + misc . )
Firefox 2.0 supports JavaScript 1.7 ( 1.6 + Generator +
Iterators + let + misc . )
Firefox 3.0 supports JavaScript 1.8 ( 1.7 + Generator Expressions + Expression Closures + misc . )
The next version of Firefox will support JavaScript 1.9 ( 1.8 +
To be determined )
Opera supports a language that is equivalent to ECMAScript 3 + Getters and Setters + misc .
Safari supports a language that is equivalent to ECMAScript 3 + Getters and Setters + misc .
It should be noted that the only browser that supports ‘ JavaScript ’ are Mozilla - based ones .
However , all modern browsers support a version of ECMAScript – at least version 3 . JavaScript 1.6-1.9 are just code names for the interim versions of ECMAScript ( JavaScript on Gecko ) that are leading up to JavaScript 2.0 ( ECMAScript 4 ) .
Of course no other browser will support another JavaScript 1.6- 1.9 , since they are n’t obligated to support JavaScript .
However , that has n’t stopped browsers from implementing JavaScript features ( such as getters and setters in Opera and Safari ) .
A big goal of Mozilla is to try implementing difficult ECMAScript features , helping to lead other browsers by example .
By using these stepping - stone JavaScript 1.6-1.9 releases as a way to test out bug fixes and functionality both users , and browser vendors , can get a better picture of the changes that will be occurring in the language .
This has been a big point in the development of JavaScript 2 ( ECMAScript 4 ) – Mozilla was able to show , through demonstrable real - world usage , that certain features were safe to implement ( generators , array comprehension , and getters and setters ) .
Mozilla will be continuing this tradition with JavaScript 1.9 , landing new features and bug fixes ( the vast majority of which will be from the upcoming ECMAScript 4 specification ) – helping to bring the newest version of JavaScript just a couple steps closer .

The Iran - Iraq war ( 1980 - 1988 ) was one of a series of crises during an era of upheaval in the Middle East : revolution in Iran , occupation of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by militant students , invasion of the Great Mosque in Mecca by anti-royalist Islamicists , the Soviet Union 's occupation of Afghanistan , and internecine fighting among Syrians , Israelis , and Palestinians in Lebanon .
The war followed months of rising tension between the Iranian Islamic republic and secular nationalist Iraq .
In mid-September 1980 Iraq attacked , in the mistaken belief that Iranian political disarray would guarantee a quick victory .
The international community responded with U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for a ceasefire and for all member states to refrain from actions contributing in any way to the conflict 's continuation .
The Soviets , opposing the war , cut off arms exports to Iran and to Iraq , its ally under a 1972 treaty ( arms deliveries resumed in 1982 ) .
The U.S. had already ended , when the shah fell , previously massive military sales to Iran .
In 1980 the U.S. broke off diplomatic relations with Iran because of the Tehran embassy hostage crisis ; Iraq had broken off ties with the U.S. during the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
The U.S. was officially neutral regarding the Iran - Iraq war , and claimed that it armed neither side .
Iran depended on U.S. - origin weapons , however , and sought them from Israel , Europe , Asia , and South America .
Iraq started the war with a large Soviet - supplied arsenal , but needed additional weaponry as the conflict wore on .
Initially , Iraq advanced far into Iranian territory , but was driven back within months .
By mid-1982 , Iraq was on the defensive against Iranian human - wave attacks .
The U.S. , having decided that an Iranian victory would not serve its interests , began supporting Iraq : measures already underway to upgrade U.S. - Iraq relations were accelerated , high - level officials exchanged visits , and in February 1982 the State Department removed Iraq from its list of states supporting international terrorism .
( It had been included several years earlier because of ties with several Palestinian nationalist groups , not Islamicists sharing the worldview of al - Qaeda .
Activism by Iraq 's main Shiite Islamicist opposition group , al - Dawa , was a major factor precipitating the war -- stirred by Iran 's Islamic revolution , its endeavors included the attempted assassination of Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz . )
Prolonging the war was phenomenally expensive .
Iraq received massive external financial support from the Gulf states , and assistance through loan programs from the U.S. The White House and State Department pressured the Export - Import Bank to provide Iraq with financing , to enhance its credit standing and enable it to obtain loans from other international financial institutions .
The U.S. Agriculture Department provided taxpayer - guaranteed loans for purchases of American commodities , to the satisfaction of U.S. grain exporters .
The U.S. restored formal relations with Iraq in November 1984 , but the U.S. had begun , several years earlier , to provide it with intelligence and military support ( in secret and contrary to this country 's official neutrality ) in accordance with policy directives from President Ronald Reagan .
These were prepared pursuant to his March 1982 National Security Study Memorandum ( NSSM 4 - 82 ) asking for a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East .
One of these directives from Reagan , National Security Decision Directive ( NSDD ) 99 , signed on July 12 , 1983 , is available only in a highly redacted version [ Document 21 ] .
It reviews U.S. regional interests in the Middle East and South Asia , and U.S. objectives , including peace between Israel and the Arabs , resolution of other regional conflicts , and economic and military improvements , " to strengthen regional stability . "
It deals with threats to the U.S. , strategic planning , cooperation with other countries , including the Arab states , and plans for action .
An interdepartmental review of the implications of shifting policy in favor of Iraq was conducted following promulgation of the directive .
By the summer of 1983 Iran had been reporting Iraqi use of using chemical weapons for some time .
The Geneva protocol requires that the international community respond to chemical warfare , but a diplomatically isolated Iran received only a muted response to its complaints [ Note 1 ] .
It intensified its accusations in October 1983 , however , and in November asked for a United Nations Security Council investigation .
The U.S. , which followed developments in the Iran - Iraq war with extraordinary intensity , had intelligence confirming Iran 's accusations , and describing Iraq 's " almost daily " use of chemical weapons , concurrent with its policy review and decision to support Iraq in the war [ Document 24 ] .
The intelligence indicated that Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian forces , and , according to a November 1983 memo , against " Kurdish insurgents " as well [ Document 25 ] .
What was the Reagan administration 's response ?
A State Department account indicates that the administration had decided to limit its " efforts against the Iraqi CW program to close monitoring because of our strict neutrality in the Gulf war , the sensitivity of sources , and the low probability of achieving desired results . "
But the department noted in late November 1983 that " with the essential assistance of foreign firms , Iraq ha[d ] become able to deploy and use CW and probably has built up large reserves of CW for further use .
Given its desperation to end the war , Iraq may again use lethal or incapacitating CW , particularly if Iran threatens to break through Iraqi lines in a large - scale attack " [ Document 25 ] .
The State Department argued that the U.S. needed to respond in some way to maintain the credibility of its official opposition to chemical warfare , and recommended that the National Security Council discuss the issue .
Following further high - level policy review , Ronald Reagan issued National Security Decision Directive ( NSDD ) 114 , dated November 26 , 1983 , concerned specifically with U.S. policy toward the Iran - Iraq war .
The directive reflects the administration 's priorities : it calls for heightened regional military cooperation to defend oil facilities , and measures to improve U.S. military capabilities in the Persian Gulf , and directs the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take appropriate measures to respond to tensions in the area .
It states , " Because of the real and psychological impact of a curtailment in the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf on the international economic system , we must assure our readiness to deal promptly with actions aimed at disrupting that traffic . "
It does not mention chemical weapons [ Document 26 ] .
Soon thereafter , Donald Rumsfeld ( who had served in various positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations , including as President Ford 's defense secretary , and at this time headed the multinational pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle & Co. ) was dispatched to the Middle East as a presidential envoy .
His December 1983 tour of regional capitals included Baghdad , where he was to establish " direct contact between an envoy of President Reagan and President Saddam Hussein , " while emphasizing " his close relationship " with the president [ Document 28 ] .
Rumsfeld met with Saddam , and the two discussed regional issues of mutual interest , shared enmity toward Iran and Syria , and the U.S. 's efforts to find alternative routes to transport Iraq 's oil ; its facilities in the Persian Gulf had been shut down by Iran , and Iran 's ally , Syria , had cut off a pipeline that transported Iraqi oil through its territory .
Rumsfeld made no reference to chemical weapons , according to detailed notes on the meeting [ Document 31 ] .
Rumsfeld also met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz , and the two agreed , " the U.S. and Iraq shared many common interests . "
Rumsfeld affirmed the Reagan administration 's " willingness to do more " regarding the Iran - Iraq war , but " made clear that our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that made it difficult for us , citing the use of chemical weapons , possible escalation in the Gulf , and human rights . "
He then moved on to other U.S. concerns [ Document 32 ] .
Later , Rumsfeld was assured by the U.S. interests section that Iraq 's leadership had been " extremely pleased " with the visit , and that " Tariq Aziz had gone out of his way to praise Rumsfeld as a person " [ Document 36 and Document 37 ] .
Rumsfeld returned to Baghdad in late March 1984 .
By this time , the U.S. had publicly condemned Iraq 's chemical weapons use , stating , " The United States has concluded that the available evidence substantiates Iran 's charges that Iraq used chemical weapons " [ Document 47 ] .
Briefings for Rumsfeld 's meetings noted that atmospherics in Iraq had deteriorated since his December visit because of Iraqi military reverses and because " bilateral relations were sharply set back by our March 5 condemnation of Iraq for CW use , despite our repeated warnings that this issue would emerge sooner or later " [ Document 48 ] .
Rumsfeld was to discuss with Iraqi officials the Reagan administration 's hope that it could obtain Export - Import Bank credits for Iraq , the Aqaba pipeline , and its vigorous efforts to cut off arms exports to Iran .
According to an affidavit prepared by one of Rumsfeld 's companions during his Mideast travels , former NSC staff member Howard Teicher , Rumsfeld also conveyed to Iraq an offer from Israel to provide assistance , which was rejected [ Document 61 ] .
Although official U.S. policy still barred the export of U.S. military equipment to Iraq , some was evidently provided on a " do n't ask - do n't tell " basis .
In April 1984 , the Baghdad interests section asked to be kept apprised of Bell Helicopter Textron 's negotiations to sell helicopters to Iraq , which were not to be " in any way configured for military use " [ Document 55 ] .
The purchaser was the Iraqi Ministry of Defense .
In December 1982 , Bell Textron 's Italian subsidiary had informed the U.S. embassy in Rome that it turned down a request from Iraq to militarize recently purchased Hughes helicopters .
An allied government , South Korea , informed the State Department that it had received a similar request in June 1983 ( when a congressional aide asked in March 1983 whether heavy trucks recently sold to Iraq were intended for military purposes , a State Department official replied " we presumed that this was Iraq 's intention , and had not asked . " )
[ Document 44 ]
During the spring of 1984 the U.S. reconsidered policy for the sale of dual - use equipment to Iraq 's nuclear program , and its " preliminary results favor [ed ] expanding such trade to include Iraqi nuclear entities " [ Document 57 ] .
Several months later , a Defense Intelligence Agency analysis said that even after the war ended , Iraq was likely to " continue to develop its formidable conventional and chemical capability , and probably pursue nuclear weapons " [ Document 58 ] .
( Iraq is situated in a dangerous neighborhood , and Israel had stockpiled a large nuclear weapons arsenal without international censure .
Nuclear nonproliferation was not a high priority of the Reagan administration - throughout the 1980s it downplayed Pakistan 's nuclear program , though its intelligence indicated that a weapons capability was being pursued , in order to avert congressionally mandated sanctions .
Sanctions would have impeded the administration 's massive military assistance to Pakistan provided in return for its support of the mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . )
In February 1984 , Iraq 's military , expecting a major Iranian attack , issued a warning that " the invaders should know that for every harmful insect there is an insecticide capable of annihilating it whatever the number and Iraq possesses this annihilation insecticide " [ Document 41 ] .
On March 3 , the State Department intervened to prevent a U.S. company from shipping 22,000 pounds of phosphorous fluoride , a chemical weapons precursor , to Iraq .
Washington instructed the U.S. interests section to protest to the Iraqi government , and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that " we anticipate making a public condemnation of Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the near future , " and that " we are adamantly opposed to Iraq 's attempting to acquire the raw materials , equipment , or expertise to manufacture chemical weapons from the United States .
When we become aware of attempts to do so , we will act to prevent their export to Iraq " [ Document 42 ] .
The public condemnation was issued on March 5 .
It said , " While condemning Iraq 's chemical weapons use . . .
The United States finds the present Iranian regime 's intransigent refusal to deviate from its avowed objective of eliminating the legitimate government of neighboring Iraq to be inconsistent with the accepted norms of behavior among nations and the moral and religious basis which it claims " [ Document 43 ] .
Later in the month , the State Department briefed the press on its decision to strengthen controls on the export of chemical weapons precursors to Iran and Iraq , in response to intelligence and media reports that precursors supplied to Iraq originated in Western countries .
When asked whether the U.S. 's conclusion that Iraq had used chemical weapons would have " any effect on U.S. recent initiatives to expand commercial relationships with Iraq across a broad range , and also a willingness to open diplomatic relations , " the department 's spokesperson said " No .
I 'm not aware of any change in our position .
We 're interested in being involved in a closer dialogue with Iraq " [ Document 52 ] .
Iran had submitted a draft resolution asking the U.N. to condemn Iraq 's chemical weapons use .
The U.S. delegate to the U.N. was instructed to lobby friendly delegations in order to obtain a general motion of " no decision " on the resolution .
If this was not achievable , the U.S. delegate was to abstain on the issue .
Iraq 's ambassador met with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. , Jeane Kirkpatrick , and asked for " restraint " in responding to the issue - as did the representatives of both France and Britain .
A senior U.N. official who had participated in a fact - finding mission to investigate Iran 's complaint commented " Iranians may well decide to manufacture and use chemical weapons themselves if [ the ] international community does not condemn Iraq .
He said Iranian assembly speaker Rafsanjani [ had ] made public statements to this effect " [ Document 50 ] .
Iraqi interests section head Nizar Hamdoon met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Placke on March 29 .
Hamdoon said that Iraq strongly preferred a Security Council presidential statement to a resolution , and wanted the response to refer to former resolutions on the war , progress toward ending the conflict , but to not identify any specific country as responsible for chemical weapons use .
Placke said the U.S. could accept Iraqi proposals if the Security Council went along .
He asked for the Iraqi government 's help " in avoiding . . . embarrassing situation [s ] " but also noted that the U.S. did " not want this issue to dominate our bilateral relationship " [ Document 54 ] .
On March 30 , 1984 , the Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the use of chemical weapons , without naming Iraq as the offending party .
A State Department memo circulating the draft text observed that , " The statement , by the way contains all three elements Hamdoon wanted " [ Document 51 ] .
On April 5 , 1984 , Ronald Reagan issued another presidential directive ( NSDD 139 ) , emphasizing the U.S. objective of ensuring access to military facilities in the Gulf region , and instructing the director of central intelligence and the secretary of defense to upgrade U.S. intelligence gathering capabilities .
It codified U.S. determination to develop plans " to avert an Iraqi collapse . "
Reagan 's directive said that U.S. policy required " unambiguous " condemnation of chemical warfare ( without naming Iraq ) , while including the caveat that the U.S. should " place equal stress on the urgent need to dissuade Iran from continuing the ruthless and inhumane tactics which have characterized recent offensives . "
The directive does not suggest that " condemning " chemical warfare required any hesitation about or modification of U.S. support for Iraq [ Document 53 ] .
A State Department background paper dated November 16 , 1984 said that Iraq had stopped using chemical weapons after a November 1983 demarche from the U.S. , but had resumed their use in February 1984 .
On November 26 , 1984 , Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations .
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz , in Washington for the formal resumption of ties , met with Secretary of State George Shultz .
When their discussion turned to the Iran - Iraq war , Aziz said that his country was satisfied that " the U.S. analysis of the war 's threat to regional stability is ' in agreement in principle ' with Iraq 's , " and expressed thanks for U.S. efforts to cut off international arms sales to Iran .
He said that " Iraq 's superiority in weaponry " assured Iraq 's defense .
Shultz , with presumed sardonic intent , " remarked that superior intelligence must also be an important factor in Iraq 's defense ; " Tariq Aziz had to agree [ Document 60 ] .
Conclusion
The current Bush administration discusses Iraq in starkly moralistic terms to further its goal of persuading a skeptical world that a preemptive and premeditated attack on Iraq could and should be supported as a " just war . "
The documents included in this briefing book reflect the realpolitik that determined this country 's policies during the years when Iraq was actually employing chemical weapons .
Actual rather than rhetorical opposition to such use was evidently not perceived to serve U.S. interests ; instead , the Reagan administration did not deviate from its determination that Iraq was to serve as the instrument to prevent an Iranian victory .
Chemical warfare was viewed as a potentially embarrassing public relations problem that complicated efforts to provide assistance .
The Iraqi government 's repressive internal policies , though well known to the U.S. government at the time , did not figure at all in the presidential directives that established U.S. policy toward the Iran - Iraq war .
The U.S. was concerned with its ability to project military force in the Middle East , and to keep the oil flowing .
Most of the information in this briefing book , in its broad outlines , has been available for years .
Some of it was recorded in contemporaneous news reports ; a few investigative reporters uncovered much more - especially after Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .
A particular debt is owed to the late representative Henry Gonzales ( 1916 -2000 ) , Democrat of Texas , whose staff extensively investigated U.S. policy toward Iraq during the 1980s and who would not be deterred from making information available to the public [ Note 2 ] .
Almost all of the primary documents included in this briefing book were obtained by the National Security Archive through the Freedom of Information Act and were published in 1995 [ Note 3 ] .

" Back Up of Transshipment Cargos for Iraq , " November 21 , 1980 .
Shortly after the beginning of the Iran - Iraq war , the U.S. embassy in Ankara reports that Turkish ports have a backlog of goods awaiting transshipment to Iraq , and that a substantial amount of Israeli goods transit Turkey for " Islamic belligerents , " including Israeli chemical products for Iran .
It remarks on " Israeli acumen " in selling to both Iran and Iraq .
The Iran - Iraq war was a tragedy for Iraqis and Iranians , resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties and immense material damage .
It was sustained by an arms bazaar made up of a broad spectrum of foreign governments and corporations : British , Spanish , Italian , French , German , Brazilian , Argentinean , Chilean , North Korean , Chinese , South African , Eastern European , Israeli , American , etc. , who found both combatants eager consumers of weapons , ammunition , and military technology .
Iran needed U.S. - origin weapons compatible with the military infrastructure created by the U.S. during the shah 's reign , could not buy them directly , and had to rely on third - party suppliers like Israel .

Pursuant to the Reagan administration 's policy of increasing support for Iraq , the State Department advises Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Lawrence Eagleburger to urge the U.S. Export - Import Bank to provide Iraq with financial credits .
Eagleburger signs a letter to Eximbank saying that since Saddam Hussein had complied with U.S. requests , and announced the end of all aid to the principal terrorist group of concern to the U.S. , and expelled its leader ( Abu Nidal ) , " The terrorism issue , therefore , should no longer be an impediment to EXIM financing for U.S. sales to Iraq . "
The financing is to signal U.S. belief in Iraq 's future economic viability , secure a foothold in the potentially large Iraqi market , and " go far to show our support for Iraq in a practical , neutral context . "

Document 34 : Department of State Cable from Kenneth W. Dam to United States Embassy in Jordan .
" Rumsfeld Mission : Meeting with King Hussein in London , " December 23 , 1983 .
Ambassador - at - large and presidential emissary Donald Rumsfeld discusses prospects for improving U.S. - Iraqi relations with King Hussein of Jordan .
Rumsfeld reports on his talks with Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz and says they had " more areas of agreement than disagreement . "
He also reviews the status of a proposed pipeline to Aqaba for Iraq 's oil .
The U.S. promoted the Aqaba pipeline project strenuously for several years during the early to mid 1980s .
It would have carried oil from northern Iraq to the Gulf of Aqaba in Jordan , alleviating the disruptive effect on Iraq 's oil output that resulted from Iran 's attacks on oil transshipment facilities in the Persian Gulf and from Syria 's closing of a pipeline that had transported Iraqi oil .
The proposed project reflected the U.S. 's extreme nervousness about threats to the world oil supply resulting from the Iran - Iraq war .
The U.S. involved several U.S. - based multinational corporations in planning the project .
International financier Bruce Rappaport , a friend of CIA director William Casey , was also a central figure in the proposed deal .
( The final report of the independent counsel for the Iran - Contra " arms for hostages " scandal cites reports indicating that Rappaport 's bank in Geneva was the recipient of a mysterious $ 10 million payment from the Sultan of Brunei to fund the Nicaraguan contras that subsequently disappeared .
Rappaport denied this ; the final report says that the issue remained unresolved .
He was invited to testify in 1999 at a House Banking committee hearing on corruption in Russian financial transactions , but declined . )
The project was complicated by demands that the U.S. arrange for ironclad security guarantees from the Israelis , since the pipeline would have been vulnerable to their attack .
The Israelis , for their part , demanded guarantees that pipeline facilities would not cause environmental damage .
All involved had their reasons for at least hypothetical interest in the project .
For Iraq , it would have been a manifestation of improved U.S. - Iraq relations - they wanted as much U.S. financial and other involvement in the proposed deal as possible .
For the U.S. , it would have provided an alternative , theoretically secure outlet for oil and created a nexus for entangling Iraqi interests with those of Jordan and Israel , consistent with U.S. plans to create a wider consortium of Arab countries that would cooperate with the U.S. and would be willing to resolve the Palestine - Israel dispute on U.S. terms .
Israel would have benefited from new oil facilities in its vicinity , and won points with the Reagan administration .
Also , according to internal documents from a friend of Reagan administration Attorney General Edmund Meese , brought in as an intermediary because of his Israeli ties , payoffs would have been skimmed from complex financial guarantee arrangements for the Israeli government and Labor Party .
Attempts to agree on arrangements that would satisfy all parties dragged on , until the several private companies that had been brought in to plan the project backed out , questioning the motives of all involved .
Iraq , however , revived the concept in 2000 , presumably for its own strategic interests .

The U.S. intensifies its diplomatic efforts to curtail arms sales to Iran and imposes anti-terrorism export controls on that country .
However , it does not plan to prohibit U.S. imports of Iranian oil .
The U.S. was developing plans to liberalize its export policy for Iraq .
The revised rules would permit the export of U.S. - origin armored ambulances , communications gear , and electronic equipment for the protection of Saddam Hussein 's personal aircraft .
The Reagan administration was continuing efforts to persuade the Export - Import Bank to provide financing for Iraq -- a positive Eximbank determination would improve Iraq 's credit rating and make it easier for it to obtain loans from international financial institutions .

This affidavit was submitted in the course of one of a number of prosecutions , following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , of U.S. companies charged with illegally delivering military , dual - use , or nuclear - related items to Iraq .
( In this case , a Teledyne affiliate was charged will illegally selling zirconium , used in the manufacture of explosives , to the Chilean arms manufacturer Carlos Industries , which used the material to manufacture cluster bombs sold to Iraq . )
Many of these firms tried to defend themselves by establishing that providing military materiel to Iraq had been the actual , if covert , policy of the U.S. government .
This was a difficult case to make , especially considering the rules of evidence governing investigations involving national security matters .

' Inherent Contempt ' Anyone ?
Brad Friedman Byon 6/18/2008 , 6:56 pm PT
Is the photo at left beginning to seem less and less absurd ?
Looks like we 're headed for an interesting game of chicken next month in the House Judiciary Committee surrounding Rove 's subpoena to appear before it to answer questions in the Don Siegelman affair ( and perhaps others ) on July 10 .
RAW has the story worth putting on your radar , with no less than two House Judiciary members hinting that they may be willing to take extra steps ( e.g. , use of " inherent contempt " to have Rove arrested by the House Sergeant at Arms if need be ) should he refuse to testify .
If Rove refuses to appear , says Rep. Wasserman - Schultz , " then we have to take the next step . "
And Rep. Sanchez notes , " We really need to set our foot down and show there are consequences to people who laugh in the face of Congressional subpoenas . "
Tea leaves sure , but interesting ones , worth watching .
The point is also made that the Committee may continue with this particular investigation , even as a new President takes office .
Would be a whole different ballgame under those conditions .
Presuming that new President is n't McCain , in any case .
Hmmm ...

Rich in Oil , Poor in Human Rights Torture and Poverty in Equatorial Guinea
It has the makings of a modern - day fairy tale , the story of a country transformed from a pariah state into an oil paradise .
But the reality is that Equatorial Guinea , almost unnoticed by the rest of the world , is experiencing a modern - day tragedy , a story of the dark niches of global politics in times of oil and terror .
Clang : a C language family frontend for LLVM
The Clang project provides a language front - end and tooling infrastructure for languages in the C language family ( C , C++ , Objective C/C++ , OpenCL , CUDA , and RenderScript ) for the LLVM project .
Both a GCC - compatible compiler driver ( clang ) and an MSVC - compatible compiler driver ( clang - cl.exe ) are provided .
You can get and build the source today .
Features and Goals
Some of the goals for the project include the following :
End -User Features :
Fast compiles and low memory use
Expressive diagnostics ( examples )
GCC compatibility
Utility and Applications :
Modular library based architecture
Support diverse clients ( refactoring , static analysis , code generation , etc. )
Allow tight integration with IDEs
Use the LLVM ' Apache 2 ' License
Internal Design and Implementation :
A real - world , production quality compiler
A simple and hackable code base
A single unified parser for C , Objective C , C++ , and Objective C++
Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants
Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of Clang .
To get a true sense of what it is all about , see the Features section , which breaks each of these down and explains them in more detail .
Why ?
Development of the new front - end was started out of a need for a compiler that allows better diagnostics , better integration with IDEs , a license that is compatible with commercial products , and a nimble compiler that is easy to develop and maintain .
All of these were motivations for starting work on a new front - end that could meet these needs .
Current Status
Clang is considered to be a production quality C , Objective - C , C++ and Objective - C++ compiler when targeting X86 - 32 , X86 - 64 , and ARM ( other targets may have caveats , but are usually easy to fix ) .
As example , Clang is used in production to build performance - critical software like Chrome or Firefox .
If you are looking for source analysis or source - to - source transformation tools , Clang is probably a great solution for you .
Clang supports C++11 , C++14 and C++17 , please see the C++ status page for more information .
Get it and get involved !
Start by getting the code , building it , and playing with it .
This will show you the sorts of things we can do today and will let you have the " Clang experience " first hand : hopefully it will " resonate " with you . :)
Once you 've done that , please consider getting involved in the Clang community .

Spain 's parliament approved a measure Wednesday to extend some human rights to gorillas , chimpanzees , bonobos , and orangutans , becoming the first country to explicitly acknowledge the legal rights of nonhumans .
The parliament 's environmental committee approved a resolution that commits the country to the Declaration on Great Apes , which states that nonhuman apes are entitled to the rights of life , liberty , and protection from torture .
The declaration , developed in 1993 by a group of primatologists , ethicists , and psychologists known as the Great Ape Project , demands " the extension of the community of equals to include all great apes . "
According to the declaration , apes may not be killed except under " strictly defined circumstances , " such as self - defense .
They may not be imprisoned without due legal process , and they may not be subjected to the " deliberate infliction of severe pain , " even if doing so is said to benefit others .
Reuters reports that the resolution is expected to become law , and will likely take effect within one year .
The news agency spells out what this means for Spain 's population of nonhuman apes .
Keeping apes for circuses , television commercials or filming will also be forbidden and breaking the new laws will become an offence under Spain 's penal code .
Keeping an estimated 315 apes in Spanish zoos will not be illegal , but supporters of the bill say conditions will need to improve drastically in 70 percent of establishments to comply with the new law .
The Times of London notes that the resolution could be the beginning of a trend toward granting similar rights to other nonhuman animals :
Spain ’s conservative Popular Party also complained that the resolution sought to give animals the same rights as humans – something that the Socialist Government denies .
Some critics questioned why Spain should afford legal protection from death or torture to great apes but not bulls .
But Mr Pozas said that the vote would set a precedent , establishing legal rights for animals that could be extended to other species .
“ We are seeking to break the species barrier – we are just the point of the spear , ” he said .
Spain 's resolution is regarded as a landmark move against " speciesism , " or human exeptionalism , but other countries have taken steps in recent years toward recognizing nonhuman apes as moral persons who possess an inherent worth and dignity .
In 2002 , Germany 's parliament voted to add the phrase " and animals " to a clause in the country 's constitution requiring the state to uphold the dignity of humans .
In 1992 , Switzerland passed an amendment to its constitution that recognized animals as " beings , " and not " things . "
Last year , the parliament of Spain 's Balearic Islands endorsed the Declaration on Great Apes .

Lies , Damned Lies , and Drug War Statistics by Matthew B. Robinson and Renee G. Scherlen ( Albany : State University of New York Press , 2007 ) ; 268 pages ; $ 27.95 .
One war appears to be going well for the United States and its allies these days : the drug war .
That was the lead in dozens of U.S. newspapers in response to a June 2007 United Nations report claiming that U.S. drug policy has led to a substantial decline in illicit drug use .
Chances are the author of the story hadnt read a copy of Lies , Damned Lies , and Drug War Statistics : A Critical Analysis of Claims Made by the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
He ought to .
Written by a pair of Appalachian State associate professors — Matthew Robinson and Renee Scherlen — Lies , Damn Lies , and Drug War Statistics seeks to provide an objective , fair assessment of Americas drug war since the passage of the 1988 federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act .
( The law , passed by Congress at the height of the 1980s drug - war Zeitgeist , created the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy — known colloquially as the drug czars office — and pronounced ,  It is the declared policy of the United States Government to create a Drug - Free America by 1995 . )
Their assessment is nothing short of scathing .
Since the ONDCPs founding in 1989 , trends in drug use , drug treatment , deaths attributed to drug use , emergency - room mentions of drug use , drug availability , drug purity , and drug prices are inconsistent with the goals of [ the federal government ] ,  the authors assert .
 Yet , during this same time period , funding for the drug war grew tremendously and costs of the drug war expanded as well . 
Of course , such a critical appraisal of U.S. drug policy is hardly unique .
What sets Robinson and Scherlens evaluation apart is their methodology .
Lies , Damned Lies , and Drug War Statistics consists primarily of the authors evaluation of the federal anti-drug agencys annual National Drug Control Strategies .
These reports , issued by the ONDCP at the beginning of each year , outline the agencys policy objectives (  Stop [ illicit drug ] use before it starts ; heal Americas drug users ; [ and ] disrupt the [ illicit drug ] market .) and , in theory , provide statistical proof to Congress and the public of the drug wars ongoing success .
Under close scrutiny , however , it is troublingly apparent that ( a ) the agency is failing to achieve its stated goals , and ( b ) the drug czars office is manipulating and falsifying statistics in its public reports in order to claim successes that are not warranted .
Robinson and Scherlen affirm that there is overwhelming evidence that the ONDCP is consistently making false and dishonest claims  regarding the drug wars perceived progress , and the authors cite more than 80 instances of the agencys relying on inappropriate and dishonest uses of statistics to prove its case . 
Examples of the agencys duplicity include :
Manipulating its budgeting techniques to exclude law enforcement and correctional costs attributable to the drug war in order to give  the appearance of increasing the proportion of funding for treatment in the drug war budget . 
Creating the impression of declines in illicit drug use by beginning its trend analysis in 1979 ( the peak year of self - reported illicit drug use in the United States ) .
By doing so , the agency attempts to show visually that drug use is down when it has actually not decreased during [ the ONDCPs ] existence . 
( Authors further note that although the agency consistently claims credit for alleged declines in drug use , the ONDCP fails to accept any responsibility for increases in drug use among the general population . )
Claiming that the black - market prices for illicit drugs are holding steady as a result of U.S. drug policies , when , in fact , they are generally declining . 
Alleging that most U.S. drug arrests and incarcerations are for trafficking offenses , when , in fact , approximately 80 percent of all drug arrests are for possession offenses .
Abandoning previously stated goals without comment , and replacing them with new ( and in recent years , far fewer ) goals .
Though the ONDCP generally does not … admit failure in meeting [ its ] goals … it [ does ] use its failure to call for stepped - up efforts in the drug war ,  the authors note .
Of the available critiques of U.S. drug policy , Robinson and Scherlens work proves to be one of the most thorough and irrefutable , as it relies solely on the ONDCPs own rhetoric and data sources to debunk the agencys various claims .
In the authors final analysis , they determine that the agency consistently and overwhelmingly fails to act in a fair , honest , or transparent manner — as required by law .
Instead , the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy predominantly operates as a generator and defender of a given ideology in the drug war ,  Robinson and Scherlen conclude :
This ideology asserts that illicit drugs are always bad , never acceptable , supply - driven , and must be fought through an ongoing war .
This ideology asserts that fighting a war on drugs is the only way to reduce drug use and achieve related goals .
In theory , one would expect that policies that do not achieve their objectives ( such as the drug war ) would be discontinued … .
Our assessment reveals that the ONDCP has not achieved its goals in the years since its creation .
Thus , a rational response to this situation would be to terminate the ONDCP .
This would save tax money , alleviate government inefficiency , and reduce the size of government .
If accompanied by a reassessment of U.S. policy toward drugs , it might even result in better outcomes with regard to drug use and abuse in the United States .
The Best of Paul Armentano
At the risk of sounding rude , I found this report from Marc Ambinder rather amusing .
The Republican National Committee has hired many of its Victory 2008 directors .
These are the folks who will be in charge of spending the many of millions of dollars that the party doles out for GOTV efforts .
Many of them are young — very young — are veterans of the Giuliani presidential campaign , and before that , veterans of the 2006 RNC field operation run by Mike DuHaime , formerly the Giuliani campaign manager .
Yes , right , Giuliani .
I remember him .
He ’s the one who spent tens of millions of dollars to compete in eight Republicans presidential contests earlier this year , losing all of them by wide margins , and who quit the race without so much as a single delegate .
He ’s the one who only managed to break double digits in only one primary , and who lost by 21 points in his most competitive contest .
It ’s his team that has been hired by the RNC for its get - out - the - vote efforts .
Thank goodness .
UPDATE : ( Nicole )
It appears that the RNC is pretty happy with the number of " friends " it has on Facebook .
Their thinking apparently is that it bodes well for the November election , as they for the first time have more than the DNC .
I 've heard rumors they 're shopping that story to some friendly reporters .

Media is everywhere , and every business uses it to get ahead , including yours .
It ’s the only way to get your brand out to the public and attract the attention of some potential clients , and without it , you will be behind the competition .
Clearly , you ’ll need to keep the essence of media at the forefront of your business to continue to reach new heights .
That said , you may be confused to find out that there are different digital media strategies to choose from , and each category goes by a specific definition .
These three strategies are known as owned , paid , and earned media .
But what does each one of these terms even mean , and what can they do for your business ?
This article is able to go in - depth with the answers you need .
You ’ll learn about the different terms and how your business can benefit from the types of media available .

Owned , Paid , and Earned Media : What ’s the Difference ?
Using media can be a bit confusing if you do n’t even know what each type stands for .
Thankfully , it ’s actually not very hard to know the difference between the three main types .
Owned , paid , and earned media are all forms of digital media that are used to strengthen and promote your brand and attract customers to your wares .
First , there is owned media .
Simply put , owned media is media that is directly owned by your company .
This content is unique to your brand and is produced by you or your hired agents to create .
This can include a variety of things , including your website , your blogs , and even your social media page .
These owned forms of content are exclusively yours , and you wo n’t have to pay a third party ( outside of those who create or maintain your content ) to use them .
Earned media works hand in hand with your owned media .
Having owned media is good , but without a way to get it out to the public , you wo n’t have a way of showing off what you have to offer .
Earned media is media that helps bring in such people without having to pay to have it .
Things such as viral videos , shares , reposts , reviews , recommendations or other forms of free exposure via 3rd parties help to bring in the traffic to your site .
Lastly , paid media is exactly what it sounds like : media that you have to pay to use .
In most cases , this comes in the form of paid advertising , which you can get from companies like Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn .
These companies will then take your information and use it to boost up your brand awareness to bring potential buyers to your owned pages .

The US Justice Department said the frauds had cost victims $ 1bn The FBI says it has arrested 406 property market players as part of a crackdown on alleged mortgage frauds worth an estimated $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) .
The arrests include housing developers , estate agents and mortgage brokers .
Reported mortgage fraud has soared in the past year , with the most common type being mis-statement of assets .
In a separate development , two former Bear Stearns managers have been charged following the collapse of two hedge funds linked to sub - prime mortgages .
They are the first executives to face criminal charges related to the collapse of the value sub - prime loans which triggered the credit crunch .
Billion dollar losses Mortgage fraud and related securities fraud pose a significant threat to our economy
Mark Filip , deputy US attorney general
The property market investigation , known as Operation Malicious Mortgage , relates to a number of types of alleged mortgage fraud .
" Operation Malicious Mortgage and the Bear Stearns case demonstrate that the Department of Justice is determined to detect and to punish mortgage fraud and to help restore stability and confidence in our housing and credit markets , " said deputy US attorney general Mark Filip .
The Justice Department said it was pursuing 144 cases against the 406 defendants .
Sixty of them were arrested on Wednesday alone .
The Justice department estimated that the losses to homeowners and other borrowers from the mortgage frauds amounted to about $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) .
" Mortgage fraud and related securities fraud pose a significant threat to our economy , to the stability of our nation 's housing market and to the peace of mind to millions of Americans , " said Mark Filip .
Some of cases involve the alleged use of false employment records or the inflation of property values .
Others are looking into alleged foreclosure rescue scams which target struggling homeowners offering to help prevent them losing their home for a fee .
Reports of mortgage fraud have increased significantly over the past year .
According to the US Treasury Department , banks reported almost 53,000 cases of suspected mortgage fraud in 2007 , up 37,000 a year earlier .

Editor 's Note :
This story was originally printed in the March 2008 issue of Scientific American .
All tuna are not alike .
The canned tuna fish in sandwiches and salads comes from either skipjack , a meter - long species that is caught in prodigious quantities around the world and served as “ light meat tuna , ” or albacore , another small fish that is marketed as “ white meat tuna . ”
The yellowfin and the bigeye tuna are larger species that are also heavily fished , but neither makes for particularly wonderful sushi , and they are usually served grilled .
But the bluefin tuna , a giant among fishes , is the premier choice for sushi and sashimi and has become the most desirable food fish in the world .
As such , it has vaulted to the top of another , more insidious list : it is probably the most endangered of all large fish species .
Heedless overfishing is steadily pushing the bluefin toward extinction , and the species may soon disappear unless entrepreneurial fish farmers can learn how to breed the tuna in captivity .
Reaching a maximum known weight close to three quarters of a ton and a length of four meters , the bluefin is a massive hunk of superheated muscle that cleaves the water by flicking its scimitar - shaped tail .
Whereas most of the approximately 20,000 fish species are cold - blooded , possessing a body temperature the same as that of the water in which they swim , the bluefin is one of the few warm - blooded fishes .
During a dive to one kilometer below the surface , where the ambient water temperature can be five degrees Celsius ( 41 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the bluefin can maintain a body temperature of 27 degrees C ( 81 degrees F ) , close to that of a mammal .
The bluefin is also among the fastest of all fishes , capable of speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour and able to migrate across entire oceans .
It is such a marvelous swimmer that when scientists in the 1990s endeavored to build a mechanical fish , they used the species as a model , designing a robot with a tapered , bullet - shaped body and a rigid , quarter - moon tail fin [ see “ An Efficient Swimming Machine , ” by Michael S. Triantafyllou and George S. Triantafyllou ; Scientific American , March 1995 ] .
The researchers found that the tail ’s efficiency lay in the interaction of the vortices created by its rapid flexing , but the hydrodynamics of their electronic models did not even come close to that of a true bluefin .
“ The more sophisticated our robotic - tuna designs become , ” the Triantafyllou brothers wrote , “ the more admiration we have for the flesh - and - blood model . ”
Like wolves , bluefins often hunt in packs , forming a high - speed parabola that concentrates the prey , making it easier for the hunters to close in .
Tuna are metabolically adapted for high - speed chases , but as opportunistic ( and by necessity , compulsive ) feeders , they will eat whatever presents itself , whether it is fast - swimming mackerel , bottom - dwelling flounder or sedentary sponge .
A study of the stomach contents of New England bluefins by Bradford Chase of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries revealed that the predominant food item , by weight , was Atlantic herring , followed by sand lance , bluefish and miscellaneous squid .
( Other prey included butterfish , silver hake , windowpane flounder , winter flounder , menhaden , sea horses , cod , plaice , pollack , filefish , halfbeak , sculpin , spiny dogfish , skate , octopus , shrimp , lobster , crab , salp and sponges . )
Tuna will eat anything they can catch , and they can catch almost anything that swims ( or floats , crawls or just sits on the bottom ) .
By and large , they hunt by vision .
From Horse Mackerel to Sushi
The bluefin was not always considered a delicacy .
In the early 1900s the fish was known as “ horse mackerel , ” and its red , strong - flavored flesh was considered suitable fare only for dogs and cats .
Nevertheless , big - game fishers off New Jersey and Nova Scotia targeted the bluefin because these powerful fish were considered worthy opponents .
Zane Grey , the popular author of Western novels such as Riders of the Purple Sage , invested most of his not inconsiderable royalties ( his books sold more than 13 million copies ) on fishing gear , boats and travel to exotic locales in search of tuna , swordfish and marlin .
Although swordfish were certainly considered edible , tuna and marlin were thought of as strictly objects of the hunt .
The bluefin did not become valuable as a food fish until the latter half of the 20th century , when sushi began to appear on menus around the globe .
One might assume that sushi and sashimi have been staples of the Japanese diet for centuries , but in fact the widespread consumption of raw fish is a relatively modern phenomenon .
Dependent on the sea to provide the great majority of their protein , the Japanese could not store fish for any length of time before it spoiled , so they preserved it by smoking or pickling .
But when refrigerators were introduced to postwar Japan , fish that once were smoked or pickled could now be stored almost indefinitely .
As the fishing industry adopted new technologies such as long - lining ( using extremely long lines with many baited hooks ) , purse seining ( deploying large nets that can enclose an entire school of fish ) and onboard freezers , the circumstances became propitious for an unprecedented modification of Japanese eating habits .
The bluefin tuna changed from a fish that samurai would not eat because they believed it was unclean , to maguro , a delicacy that can be as expensive as truffles or caviar .
Toro , the best quality maguro , comes from the fatty belly meat of the adult bluefin .
Truffles or caviar are expensive because they are rare , but bluefin tuna , previously perceived as inedible , could be found in huge offshore schools and soon became an internationally exalted menu item .
In 2001 a single bluefin tuna sold at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo for $ 173,600 .
In America — where the thought of eating raw fish was anathema 40 years ago — sushi and sashimi have become commonplace , sold in supermarkets , delis and high - end restaurants .
Perhaps the grandest temple to sushi in the U.S. is Masa , a New York City restaurant opened in 2004 by Japanese chef Masayoshi Takayama .
With a prix fixe of $ 350 ( excluding tax , tips and beverages ) , Masa immediately became the most expensive restaurant in the city ; a lunch or dinner for two can easily exceed $ 1,000 .
It stands to reason that a fish that can be sold for hundreds of dollars a slice is going to attract fishing fleets .
The pell - mell rush to provide tuna for the Japanese sushi and sashimi markets has — not surprisingly — intensified tuna fishing around the world .
The Japanese tried to fill their larders ( and freezers and fish markets ) with tuna that they could catch off their own shores ( this would have been the Pacific bluefin , Thunnus orientalis ) , but they soon observed that the bluefins were larger and more plentiful in the North Atlantic .
The buyers for Japanese fish importers became a familiar sight at the docks of American ports such as Gloucester and Barnstable in Massachusetts , ready to test the tuna for fat content and , if they passed , buy the fish on the spot and ship them to Japan .
At one time , researchers believed that there were two separate populations of North Atlantic bluefins ( Thunnus thynnus ) , one that bred in the Gulf of Mexico and stayed in the western Atlantic and another that spawned in the Mediterranean and foraged in the eastern part of the ocean .
The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) , a regulatory body established in 1969 , based its catch quotas for the bluefin on this two - population concept , setting strict limits in the western Atlantic ( where bluefin were becoming scarce as early as the 1970s ) while allowing much larger catches in the eastern Atlantic .
But tagging experiments — pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s by Frank J. Mather and Francis G. Carey of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and refined in recent years by Barbara A. Block of Stanford University ’s Hopkins Marine Station — showed that the bluefin confounds the conventional wisdom .
The Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are indeed the breeding areas of the North Atlantic bluefins , but individual fishes can migrate across the ocean , and the foraging grounds of the two populations overlap .
Because ICCAT has failed to stop overfishing in the eastern Atlantic , bluefin stocks have collapsed throughout the ocean .
If possible , things are worse in the Mediterranean .
Employing ideas and technology originally developed in South Australia ( with the southern bluefin , Thunnus maccoyii ) , fishers corral schools of half - grown tuna and tow them in floating pens to marine ranches where they are fed and fattened until they can be killed and shipped to Japan .
There are rules banning fishing fleets from taking undersize tuna out of the Mediterranean , but none that prevent catching immature tuna and fattening them in floating pens .
Every country on the Mediterranean ( except Israel ) takes advantage of this loophole and maintains tuna ranches offshore .
The fishers from Spain , France , Italy , Greece , Turkey , Cyprus , Croatia , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , Morocco and Malta are capturing half - grown tuna by the hundreds of thousands .
If you had to design a way to guarantee the decimation of a breeding population , this would be it : catch the fish before they are old enough to breed and keep them penned up until they are killed .
The tuna ranches , once seen as a solution to the problem , are only making it worse .
In 2006 the World Wildlife Fund called for the cessation of all tuna fishing in the Mediterranean , but given the tremendous financial rewards of the status quo , you can imagine how effective this plea was .
At its meeting last November , ICCAT ignored the arguments of conservationists and set the 2008 quotas at approximately the same levels as 2007 .
The organization adopted a plan to scale back Mediterranean tuna fishing by 20 percent by 2010 , with further reductions to follow , but the head of the U.S. delegation decried this half - measure , saying that ICCAT had “ failed to live up to its founding mission . ”
Even if lower quotas were in place , however , the bluefin would still be imperiled .
The tuna fishery is rife with illegal , unregulated fleets that ignore quotas , restrictions , boundaries , and any other rules and regulations that might threaten their catch .
Furthermore , the Japanese market — which devours about 60,000 tons of bluefin every year , or more than three quarters of the global catch — is only too eager to buy the tuna , regardless of where or how it is caught .
Japanese fishers have contrived to circumvent even their own country ’s restrictions , bringing in thousands of tons of illegal tuna every year and then falsifying their records .
It would be good for the tuna and , in the end , good for the consumer if tuna fishing was not practiced in such a remorseless manner , but such change would entail nothing less than a modification of the fundamentals of human nature .
As the tuna populations continue to fall , the Japanese demand for toro is increasing ; fewer tuna will mean higher prices , and higher prices will mean intensified fishing .
Intensified fishing will , of course , result in fewer tuna .
( All bets would be off if the Japanese somehow relaxed their demand for maguro , but that seems as likely as Americans giving up hamburgers . )
It appears that the only hope for the bluefin is captive breeding .
Cattle of the Sea
In an article entitled “ When Will We Tame the Oceans ? ” that appeared in Nature in 2005 , John Marra , a biological oceanographer at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , observed that “ fishing in the ocean is no longer sustainable .
Worldwide , we have failed to manage the ocean ’s fisheries — in a few decades , there may be no fisheries left to manage . ”
His recommendation ?
A large - scale domestication of the ocean — with fish farmers breeding , raising and harvesting commercially valuable species .
Marra acknowledged that existing fish farms have harmed the environment , polluting coastal ecosystems and putting additional pressure on wild fish populations by spreading disease and toxic chemicals .
His solution is to move these so - called mariculture operations farther offshore , to the waters of the outer continental shelves , and to deploy much larger fish pens ( closed net structures containing as much as 100,000 cubic meters of water ) that could be floated below the surface and towed from one destination to another .
This strategy would at least disperse the pollutants generated by fish farming , mitigating the environmental damage .
Marra also suggested taking advantage of the inclination of certain tunas to aggregate under an object that is significantly different from their surroundings .
This propensity has already been exploited by fishers in the design and implementation of fish - aggregating devices , which are towed behind boats to attract schools of tuna .
Instead of netting all the fish at once , though , fish farmers could create a sustainable business by feeding , maintaining and periodically harvesting some of the tuna in the school , handling the fish in much the same way that ranchers on land manage herds of cattle .
Unless tuna can be raised as if they were domesticated animals , their world populations will continue to crash .
Breeding the bluefin in captivity , however , is a major challenge .
One company that is attempting this feat is Clean Seas Aquaculture Growout , owned by the Stehr Group in Port Lincoln , South Australia .
The Australian government has provided Clean Seas with a grant of 4.1 million Australian dollars ( $ 3.4 million ) to assist in the com­mer­cialization of southern bluefin breeding .
The company has already raised captive - bred yellow­tail kingfish ( Seriola lalandi ) and mulloway ( Argyrosomus hololepidotus ) , which are now in significant commercial production .
In October 2006 Clean Seas airlifted southern bluefin broodstock ( sexually mature males and females ) from their pens to a three - million - liter ( 790,000 - gallon ) tank that had been designed to replicate the optimum conditions for spawning .
Hagen Stehr , founder of the company , said in a 2006 interview in The Australian , “ We ’ve got it all on computer , we can make [ the tank ] lighter or darker , we can leave the fish in a state of well - being , we ’ve got the sun going up , the sun going down ....
This is a world first , the Japanese wo n’t try it at all , the Americans have tried it and failed and the Europeans have failed too . ”
During my February 2007 visit to Port Lincoln , Rob Staunton , the farm manager for the Stehr Group , drove me to Arno Bay , 120 kilometers north of Port Lincoln , on the western shore of Spencer Gulf .
I was granted limited entrée into the holy grail of the tuna business , the giant enclosed tuna tank at the Arno Bay hatchery .
I say “ limited ” because my visit , personally sanctioned by Stehr himself , came with severe restrictions , all of which are perfectly understandable .
No photography is allowed in the facility itself , because the engineering , water processing , climate control and every other element in the design of this potential miracle must be carefully safeguarded to prevent corporate theft of the ideas .
Along with the grant from the Australian government , the Stehr Group has invested millions in the innovative design of this facility , and it would be a disaster if someone borrowed or modified their designs and somehow beat them to the punch .
It is hard to imagine anybody replicating this massive operation without all of Australia knowing about it , but of course , entrepreneurs in other countries — Japan , for instance — are also very interested in the business of captive - breeding bluefin tuna .
Indeed , Japanese scientists at Kinki University have already hatched bluefin tuna from eggs and raised them to breeding age in the laboratory but not on the commercial scale being attempted by Clean Seas .
To begin our tour , Staunton and I had to change into special white rubber boots , sterilized to prevent the introduction of alien microbes into the tanks where the bluefin tuna are nurtured .
Chaperoned by Thomas Marguritte , the Frenchman - turned - Australian who manages the facility , we exchanged our white boots for blue ones as we entered the sanctum sanctorum of the Arno Bay hatchery , the tuna - breeding tank .
In a cavernous room illuminated by a battery of fluorescent lights , with the quiet hum of air - conditioning as the only background noise ( the temperature outside was near 38 degrees C , or 100 degrees F ) , we climbed up to the concrete rim of the vast tank and looked down .
The tank is about 25 meters in diameter and six meters deep , and because the light level was fairly low , we could see very little until Marguritte tossed in a couple of small fish .
Suddenly the surface broke with an ultramarine and chrome flash as one of the tuna charged at the baitfish .
The tank came alive with froth , pierced by the sicklelike dorsal and tail fins of the tuna , which were anticipating a meal even though , as our docent explained , they had been fed only an hour before .
As they circled excitedly underneath us , we could see that these were breeding - size bluefins : 300 kilograms of sleek , polished torpedo , pointed at both ends , with a dotted line of yellow finlets just before the tail , and the startling parentheses that mark the species ’ horizontal keels , chrome yellow in the southern bluefin and black in the northern varieties .
No one can tell a live male from a live female except another tuna .
Poised on the rim of the tank , we talked about the breeding program .
“ We can replicate the exact conditions in Indonesian waters where they are known to spawn naturally , ” Marguritte said .
“ If they usually spawn in the Southern Hemisphere summer when the days are longest and the water temperature is highest , we can make this tank conform to — pick a date , say , November 20 — and set the length of daylight hours , air temperature , water temperature and even currents to conform to that moment in the Indian Ocean , south of the Indonesian archipelago . ”
The only variable they cannot duplicate is the depth of the water , and they are praying that it is not a critical factor in the breeding of the southern bluefin .
Just south of the Indonesian arc of islands — Java , Bali , Flores , Sumba , Komodo , Timor — is the Java Trench , which descends to one of the deepest points in the Indian Ocean , nearly eight kilometers down .
If depth is a factor , the Clean Seas project is doomed .
The broodstock at Clean Seas did not produce offspring in 2007 , but they will try again this spring .
Taming the Bluefin
At the Clean Seas conference room in the Port Lincoln headquarters , I met with Marcus Stehr , Hagen ’s 42 - year - old son and the managing director of the company .
The day before , Marcus had been onboard one of the company ’s purse seiners in the Great Australian Bight , the huge open bay off the continent ’s southern coast , as a net cage containing perhaps 100 tons of tuna started on its journey to the pens off Port Lincoln .
Like everyone else associated with this venture , Marcus is enthusiastic and optimistic about the potential for success and believes it is imminent .
When I asked him if that success would completely change the way bluefin tuna are perceived in Australia , he said , “ It ’s not a question of if , mate — it ’s when . ”
Although the Aussies appear to be in the lead , it remains to be seen if they , the Japanese , or the Europeans will win the race to breed the bluefin in captivity .
In 2005 , for example , a research team at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Puerto de Mazarrón , Spain , successfully retrieved eggs and sperm from captive Atlantic bluefin broodstock , performed in vitro fertilization and produced larvae .
( The hatchlings of bony marine fishes are called larvae because they look so different from the adults . )
Somehow or other , it has to happen , because the survival of the species — and the tuna industry — depends on it .
The big - game fisher sees the bluefin tuna as a sleek and powerful opponent ; to the harpooner , it is an iridescent shadow below the surface , flicking its scythelike tail to propel it out of range ; the purse seiner sees a churning maelstrom of silver and blue bodies to be hauled onboard his boat ; the long - liner sees a dead fish , pulled onto the deck along with many other glistening marine creatures ; the tuna rancher sees the bluefin as an anonymous creature to be force - fed until it is time to drive a spike into its brain ; the auctioneer at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo sees row on row of tailless , icy , tuna - shaped blocks ; Japanese consumers see it as toro , a slice of rich red meat to be eaten with wasabi and soy sauce ; to the biologist , the tuna is a marvel of hydrodynamic engineering , its body packed with modifications that enable it to outeat , outgrow , outswim , outdive , and outmigrate any other fish in the sea ; and to those who wish to rescue Thunnus thynnus from biological oblivion , it has to be seen as a domesticated animal , like a sheep or a cow .
For some , such a shift is almost impossible to contemplate ; the bluefin tuna , the quintessential ocean ranger , the wildest , most powerful fish in the sea , cannot be — and probably should not be —tamed .
But if it remains wild , the future looks bleak for the maguro industry — and for the great bluefin tuna .
This is part three of the Mental Handicap series , see part one here and part two here .
I need to start carrying around a cheap digital camera to start capturing all the idiots that like to abuse handicap parking spaces .
This guy today was an idiot on multiple levels .
Here 's the thing , I was leaving Wal - Mart today after picking up the necessities ( Smirnoff , Jäger , Captain Morgan , Batteries , Cat Food , and Full Throttle ) and as I 'm pushing my cart out , I see a car coming at me , usually not a problem because I 'm in a parking lot , but the problem is that our local Wal - Marts parking lot looks like this :
And I was walking up aisle 4 , which means cars should be coming from behind me , not in front of me .
So as I 'm walking and thinking , wait a second , I 'm not drunk yet , this doesnt seem right .
Then watching this specimen of human evolution try and park in the handicap spot that is very clearly designed for someone coming from another direction , I wanted to yell at him but decided against it .
All the while , he was going back and forth until eventually he was able to pull it off .
The icing on the cake was when just like in Part 1 , we see a fully healthy 20 something year old guy emerge from the car and start to walk in .
Honestly , he took more time to fight his way into an illegal spot , than had he gone the right direction and took a normal spot , for petes sake it 's 10 pm on a Friday night , not many people are taking up the parking spots at Wal - Mart .
So , am I a magnet for stupid people ?
or are there really THAT many dumb people in the world ?
CSS has brought us many capabilities in terms of typography and the web , but we always seem to be limited to the same 4 - 5 typefaces over and over again .
There is an inherant problem , if the font you specify is n’t on the viewers computer it wo n’t render in that font .
So as designers and developers we end up selecting the ones that we can safely assume is available on most computers today .
So most pages use Arial , Helvetica , or Georgia as their typefaces … and the world of the web remains slightly more bland .
But there are quite a few high quality typefaces that are available on most new computer systems and you can always fall back on the common ones .
Of course there are options like creating images , dynamic headlines , and siFR … but all of these techniques increase load time and development time .
There are plenty of good reasons to be strategic in the font choices rather than using additional technology .
I am shocked at how rarely I see anyone taking advantage of these type options , so here is a quick and dirty list of fonts you should and could use in your desgns and stylesheets .
1. Palatino Linotype / Palatino
WINDOWS 97.09 % / MAC 78.86 %
This is a nice serif font that his pretty good support for both Mac and Windows based machines ( 97.09 % of all windows machines have it , and 78.86 % of mac’s ) .
Yet very few people use it and instead default to georgia or times .
As you can see it makes for great headlines , and I have used it with success as copy type as well .
Worse case you can always default back to georgia , times , etc .
2. Tahoma
WINDOWS 96.09 % / MAC 72.02 %
I admit this is not one of my favorite fonts , but it does have many instances where it could be used effectively .
It does n’t seem to get used very often despite the fact that it could be an excellent copy font .
Again there is always Arial or Helvetica if the machine does n’t have Tahoma installed .
3. Impact
WINDOWS 95.85 % / MAC 88.08 %
Admittedly this font probably is overused in non-web related design .
Since it is one of the “ cooler ” default fonts on most machines it tends to get a lot of use .
Despite this fact there are plenty of good places to use it , and it works great for well … “ impactfull ” headlines .
4. Century Gothic
WINDOWS 85.44 % / MAC 42.50 %
This is a nice elegant font that was overused by graphic designers some time ago , but it has been locked away and shunned for some time now .
It may almost be time to pull it back out of the tool chest .
Not a huge percent of Mac systems come with it preinstalled , but most new ones do .
Depending on your target audience this could be the perfect font to use .
If you are worried about the low mac support you could always opt for Futura as well ( which has very high mac support ) .
5. Arial Black
WINDOWS 97.73 % / MAC 96.18 %
Yup you do n’t just have to use plain old Arial .
Arial black is a nice bold font that could be perfect for headings , impacting headlines , and hell even a replacement for the Impact font mentioned above .
I do n’t know that I would use it for body text , but it is an option that should be realized in web typography .
6. Arial Narrow
WINDOWS 87.08 % / MAC 91.01 %
Arial again !
We are not done yet , oh no .
Much like arial black , arial narrow is a great font for headlines .
Instead of the big bold in your face style of headlines you can use this typeface for more elegant subtle headlines .
A nice change from the traditional arial , and can be used much like you would a condensed font .
7. Copperplate / Copperplate Gothic Light
WINDOWS 58.13 % / MAC 85.85 %
I will admit I hate this font , mostly because it is misused ( and people will probably argue that it is not the fonts fault , but the designers ) .
But there are times when it can be used effectively , and it has pretty good support on newer windows computers and most mac based computers .
Most likely it will again be for headlines , larger headlines , as it is not terribly legible at small fonts especially when it is n’t properly aliased .
8. Gill Sans / Gill Sans MT
WINDOWS 43.09 % / MAC 90.82 %
No surprise I like this font .
I think it works both in copy and in headlines , and it has fair support in both platforms .
Anytime you use a font that has about 50 % support rate you want to think about the next logical font to serve , but there are enough options specific to windows that would let you achieve the same typographic message with only subtle differences .
Some scientists believe thatat least one meteorite found in Antarctica preserves evidence of ancient lifeon Mars .
Now , work by a team of English scientists reinforces an earlier suggestionthat evidence of life on the early Earth might be found in meteorites on themoon .
The original idea waspresented in a 2002 paper by University of Washington astronomer JohnArmstrong , who suggested that material ejected from Earth during the Late HeavyBombardment ( a period about four billion years ago when the Earth was subjectedto a rain of asteroids and comets ) might be found on the moon .
Armstrong 's suggestion wasinteresting , but whether a meteor ejected from the Earth might arrive intact onthe moon remained an open question .
New research by a team underIan Crawford and Emily Baldwin of the Birkbeck College School of Earth Sciencesused more sophisticated means to simulate the pressures any such terrestrialmeteorites might have experienced during their arrival on the lunar surface .
Thisconfirmed Armstrong 's hypothesis .
In many cases , the pressures could be low enough topermit the survival of biological markers , making the lunar surface a goodplace to look for evidence of early terrestrial life .
Any such markers areunlikely to remain on Earth , where they would have been erased long ago by morethan three billion years of volcanic activity , later meteor impacts , or simple erosion by wind and rain .
Crash landings
Given that material fromearly Mars has been found in meteorites on Earth , it certainly seems reasonablethat material from the early Earth could be found on the moon .
Indeed , Armstrong 's paper estimated that tens of thousands of tons of terrestrialmeteorites may have arrived there during the Late Heavy Bombardment .
However , there is a problem :
The moon lacks any appreciable atmosphere .
Meteorites arriving on Earth aredecelerated by passing through our atmosphere .
As a result , while the surfaceof the meteorite may melt , the interior is often preserved intact .
Could ameteorite from Earth survive a high - velocity impact on the lunar surface ?
Crawford and Baldwin 's analysis , based on commercially available software called AUTDYN , used finite elementanalysis to simulate the behavior of two different types of meteors impacting the lunar surface .
Armstrong 's group performeda crude calculation indicating that pressures experienced by a terrestrialmeteorite arriving on the moon probably would not be enough to melt it .
Crawford and Baldwin 's group simulated their meteors as cubes , and calculatedpressures at 500 points on the surface of the cube as it impacted the lunar surfaceat a wide range of impact angles and velocities .
In the most extreme casethey tested ( vertical impact at a speed of some 11,180 mph , or 5 kilometers persecond ) , Crawford reports that " some portions " of the simulatedmeteorite would have melted , but " the bulk of the projectile , andespecially the trailing half , was subjected to much lower pressures . "
At impact velocities of 2.5 kilometers per second or less , " no part of the projectile even approacheda peak pressure at which melting would be expected . "
He concludes thatbiomarkers ranging from the presence of organic carbon to " actualmicrofossils " could have survived the relatively low pressures experiencedby the trailing edge of a large meteorite impacting the moon .
Hard to find
Finding terrestrialmeteorites on the moon will be challenging .
Crawford suggests that the key tofinding terrestrial material is to look for water locked inside .
Many mineralson Earth are formed in processes involving water , volcanic activity , or both .
By contrast , the moon lacks both water and volcanoes .
Minerals formed in thepresence of water , called hydrates , can be detected using infrared ( IR ) spectroscopy .
Crawford and his co-authors believe that a high - resolution IRsensor in lunar orbit could be used to detect any large ( over one meter ) hydrate meteorites on the lunar surface , while a lunar rover with such a sensor " could search for smaller meteorites exposed at the surface . "
Other planetary astronomersview the issue more conservatively .
Dr. Mike Gaffey of the University of NorthDakota Space Studies department argues that while " debris from a largeterrestrial impact could have reached the moon ... it 's highly unlikely that itwould be in sufficient concentrations to be seen " using orbitalinstruments .
He believes that themeteorites would be shattered into small pieces by the impact , and then subjectedto a form of lunar weathering due to the solar wind and a continuous rain ofmicrometeoroids that hit the moon .
Instead , he suggests that any surviving materialfrom Earth would be fractured into small pieces embedded in ancient lunarsoils , some of which might be exposed at the surface by later meteor impacts .
Crawford concedes thatpoint , and suggests that it might be necessary to dig below the surface to findterrestrial meteorites .
He adds that collecting samples , observing them on thelunar surface , and picking those that warrant a return to Earth for detailedanalysis " would be greatly facilitated by a human presence on the moon . "
The last U.S. astronaut toset foot on the moon , Dr. Harrison Schmitt , was a geologist .
If current NASAplans for a return to the moon later in this century are fulfilled , perhaps Dr.Schmitt 's successors will search for hydrated rocks , which might unlock themystery of how life began on the Earth .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
For every dollar that the price of fuel increases , costs to the aviation industry go up by $ 1.6 billion .
And if oil hits $ 135 a barrel for the rest of the year , the International Air Transport Association says losses could hit $ 6.1 billion .
The industry , analysts say , is approaching tipping point .
But airlines disagree .
They are fighting back with a host of measures to cut costs and boost revenue .
And as demand for air travel continues to slowly increase worldwide , they believe -- for now at least -- they can keep bouyant .
As Richard Branson , chairman of the Virgin Group told CNN Business Traveller on this month 's show , Virgin Atlantic 's annual fuel bill has risen from £ 250 million three years ago , to £ 1.4 billion this year .
The only way to survive the increase , he says , is to pass the cost onto the consumer .
Last month , both Virgin Atlantic and British Airways ( BA ) announced increases in fuel surcharges on all routes .
Charges for a BA flight of more than nine hours rose by $ 59 ( £ 30 ) per flight to $ 213 ( £ 109 ) .
In the U.S. , United Airlines , American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have all increased domestic roundtrip ticket prices by up to $ 60 .
And budget carrier AirTran raised its coach fares by $ 30 .
For now , says Chris Pickard , aviation industry consultant , carriers can get away with these modest price hikes .
" Legacy carriers had to bring their prices down at the back of the plane to compete with the low cost carriers .
Now they 're going to see how far they can edge these prices back up , " he says .
And with fuel costs still only a small percentage of the premium class fare , increases will have less impact on ticket prices for business travelers .
But consumers will be less tolerant of some of the additional costs airlines are now imposing , he adds .
United and American and US Airways , for example , are planning charges of $ 15 for one checked - in bag , and a further $ 25 for a second .
Other airlines are limiting fees to second checked bags only .
" Passengers not interested in all these add - ons , " says Pickard .
" They want to keep it simple and be told how much it will cost to fly from A to B . "
Airlines are also announcing plans to cut back flights on less profitable routes .
Virgin America said this week that it will cut capacity by 10 percent , Continental Airlines by 11 percent ( in addition to shedding 3,000 jobs ) , and Air Canada by 7 percent .
American Airlines has ditched its New York JFK to London Stansted , as well as its Chicago - Buenos Aires , Chicago - Honolulu , and Boston - San Diego .
And Qantas will reduce capacity on routes serving South East Asia and Japan .
In the past , airlines have also protected themselves against rising costs by locking into fuel prices ahead of time , known as hedging .
British Airways has , for example , hedged an average 65 percent of its fuel needs this year .
But only 30 percent of fuel is hedged for 2009 .
Looking ahead , airlines will have to come up with even more innovative methods to buffer costs .
One option is by reducing fuel burn .
Virgin Atlantic now tows its aircraft to take - off areas at London airports to save up to two tonnes of fuel per flight .
Airlines are also now flying planes at slower speeds to increase fuel efficiency and removing unnecessary weight from planes , for example by switching to lighter weight seats or carrying less water for toilets .
British Airways will strip old paint off aircraft brought in for re-spraying to make them 400 kgs lighter .
Japan Airlines has streamlined its spoons and forks to reduce weight by 2 grams per piece .
Airlines are also investing in more efficient aircraft and many are eagerly waiting for delivery of the delayed Boeing 787 Dreamliner that burns a third less fuel than similar size and range aircraft .
European airlines have also gained efficiency savings through consolidation .
Air France 's merger with KLM , and Lufthansa 's with Swiss International Airlines helped the airlines maximize number of passengers per plane as well as cut back - office costs .
But further consolidation is now looking less likely , say analysts .
United Airlines and U.S. Airways recently dropped merger talks , and before that United and Continental Airlines .
The only merger left on the table is between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines .
As Robert Mann , airline analyst and consultant says , mergers are costly undertakings .
A more attractive option is consolidation through airline alliances .
Airlines work together in an alliance to sell tickets aboard each other 's flights .
A traveler flies one leg of a trip with one airline and the next leg on another .
As a result , the arrangement boosts sales for airlines , without adding costs .
At the end of May , Continental said it was reviewing its membership in the SkyTeam Alliance .
And following its failed merger with United , reports are that it might come together with United under the Star Alliance instead .
All airlines are conscious , however , that all these cost - saving efforts will be worthless as soon as demand falls for their profit - generating premium seats .
But for now , they are hopeful .
As BA 's CEO Willie Walsh told CNN , while demand for premium seats may be declining on short haul flights , on long haul business travelers are staying put at the front of the plane .
" Club World has actually been one of the strongest performances we have seen ever , " he said .
" That justifies our decision to increase capacity in that cabin . "
As Pickard says , while budget airlines will be hit hard given fuel makes up a larger proportion of their overall costs , legacy airlines can still rely on premium ticket sales for some protection .
" Yes we 've seen a few airlines go under in recent months but they are airlines that only had a limited number of services .
The big boys are actually adding capacity , " he says .

Last February , I stumbled across a short news story that — at first glance — seemed only mildly entertaining and mostly innocuous .
It was only interesting because it was weird .
But I can't stop thinking about this particular article .
These are the opening paragraphs , as they appeared online :
London ( AP ) — Answering a nationwide appeal for tall people with athletic potential , more than 50 prospective Olympic athletes have been placed in British training programs for the 2012 London Games .
More than 3,800 people applied to be part of the " Sporting Giants " project .
They were tested for their skills in four Olympic sports — rowing , handball , beach volleyball and indoor volleyball .
Making the cut were 34 rowers , 11 handball players and seven volleyball players .
They have been integrated into various British Olympic training squads .
" There are so many people out there who do n't know how good they could be at sports they 've probably not even thought about , " UK Sport talent identification manager Chelsea Warr said Thursday .
" This was a mild shake of the tree .
We looked under a few rocks and look what we found . "
I find this information fascinating , and not just because I 'm the coauthor of an upcoming 677 - page book tentatively titled Future Legends of British Handball .
What intrigues me is the brilliantly simplistic premise of the British experiment — it eradicated the role of self - selection from the process of achievement .
Now , I realize that sentiment sounds borderline draconian .
But the technique might be rewarding in a lot of contexts that have nothing to do with skeletal frames or volleyball .
The Sporting Giants project operated on the belief that the average tall person in London might not realize he was perfectly designed to excel at an activity he'd never even considered .
It seems possible that this same logic could apply to most human endeavors .
Because most people do n't know what they 're good at .
Imagine you are Tom Cruise in All the Right Moves .
Imagine that your fictional high school experience is almost over .
You have just been thrown off the football team for criticizing Craig T. Nelson 's skepticism of Scientology , and your life will now take one of two paths : Either you will a ) take a job at the local steel mill and remain trapped in your depressing Pennsylvania town , or b ) earn a scholarship and pursue your adolescent love of mechanical engineering .
In the first case , you have no agency over the decision that will define your existence .
In the second situation , you get to pick how you will try to make a living — even though you really have no idea how good an engineer you will be or how much you will enjoy the actual work .
In the former scenario , your life follows the path of least resistance ; in the latter scenario , you 'll invest years of energy and thought toward a vocation you wanted at the age of seventeen but might despise when you 're thirty - seven .
Either way , you 'll inadvertently ignore all the other careers that might suit your skill set far better ( Navy pilot , Nascar driver , annoying Kokomo bartender , bisexual vampire , etc. ) .
Look at it like this :
There are many traits necessary for someone to be a physician , and understanding medicine is chief among them .
But being a good doctor requires countless other things that are difficult to imagine or test for — the way a person interacts with unusually nervous patients , the capacity to diagnose unconventional problems , ethical boundaries , etc .
These details are essential but only tangible in practice .
As a result , medical schools are forced to choose candidates based on academic achievement ( school grades and MCAT scores ) and how effectively an applicant expresses the desire to be a doctor .
But what if the applicants do n't understand their own desires ?
What if the understanding of medicine is only marginally related to the application of medicine ?
We rely on future doctors to select themselves ; we assume the kind of person who would be good at medicine will naturally gravitate toward that craft , and that the type of twenty - one - year - old who 's sharp enough to get into ( and complete ) medical school will be able to adopt all the other skills needed for the job .
This is how most life paths are patterned , medical and otherwise :
We assume people ( somehow ) understand who they are and what they can do .
This is most readily apparent with high - profile public occupations — NBA general managers , FEMA administrators , the U.S. Presidency , and virtually anyone who works in human resources .
It seems like there must be a better way .
I am not suggesting that anyone should be forced to accept a life just because they 're theoretically built for it , nor am I discounting the role that aspiration plays in someone 's success .
But I do wonder if our reliance on self - selection drastically limits the parameters of human potential ( and human happiness ) .
It has been my experience that people are not good at understanding themselves ; they tend to over - or underestimate their intelligence , they consistently behave in ways that contradict their espoused wishes , and when asked directly , they conflate their defining personality traits with how those traits are perceived by others ( optimistic vs. pessimistic ; extroverted vs. introverted , etc. ) .
This is no one 's fault or failing ; it 's simply impossible to be objective or insightful about the person you have always been .
And since this is the case , it should n't be surprising that a ) so many people are unhappy with what they have chosen to do for a living , and b ) so many people are n't particularly good at the functions they 've devoted their lives to .
Moreover , those two issues are almost certainly interrelated .
Try to think of the ten happiest people you know .
How many of those ten are good at what they do for a living ?
People select careers that seem interesting or lucrative , but they only enjoy jobs for which they have an aptitude .
If there were a way to fit people into jobs they 're naturally , unconsciously good at — as opposed to jobs they think they'd want to have — everyone might be better off .
So how could this be done ?
How does one place people in lives they 've never even considered ?
The British Sporting Giants model might not be far off .
It was so rudimentary that it almost seems absurd :
They just examined a few sports and concluded that the single unifying element that most often led to success was physical frame .
Rowing is a sport that requires myriad skills , and it's a sport that short people can sometimes succeed at , but on average , it is a huge advantage to have long arms .
It 's purely mathematical .
And this is something most people do n't consider .
Most long - armed people do not sit around thinking ,
You know , I bet I could totally row the shit out of a narrow watercraft .
No non -rower ever thinks like this .
But place that long - armed man in a boat and he realizes what he was made to do .
So , what if we changed the way we hired people ?
What if instead of having people attempt to select and pursue careers , employers advertised for blind characteristics ?
What if they analyzed the nature of specialized jobs , figured out which qualities were most central to success , and then recruited people who possessed those specific abilities ( regardless of who they were , what they 'd done before , or what they thought they were supposed to do for a living ) ?
Now , I realize they would sometimes be wrong .
In fact , they might be wrong most of the time .
But would they be any less right than you ?

When Bell Canada began throttling P2P access on its network for nine hours a day in an effort to keep the tubes clear , the company probably did n't mean to goad regulators into launching a major net neutrality proceeding that could set the ground rules for ISPs across the country .
But judging from this week 's comments by Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) boss Konrad von Finckenstein , Q.C. , that 's exactly what Bell Canada is about to get .
In a speech this week ( PDF ) , von Finckenstein pointed out that the dispute between Bell Canada and the group of small ISPs that lease wholesale access from it was only " the tip of the iceberg .
Under the heading of ' net neutrality ' lies a whole range of questions affecting consumers and service providers .
Fundamental issues of technology , economics , competition , access and freedom of speech are all involved . "
But will the CRTC take up such questions ?
von Finckenstein certainly hinted that it would , saying , " In the coming year , we will continue to study the issues surrounding net neutrality .
This process could evolve into a major public consultation in order to obtain the views of interested parties .
It is one of the polarizing issues of the day .
It will have to be addressed and debated by all of us . "
Such a proceeding would go far beyond the narrow issue of the day , whether Bell Canada can throttle P2P access on its GAS wholesale service .
That debate also got more interesting this week as the CRTC sent another letter to Bell ( PDF ) demanding that the company publicly release some of the " confidential " data it submitted to CRTC in defense of its practices .
Bell Canada 's throttling lifts only at 2AM
Bell had claimed that data on link utilization thresholds and congestion criteria was commercially sensitive and would only be submitted to the CRTC , not to the ISPs challenging Bell or to the general public .
In its public filings , that data was redacted .
But the CRTC this week told Bell to make the information public , and to do it by June 23 .
" Commission staff has determined , based on all the material before it , that no specific direct harm would likely result from disclosure , " said the CRTC , " or that the public interest in disclosure outweighs any specific direct harm that might result from disclosure , of the information specified in the Attachment to this letter . "
Bell now has until Monday to make available some of the data it used to argue that P2P was creating unacceptable congestion on its network .
The CRTC will rule on the case sometime this autumn .
People , people , people .
This is no scam , and certainly not the ' Ultimate Steal ' .
It is simply good marketing .
By making sure that MSO is the office suite that you know how to use best before you are in a position of authority in a corporate setting , guess which one you will counsel your company to spend uber - bucks on ?
Exactly .
By spending a few cents right now , they know that they will reap big money down the road .
They know that people will ' take advantage ' of their offer .
In fact , I would n't doubt that they are hoping that they will .
They are probably targeting all of those who went to college or university for the simple reason that those people are the ones who will rise highest in any corporation and will be the ones making the buying decisions .
So do n't feel guilty about dusting off that ten year old .edu address ; they are quite happy to have you do so .
As for me , my needs are simply , so I will stick with OpenOffice and Gmail and not burden my system with yet another leviathan that I do n't need or want .
Well , it took longer than 15 days to reach a resolution , but apparently RIM is going to back down and allow the Indian government to monitor the Blackberry network in that country .
What 's worse , it appears that RIM was more interested in covering its own ass than protecting user data during the negotiations : the only concession the company received from the Indian government was a promise that it wo n't be held liable if there 's a leak of users ' personal information .
Yeah , that ought to provide a sparkling incentive to keep things safe .
There 's no word on when monitoring might begin , but we 've got a feeling privacy - loving Indians might suddenly be in the market for a new smartphone .

Although Otlet spent his entire working life in the age before computers , he possessed remarkable foresight into the possibilities of electronic media .
Paradoxically , his vision of a paperless future stemmed from a lifelong fascination with printed books .
Otlet , born in 1868 , did not set foot in a schoolroom until age 12 .
His mother died when he was 3 ; his father was a successful entrepreneur who made a fortune selling trams all over the world .
The senior Otlet kept his son out of school , out of a conviction that classrooms stifled children ’s natural abilities .
Left at home with his tutors and with few friends , the young Otlet lived the life of a solitary bookworm .
Image Credit ... Alex Wright / The New York Times
When he finally entered secondary school , he made straight for the library .
“ I could lock myself into the library and peruse the catalog , which for me was a miracle , ” he later wrote .
Soon after entering school , Otlet took on the role of school librarian .
In the years that followed , Otlet never really left the library .
Though his father pushed him into law school , he soon left the bar to return to his first love , books .
In 1895 , he met a kindred spirit in the future Nobel Prize winner Henri La Fontaine , who joined him in planning to create a master bibliography of all the world ’s published knowledge .
Even in 1895 , such a project marked an act of colossal intellectual hubris .
The two men set out to collect data on every book ever published , along with a vast collection of magazine and journal articles , photographs , posters and all kinds of ephemera  like pamphlets  that libraries typically ignored .
Using 3 by 5 index cards ( then the state of the art in storage technology ) , they went on to create a vast paper database with more than 12 million individual entries .
Otlet and LaFontaine eventually persuaded the Belgian government to support their project , proposing to build a “ city of knowledge ” that would bolster the government ’s bid to become host of the League of Nations .
The government granted them space in a government building , where Otlet expanded the operation .
He hired more staff , and established a fee - based research service that allowed anyone in the world to submit a query via mail or telegraph  a kind of analog search engine .
Inquiries poured in from all over the world , more than 1,500 a year , on topics as diverse as boomerangs and Bulgarian finance .
We have seen some awesome sinks over the years , and at least one that was inspired by geology and topographical maps .
The Ammonite washbasin from HighTech features a similar " organic " theme , but in my opinion , a much more captivating design .
Apparently , Ammonites are an extinct species of cephalopods that existed about 400 million years ago , and their shells are prized by collectors .
When integrated into a concrete sink , this prehistoric design creates a hypnotic spiral of water .
Advertisement
The Ammonite Washbasin is available in 1200 - 1590 x 560 mm ( approx . 47-63 x 22 inches ) dimensions with a basin that measures 64 cm ( about 25 - inches ) .
There is no word on pricing , but my guess is that it would be very expensive to install .
Plus , you may run into trouble with the financing after you get canned for being late to work everyday .
You could easily get caught in a trance watching this sink operate as you brush your teeth in the morning .

Click to view Bill William Gates has only made one presidential - candidate campaign donation this season , and it was to Barack Obama .
Meanwhile , although Steve Jobs ' wife Laurene has given nice sums to each of the three leading Democratic candidates , Barack appears to be the apple of her eye , if you calculate that in terms of dollars .
Steve himself is not in the registry .
What 's more , neither billionaire tech household donated a ( traceable ) penny to any of the Republicans currently running for office .
Update :
We have been informed that the William Gates referred to in the database is actually Bill 's father .
No other William Gates has donated any money to any candidate , and Melinda Gates is listed only as donating to the Microsoft PAC .
As such , I have also changed the image from Bill ' n ' Barack ' n '
Steve to what looks like Barack Obama 's Welcome Back Kotter audition photo , from his campaign site .

Around this time of year , I like to poke around in the MoneyLine campaign donation search tool at Congressional Quarterly 's website .
You can look up anyone you want — campaign donations by law have to be public .
Sometimes the results are clear , as in the case of William Gates , " esecutive " ( sic ) of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .

Things are a tad murkier when it comes to Palo Alto resident Laurene P Jobs :
Given the number of Barack listings , it 's clear that Laurene is a fan .
She might even be too zealous :
Is that - $ 2,300 line item a donation she had to take back for giving too much ?
Even if you nix that and one of the other $ 2,300 items ( for a zero sum ) , Barack appears to be $ 2,300 ahead of both Hillary and John Edwards .
It is possible that I 'm reading this wrong , although I 've doublechecked it as best as I can .
The real lesson here is that anyone can " follow the money . "
Want to have a go ?
Dive in , enjoy democracy and report back any weirdness you might happen upon .

Thousands of Canadians wasted no time protesting the government 's copyright reform bill , piling on to websites and joining internet - based letter - writing campaigns on Friday .
More than 7,000 people joined a Facebook group within a day of the bill 's introduction on Thursday morning , bringing its total membership to more than 48,000 people .
The group — started on the popular social - networking site late last year by Michael Geist , a University of Ottawa internet law professor — is credited for scaring the Conservatives out of introducing the bill in December after initially attracting more than 20,000 members .
Many of the members of the group posted messages on Friday saying they were taking political action in an effort to prevent the controversial legislation from becoming law .
" I just phoned the Liberal Party of Canada and said I would vote Liberal for the first time in my life if they brought down the government over this bill , " Ray Klassen wrote .
" I 've requested a in person meeting with Dawn Black , MP for Coquitlam / New Westminster .
I live only 1 minute from her office up on Austin , " wrote Brian B of Vancouver .
Bill C - 61 , introduced Thursday by Industry Minister Jim Prentice and Heritage Minister Josée Verner , seeks to update Canada 's copyright rules and bring it in line with the country 's obligations under the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty signed more than a decade ago .
The bill spells out Canadians ' rights with respect to digital copying of content , granting permissions to make copies of books , photographs , music and other media .
It found support with a number of entertainment industry groups , including the Entertainment Software Association of Canada and the Canadian Recording Industry Association , who praised it for proposing methods of stopping illegal piracy of copyrighted works .
However , the source of most of the protests is the bill 's anti-circumvention clause , which would allow copyright holders to place digital locks on content and thus prevent copies from being made .
Critics of the proposed legislation say the clause invalidates all of the other rights granted , thus heavily skewing the bill in favour of copyright holders .
Website sends e-mails to MPs
The Facebook group has also splintered into regional sub - groups , each with hundreds of members .
Most of the groups pointed members to Copyright For Canadians , a website run by the Ottawa - based Canadian Internet Policy & Public Interest Clinic , and the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The website has an automated system that allows visitors to send protest e-mails to their respective MPs .
As of Friday afternoon , more than 3,200 messages had been sent .
The copyright bill has set off an unprecedented wave of political activism on the internet in Canada , Geist said .
" What we 've seen over the past 24 hours has been nothing short of remarkable , " he said .
" Literally tens of thousands of Canadians are speaking out with an element of shock that the government would introduce this legislation in the manner that it has . "
One reader of Geist 's blog e-mailed him to say that the bill 's introduction had awakened their sense of political activism .
" Besides voting , I 've never taken action politically , but I 've now got a face - to - face meeting set up with Guy Lauzon , our MP for [ Stormont– Dundas–South Glengarry ] on the 24th , " the reader wrote .
" He 'll know first - hand that this bill , if passed , will cause him to lose votes . "
Other bloggers also tore into the proposed legislation and the government .
Harper campaigner outraged at bill
Robert Phillips , who said he has campaigned on behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and was a former executive of the Brock University Conservative Club , wrote on Friday that he has turned his back on the party .
" Whether it does or does not pass , the fact remains that the party and whatever candidate happens to be in my riding will receive one less vote come the next election , " he wrote .
Many members of the Facebook groups called for rallies to be organized over the summer .
A possible focal point will be the Ontario riding of Guelph , where a by - election must be called by September .
Brenda Chamberlain , a Liberal , currently holds the riding but the Conservatives have targeted her seat .
Students at the nearby University of Waterloo , a hotspot of Canadian technology , could turn the by - election into a proxy battle over the copyright bill .
Geist said the sheer number of people protesting online is likely to translate into protests in the real world .
" You 're going to see the concern and protests build over the summer rather than go away , " he said .
The bill is unlikely to progress much over the next few months as Parliament is due to soon break for its summer session .
When it resumes , the bill will receive its second reading and then be sent off to a committee for closer scrutiny .
The Conservatives could make it a confidence bill , meaning that if opposition parties voted it down , they would force an election .
Members of the Facebook protest group mused over the possibility of the government being brought down by its copyright bill .
" Would n't it be funny if an election was fought over iPods ? " wrote Charles Troster of Vancouver .

US Rep . Wants Bush Impeachment
WASHINGTON , June 10 – Democrat Dennis Kucinich introduced a 35 - count resolution to impeach US President George Bush , saying that the president set out to deceive the nation , and violated his oath of office with the Iraq war .
Addressing the House of Representatives on Monday evening , the Ohio congressman and former presidential candidate accused the administration of a number of offenses , including lying to Congress and the public about its reasons for the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
He said Bush “ fraudulently ” justified the war on Iraq and misled “ the American people and members of Congress to believe Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction so as to manufacture a false case for war . ”
He added , Bush has violated his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of president of the United States , and to the best of his ability preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
“ President George W. Bush , by such conduct , is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office , ” Kucinich said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would not pursue the impeachment of Bush saying it was “ off the table . ”
Kucinich , an outspoken Iraq war critic who has consistently voted against funding the war and led anti-war efforts in Congress , offered a resolution to impeach Vice president Dick Cheney in April 2007 .
That also failed to move forward .
Many Democrats and civil liberties groups have accused the Bush administration of providing misleading information before the 2003 Iraq invasion as well as violating the rights of US citizens with its warrantless surveillance program .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - EU fisheries regulators have banned trawling for bluefin tuna from next week in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean to stop overfishing of a species that is approaching stock collapse , the EU executive said on Friday .

Bluefin tuna is prized by sushi lovers and its numbers have fallen due to overfishing by countries hunting it in those waters -- Cyprus , France , Greece , Italy , Malta , Portugal and Spain .
Last year , their combined national fleets caused the EU to exceed its international catch quota by 25 percent .
Scientists say bluefin tuna may die out if fishing is not restricted .
But the incentive to catch bluefin tuna remains strong , particularly in June , when around 85 percent of the fish are caught .
Since last year , market prices for the delicacy have roughly tripled : in Japan a single fish can cost up to $ 100,000 .
Bluefin tuna are known for their huge size , power and speed .
Maximum weights recorded are in excess of 600 kg .
As of June 16 , vessels flying the flags of Cyprus , France , Greece , Italy and Malta will be prohibited from fishing for bluefin tuna in either Mediterranean or eastern Atlantic waters .
A similar ban goes into force for Spain on June 23 .
It was not immediately clear if or when Portugal would be subject to a ban .
The bans apply to vessels that use a “ purse seine ” , a type of net that floats the top of a long wall of netting on the surface while its bottom is held weighted under the water .
The European Commission , the EU executive , regulates fishing quotas for member states and also negotiates international fisheries agreements on their behalf .
“ The Commission is determined to use all necessary means to prevent a recurrence of the substantial overfishing seen in 2007 , ” it said in a statement .
“ Last year , overfishing was largely driven by the industrial purse seine sector of the fleet , which takes more than 70 percent of the total catch . ”
France ’s Agriculture Ministry said minister Michel Barnier had expressed his objection to the decision to the EU and called for a meeting of an expert committee to help clarify the use of quotas in the countries concerned .
Environment group WWF was unimpressed with the later date for Spain ’s ban and said the poor state of stocks should have prevented trawling this year altogether .
“ Overfishing and massive illegal catches threaten the survival of bluefin tuna .
Fishing should be banned indefinitely at least during June , the key spawning month for Mediterranean bluefin tuna , ” Aaron McLoughlin , head of WWF ’s European Marine Program , said in a statement .
Commission experts say the EU ’s fishing capacity is so large and bluefin tuna trawling activity so concentrated in June that the EU quota can be exhausted in just two days of fishing .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is said to be al - Qaeda 's number three
The alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the US and four other key suspects have appeared at a military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 , dismissed the trial as an " inquisition " .
He said he had had five years " under torture " and wished to become a martyr .
All five men face the death penalty if convicted by the US tribunal in Cuba .
Correspondents say the hearing raises questions about military commissions .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale , one of 60 international journalists at the hearing , said it was the first time Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been seen in public since his capture .
He said his appearance had changed dramatically since a photograph at the time of his arrest showing him dishevelled and unshaven .
The five defendants were all dressed in white , traditional Arab dress .
Only defendant Ramzi Binalshibh was shackled .
I 'm looking to be a martyr for long time
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
Eyewitness : Trial opens Marine Col Ralph Kohlmann , presiding over the hearing , told Khalid Sheikh Mohammed he faced the death sentence if convicted .
" That is what I want , I 'm looking to be a martyr for long time , " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed replied .
Our correspondent says the alleged terror mastermind started singing an Arabic prayer , translated into English as " God is all sufficient " .
Despite a warning from the judge against representing himself , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said he could not accept any attorney " who was part of the evil US constitution " .
The US describes Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , believed to have been al - Qaeda 's third in command , as " one of history 's most infamous terrorists " .
Mr Binalshibh is a Yemeni man described by the US as the co-ordinator of the 9/11 attacks , who , according to intelligence officials , was supposed to be one of the hijackers , but was unable to get a US visa
He also told the court he wished to be " martyred " .
" I have been seeking martyrdom for five years , " he said .
Waterboarding
Following his arrest he was held at a CIA secret prison , where he was subjected to harsh interrogation techniques and a practice known as waterboarding , that simulates drowning , until he was moved to Guantanamo Bay two years ago .
The US military says that as well as admitting involvement in the 11 September 2001 attacks on Washington and New York , he has confessed to being involved in more than 30 terrorist plots around the world , including plans to attack London 's Big Ben and Canary Wharf .
Appearing alongside Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mr Binalshibh are : Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi , a Saudi man said by US intelligence officials to be one of two key financial people used by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to arrange the funding for the 11 September hijackings
Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali , also known as Amar al - Balochi , who is accused of serving as a key lieutenant to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - his uncle - during the 11 September plot
Walid Bin Attash , a Yemeni national who , according to the Pentagon , has admitted masterminding the bombing of the American destroyer , USS Cole , in Yemen in 2000 , which killed 17 sailors , and is who is accused of involvement in the 11 September 2001 attacks
The charges against them list " 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the September 11 events " .
The charges , which include 2,973 individual counts of murder - one for each person killed in the 9/11 attacks - are the first directly related to the 9/11 attacks to be brought against any Guantanamo inmates .
The five are among 19 prisoners due to face the military tribunals , which were set up in the wake of 9/11 to try non-US prisoners who have been classed as " enemy combatants " by the White House and therefore deemed to not be entitled to the legal rights normally afforded to prisoners .
Justice in the dock
The trials have already raised questions about not just the treatment of detainees , but also the legitimacy of American military commissions .
The trials are taking place in Camp Justice , a complex set up on the base
The US authorities say they have bent over backwards to make sure that the trials are fair but some of its own lawyers have already condemned the process as fundamentally flawed .
Human Rights Watch , a New York - based organisation , says the system lacks credibility given much of the evidence had been obtained through harsh interrogation techniques .
Later this month , the US Supreme Court is to rule on the rights of prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay , threatening a possible delay or even halt to the proceedings .
The court ruled in 2006 that an earlier tribunal system was unconstitutional .

Calcium is important for the health of your bones , including the vertebrae in your spine .
For people who need to limit or avoid dairy because of lactose intolerance , getting enough calcium can be a challenge .
To reduce the risk for complications related to low bone density , such as osteoporosis and vertebral fractures , try these tips to get enough calcium without cheese or other dairy products .
1 . Start the day with oatmeal .
One packet of unsweetened instant oatmeal makes for a convenient breakfast and contains over 100 mg of calcium , about 10 % of the 1000 mg to 1200 mg daily recommended amount for adults .
Read the label first and make sure there ’s added nutrients but no added sugar .
Eat it with almond milk or soy milk for extra calcium .
2 . Get enough vitamin D .
Vitamin D helps the body absorb and store calcium .
Without enough vitamin D , your body starts taking calcium from your bones , weakening them .
Eating eggs , fatty fish ( such as salmon ) , and cereal with vitamin D added are all ways to get the recommended amount of vitamin D , which is 600 international units ( IU ) per day ( or 800 IU for people over age 70 ) .
Spending time in the sunlight helps your body to absorb vitamin D naturally .
Even 5 to 10 minutes of sun exposure per day can help increase your vitamin D intake .
See Calcium and Vitamin D Requirements

3 . Have an orange .
An orange is one of the more calcium - rich fruits .
One orange ( 150 g ) has about 60 mg of calcium .
Another option could be to drink a small glass of orange juice that has been fortified with calcium and vitamin D ( but no added sugars ) .
See Food for Thought : Diet and Nutrition for a Healthy Back
4. Snack on nuts .
Nuts are a rich source of calcium .
A half cup of unroasted almonds contains over 130 mg of calcium .
Pistachios and walnuts have about 65 mg of calcium per half cup .
Nuts make a good addition to meals , such as sprinkling on oatmeal in the morning .
They can also be an easy on - the - go snack .
5 . Try tofu .
A half cup of firm tofu ( processed with calcium salt ) has over 200 mg of calcium .
This food option , made from soy milk , is low in calories but high in protein , and it can be used in a variety of dishes .
Just remember to check the food label first as tofu calcium levels can vary greatly .
6 . Have a side of beans .
A half cup of canned baked beans provides more than 40 mg of calcium .
And a half cup of white beans has more than twice that much .
Eat them on their own or add them to a low - sodium soup .
See Lifestyle and Diet Tips for Healthy Bones
7 . Do n’t forget leafy greens .
Eating leafy greens can help you meet the recommended daily intake of calcium .
Some leafy greens with higher calcium contents include :
Kale
Bok choy
Turnip greens
You can also swap out iceberg lettuce for raw spinach ( which has more calcium ) on your sandwiches and in your salads .
8 . Add seeds to your diet .
Seeds are dense with calcium .
A single ounce of chia seeds has 179 mg of calcium , and they work well as an oatmeal topping .
Poppy seeds have 127 mg of calcium per tablespoon .
If you enjoy baking , look for ways to incorporate these seeds as ingredients .

9 . Eat canned seafood .
Canned seafood is packed with calcium .
A 1 - oz portion of canned sardines or shrimp typically has more than 100 mg of calcium .
A 1 - oz portion of canned salmon has 62 mg of calcium , and it ’s an excellent source of omega - 3 fatty acids , too .

10 . Consider taking a calcium supplement .
If you ca n’t get enough calcium through diet alone , you may want to consider adding over - the - counter calcium supplements to your daily routine .
Talk to your doctor or a pharmacist about calcium supplements they recommend for you .

Using powerful radio telescopes , scientists have captured a supermassive black hole just as it was belching out a jet of supercharged particles , offering a first look at how these cosmic jets are formed .
Supermassive black holes form the core of many galaxies and astronomers have long believed they were responsible for ejecting jets of particles at nearly the speed of light .
But just how they did it had remained a mystery .
An international team of researchers led by Professor Alan Marscher of Boston University just got its first peek .
Professor Marscher 's team aimed the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Long Baseline Array , a system of 10 radio telescopes , at the galaxy BL Lacertae .
A kind of supermassive black hole known as a blazar was suspected of spewing out a pair of forceful streams of plasma some 950 million light years from Earth .
A light year , the distance light travels in a year , is about 9.65 trillion kilometres .
What they saw was a close up of this charged material winding in corkscrew fashion out of the supermassive black hole , behaving just as astronomers had predicted .
" We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the particles actually are accelerated , " Professor Marscher , whose study appears in the journal Nature , said in a statement .
" It helps us understand how these objects are able to accelerate particles up to the near velocity of light , " said University of Michigan astronomy Professor Hugh Aller , who worked on the project .
A black hole is a concentration of mass so dense that little can escape its gravitational pull .
Professor
Aller said in a telephone interview that as objects fall into the black hole , others get shot out at very high velocities .
But the trick is capturing enough data at the right time to study how this works .
" We never know when these objects will go off .
It depends on when the object falls into it , " Professor Aller said .
He said the acceleration process is similar to the output of a jet engine .
" We think it is focused by a nozzle of sorts and it comes out at us . "

WINNIPEG–She freely admits that her 7 - year - old daughter was sent to school sporting a swastika – the Nazi emblem adopted as a symbol of racially motivated hate groups .
She says she 's not a neo - Nazi , just proud of her northern European heritage .
Now she 's fighting to get her children back from Manitoba Child and Family Services , and finding herself at the centre of a case that has raised questions about whether children are affected by parental views that may be extreme .
In an interview yesterday , the woman , who under provincial law cannot be identified , said her politics are misunderstood .
" This is n't , you know , a bunch of ... skinheads running around the streets in neo - Nazi gear , " she said .
" It 's not about that .
It 's about being proud of who you are and what you are , and I do n't have a problem with anybody feeling pride in who they are . "
School officials called social services in March after the girl showed up with what police call " hate - related drawings " on her body , including a swastika .
Child welfare workers removed the girl and a 2 - year - old boy from the woman 's Winnipeg home .
The government is now asking the courts for permanent guardianship of the children .
An affidavit from a child welfare worker cites the " behaviour and associations " of the woman and her husband as one reason for the removal , as well as drug and alcohol use .
The mother remembers the day her child left for school with a swastika on her body .
She would n't discuss details but hinted she had not drawn the symbol .
" I worked a lot .
I 'm not going to say I was ignorant to it , ' cause I was n't , " she said .
" That 's all I 'm going to ... comment . "
The woman says she threw her husband – the stepfather of the girl and biological father of the boy – out of the family home three days after seeing court documents outlining the case against the family .
She says she has always worked long hours at her job in the restaurant industry to provide for her children and has never let her politics affect how her kids are raised .
She is vague about her political beliefs .
" I would never consider myself a neo - Nazi , " she said .
" I consider myself a proud Scottish chick . "
She says she does not belong to any group , yet has a personal belief in white pride and talks collectively about a feeling that " people are very ignorant to our politics because of media bias . "
She also defends the use of the swastika , pointing out that it is based on an ancient symbol for prosperity .
She rejects a suggestion that someone seeing it drawn on a child would be unlikely to interpret it as anything other than a Nazi image .
So how far can parents go in teaching their children what they think is right ?

Harvey Frankel , a professor of social work at the University of Manitoba , said earlier this week that the government could face an uphill battle trying to persuade a judge to remove children strictly because of their parents ' political beliefs .
Manitoba guidelines allow child welfare workers to intervene in any situation where there is concern for the safety or well - being of a child .
That could cover instances where the controversial beliefs cause the children problems at school or elsewhere .
Broadcasters have overcompensated for their lack of executives from ethnic minorities by putting too many black and Asian faces on screen , a leading television industry figure said last night .
Samir Shah , a member of the BBC 's board of directors , said this had led to a " world of deracinated coloured people flickering across our screens - to the irritation of many viewers and the embarrassment of the very people such actions are meant to appease " .
Shah , a former BBC head of current affairs who now runs an independent production company , Juniper , as well as being a non-executive director of the corporation , used a speech to the Royal Television Society to call for current TV industry diversity policies to be ditched because they were not working .
In an echo of the speech earlier this year by comedian Lenny Henry , who bemoaned the lack of diversity in British broadcasting , Shah said UK television had to go back to the drawing board to increase the number of black and Asian executives .
Speaking to an audience of television insiders , Shah said : " The difficult truth I want you to accept is this : the equal opportunity policies we have followed over the last 30 years simply have not worked .
" Despite 30 years of trying , the upper reaches of our industry , the positions of real creative power in British broadcasting , are still controlled by a metropolitan , largely liberal , white , middle - class , cultural elite - and , until recently , largely male and largely Oxbridge .
" The fine intentions of equal opportunities - and they are fine intentions - have produced a forest of initiatives , schemes and action plans .
But they have not resulted in real change .
" The result has been a growing resentment and irritation at the straitjacket on freedom such policies impose and , paradoxically , the occasionally embarrassing over - compensation in an effort to do the right thing . "
Shah said that instead of dealing with the issues surrounding why greater numbers of people from ethnic minorities had not made it to the executive level of British television , broadcasters had instead put more black and Asian faces on screen , regardless of whether they were cultural fits to the programmes they were in .
" I do n't think that such over - representation is a brilliant idea .
Another thing that 's not real is some of the casting of non-whites in fiction , " he added .
He pointed to the casting of the Ferreira family in EastEnders as an example .
" If you were to cast an Asian family in the East End , it should have been Bangladeshi .
Instead we had a family of Goan descent , " Shah said .
" The plain fact is that this tick - box approach to equal opportunities has led to an inauthentic representation of who we are : a world of deracinated coloured people flickering across our screens - to the irritation of many viewers and the embarrassment of the very people such actions are meant to appease . "
Shah said the reason there were so few executives from ethnic minority backgrounds in broadcasting was not because of institutional racism , but because managers liked to " clone " themselves when picking other senior staff .
" The search for comfort can take precedence over the search for the best , because cultural cloning carries no immediate cost , " he added .
Shah said that when recruiting new senior staff , managers should think about the diversity of their team .
He added if he had a " magic wand " , he would " make it incumbent on every major broadcaster and producer in the UK that , within five years , they need to demonstrate that their team of executives with real power over airtime or commissioning budgets come from a variety of different backgrounds , life experiences and ethnicity " .
Shah said that if the UK TV industry did not change , then further regulation might force reform upon it .
" If you want to avoid that happening , then maybe the industry ought to start taking really seriously the need to tackle institutional cloning , " he added .
" We urgently need to break the cultural hegemony that has dominated broadcasting in Britain if we are to tap into , and not lose , the creativity among all our people .
It 's time to force the change , before the change is forced upon you . "

Al Qaeda Supporters ' Tape to Call for Use of WMDs Authorities : a new tape to urge use of weapons of mass destrution on civilians .
May 27 , 2008  --
Intelligence and law enforcement sources tell ABC
News they are expecting al Qaeda supporters will post a new video on the Internet in the next 24 hours , calling for what one source said is " jihadists to use biological , chemical and nuclear weapons to attack the West . "
" There have been several reports that al Qaeda will release a new message calling for the use of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) against civilians , " FBI spokesman Richard Kolko told ABC News in an e-mail .
" Although there have been similar messages in the past , the FBI and [ Department of Homeland Security ] have no intelligence of any specific plot or indication of a threat to the U.S. , " the e-mail said .
" The FBI and U.S. intelligence community will review the message for any intelligence value . "
While there is no evidence of any direct threat , the FBI sent a bulletin to 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country , out of an abundance of caution .
Some independent analysts do n't think the public should worry much .
Ben Venzke , the CEO of IntelCenter , a group that monitors terrorist communications on the Web , said the video , entitled " Nuclear Jihad , The Ultimate Terror , " is a jihadi supporter video compilation and not from an official group .
" Supporter videos are made by fans or supporters who may not have ever had any contact with a real terrorist , " Venzke said .
" These videos almost always are comprised of old video footage that is edited together to make a new video . "
He said the material in these types of videos does not qualify as an official message from al Qaeda or any other group .
" Considering them so would be the equivalent of considering a 10 - year - old 's homemade fan video of his favorite sports team to be an official team message , " Venzke said .
" IntelCenter is not aware of any new imminent message by al - Qaeda or any other leading jihadist group in audio or video form that will call for the use of WMD against civilians . "
Word of the new tape comes on the heels of a spate of messages from Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda 's second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
Earlier this month , al Qaeda released an audio message from bin Laden , excoriating the media and countries that are supportive of Israel .
The release was timed to coincide with the nation 's 60th anniversary and President Bush 's trip to the region .
So far this year , four bin Laden tapes have surfaced .
In April , the terror group released audio recordings in which al - Zawahiri answered questions submitted to an online forum several months earlier .
The increasing volume of tapes seems to signal to the law enforcement and intelligence communities that top al Qaeda leadership is comfortable monitoring current events and communicating messages frequently .
Officials have tracked the trend , but FBI director Robert Mueller downplayed the surge of messages during an appearance earlier this month , noting that " there is a difference between al Qaeda 's ability to communicate internally and al Qaeda 's ability to post a message on the Internet .
As we all know , the Internet is so broad .
The access is absolutely open that just about anybody can post material on the Internet . "
Angelina Jolie's Candid Q and A , Entertainment Weekly Cover Photos
did an interview for Entertainment Weekly that provides some insight into the wonderfully wacky world of the Jolie Pitt camp .
The six page conversation with Jolie covers a wide range of topics , including her pregnancy , her relationship with an ex husband and the group dynamic of so many children .
In one of the photographs taken for the EW story , Angelina is wearing a necklace that Brad Pitt had made for Mother 's Day .
The tiny machine gun was crafted from a drawing 6 year old Maddox created .
The couple say that he is all about guns and war and they were both taken with how well he captured his subject matter .
Some might try to steer a kid away from these concepts but Angie is a free thinker , who claims to be fascinated by blood , tattoos and knives .
Jolie says that Brad 's parents are planning to come to France to help with the children when the new babies arrive .
They are reportedly poised and ready to come at a moments notice .
Angelina admits that she and Brad were really taken aback when they found out she was expecting twins but quickly recovered .
The biggest drawback at the moment is not being able to bend down to pick up the kids .
She has always enjoyed toting them around and now has to rely on Brad to lift the kids into her arms , though he doctor has advised against it .
Jolie shared the Jolie - Pitt weekly ritual of ' family sleep ' .
One night a week they all climb into one big bed and watch movies and sleep together .
That may work for now but with two more on the way it could prove challenging .
Angelina says they try to give each child his or her own time each day .
Shiloh gets up earlier than the other kids so that is her time .
Maddox gets the last half hour of the day because he has the latest kid bedtime .
Pax and Zahara are squeezed in during the day .
Angelina discusses her upcoming movie Wanted which has her cast in the role of an assassin .
The film release is slated for June 27 .
She will obviously not be able to do any promoting .
Perhaps the timing was intended to coincide with the birth of her children , which will probably work just as well at revving up interest in the project .
The Changling received critical acclaim at Cannes Film Festival and will release in late October .
By then Jolie should be able to actively participate in premiere activities .
The next big role for Angelina will be the birth of her twins .
The blessed event is expected to send shock waves around the globe .
If only we knew when .

In April 2007 , a Columbia graduate student was raped and tortured for 19 hours in her Hamilton Terrace apartment .
More than a year later , her suspected rapist is now in court , facing 71 criminal charges including attempted murder , arson , rape and sodomy .
Assistant District Attorney Ann Prunty describe the harrowing ordeal in her opening statement .
From the NY Times :
Over many torturous hours , [ the victim ] had been repeatedly raped , sodomized and forced to perform oral sex , a prosecutor told a jury on Thursday .
The accused , Robert A. Williams , 31 , had doused the woman ’s face and body with boiling water and bleach , forced her to swallow handfuls of pills and to chase them with beer , sealed her mouth with glue , and bound her wrists and legs with shoelaces , cords and duct tape , said the prosecutor , Ann P. Prunty .
And now , Ms. Prunty said , he was asking the woman to gouge out her own eyes with a pair of scissors .
Williams allegedly wanted her to blind herself , so she would not be able to identify him .
The victim ended up trying to stab her neck , and Williams allegedly continued his abuse , using a butcher knife , to , as Prunty said , " slice into her face and eyelids , carving and disfiguring her face . "
The victim passed out from the pills and awoke to find her futon on fire -- her attacker meant to kill her , but she managed to burn through the ties of her bound hands and escape to find help .
Police conducted a manhunt to find Williams , 31 , who has a criminal history including attempted murder ( twice ) and assault .
He was found a week later when he tried to break into a Queens apartment ; residents there stopped him and called the police .
One said , " If we had known he was a rapist , he would n't have made it off this block . "
Police have previously said they have DNA evidence linked Williams to the rape , but his defense attorney has previously said he was argue his client is mentally ill ( though psychological exams found Williams fit for trial ) .
The victim is expected to testify today and the trial will continue throughout next week .
OPW INTERVIEW -- May 24 -- FriendScout24 is the top internet dating site in Germany and Switzerland and ranked # 3 in Spain .
See rankings .
Here 's our interview with the CEO , Christoph Mempel .
- Mark Brooks
What is FriendScout24 's founding story ?
FriendScout24 was founded 1997 under the name People United by private founders in Cologne .
In 2000 , People United was acquired by the Scout24 group , a private finance company , and was renamed FriendScout24 .
The company then moved from Cologne to Munich , where most of the Scout24 companies are located .
In 2003 , the Deutsche Telekom Group , the largest telecommunications group in Germany , which has an internet presence , bought the whole Scout24 group , including FriendScout24 .
How many people work at FriendScout24 now ?
Right now we have 90 employees , and we think by the end of the year there will be about 110 .
We are constantly growing .
To give you an idea of our development : we started with 5 to 10 people after the acquisition by Scout24 .
How would you characterize FriendScout24 against your competition , and how is the service different ?
In Germany , we have with 7 millon members the largest database of singles .
FriendScout24 is the market leader and stands for reliable and first class service .
For example , we constantly work to secure the authenticity of the user profiles .
We want to offer our users everything they need , to get the best chance of finding the right partner by offering them a big variety of interesting singles .
I think this is the most important thing to know about FriendScout24 .
I see you 're in Germany and Spain , Italy , Austria and Switzerland .
With your top 3 positions in Germany , Spain and Switzerland , how are things going in Italy , which I hear is the emerging market for Internet dating .
This year , we could add the Netherlands to that list .
We launched our service in the Netherlands at the end of January .
Regarding the Italian market , we 're doing quite well .
We entered Italy almost a year ago and the market situation is similiar to Spain .
The challenge right now is getting more and more online traffic in Italy .
We support our brand with a lot of press work , furthermore we are working on identifying different channels , which we can use to push the online traffic and the business opportunities in Italy in general .
How have you reached out to users via mobile phones ?
In Germany , we launched a mobile application very early and we were one of the first companies to implement such a service .
However , this was no focus for our business for quite a while , because the technical development of mobile phones was not that fast .
Now it is emerging again .
Therefore we will extend our mobile application features , and will also implement new product innovations in this field .
Have you also considered launching applications on social networks such as Facebook and other local networks ?
It 's interesting that you ask , as this is also on our list this year .
We believe , that this is not a big topic right now .
In Germany , the social network companies , including Facebook , are ready to start with a German site and there are further popular sites , e.g. StudiVZ .
We are monitoring this segment of the market very seriously and will - based on the developments - check the appreciation for such applications .
One of the arguments that I hear time and time again is that social networking is pulling people away from the Internet dating market .
Is that true or do you think the two can work together ?
I think they can work together .
We do n't see a shift in people going away from dating sites to social network sites and I believe it 's still a different business .
Two years ago , when the hype about social communities started , we were n't sure if there would be an impact on our work and if this would draw a lot of users from our sites .
In reality , we can't see a big impact of social communities on our work , because the focus is quite different .
Besides , social networks are successful in Germany , and especially StudiVZ , in terms of page impressions , is a very highly ranked site , regarding the younger target group .
However , our members are not only looking for a social network , but also for a targeted search of a soulmate .
We have 9,000 registrations daily , so they do n't appear to be a real threat .
What are your goals for FriendScout24 over the coming year ?
One of our main goals for this year is to secure and expand our market leadership in Germany .
We see a market consolidation right now in Germany .
For the last 3 – 4 years everyone expected a consolidation , but it did n't happen in Germany .
Therefore it is important for us , to keep and to strengthen our position .
There is a lot going on in the German market .
I 'm sure you 're informed about Meetic , which acquired Neu.de , a big player in Germany .
A second goal is to expand our European presence .
We have a few other countries on our list to launch our product this year .
Talking about product innovation , we do have a lot of convenient features for our users .
It 's our main focus , to offer a big variety of attractive features which make it easy , fun and successful to find a partner .
Ted Adams — the publisher of IDW comics — named his little son " Sam Adams , " a good , solid patriotic name .
It 's also a name on the TSA 's no -fly list , and the five - year - old has spent his young life being harassed by airport security goons who think he 's a terrorist .
Saw the article you posted on Boing Boing about the five year old on the no-fly list .
My son , also five , is on that same list and it's a nightmare .
Every time we fly with him , we can't use the computer terminals to check in and the attendant has to call some never named government agency to make sure he 's not a terrorist .
Some attendants joke it off but some are insanely serious about it .
His seat always goes unassigned ( even if it was assigned when the reservation is made ) which always causes problems .
I 've tried everything that anyone has suggested .
There 's a TSA form that you can fill out for this situation , which I did , but they wo n't tell you if they 've removed your name .
We got him a passport — that did n't work .
We 've tried booking the tickets with his full name ( including middle name ) , that did n't work .
We tried booking the ticket under Master Samuel Adams , with still no luck .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
Sat on the start grid , foot poised over the accelerator , you wait for the row of red lights to extinguish .
Alongside you are top names like Lewis Hamilton , Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen .
The cars ' engines are screaming and everyone is poised to go .
For any Formula
One fan the chance to race against their heroes would be a dream come true .
Sadly , the closest most of us have ever got is watching the Grand Prix on television .
But that could soon change if a company from the Netherlands has its way .
" It 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said Andy Lurling , founder of iOpener Media .
The patented system his company is developing sucks in real - time GPS data from racing events and pumps it out to compatible games consoles and PCs .
The idea is that you could pit yourself against the top drivers in the world , as it happens , from the comfort of your living room .
" You can compete against the best of the best , " he told BBC News .
' Hardcore appeal '
And if all of this sounds far fetched , think again .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) was so impressed with his proposal , it gave Mr Lurling 's company a grant to develop a proof of concept .
A German venture capitalist has stumped up cash to develop it further .
Driving the boundaries of realism
He has already tested it with an F1 car and plans to have the first games on the market as early as September this year .
" At this point we have lots of interest and we are looking for the right partner to launch , " he said .
The firm is currently in talks with six developers about using the technology .
Gareth Wilson , design manager at Bizarre Creations , makers of the Project Gotham Racing series , says he thinks games with the real - time feature would " excite a hardcore minority of gamers " .
" Formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays , compared to their more arcade - style heyday in the late 90s , " he told BBC News .
" This sort of feature would probably appeal to the hardcore gamer or F1 fan more than a mass market gamer .
" Having said that , the hardcore would totally love it . "
Bizarre Creations is not currently one of the firms evaluating the system .
Precision position
At the core of iOpener 's technology is an enhanced GPS system known as differential GPS ( DGPS ) .
This uses a network of fixed base stations to correct the GPS signal , which on its own may only be accurate to within 10 m .
DGPS is commonly used for air navigation or shipping where precision is key .
1 . Car position located with Global Navigation Satellite Systems 2 .
Location data and car telemetry is beamed to a track side server 3 .
Data is tagged with unique ID of the car and sent over the internet 4 .
Information stored on servers and " mediacast " to gamers .
Whole process from car to gamer takes less than five seconds " With that we know the location and the velocity of the car , " explained Mr Lurling .
As further precision is needed , iOpener can use information from the European EGNOS network , which augments GPS satellite signals to provide positional data accurate to within 2 m .
Other tweaks include fitting cars with an inertial measurement unit ( IMU ) , commonly used in guided missile systems , which measure acceleration , angle and yaw of the object .
" IMUs give accuracy on a short range , " Mr Lurling told BBC News .
" Combined with DGPS , we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres . "
In addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the GPS receiver .
" That is already good enough data for a game , " he said .
Telemetry is commonly collected by track - side engineers to monitor the vehicles ' performance and can include information such as acceleration and what gear the car is in .
It has already used by games developers to build more realistic simulations .
Designers at Bizarre Creations used the telemetry to generate accurate track models for early F1 games , before detailed circuit maps existed , for example .
From the track side , the data is sent over the net to a server farm , where it is saved before being pumped out - or " mediacast " - to eager gamers .
The delay between collecting the data and the gamer being immersed in it is up to five seconds , similar to the lag on a TV broadcast .
" We also store the data , so not only can you play the game in real time , but you can replay races at a later date , " said Mr Lurling .
Intelligent gaming
The company does not intend to develop its own games ; rather it will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
But it will provide some software ; specifically an artificial intelligence ( AI ) program to make sure that the virtual and real worlds blend seamlessly .
Artificial intelligence handles collisions between real and virtual drivers " If Hamilton is driving behind you he can't see you [ in the game ] , so he would drive right through you , " explained Mr Lurling .
" So the AI takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking . "
The system also handles the results of in - game collisions between real and virtual drivers .
In this case , the real car always drives away .
The gamer 's fate is less certain .
" We go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right , " he said .
Mr Wilson agrees with this approach .
" There is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games - even the most ' realistic ' simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun , " he said .
However , even with the AI , he thinks gamers may encounter a more fundamental frustration with the system .
" I know I would n't even get close to the lap times that Lewis Hamilton could run , unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power - which might defeat the point , " he said .
At the moment , iOpener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports .
" You can think of biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding , " said Mr Lurling .
" In the next three to five years , we believe that games will not be ' triple A ' games unless they have our feature in , " he said .
Mr Lurling was the 2006 Dutch regional winner of the European Satellite Navigation Competition ( Galileo Masters ) which aims to find novel uses for location data .
The 2008 competition is now open to entries , until 31 July .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. unemployment rate jumped by half a percentage point in May -- to 5.5 % , the highest since October 2004 -- on the biggest increase in seasonally adjusted unemployment in 33 years , government data showed Friday .
Nonfarm payrolls fell by 49,000 last month , the Labor Department reported , marking the fifth consecutive decrease and in line with expectations of economists .
See Economic Calendar .
It " looks a lot like a recession to us , " wrote Joseph Brusuelas , chief economist for Merk Investments .
Employment is one of the main indicators used to judge whether the economy is growing or contracting .
The economy has lost 324,000 jobs this year , according to the government 's survey of some 400,000 work sites .
Job losses in March and April were revised lower by 15,000 .
Unemployment rose by 861,000 in May to a total of 8.5 million , according to a separate survey of about 60,000 households .
It was the biggest one - month increase in unemployment since January 1975 .
Read the full government report .
The half - percentage - point increase in the jobless rate was a shock to economists , who expected a much smaller gain to 5.1 % .
It was the biggest percentage - point gain in unemployment since 1986 .
The very weak report undercuts the argument put forth by some analysts who had said the economy was n't in a recession because the unemployment rate had remained so low .
The employment participation rate rose to 66.2 % from 66 % , indicating that more people wanted jobs in the month .
The employment - to - population ratio dipped to 62.6 % , off from 62.7 % .
However , the employment report is likely to have little impact on the Federal Open Market Committee , which meets in three weeks to set the policy interest - rate target .
Analysts expect no change in the FOMC 's 2.0 % federal funds target rate in the near future .
Fed officials have said they believe the economy and the job market are likely to worsen in coming months before bouncing back by the end of the year .
Several economists said the report would probably keep the FOMC on hold for the rest of the year .
" This will take away the market 's expectation of an increase or two by the end of the year , " said Robert MacIntosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance , in an interview with MarketWatch Radio Network .
Listen to the interview .
Some weakness , some improvement
In May , job losses were concentrated in construction , manufacturing , retail and temporary - help jobs .
Construction jobs fell by 34,000 , while factory jobs declined by 26,000 , retail - sector positions contracted by 27,000 and temporary jobs dropped 30,000 .
There were a few bright spots for hiring .
Health care added 34,000 jobs , and government hired 17,000 additional workers .
Of the 274 industries tracked in the Labor Department survey , 45.4 % were hiring in May .
And of 84 manufacturing industries , 33.3 % were hiring .
The average work week last month was unchanged at 33.7 hours .
Total hours worked in the economy dropped by 0.1 % .
Average hourly earnings rose 5 cents , or 0.3 % , to $ 17.94 .
Average wages were up 3.5 % in the past year , falling short of the increase in consumer prices .
After the tax rebates come and go , " consumers will have nothing left to fall back on , " wrote Joshua Shapiro , chief economist for MFR Inc .
" The spike in the unemployment rate to 5.5 % from 5.0 % a month ago is like a tsunami hitting our economy , " said Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , who again urged the White House to support an extension of unemployment benefits .
The number of people who 've been out of work longer than 26 weeks rose by 197,000 to 1.55 million .
Statistical noise ?
The government cautioned that the scope of the increase in the unemployment rate in May could be a statistical distortion .
Month - to - month changes from April through July can be hard to adjust seasonally .
" There is a substantial flow of workers , particularly young workers , into the labor force during these months , " said Phillip Rones , deputy commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The unemployment rate for teenagers surged to 18.7 % from 15.4 % , the largest increase since the data were first collected in 1948 .
A broader measure of unemployment that includes so - called discouraged workers rose to 9.7 % in May from 9.2 % .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Beijing organizers are promoting an officially sanctioned chanting routine for Chinese spectators at August ’s Olympics , state media said Thursday .
Incorporating the ubiquitous Chinese sporting chant , “ Jiayou ” or “ add oil , ” the four - step routine is designed to help spectators cheer in a “ smooth and civilized manner ” at the August 8 - 24 Games .
The chant will be promoted by television programs , video presentations and squads of cheering volunteers at the venues as well as by the education ministry , the People ’s Daily reported .
The routine begins with “ Olympics -- add oil ” accompanied by two claps and a double thumbs up , before continuing with “ China -- add oil ” with two more claps and raised fists .
The “ China ” and “ Olympics ” can be replaced to allow support for other countries or individuals , the paper said .
Possible lack of sporting etiquette has been a major concern for city authorities during preparations for the Games and a series of educational programs have been instituted .
Users of public transport in the Chinese capital are briefed on the rules of Olympic sports on special television screens , while special projects have taken place in many city schools to teach the children about the history of the Games .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s tax policies have given him an edge as the better man for the economy , various Wall Street experts said at this week ’s Reuters Investment Outlook Summit .

But , against a backdrop of job losses and deteriorating home values , Wall Street is backing McCain ’s Democratic rival , Barack Obama with cold , hard cash .
McCain plans to extend the Bush administration ’s tax cuts , eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax , and slash corporate taxes .
Obama , who has derided the Arizona senator ’s plans , has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy and introduce a broad range of refundable tax credits .
“ My personal opinion is I would argue that McCain is probably the better candidate for the economy and that is more or less because of his tax policies , ” James Caron , head of global rates research at investment bank Morgan Stanley in New York , said at the Reuters Summit this week .
“ In this environment that we ’re in right now , the last thing you want to have is higher taxes and taking money out of the consumers ’ pockets , ” he added .
David Bianco , chief U.S. strategist at UBS Investment Research , told the summit that Wall Street would welcome McCain with open arms .
“ My view is that McCain is better for the market , ” Bianco said .
“ The market will respond to McCain corporate tax cuts , ” said participant Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich , Connecticut .
Wall Street may like McCain but it is betting on the Democratic senator from Illinois .
The securities and investment industry has given more campaign contributions to Obama than any other candidate , totaling nearly $ 7.91 million and exceeding McCain ’s $ 4.15 million .
And Corporate America as a whole likes the Democrats .
For the first time in a generation , most major U.S. business sectors are donating more campaign money to Democrats than to Republicans , according to a political fund - raising watchdog group .
Six of 10 business sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics had given more money to Democrats as of late April in all federal races , marking a shift over the past year with profound implications for Republicans .
That said , prominent Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman said it is too soon to formulate who would move the economy in the right direction .
“ Both of the two candidates thus far have not expressed in detail their financial and economic programs , ” he said .
But Kaufman , president of financial consulting firm Henry Kaufman & Co , quickly added : “ I was a little bit dismayed when Senator McCain said flippantly that he does not know too much about economics but carries Alan Greenspan ’s book under his arm .
That does not encourage me . ”
All told , U.S. stock markets will do well regardless of who takes the White House , one strategist said .
“ It is worth noting that in every presidential election year since World War Two , the S&P 500 has posted a gain in the fourth quarter , as the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the election fades , with the only exception being 2000 , ” said Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at LPL Financial .
In 2000 , the result of the White House race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore was uncertain for weeks .

Despite all of the reports about record - high gas and oil prices , we 're still nowhere close to record high gas prices adjusted for the growth in per- capita , disposable income .
The chart above shows the cost of 1,000 gallons of gasoline , as a percent of per- capita disposable income in every month from January 1980 to May 2008 .
During most of 1980 and 1981 , it took between 13.50 % and 15 % of per- capita disposable income ( $ 8,5000 to $ 10,000 in that period ) to purchase 1,000 gallons of gasoline ( $ 1.25 to $ 1.40 retail price per gallon in that period ) , which was far greater than the 10.26 % that it takes of today 's per- capita disposable income of about $ 37,000 to purchase 1,000 gallons of gas at the May average of $ 3.76 per gallon .

Bend over , pull out your wallet and kiss your Abe ‘ goodbye . '
The Lincolns have got to go – and so do the Hamiltons and Jacksons .
Those bills in your billfold are n't yours anymore .
The landlords of our currency – Citibank , the national treasury of China and the House of Saudi – are foreclosing and evicting all Americans from the US economy .
It 's mornings like this , when I wake up hung - over to photos of the King of Saudi Arabia festooning our President with gold necklaces , that I reluctantly remember that I am an economist ; and one with some responsibility to explain what the hell Bush is doing kissing Abdullah 's camel .
Let 's begin by stating why Bush is not in Saudi Arabia .
Bush ai n't there to promote ‘ Democracy ' nor peace in Palestine , nor even war in Iran .
And , despite what some pinhead from CNN stated , he sure as hell did n't go to Riyadh to tell the Saudis to cut the price of oil .
What 's really behind Bush 's hajj to Riyadh is that America is in hock up to our knickers .
The sub - prime mortgage market implosion , hitting a dozen banks with over $ 100 billion in losses , is just the tip of the debt - berg .
Since taking office , Bush has doubled the federal debt to more than $ 5 trillion .
And , according to US Treasury figures , on net , foreign investors have purchased close to 100 % of that debt .
That 's $ 3 trillion borrowed from the Saudis , the Chinese , the Japanese and others .
Now , Bush , our Debt Junkie - in - Chief , needs another fix .
The US Treasury , Citibank , Merrill - Lynch and other financial desperados need another hand - out from Abdullah 's stash .
Abdullah , in turn , gets this financial juice by pumping it out of our pockets at nearly $ 100 a barrel for his crude .
Bush needs the Saudis to charge us big bucks for oil .
The Saudis can't lend the US
Treasury and Citibank hundreds of billions of US dollars unless they first get these US dollars from the US .
The high price of oil is , in effect , a tax levied by Bush but collected by the oil industry and the Gulf kingdoms to fund our multi-trillion dollar governmental and private debt - load .
The US Treasury is not alone in its frightening dependency on Arabian loot .
America 's private financial institutions are also begging for foreign treasure .
Yesterday , King Abdullah 's nephew , Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , already the top individual owner of Citibank , joined the Kuwait government 's Investment Authority and others to mainline a $ 12.5 billion injection of capital into the New York bank .
Also this week , the Abu Dhabi government and the Saudi Olayan Group are taking a $ 6.6 billion chunk of Merrill - Lynch .
It 's no mere coincidence that Bush is in Abdullah 's tent when the money - changers made the deal just outside it .
Bush is there to assure Abdullah that , unlike Dubai 's ports purchase debacle , there will be no political impediment to the Saudi 's buying up Citibank nor the isle of Manhattan .
So what ?
I mean , for the average American about to lose their job and their bungalow it does n't matter a twit whether it 's Sheik bin Alwaleed who owns Citibank or Sheik Sanford Weill , Citi 's past Chairman .
It 's the price paid to buy back our money from abroad that 's killing us .
Despite the Koranic prohibition on charging interest , the Gulf princes demand their pound of flesh , exacting a 7 % payment from Citibank and 9 % from Merrill .
That hefty interest bill then pushes adjustable rate mortgages into the stratosphere and pushes manufacturing into China by making borrowing and energy costs impossible to overcome .
Forget the cost of health care : General Motors ' interest burden quintupled in just two years .
As the great economist Paddy Chayefsky wrote in the film The Network :
“ The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country , and now they must put it back . …
It is ebb and flow , tidal gravity … .
There are no nations , there are no peoples .
There is only one vast and immense , interwoven , multi-national dominion of petro-dollars . …
There is no America .
There is no ‘ democracy . '
The world is a business , one vast and ecumenical holding company , for whom all men will work . ”
In 2005 , the US consumer paid Arab and OPEC nations a quarter trillion dollars ( $ 252 billion ) for oil – and the USA received back 100 % of it – and then some ( $ 311 billion ) via Gulf nations ' investment in US Treasury bills and purchases of US businesses and property .
Bush 's trip to Abdullah 's tent is all about this vast business of keeping this petro - dollar treadmill spinning .
The Bush Administration , rather than tax Americans to cover our deficits or make the banks suffer the consequences of their predatory lending practices , is allowing the Saudis to charge us big time at the pump with the understanding they will lend it all back to us – so the party never has to stop .
It has been reported that the President 's Secret Service men traveling with him seemed embarrassed by the eye - popping loads of diamond and gold gifts which they have to carry back for President Bush .
They need not feel they have taken too much from their hosts : Bush has assured Abdullah that the King can suck it back out through our gas tanks .

Gallup Daily : Obama Holds Slight 47 % to 45 % Advantage First time in days that Obama ’s Democratic bid has gained supporters
PRINCETON , NJ --
The peeling away of national Democratic support for Barack Obama seen this past week may have run its course .
After trailing Hillary Clinton by one percentage point in Saturday 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking report , Obama now leads Clinton by two points , 47 % to 45 % .
Today 's results are based on Gallup Poll Daily tracking conducted Thursday through Saturday , April 17 - 19 , 2008 .
Obama 's largest lead to date in the Democratic nomination race came less than a week ago when he led Clinton by 11 points , 51 % to 40 % .
However , Obama 's support began to erode slightly even before the highly publicized April 16 Democratic debate in Philadelphia , and fell more significantly in the two days immediately after it .
His advantage whittled away to a 1 - point deficit in April 16 - 18 tracking , the first time since mid-March that Clinton 's share of the vote exceeded Obama 's , albeit by a statistically insignificant margin .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
In a race seemingly constrained by the laws of motion -- " what goes up must come down " --, Obama has for now stemmed the recent drop in his support and is back in front of Clinton , albeit with a non-significant 2 - point lead .
At the same time , the general election preferences of national registered voters have held fairly steady .
In a trial heat between Obama and Republican John McCain , the two are now tied at 45 % .
This is a slight improvement for McCain who trailed Obama by as much as three points earlier in the month , but more broadly reflects the pattern seen since late March of a generally close race .
Clinton leads McCain by one point , 46 % to 45 % , similar to where that hypothetical contest has been since early April .

Any time you hear someone say something like “ with all due respect ” or “ respectfully , … ” , you know that you ’re about to bear witness to an extraordinary insult .
Or that you just witnessed such .
In the case of Chief Justice ’s Roberts ’ dissent to today ’s 5 - 4 decision against the detention of “ enemy combatants ” without access to due process under habeas corpus ( the Constitutional right to challenge your detention as unlawful in a federal court ) , his statement comes at the end of a 28 - page dissent that drips contempt for the Justices in the majority .
Frustration with his fellow Justices is totally understandable .
Anger , even .
Dislike of them is reasonable , even outright hatred .
But contempt – that ’s the worst thing one person can have for another , and the fact that the man leading the Supreme Court of the United States has contempt for his fellow Justices bodes ill indeed .
It ’s entirely possible , albeit difficult , to work with people you dislike , even hate .
But doing so requires at least some amount of respect , and that respect is definitionally absent from someone who feels contempt for another .
Mirriam - Webster ’s online dictionary defines “ contempt ” ( in the non-judicial sense , ie “ contempt of court ” ) as follows :
contempt : a : the act of despising : the state of mind of one who despises : disdain b : lack of respect or reverence for something
Diving deeper , if you look up the definitions of “ disdain , ” and “ despise ” , you find they mean the following :
disdain : a feeling of contempt for someone or something regarded as unworthy or inferior despise : to look down on with contempt or aversion to regard as negligible , worthless , or distasteful
In other words , if you feel contempt for another , you a ) do n’t respect them , b ) regard them as unworthy or inferior , and c ) view them as negligible , ie insignificant and inconsequential .
And the language that the Chief Justice choose to use in his dissent reveals that this is most definitely how he feels about Justices Kennedy , Souter , Stevens , Ginsburg , and Breyer .
The following is an attempt at an exhaustive list of all the times that Chief Justice Roberts used contemptible language in his dissent , along with some quotes to give you background into the Chief Justice ’s thoughts .
One cannot help but think , after surveying the modest practical results of the majority ’s ambitious opinion , that this decision is not really about the detainees at all , but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants .
The Court does eventually get around to asking whether review under the DTA is , as the Court frames it , an “ adequate substitute ” for habeas , but even then its opinion fails to determine what rights the detainees possess and whether the DTA system satisfies them .
The majority instead compares the undefined DTA process to an equally undefined habeas rightâ€ ” one that is to be given shape only in the future by district courts on a case - by - case basis .
This whole approach is misguided .
( emphasis added )
I believe the system the political branches constructed adequately protects any constitutional rights aliens captured abroad and detained as enemy combatants may enjoy .
I therefore would dismiss these cases on that ground .
With all respect for the contrary views of the majority , I must dissent .
( emphasis added )
It is grossly premature to pronounce on the detainees ’ right to habeas without first assessing whether the remedies the DTA system provides vindicate whatever rights petitioners may claim .
( emphasis added )
This point is directly pertinent here , for surely the Due Process Clause does not afford non-citizens in such circumstances greater protection than citizens are due .
( emphasis original , bold added )
The Court acknowledges that “ the ordinary course ” would be not to decide the constitutionality of the DTA at this stage , but abandons that “ ordinary course ” in light of the “ gravity ” of the constitutional issues presented and the prospect of additional delay .
It is , however , precisely when the issues presented are grave that adherence to the ordinary course is most important .
A principle applied only when unimportant is not much of a principle at all , and charges of judicial activism are most effectively rebutted when courts can fairly argue they are following normal practices .
( emphasis added )
The majority ’s overreaching is particularly egregious given the weakness of its objections to the DTA .
Congress followed the Court ’s lead , only to find itself the victim of a constitutional bait and switch [ today ’s decision ] .
The majority attempts to dismiss Hamdi ’s relevance by arguing that because the availability of Â §2241 federal habeas was never in doubt in that case , “ the Court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review . . . in the context of enemy combatant detentions . ”
Hardly .
Hamdi was all about the scope of habeas review in the context of enemy combatant detentions .
The petitioner , an American citizen held within the United States as an enemy combatant , invoked the writ to challenge his detention .
( emphasis added )
The Court , however , will not take “ yes ” for an answer .
For my part , I will assume that any due process rights petitioners may possess are no greater than those of American citizens detained as enemy combatants .
( emphasis added )
The Court further complains that petitioners lack “ the assistance of counsel , ” andâ € ” given the limits on their access to classified informationâ€ ” ” may not be aware of the most critical allegations ” against them .
None of these complaints is persuasive .
( emphasis added )
The Implementation Memo requires only that detainees ’ witnesses be “ reasonably available , ” a requirement drawn from Army Regulation 190â € “ 8 , ch. 1 , Â § 1â € “ 6( e ) ( 6 ) , and entirely consistent with the Government ’s interest in avoiding “ a futile search for evidence ” that might burden warmaking responsibilities .
The dangerous mission assigned to our forces abroad is to fight terrorists , not serve subpoenas .
( emphasis added )
What alternative does the Court propose ?
Allow free access to classified information and ignore the risk the prisoner may eventually convey what he learns to parties hostile to this country , with deadly consequences for those who helped apprehend the detainee ?
If the Court can
design a better system for communicating to detainees the substance of any classified information relevant to their cases , without fatally compromising national security interests and sources , the majority should come forward with it .
Instead , the majority fobs that vexing question off on district courts to answer down the road .
( emphasis added )
The Court hints darkly that the DTA may suffer from other infirmities , see ante , at 63 ( “ We do not imply DTA review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainee ’s ability to present exculpatory evidence ” ) , but it does not bother to name them , making a response a bit difficult .
As it stands , I can only assume the Court regards the supposed defect it did identify as the gravest of the lot .
If this is the most the Court can muster , the ice beneath its feet is thin indeed .
( emphasis added )
The Court ’s hand wringing over the DTA ’s treatment of later - discovered exculpatory evidence is the most it has to show after a roving search for constitutionally problematic scenarios .
( emphasis added )
The Court grudgingly suggests that “ Congress ’ silence on the question of remedies suggests acquiescence to any constitutionally required remedy . ” ( emphasis added )
The Court could have saved itself a lot of trouble if it had simply announced this Catch - 22 approach at the beginning rather than the end of its opinion .
The majority rests its decision on abstract and hypothetical concerns .
Step back and consider what , in the real world , Congress and the Executive have actually granted aliens captured by our Armed Forces overseas and found to be enemy combatants : ( emphasis added )
So who has won ?
Not the detainees .
The Court ’s analysis leaves them with only the prospect of further litigation to determine the content of their new habeas right , followed by further litigation to resolve their particular cases , followed by further litigation before the D. C. Circuitâ € ” where they could have started had they invoked the DTA procedure .
Not Congress , whose attempt to “ determineâ € ” through democratic meansâ € ” how best ” to balance the security of the American people with the detainees ’ liberty interests has been unceremoniously brushed aside .
Not the Great Writ , whose majesty is hardly enhanced by its extension to a jurisdictionally quirky outpost , with no tangible benefit to anyone .
Not the rule of law , unless by that is meant the rule of lawyers , who will now arguably have a greater role than military and intelligence officials in shaping policy for alien enemy combatants .
And certainly not the American people , who today lose a bit more control over the conduct of this Nation ’s foreign policy to unelected , politically unaccountable judges .
I respectfully dissent .
( emphasis added )
“ Misguided ” .
“ Grossly premature . ” “ Surely . ” “ Judicial activism . ”
“ Overreaching is particularly egregious . ” “ Hardly . ” “ Complains . ” “ Fobs…off . ” “ Hints darkly . ”
“ Hand wringing . ” “ Grudgingly . ”
“ In the real world . ”
All together , this is the picture that the Chief Justice ’s language paints :
The Majority is not only wrong , but obviously so .
The Majority cannot be right because they ’ve glaringly tried to claim too much , and that fact is apparent to everyone who has the right ideals .
The Majority is excessively concerned about theory over fact and is reluctant to face the fact that their decision is childish and immature .
Justice Scalia ’s dissent shows about as much respect for Scalia ’s peers as the Chief Justice ’s does .
Scalia did , after all , choose to preface his entire opinion with the Supreme Court equivalent of “ We ’re at war , you idiots !
Letting more psycho terrorists out of Gitmo ( some of whom have gone on to kill more of our allies ) is about as rock stupid as you can get .
What the hell are you thinking ?
Oh , that ’s right – YOU’RE NOT !!! ”
I ’ve chosen to focus on Chief Justice Roberts ’ dissent because Justice Scalia has a long , well established , and justified reputation for holding his peers in similar contempt .
It ’s always easier to work with people you like and respect .
But if you ca n’t like the people you work with , you must at least be able to respect them .
Chief Justice Roberts ’ dissent , stuffed as it is with language that is full of contempt , makes it plain that he simply has no respect for the more liberal of his fellow Justices .
And it ’s not possible to have a productive working relationship without a foundation of respect .
Think about it – if you ca n’t respect the quality of a coworker ’s work , how can you trust that it ’s right ?
If you ca n’t respect his or her work ethic , you ca n’t trust that he or she wo n’t claim your work as their own , or be done on time , or anything else .
If you hold someone in contempt , they ’re not your equal , so they ’ll never be as good as you , even if they ultimately exceed you in every way .
Chief Justice Roberts ’ dissent today shows he has no respect for his peers on the Supreme Court .
That means , until such time as he respects them again , he will never trust that their judgment is correct .
On anything .
And so he ’ll oppose them and work against them reflexively , and he ’ll consider them to be his subordinates instead of his equals .
And so , even if they ’re right , it ’ll just be because they recognized his inherent superiority , not because they could possibly be smart enough to agree with him on their own terms .
There are an infinite number of ways the Chief Justice could have written his dissent that could have shown he had respect for his fellow Justices .
He chose not to .
And in so doing , he has all but guaranteed that a Supreme Court already riven by internal division will never unite under his leadership .
Chalk up one more in the “ Divider , not a Uniter ” column … .
We 've long used various methods , such as cell freezing , to analyze the rise of viruses as they convert happy cells into destruction production facilities .
But now , for the first time ever , scientists have found a technique to watch viruses grow in real time .
As Rockefeller University virologist explained , " This is the first time anyone has seen a virus particle being born . "

The method uses what we assume is a semi-standard optical microscope .
However , as opposed to shining light straight - on at the cells , the light penetrates from a sharp angle allowing the close study of the cell 's membrane ( this particular cell is being infected with HIV ) .
In addition , some particles appear to be fluorescently tagged .
A single virion ( mature virus ) was recorded to take 5 - 6 minutes to be produced .

If there ever was an overused word in the current financial world , it has to be the word " bubble . "
It seems that everything that moves sharply up in price is now said to be in a bubble .
Recently , I have read , and heard , more commentary on what item may be in a bubble than at any point in my lifetime .
I �m sure you have as well .
Much of the current commentary , particularly from those whose opinions I respect , leaves me confused as to what being in a bubble means to the average investor .
While there�s a debate as to whether we are experiencing a bubble in certain items , there�s much less attention on what an individual investor should do about it .
Nowhere is the term currently used more than with crude oil , the most important commodity of all ( save food , also said to be in a bubble ) .
No commodity�s price rise has garnered more attention than crude oil .
But if oil and other commodities are in a bubble , what does that mean to investors ?
Let �s take a step back and first define the word bubble .
Many say it is simply any item that gets overvalued in price ( compared to its fundamental value ) due to excessive speculation .
That definition doesn�t go far enough .
A true bubble involves widespread public participation , tacit government support and the use of leverage to buy the asset in the bubble .
While the bubble is in full force , vast numbers of people appear to be winners , which in turn attracts more participants .
All remain in the game .
Finally , prices in a bubble eventually reach levels so much above any sane measure of supply and demand , that the inevitable price deflation is severe and long lasting .
Most participants lose .
However , some are lucky enough to get out near the peak and are financially set for life .
Prior to the past ten years or so , the term bubble was used sparingly .
It was reserved for truly historic price events like the South Sea Bubble and the Holland Tulip Bulb Mania .
But two recent financial events did qualify as historic bubbles , and that has created a propensity to label any subsequent unusual price rise as a bubble .
I�m speaking of the dramatic price rise in technology common stocks in the late 1990�s , ending in early 2000 , and the unusual and worldwide rise in real estate prices from 2000 to 2005 .
Tech stocks generally rose hundreds of percent in price , only to lose almost all those gains in the subsequent crash .
Real estate is still correcting in price .
Both bubbles involved widespread public participation and borrowed money .
These twin bubbles , tech stocks and real estate , were very unusual events .
Most generations don�t get to experience even one genuine bubble .
We got two .
Money supply , credit creation and world economic conditions allowed the twin bubbles to come into existence , and then burst .
Those forces still appear to be in place , setting the stage for future bubbles .
It is extremely important , investment - wise , to correctly identify a bubble in any item .
Even more important , but rarely stated , is the identification of an item about to enter a bubble .
That �s because there can be nothing more profitable than to correctly anticipate beforehand whether a bubble is likely to form .
If one can anticipate a bubble developing in any item , and invests accordingly , that person would profit beyond any dreams imaginable .
There could have been no better investment than to have purchased tech stocks or real estate before the bubble and then selling before the bubble burst .
So let �s stipulate that investing in any financial item about to enter into a bubble is as good as it gets , and something we want to achieve .
That �s the easy part , stating our objective .
More difficult is identifying the specific item .
Let �s look at the current bubble poster child , crude oil .
Even though the words oil and bubble are used in the same breath by commentators and regulators , crude oil doesn�t meet the definition of a true bubble .
There is speculation in the oil futures market , as with every commodity , but there is no evident concentration suggesting manipulation .
Moreover , there is no widespread public participation or borrowing to buy crude oil .
No one you know is hoarding oil , and very few are winning on the price rise .
Everyone is complaining about the crude oil price rise .
Compare that to the day - traders , real estate flippers and get rich quick dreamers of a few years ago .
Even if I �m dead wrong , and oil is in a bubble , it �s still way too late to get in cheaply , nor is it a practical play for the average investor in either direction .
I have experience in commodities for more than 35 years and I wouldn�t play oil in either direction with anyone�s money .
My point is that crude oil , at this time and price , whether in a bubble or not , is not a potential home run investment .
Neither are tech stocks .
When bubbles burst , history suggests they usually don�t re-inflate quickly .
So , if we are in a quest to find the best potential asset that could develop into a bubble and fulfill the wildest possible investment dreams , where can we find it ?
The Bubble To Be
If there is any single investment asset that is not yet in a bubble , but holds the potential to turn into one of the biggest bubbles in financial history , it is silver .
More than other precious metals or commodities , stocks , bonds or real estate , silver has unique characteristics that make it the prime candidate to be the next big bubble .
Silver is still dirt cheap by any relative or absolute measurement , especially after its recent price correction .
Yes , it is up four - fold from the lows of several years ago , giving early buyers an immense return , but it is still cheap compared to its own fundamentals and all other commodities , including gold .
I know that some analysts I respect maintain that gold will go into a bubble of its own , greatly enriching investors .
If that turns out to be true , it will enhance , not diminish , the likelihood of a bubble in silver , because silver is less than 2 % of the price of gold and more rare in investment form .
If gold doesn�t get to a bubble , silver may still do so , due to special circumstances unique to silver .
Silver is still off the radar of those who are capable of investing in it , namely , just about everyone in the world .
Silver is a basic element , known to all cultures and in all places .
In fact , it is somewhat of a miracle that silver has not entered a bubble yet .
The key word is yet .
Bubbles are unpredictable in their lifecycle , both when they start and when they end .
My main point is that silver is prime bubble material .
Silver is conducive to becoming a bubble .
By that , I mean it is of the form that vast numbers of the world�s population , from the very richest to the not so rich can participate in direct ownership .
Plus , silver has an existing worldwide distribution and investment infrastructure in place which can accommodate the largest institutional investor buying 1000 - ounce bars to local village brides in India or Asia buying silver bracelets .
Crude oil , grain , copper , sugar or zinc can not be held in their elemental physical form by the world�s investors .
That precludes these items from entering into a bubble mania .
Vast numbers of people can�t buy and hold them for investment .
We witnessed bubbles in the past because they were doable , just like silver .
One of the characteristics of prior financial bubbles is that there was an initial sound economic rationale for investing in the item in the first place .
There was a good story to begin with .
Whether it was the profits that a company could earn through some new technology , or the rarity of a beautiful flower , or the demand for shelter , the initial story made sense .
A bubble develops when the emotions and great numbers of people overwhelm the initial good story .
And make no mistake , there is no better story than silver .
The silver story is so good that I couldn�t make it up if I tried .
No one�s imagination could be that vivid .
No one could fabricate a story of how an age - old revered precious metal , sought in every land and culture and accumulated for thousands of years , could suddenly develop into a vital modern material capable of more varied industrial applications than any other metal .
And how , in the course of just a half - century , the world could deplete the accumulated inventory of thousands of years , in pursuit of vital applications .
What better story could there be ?
Because of the depletion of the world�s silver inventories , silver is rarer than gold and its price doesn�t reflect that fact yet .
If a bubble develops in silver , it will probably occur because enough people recognize silver�s rarity and new investors will chant the mantra that silver is rarer than gold .
They will justify the purchase of silver at any price less than gold�s price , and perhaps equal to or more than gold�s price .
While I don�t think most world governments would welcome a silver bubble , the amount of silver owned collectively by world governments is the lowest in hundreds of years .
They are incapable of dousing any price fire from a silver bubble ( unlike gold ) .
Silver is used in tiny amounts in most applications .
Dramatically higher silver prices will not bring the pain to consumers like increases in oil and food .
Hence , there will be less widespread political pressure from constituents to fight a silver price rise ( save the Silver Users Association ) .
It �s not certain that vast amounts of leverage would fuel a silver bubble , but it could , particularly when it involves large institutional investors , such as hedge funds .
But , importantly , no leverage is needed to fuel a silver bubble .
That �s because silver is so cheap and there is so little remaining in existence , that borrowed money is not needed to drive prices sharply higher .
With perhaps a billion ounces of investment silver in existence , there is less than $ 20 billion worth of silver in the entire world .
That is truly a small amount of money for the entire worth of an important world asset .
There are individuals , and certainly many investment pools , with more than that .
Please keep in mind that the more silver that is held on a fully paid for basis lessens the chance of a leveraged induced sell - off , like the kind we have seen regularly on the COMEX .
As more investors buy for cash , shaking them out will be harder .
Even the thought that big leveraged money might flow into silver should boggle the mind .
Don�t assume for a moment that just because a billion ounces of silver may exist , as small as that is in actual material and money , especially in per capita terms , that somehow that small amount of silver is available for purchase at anywhere near current prices .
Every ounce of that silver is owned by someone and only that person will decide at what price to sell .
If the vast majority of owners of that silver have done their homework , as I suspect they have , that silver will not be coming to market any time soon .
That greatly reduces the amount of silver that could be bought , and juices up the case for an investment bubble .
While I have not made it the focus of this article , I would be remiss if I did not mention the obscene short position of silver , both on the COMEX and in unbacked silver certificates .
As you know , I consider the concentrated short position on the COMEX to be prima facie evidence of a silver manipulation .
I am not so much concerned that you embrace my manipulation thesis , as I am for you to be aware of the unusual nature of such a documented short position .
At the very least , hundreds of millions of ounces have been pre-sold , by just a few entities , and can�t be sold again .
In a world destined to be chronically short of silver for investment demand , hundreds of millions of ounces already sold , but not yet delivered against or bought back , is bullish beyond description .
The purpose of this article is to add to all my prior research by suggesting the possibility that silver could enter into an investment bubble .
This is on top of my prior analysis pointing to sharply higher prices , which stands by itself .
Permit me to summarize the significance of the bubble possibility .
I had previously pegged silver as perhaps hitting $ 50 or $ 100 per ounce .
This prediction was made when silver was below $ 5 , and seemed outlandish at the time .
Today it doesn�t seem so extreme .
But the possibility of silver developing into a bubble mania phase radically changes the equation .
Such a bubble phase in silver could easily lift the price into the hundreds of dollars price range .
And in some ways , silver may not appear at that time to be excessively valued .
For instance , at $ 200 per ounce , the 1 billion ounces of real investment silver in existence would be worth $ 200 billion .
Assuming that gold was only priced at that time at $ 1000 per ounce ( an admittedly very low number ) , that would make all the gold in the world worth $ 5 trillion , or still 25 times what all the silver was worth .
And if gold were much higher , as is likely , the comparison would be more favorable for silver .
With potential new investors realizing silver is rarer than gold , silver could still look cheap to them .
This is not a promise that silver is going into a bubble and will trade at hundreds of dollars per ounce in the next few years .
It is intended as an additional thought process for you to consider .
Don�t you wish someone hinted at such a possibility in tech stocks or real estate before those bubbles developed ?

* Do you know what the Round - Robin DNS is ?
Suggested article from our blog :
What is Round - Robin DNS and how to set it up ?
This is what Round - Robin DNS is :
A fast and easy way to manage the DNS traffic .
When you are getting heavy traffic , it could be a great idea to have your website or application hosted in different places .
Then you will need a load balancer like the Round - Robin DNS to redirect the traffic to those locations .
It will do it based on a statistical model .
Here you can find Round - Robin example configuration !
How does it work ?
Imagine this scenario .
You have a website with a single domain and 5 web servers with identical copies of your site .
The users will ask for a resolution for their DNS request , but they will get a different IP address , depending on when they requested it .
The first will get the IP of the first web server .
The second user will get the second IP address , and so on .
After the fifth , the Round - Robin DNS will start the sequence again , and that way , it will balance the load between the 5 web servers , providing , overall , better traffic management .

The field marshal had a long and distinguished military record ( Photo : Indian army website )
The Indian general who commanded the military campaign that led to the creation of Bangladesh has died at the age of 94 .
Sam Manekshaw , whose career spanned four decades , was one of India 's best known and well - respected soldiers .
Under the British , he was decorated for gallantry in World War II for his part fighting the Japanese army in Burma .
After India gained independence , he became chief of the army in 1969 and in 1973 was made field marshal .
' The brave ' Under his command , India went to war with Pakistan in 1971 , supporting Bengali nationalists in what was then East Pakistan .
Pakistan surrendered within 14 days and Bangladesh was born .
In 1973 , only a fortnight before he retired , he was promoted to the rank of field marshal , one of only two Indian army generals to rise to the post .
" Sam Bahadur " or " Sam the Brave " died in Tamil Nadu Sam Manekshaw otherwise known as Sam Bahadur - or " Sam the Brave " - was born in the northern Indian town of Amritsar in 1914 and was among the first batch of recruits at the Indian Military Academy set up by the British in 1932 .
Serving under the British , he was decorated for his part in a battle with the Japanese army in Burma .
He made the transition to working for independent India with ease and became chief of the Indian army in 1969 .
He played a decisive role in some of India 's most significant wars , including the war with China in 1962 and the victory over Pakistan in 1971 , which made him a national hero .
A documentary film made about him in 2003 captured some of his much admired sense of humour .
In one sequence Field Marshal Manekshaw recalls how , following the 1971 war against Pakistan , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi confronted him about rumours that he was planning a coup against her .
" Do n't you think I would not be a worthy replacement for you Madam prime minister ?
You have a long nose , so have I .
I do n't poke my nose in other people 's affairs , " he joked .
In the film , Field Marshal Manekshaw also said that India lost a golden opportunity to solve the Kashmir issue once and for all at the Shimla summit with Pakistan which was held soon after the 1971 war .
' Thorough gentleman '
The BBC's Charu Shahane says that he will be remembered as being handsome and witty with a handlebar moustache - every inch a victorious soldier .
Our correspondent says that he captured the public imagination and became a hero in the eyes of India 's people .
The Bangladesh war of independence was brief but bloody
In retirement , the field marshal remained reticent and eager to keep a low profile despite being much adored by his countrymen .
He recently refused to comment on the war in Iraq despite a huge gathering of journalists bombarding him with questions .
Tributes have been pouring into the websites of Indian newspapers , calling him " a great soldier and a very thorough gentleman " .
Sam Manekshaw , who had been battling a series of illnesses , died at a military hospital in Wellington in the southern state of Tamil Nadu , where he had lived since retiring .
Indian Defence Minister AK
Antony said the nation " had lost a great soldier , a true patriot and a noble son " .

Underage drinkers attempting to buy alcohol could soon be thwarted by cutting edge technology currently used by police to identify suspected criminals .
A supermarket chain is introducing face recognition cameras in a bid to prevent staff mistakenly selling cigarettes and booze to children .
The biometric technology , which helps identify underage customers , is being piloted by Budgens at one of their London branches .
Scroll down for more ...
Face recognition :
Will be used to stop underage drinkers buying alcohol
If successful , it could be rolled out across the country to create a giant database of customers .
The system , which has customers facial images stored on a database , immediately alerts a cashier if it recognises someone who has previously been unable to prove they are 18 .
Once aware , staff can carry out the proper checks .
In the future , images of offenders could be pooled with other convenience stores , allowing retailers in an area to instantly know if a customer is under-age .
It is believed to be the first time a British retailer has used the technology to identify underage customers .
But critics say the storage of such sensitive data could infringe customers ' civil liberties .
The facial recognition software takes measurements between key points on the face , making a unique template of a person 's features .
Budgens have installed three cameras at the pilot branch , one at each till .
They monitor customers as they approach the checkout lanes and relays their image back to a control centre in Worcester .
Customers ' scanned facial features are then compared against a database of under - 18s who have previously visited the store .
Anyone refused alcohol or cigarettes in the past will be automatically flagged up .
The system also identifies customers who have previously verified their age , allowing them to be served more quickly .
To comply with the Data Protection Act , the system stores the information as data or ' tokens ' - which cannot be reversed back into images , but can be compared to fresh pictures .
Currently 1,500 ' tokens ' are stored on the database , says Charlie Willetts , managing director of Charton Ltd , which is supplying the software .
With the system capable of holding up to two million sets of data , Mr Willetts said other retailers were interested in linking the scheme to their own shops to create a giant database of customers .
He said : " This is the first store in the country doing this , but we have had great interest from retailers looking to install the technology . "
Police and other law enforcement agencies use face recognition technology to match CCTV footage of suspects with a database of known offenders .
Trials will also begin in the summer at British airports to scan the facial details of some passport - holders , in a bid to improve the fight against ID fraud .
Hi -tech gates will scan people 's faces and compare the image with their biometric passports .
If the pilot scheme is a success , the technology will be rolled out to airports and seaports nationwide .
The trial will initially be for British and EU citizens carrying the new biometric passports .
It is not clear how many airports will take part .

When I was a kid , I was a compulsive painter of punched eyes , missing teeth and bloody scars on almost every magazine or newspaper photo I found interesting .
Time passed by and I did n’t become a special effects makeup artist , but I still enjoy a nice horror movie with some decent gore and splatter effects .
Lately I ’ve been noticing that many Photoshop artists are mastering the horror makeup techniques and believed that it was time to gather a nice ( er , sort of … ) list of Photoshop tutorials filled with gore , splatter and blood .
In the US legal system , judges and juries have to walk a fine line when they weigh the difference between illegal obscenity and content that 's protected by the First Amendment .
The controlling precedent is the Supreme Court 's decision in Miller v. California , but the wording of that decision still leaves those making the ultimate decisions faced with determining what the " contemporary community standards " are .
Now , a case in Florida is going to be asking jurors to decide whether Google search terms are an accurate measure of a community 's standards .
The Miller v. California decision sets a number of hurdles that have to be cleared before a work can be deemed illegally obscene , most of them subjective .
These include a lack of artistic merit , being sexually focused , and offensiveness .
But , even if a work is inartistic and offensive , it 's not obscene if the community has determined that it 's okay .
One of the facts that needs to be considered is , " whether ' the average person , applying contemporary community standards ' would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest . "
This standard has led a lot of lawyers to try to ascertain exactly what the community considers standard .
Perhaps the most thorough examination came in a 2000 case , where a video store owner was accused of obscenity for offering sales and rentals of pornographic material in conservative Provo , Utah .
His lawyers dug deeply enough to obtain the statistics for the subscriber rates for X - rated channels and frequency of pay - per- view pornography purchases by the surrounding community .
After demonstrating that the defendant 's rentals accounted for a small fraction of the community 's porn consumption , the lawyers earned a quick acquittal .
Now ,
The New York Times is reporting a case in Florida where the defendant 's lawyers are trying to avoid all the hard work done by the lawyers in Utah .
They 're apparently hoping take a shortcut to community standards : Google search terms .
A new use for Google Trends
The obscenity portion of the case , as detailed by the Free Speech Coalition , may be the least of the defendants ' worries , as they were arrested in possession of guns and drugs .
Still , those may have been secondary profit centers for the duo on trial , who also ran an online porn business , and kept costs down by recruiting local talent for group sex scenes .
This led to charges of prostitution and the manufacture and sale of obscene material .
For those in Florida , an interest in " boobs " trumps more mundane concerns like surfing and orgies .
The defense against the obscenity charges will focus , in part , on the suggestion that interest in group sex fails the community standards test .
Google search trends will be used to demonstrate that , except for brief periods near Thanksgiving , searches for " orgy " consistently outrank attempts to find information about " apple pie " in Florida .
The rest of the year , orgy searches are closer in frequency to what might be expected to be a common activity in Florida , " surfing . "
An astute reader at Slashdot also recognized that , among Floridian Internet users , " boobs " has built and then expanded a lead over surfing during the past three years .
The lawyers have subpoenaed Google in an attempt to obtain data specifically for the area where the trial is taking place .
It 's hard not to view the effort somewhat cynically , namely as an attempt to avoid doing the hard work of digging into the data that was performed by the lawyers in the Utah case .
Still , it could be argued that citizens are increasingly finding their communities online , and that search terms provide a more accurate measure of community interest than actual purchases and rentals .
Expect those arguments to be made if this goes to trial , which will allow the legal system to decide how compelling it finds them .

Alan Green rails against the meaninglessness of Something Manager :
How many classes do you come across named Something Manager ?
Any decent sized commercial system seems to have plenty – SessionManager , ConnectionManager , PolicyManager , QueueManager , UrlManager , ConfigurationManager , or even , sadly , EJBManager .
A quick look at the dictionary entry for " manager " and " manage " gives at least ten different meanings - from " to make and keep compliant " through to " to achieve one 's purpose " .
I remember one day when the receptionist briefly retitled herself as Switchboard Manager .
The common semantic to all these definitions seem to be a vague " looks after stuff " .
This imprecision makes Manager a bad word to use in naming classes .
For instance , take a class named UrlManager – you cannot tell whether it pool URLs , manipulates URLs or audits the use of them .
All the name tells you is that this class does something with URLs .
On the other hand , the name UrlBuilder provides a much clearer picture of what the class does .
In the Java world , the Manager suffix is thrown around a lot .
Almost anywhere you have a class that is responsible in any way for other objects , it automatically earns the Manager label .
There 's nothing more ambiguous than a Something Manager .
Avoid this word .
Alan proposes a few alternatives in his blog post that might be helpful in narrowing down what your class actually does .
Giving your classes and objects good , descriptive names is n't easy .
Steve McConnell provides a few helpful guidelines for routine naming in Code Complete :
Describe everything the routine does
And we mean literally everything .
If that makes the name ridiculously long , the name is n't the problem .
Your routine is .
Avoid meaningless , vague , or wishy - washy verbs
Like UrlManager , or HandleOutput ( ) , or PerformServices ( ) .
Be specific .
What does it do ?
If you can't answer that question succinctly , it may be time to refactor the code until you can .
Do n't differentiate routine names solely by number
I include this only for completeness .
If you ever find yourself writing OutputUser1 ( ) and OutputUser2 ( ) , God help you .
And God help the team you work with .
Make names as long as necessary
According to McConnell , the optimum name length for a variable is 9 to 15 characters ; routines tend to be more complex and therefore deserve longer names .
Make your names as long as they need to be in order to make them understandable .
For functions , try using a description of the return value
An easy , straightforward rule .
Some examples are printer .
IsReady ( ) , pen.CurrentColor ( ) , etcetera .
Use opposites precisely
For every Open ( ) , there should be a Close ( ) ; for every Insert ( ) , a Delete ( ) ; for every Start ( ) , a Stop ( ) .
Establish conventions for common operations
This is best illustrated with an example , and McConnell provides an excellent one : employee.id. Get ( ) dependent .
GetId ( ) supervisor ( ) candidate.id ()
Now how do I get an Id again ?
I 'd say renaming classes and variables is one of my most frequent refactoring activities .
Creating good names is hard , but it should be hard , because a great name captures essential meaning in just one or two words
It 's difficult to tell what something should be named until you 're completely finished writing it .
And like most code , it 's never quite done , so the name may change over time .
Succinct , descriptive variable , object , and function names can make the difference between Daily WTF code and … well , code you 'd actually want to work on .

It ’s worth it trust me .
After staring at this picture for too long i decided to look into it a little more .
First I found out it was the cover of a greatest hits album put out in 1986 on Island Records called ‘ Island Life ’ ( get it ? ) .
The album itself is a decent introduction to what Grace Jones did as a singer but is too full of 70 ’s european disco schlock to listen all the way through .
Next thing I found out was that the position she is in is a ballet move called an Arabesque and that while it certainly looks impressive it is also impossible .
The picture was taken by a photographer named Jean Paul Goude who saw an intriguing subject in the model / actress / singer .
He notes about that picture that “ … unless you are extraordinarily supple , you cannot do this arabesque .
The main point is that Grace could n’t do it , and that ’s the basis of my entire work : creating a credible illusion . ”
Goude photographed Jones in a variety of positions using boxes to hold up parts of her body and then combined the images in a montage that eventually became the amazing image that you see above .
Here is the mock up :
Do I feel duped ?
Not at all .
I think Goude did an amazing job especially considering it was all done before the Photoshop times of today when , with every amazing image , someone asks “ Is that photoshopped ? ” .
We are all excited that Malak was discharged from the hospital and has gone into first grade , like any normal girl .
At home , she continues to work - out on her knee , for which purpose we got her a bicycle which she must ride daily .
It ’s a struggle for her , but this is the best physiotherapy in her case .
She is also wearing special garments , which place pressure on her scars .
She will have to wear these for a while , so that the scars do n’t grow .
We are sure she will do very well in school , (... )

When it comes to relationships with dot - com billionaires , pre-nups are becoming passe , and post - nups have become commonplace .
The new trend in high - tech , high - net - worth relationships is what might be called " dating terms of engagement . "
Mark Zuckerberg ( Associated Press Photo )
According to a post on Valleywag , which quotes from a new book by Sarah Lacy , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend , Priscilla Chan , held a " series of negotiations " to hammer out the terms of her move to Palo Alto .
According to Ms. Lacy , the final contract included how often Ms. Chan would get to see Mr. Zuckerberg .
It states :
" One date per week , a minimum of a hundred minutes of alone time , not in his apartment and definitely not at Facebook . "
It 's unclear what else was in the contract .
But for future dot - com billionaire daters , I 'd recommend a few additional terms .
Gina Bianchini :
When you look at the history of any new medium , it takes a decade or more for people to figure out what the native behavior of that medium is .
For the first 15 years of television , they were actually filming radio shows .
And it really took 10 to 20 years to start seeing native TV programming like the Today show , which nobody thought was going to be successful because people did n’t watch television the first thing in the morning .
What ’s becoming very , very clear — and really why we started Ning — was when you look at what the fundamental or native behavior of what the Internet is , it ’s social .
It is two - way communication .
Unlike a MySpace , which really came out of this concentrated L.A. music - and - hot - chick scene , or Facebook , which came out of a dorm at Harvard , what ’s been interesting about Ning is that we basically have this service and this platform that we throw out there and say , Hey , anybody can create whatever social network they want and spread it virally through invitations and sharing and embeddable widgets and things like that .
I would n’t consider it crazy to say that there will be millions of social networks .
They will be for every conceivable purpose in every conceivable country .
Today , we have registered users in 220 countries .
Forty - six percent of our traffic is outside the United States .
In 2007 , CNN partnered with YouTube to create the “ YouTube Debates , ” which allowed computer users to upload questions for the candidates — one indication of the Internet ’s increasing grip on American politics .
Howard Dean wo n’t publicly say which candidate is the most Internet - savvy , but the answer is Barack Obama .
Chuck Todd is the political director of NBC News and the former editor of the political Web site the Hotline .
Chuck Todd : Obama basically is Dean 2.0 , and like any successful 2.0 , sometimes you actually have to rename the entire software .
Microsoft got rid of the Windows , called it XP .
Now we call it Obama rather than Dean .
The Internet was Obama ’s only path — he had to be successful doing it this way , because the party , the old - school party infrastructure , was behind the brand name Clinton .
He had to figure out how to expand the electorate .
He had to figure out how to change the rules , and to change the rules he had to figure out how to create this technological marvel that is the Obama campaign .
The other thing the Obama people understand is that to make the Internet work you have to close your eyes and say , O.K. , I ’m going to let something like that go .
You ’ve got to be willing to not have centralized control .
VIII : The Last Word
The underpinnings of the Internet trace back in part to concerns about national security .
In October of this year the nation ’s newest military endeavor , the United States Air Force Cyber Command , is set to commence operations .
The command will employ a force of 8,000 — mostly tech - savvy civilians such as physicists , computer scientists , and electrical engineers .
Major General William Lord is the commander .
Major General William Lord :
There are cyber - terrorists , there are cyber - criminals , and potentially there are even nation - states .
I do n’t happen to view the nation - states as the 800 - pound gorilla in the room .
I think that the cyber- terrorists and the cyber - criminals are much more problematic .
The fact that a 12 - year - old in the Philippines can affect global markets with the release of one virus , all of a sudden it ’s kind of a wake - up call .
We do n’t want to be in the middle of monitoring the Internet .
What we have been focusing on in the air force is really the defense of our networks , the defense of our ability to use the entire electromagnetic spectrum to conduct air - force operations .
As you see in some of our ads , we show you a Predator flying over a combatant area that is being controlled from the United States — that ’s a long , long thin thread that we need to be able to protect .
It ’s a worldwide operation that ’s in air and space and terrestrial networks .
It connects 500,000 people together , and probably 3,000 aircraft , and an untold number of spacecraft .
Vinod Khosla : Communication always changes society , and society was always organized around communication channels .
Two hundred years ago it was mostly rivers .
It was sea-lanes and mountain passes .
The Internet is another form of communication and commerce .
And society organizes around the channels .
Paul Baran :
At the beginning there was a different attitude than today .
Now everyone is concerned about making money , or reputation .
It was different then .
We all wanted to help one another .
There was no competition , really , on most things .
It was a total open flow of information .
There were no games .
There are so many others who did equally good work , and their names are just forgotten .
We were all a bunch of young whippersnappers .

It 's just another in a long line of stolen laptops ... unless you work in management at AT&T and you 're worried about your social security number falling into the hands of identity thieves .
Or , you 're worried that your coworkers might find out how much -- or how little -- you actually earn .
( Update : Maybe AT&T should have eaten its own dog food . )
While AT&T has declined to disclose the number of management employees put at risk by the May 15 theft from an employee 's car , one manager who is among them tells me he knows of others located throughout every corner of AT&T 's vast empire in the U.S.
" I have found one individual who was not impacted , " says the manager , who asked not to be named .
" This is probably big , but not everyone . "
" I 'm very disappointed in my company , " he adds .
" Eight days passed before we were notified ... and it took up to another 10 days to be informed about requesting a fraud alert and to be given instructions for signing up for credit watch . "
I 've asked AT&T for comment .
At the end of this post is a long excerpt from a Q& A the company provided to employees , who learned of the breach via an e-mail , which reads in part :
" This is to alert you to the recent theft of an AT&T employee 's laptop computer that contained AT&T management compensation information , including employee names , Social Security numbers , and , in most cases , salary and bonus information .
...
We deeply regret this incident .
You will soon hear about additional steps we 're taking to reinforce our policies to safeguard sensitive personal information and ensure strict compliance in order to avoid incidents like this in the future . "
Regrets were not enough to allay the anger of this manager .
" It is pathetic that the largest telecom company in the world -- with more than 100 million customers -- does n't encrypt basic personal information , " he says .
Failure to encrypt and otherwise better protect such data is inexcusable at this point in time , agrees Kelly Todd , a staff member at attrition.org , a security site that maintains a database of data - breach incidents .
" Lack of encryption of personal data is generally troubling , especially when the data is being stored on any mobile device with a ' steal me ' bulls - eye on it , " says Todd .
" According to part of the AT&T e-mail , ' It was not encrypted , but the laptop was password protected .
AT&T is currently in the process of encrypting such systems . '
Good for them , but larger companies can sometimes have tens of thousands of systems to identify , plan for , and then execute an encryption process .
It seems to me that they should have been ' in the process ' a year ago .
" Even more troubling is that AT&T mentions that the laptop was password protected in their letter , " he adds .
" It might make some people feel better , but just password protection alone is generally considered a security joke . "
The AT&T manager whose data was exposed sees an even larger issue in play here .
" I receive company internal e-mails reminding me to contact our legislators about relieving the company of the burdens of regulation , " he says .
" What happened here shows the company is n't ready to have those burdens lifted . "
Here 's the meat of that Q&A from AT&T :
When and where did this happen ?
The laptop was stolen on May 15 from an employee 's vehicle , and the employee notified a supervisor upon discovering the theft .
The case is under active police investigation ; we 're not providing any further details .
Why are n't you disclosing the location ?
We believe that the theft was a random property crime and , in most of these cases , the hard - drive is wiped clean and the computer is re-sold for profit .
We do not want to potentially notify the thief of the nature of the data on the hard - drive .
What kind of information was on the laptop ?
The laptop contained a file listing names , Social Security numbers and salary and bonus payments for a number of AT&T management employees .
Has any of this personal information been compromised ?
We have no reason to believe this information has been compromised .
We are working closely with local law enforcement to investigate the crime and to attempt to recover the laptop .
How many employees are affected ?
It is our policy not to provide that information .
Why did the employee have the information on his / her laptop ?
The employee and business unit had access to the data as part of normal work functions .
We 're not providing any additional detail on the circumstances .
Was it encrypted ?
If not , why not ?
It was not encrypted , but the laptop was password protected .
AT&T is currently in the process of encrypting such systems .
How could this have happened ?
This was a criminal act by an unknown person .
AT&T is taking proactive measures to remind employees of the need to protect company property to avoid such incidents in the future .
What are the proactive measures ?
Managers throughout the company will be responsible for ensuring compliance with existing standards for use of mobile computing devices by both employees and vendors .
These standards include encrypting sensitive data and physically securing devices containing such data .
Why were n't those standards followed in this case ?
The measures and precautions we put in place to protect the security of company - owned property and our employees ' personal information were not followed .
We will continue to remind our employees in the strongest terms what the policies and expectations are , and we will enforce those policies across - the - board , without exception .
We 'll leave the last word to the manager whose personal info was put at risk :
" Water - cooler buzz is really just beginning , " he says of the reaction within the company .
" Lots of anger - both that the information was compromised and that the person responsible was just disciplined .
We absorb the entire risk of identity theft and the individual gets off with ' discipline . '
" I expect , after the outrage of SSN and payroll dies down , there will still be anger that ' personal responsibility ' means nothing .
If this does n't get you fired - what does ? "
Ever since Victorian holidaymakers rushed to the seaside to don knotted hankies , the postcard image of children riding donkeys has been inextricably linked to British summer holidays .
But today , the tradition is facing restrictions as new animal cruelty guidelines are introduced , banning overweight youngsters from seaside donkey rides .
A donkey code of practice is being brought in to stop anyone over 50.8 kg ( 8st ) from riding the animals amid growing fears that Britain 's 850 donkeys are buckling under the weight of heavier children and putting their health at risk .
As childhood obesity becomes an increasing problem , a whole generation could miss out on what has become something of a rite of passage at Britain 's seaside resorts .
The latest rules , drawn up by the Donkey Sanctuary in Devon and endorsed by the British Equine Veterinary Association , are targeted at all local authorities with beach donkeys – including Great Yarmouth , Brighton and Torquay .
Blackpool beach , which is home to the largest number of beach donkeys in the UK , is likely to see the biggest impact on its 200 animals .
The resort was approached by the charity to accept the first copy of the new code to hand over to the town 's mayor , Councillor Robert Wayne , and Joan Humble , the Labour MP for Blackpool North and Fleetwood , at the north pier today .
The Lancashire resort already has stringent employment rights for its animals , brought in three years ago .
These include working no more than six days a week between 10 am and 7 pm , with one full day of rest , a minimum of an hour 's lunch break and a donkey ' MoT ' at the start of the summer season to ensure the animals are fit .
Council inspectors also carry out spot checks to make sure the animals ' rights are respected .
Donkeys are also fitted with a microchip so they can be easily identified .
These rules are also being rolled out on a nationwide basis along with the rider weight limits .
Donkeys , which were first brought to Britain to toil down mines and can live to the age of 50 , are a common sight in Blackpool , plodding along the beach through sun and rain .
During a summer season they can take tens of thousands of children on rides at £ 2 a go .
Despite their indentured servitude , donkeys are actually very intelligent .
They have an incredible memory , recognising places and other donkeys from 25 years ago .
They were first domesticated around 4,500 years ago and were a status symbol .
But unlike horses , they do not have natural waterproof coats so they must have access to shelter .
Martin Taggart , Donkey Sanctuary 's head of welfare , said : " We already see an excellent standard of care for many beach donkeys in the UK , including Blackpool .
The code of practice will help to support local authorities to ensure all beach donkeys receive the same levels of care .
" The other purpose of the code is to provide a resource of advice and support to those working with beach donkeys or setting up new businesses .
We are here to help in any way we can . "
Blackpool councillor Henry Mitchell said : " It is 66 years since we recognised that these animals needed protecting against some owners who would work them day and night if they could .
The new code endorses what we do already and gives it the backing of two powerful organisations . "
The Donkey Sanctuary is hosting a free workshop on how to look after donkeys in Drumnadrochit , near Loch Ness .
Similar classes are also being planned throughout the UK and Ireland .
Advice will be offered on dental care , warning signs for when to call for a vet and basic first aid .
To date , the US government has announced charges against 23 detainees whom it plans to try by military commission , including six against whom it is seeking the death penalty .
In the seven years since the Bush administration announced that it planned to try Guantanamo detainees by military commission , only one terrorism suspect has gone to trial .
However , there have been dozens of pre-trial hearings .

Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving

Profile : INTP
Revision : 3.2
Date of Revision : 6 Aug 2010
INTPs are pensive , analytical folks .
They may venture so deeply into thought as to seem detached , and often actually are oblivious to the world around them .
Precise about their descriptions , INTPs will often correct others ( or be sorely tempted to ) if the shade of meaning is a bit off .
While annoying to the less concise , this fine discrimination ability gives INTPs so inclined a natural advantage as , for example , grammarians and linguists .
INTPs are relatively easy - going and amenable to almost anything until their principles are violated , about which they may become outspoken and inflexible .
They prefer to return , however , to a reserved albeit benign ambiance , not wishing to make spectacles of themselves .
A major concern for INTPs is the haunting sense of impending failure .
They spend considerable time second - guessing themselves .
The open - endedness ( from Perceiving ) conjoined with the need for competence ( NT ) is expressed in a sense that one 's conclusion may well be met by an equally plausible alternative solution , and that , after all , one may very well have overlooked some critical bit of data .
An INTP arguing a point may very well be trying to convince himself as much as his opposition .
In this way INTPs are markedly different from INTJs , who are much more confident in their competence and willing to act on their convictions .
Mathematics is a system where many INTPs love to play , similarly languages , computer systems -- potentially any complex system .
INTPs thrive on systems .
Understanding , exploring , mastering , and manipulating systems can overtake the INTP 's conscious thought .
This fascination for logical wholes and their inner workings is often expressed in a detachment from the environment , a concentration where time is forgotten and extraneous stimuli are held at bay .
Accomplishing a task or goal with this knowledge is secondary .
INTPs and Logic --
One of the tipoffs that a person is an INTP is her obsession with logical correctness .
Errors are not often due to poor logic -- apparent faux pas in reasoning are usually a result of overlooking details or of incorrect context .
Games
NTs seem to especially enjoy include Risk , Bridge , Stratego , Chess , Go , and word games of all sorts .
( I have an ENTP friend that loves Boggle and its variations .
We 've been known to sit in public places and pick a word off a menu or mayonnaise jar to see who can make the most words from its letters on a napkin in two minutes . )
The INTP mailing list has enjoyed a round of Metaphore , virtual volleyball , and a few ' finish the series ' brain teasers .
INTPs in the main are not clannish .
The INTP mailing list , with a readership now in triple figures , was in its incipience fraught with all the difficulties of the Panama canal : we had trouble deciding : whether or not there should be such a group , exactly what such a group should be called , and which of us would have to take the responsibility for organization and maintenance of the aforesaid group / club / whatever .
A Functional Analysis
Introverted Thinking
Introverted Thinking strives to extract the essence of the Idea from various externals that express it .
In the extreme , this conceptual essence wants no form or substance to verify its reality .
Knowing the Truth is enough for INTPs ; the knowledge that this truth can ( or could ) be demonstrated is sufficient to satisfy the knower .
" Cogito , ergo sum " expresses this prime directive quite succinctly .
In seasons of low energy level , or moments of single - minded concentration , the INTP is aloof and detached in a way that might even offend more relational or extraverted individuals .
Extraverted iNtuition
Intuition softens and socializes Thinking , fleshing out the brittle bones of truths formed in the dominant inner world .
That whichis not negotiable ; yet actual application diffuses knowledge to the extent that knowledge needs qualification and context to be of any consequence in this foreign world of substance .
If Thinking can desist , the INTP is free to brainstorm , calling up the perceptions of the unconscious ( i.e. , intuition ) which are mirrored in patterns in the realm of matter , time and space .
These perceptions , in the form of theories or hunches , must ultimately defer to the inner principles , or at least they must not negate them .
Intuition unchained gives birth to play .
INTPs enjoy games , formal or impromptu , which coax analogies , patterns and theories from the unseen into spontaneous expression in a way that defies their own comprehension .
Introverted Sensing
Sensing is of a subjective , inner nature similar to that of the SJs .
It supplies awareness of the forms of senses rather than the raw , analogic stimuli .
Facts and figures seek to be cleaned up for comparison with an ever growing range of previously experienced input .
Sensing assists intuition in sorting out and arranging information into the building blocks for Thinking 's elaborate systems .
The internalizing nature of the INTP 's Sensing function leaves a relative absence of environmental awareness ( i.e. , Extraverted Sensing ) , except when the environment is the current focus .
Consciousness of such conditions is at best a sometime thing .

Type Relationships for INTPs :
Feeling tends to be all or none .
When present , the INTP 's concern for others is intense , albeit naive .
In a crisis , this feeling judgement is often silenced by the emergence of Thinking , who rushes in to avert chaos and destruction .
In the absence of a clear principle , however , INTPs have been known to defer judgement and to allow decisions about interpersonal matters to be left hanging lest someone be offended or somehow injured .
INTPs are at risk of being swept away by the shadow in the form of their own strong emotional impulses .

The day ’s news surely confirmed that prejudice .
The second day of this year ’s annual meeting was devoted to a symposium on weeds and global climate change , and the speakers were outlining a future in which many of the members ’ current strategies will be irrelevant or ineffective .
The keynote speaker , Cameron Wake of the University of New Hampshire ’s Climate Change Research Center , did little to put the audience at ease .
Wake is a charismatic man who has traveled the colder regions of the world  the Canadian arctic , the Greenland ice sheet , Antarctica and the high mountains of Central Asia .
On these trips , he collects ice cores , whose analysis enables him to reconstruct histories of past atmospheric and climatic changes .
His soul patch , pink shirt and pink tie made him a minority of one in this room .
He dealt firmly with an audience member who asserted that the climatic warming is nothing new , that records from imperial Rome indicate that citrus and other warm - weather crops were then far to the north of their current ranges .
Wake pointed out that local archaeology can’t change the global data set , which proves that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is at its highest point in more than 650,000 years and that the rate of increase is accelerating .
Subsequent speakers got down to cases .
Andrew McDonald , an agricultural scientist at Cornell University , had used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s high projections for CO2 levels at the middle and end of the century to create an atlas of potential weed migrations in cornfields in the Eastern United States .
If these projections prove accurate , Kentucky , by the end of the next one to three decades , should have a climate ( and weed flora ) resembling that of present - day North Carolina ; by century ’s end , it will have shifted to a regime more like that of Louisiana .
Delaware , over the same period , will be transformed to something first like North Carolina and then Georgia , while Pennsylvania will metamorphose into West Virginia and then North Carolina .
Florida will become something unprecedented in this country .
Field observations indicate that these transformations are already under way : another speaker pointed out that kudzu , “ the weed that ate the South , ” has already migrated up to central Illinois and by 2015 could be extending its tendrils into Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula .
Even more sobering were the figures that the biologist Brent Helliker of the University of Pennsylvania flashed on the screen .
First , he used maps taken from an ecology textbook to show the way the last ice age drove various forest types southward .
Then came a map Helliker created , suggesting that the current warming seems most likely to change the ranges to which forest trees are adapted  the areas where the black spruce , for example , grows now , are likely to become better suited to broadleaf trees .
He asked the question that was on the lips of every one of his listeners :
Can the forest adapt so drastically in a space of just decades ?
Helliker announced that he had no answer to that question , and his talk was over .
During a break between talks , Lewis Ziska was surprisingly upbeat .
With the challenges , he insisted , come opportunities .
Kudzu , for instance : Ziska has been seeking financing to study its potential as a source of biofuel .
Kudzu roots , as much as 50 percent starch by weight , seem ideal for ethanol production , while the plant ’s supercharged vines , which can grow a foot a day , would be an abundant source of alternative energy .
This would be win-win : we develop an alternative to fossil fuels and , at the same time , create a financial incentive to root out a particularly troublesome weed .
Developing techniques for managing weeds in a time of global climate change will be essential to the world ’s agricultural future , and the U.S.D.A. researchers , though they have been starved of essential financing , lead the world in this field .
( There is one exception , Ziska admits ; his Web searches have revealed that marijuana growers have an amazingly detailed knowledge of how CO2 enrichment affects their crop .
But as Ziska points out , they do n’t publish in scientific journals . )
Possession of this expertise could be a great economic asset to the United States , both for the protection it could provide to our own harvests and as an intellectual export that is sure to be much in demand in other countries .
Ziska says that he worries about mankind ’s ability to feed itself in a fast - changing future .
Paradoxically , it is weeds , he says , that can provide solutions .
They have helped us deal with lesser crises in the past .
When diseases and pests overwhelmed our domesticated food crops , it was to their wild relatives  plants that mankind has been battling for millennia  that plant breeders turned .
Because weeds have more diverse genomes , it is easier to find one with the proper genetic resistance to a given threat  and then to create a new hybrid by breeding it with existing crops .
An answer to the Irish potato blight of 1845 - 6 was eventually found among the potato ’s wild and weedy relatives ; a wild oat found in Israel in the 1960s helped spawn a more robust , disease - resistant strain of domesticated oats .
Weedy ancestors of our food crops , Ziska predicts , will cope far better with coming climatic changes than their domesticated descendants .
Coping , after all , is what weeds have always done best .
As last year ’s climate - change panel report , Climate Change 2007 , made clear , we have already set in motion far - reaching and unstoppable changes in regional temperatures and precipitation and in the composition of our atmosphere .
No matter what actions we take , these changes will continue for decades .
If we are to avoid disaster , experts agree , we will need to be tenacious but flexible , ready to identify and exploit any opportunity in what will be a challenging , even hostile situation .
In this new world that we have made , weeds , our old adversaries , could be not only tools but mentors .
At which point , if Ralph Waldo Emerson is to be believed , weeds by definition will cease to exist .
The future of the infamous Guantánamo detention centre was thrown into doubt today after the US supreme court delivered the most serious blow yet to President George Bush 's policy of holding prisoners indefinitely without trial .
The justices , in a historic ruling , said the 270 prisoners , held for more than six years for alleged links with al - Qaida and the Taliban , have a constitutional right to take their cases to civilian courts on the US mainland .
Lawyers for the prisoners today hailed the ruling as a vindication of their battle to have Guantánamo , in Cuba , closed .
Travelling in Rome , Bush said he did not agree with the ruling .
" We 'll abide by the court 's decision .
That does n't mean I have to agree with it , " he said .
The nine - member supreme court normally has a rightwing bent but Justice Anthony Kennedy , a maverick conservative who holds the balance of power , joined his more liberal colleagues to provide a 5 - 4 majority .
" The laws and constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times , " Kennedy said .
At present the prisoners are classed as enemy combatants and face trial in military commissions set up by the Bush administration .
Their lawyers are expected to lodge habeas corpus petitions with federal courts as a matter of urgency , demanding their release .
Scores of cases related to the prisoners have been on hold in the federal courts pending the ruling .
Federal judges , thrown into consternation by the ruling , met today to decide how to proceed .
It is the third time that the supreme court has ruled against Bush on Guantánamo .
On the previous two occasions , the administration and the Republican - controlled Congress changed the law to strip the detainees of their right to habeas corpus .
Bush cannot go to Congress this time because it is now controlled by the Democrats , who favour closing the camp .
The definitive nature of the ruling will make it harder for the Bush administration to manoeuvre round .
One option , though it would create an outcry , would be to close the camp and transfer the prisoners to another country , such as Afghanistan .
In the split decision , Chief Justice John Roberts , a conservative , sided with the dissenters .
He described the existing set - up at Guantánamo as " the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants " .
Justices Samuel Alito , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also dissented .
Scalia said the nation is " at war with radical Islamists " and that the court 's decision " will make the war harder on us .
It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . "
Justices Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy to form the majority .
Souter wrote a separate opinion in which he emphasised the length of the detentions .
" A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents is the length of the disputed imprisonments , some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years , " he said .
Reflecting the chaos created by the ruling , a lawyer for Salim Ahmed Hamdan , Osama bin Laden 's one - time driver , said he will seek dismissal of the charges against Hamdan .
A military judge had already delayed the military trial 's start at Guantánamo to await the supreme court ruling .
Navy Commander Jeffrey Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman , said he had no immediate information whether a hearing at Guantánamo for Omar Khadr , a Canadian charged with killing a US special forces soldier in Afghanistan , would go forward next week as planned .
Vince Warren , executive director of the New York - based Centre for Constitutional Rights , which represents more detainees than any other group of lawyers , said he hoped the Bush administration would not react by transferring the detainees to " a black hole " in another country , such as Bagram airbase in Afghanistan .
Clive Stafford Smith , director of the London - based Reprieve , which represents 35 prisoners , said the ruling was " catastrophic " for Bush 's " secret prisons policy " .
He added : " But the prisoners still have a long way to go . "
Amnesty International wrote to the prime minister , Gordon Brown , today urging him to raise with Bush on his visit to London next week the issue of three prisoners with British links .
The three prisoners are : Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian formerly resident in London ; Shaker Aamer , a Saudi national formerly resident in London ; and Ahmed Belbacha , an Algerian who lived in Bournemouth .
Both the presidential candidates , the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain , have said they would close Guantánamo on taking over the White House .
McCain reiterated that pledge today : " I was in favour of closing Guantánamo Bay and I am still in favour of that , " he said .
DAVOS , Switzerland 
The president of the European Central Bank gave a full - throated defense Wednesday of the bank ’s determination to fight inflation , quashing hopes  at least for now  that it might follow the United States Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates to contain an economic slowdown .
Jean - Claude Trichet , the central bank president , said the bank , which hinted this month that it might raise interest rates , needed to focus on keeping inflation low , an approach that he argued would help calm increasingly chaotic financial markets .
The stance offered a sharp contrast to the Fed , which has shifted its focus over the last six months from fighting inflation to kick - starting the American economy .
The Fed aggressively eased interest rates further in an emergency move Tuesday .
Unlike the Fed , which is required by law to promote employment while keeping prices stable , the European Central Bank ’s sole role is that of a sentinel against inflation .

That ’s the point we ’re coming to under this national - security state in 21st - century America .
Republicans and Democrats and the people who continue to support them like a battered wife who wo n’t leave her abusive husband are to blame .
Karen De Coster on the LRC blag :
If you are going to St. Paul for the GOP convention , do n’t wear your Teva sandals , have hair like a hippie , flash a peace sign , or hang out with the vegans .
The feds are planting snitches and will brand dissenters as ‘ terrorist groups or organizations . ’
What they were looking for , Carroll says , was an informant — someone to show up at “ vegan potlucks ” throughout the Twin Cities and rub shoulders with RNC protestors , schmoozing his way into their inner circles , then reporting back to the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force , a partnership between multiple federal agencies and state and local law enforcement .
The effort ’s primary mission , according to the Minneapolis division ’s website , is to “ investigate terrorist acts carried out by groups or organizations which fall within the definition of terrorist groups as set forth in the current United States Attorney General Guidelines . ”
How much longer is it going to be before this totalitarian fascism is undoable except by bloody , catastrophic revolution ?
How much more are Republican and Democratic voters going to take ?
What ’s it going to take for them to realize voting for new and better politicians is never , ever going to solve anything ?

Fifty artists who recorded Prince covers in honor of His Purpleness ' 50th birthday June 7 have been slapped with a lawsuit by the short - tempered star .
His lawyers now demand that all copies of the tribute be destroyed .
Shockadelica had reached No. 8 on Norway 's album charts and received several popular reviews by the Norwegian press .
It 's perfectly legal to record and sell cover songs of someone else 's material , so long as you pay the compulsory licensing fee of about 10 cents per song .
To sell their five - disc set of 81 Prince cover songs , they would have to remit around $ 8 per unit sold to Prince , under a compulsory mechanical license .
Norway 's C+C Records distributed 5,000 of the box sets starting earlier this month , plus digital versions , and claim that no one made any money from the project .
As a result , they did n't think they owed Prince anything except maybe a free copy .
C+C Records owner and Prince fan Christer Falck contacted the Purple One 's people to try to send one to Prince , and that 's when the trouble began , according to the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet ( re-reported in Daily Swarm ) , one of many publications to post positive reviews of the collection .
For now , all 81 songs can be previewed free on C+C Records ' website , and some are also available on MySpace in streamable medley form .
When this giveaway first began , there were 5,000 copies of the compilation in circulation .
Thanks to Prince 's lawsuit and the publicity it will generate , we expect that number to balloon significantly in the coming weeks .

I 'll assume you know what a functor is ( and optionally a bit of Haskell ) : Consider these two functions
There 's a fundamental difference between them .
In some sense f " makes use " of the fact that we 're applying functions to integers , but even though g is acting on integers , it 's not using the fact that we 're acting on integers .
But this is a vague idea .
How can we make it precise ?
Consider the same in the context of computer programs .
This applies in many programming languages , but I 'll use Haskell here
When we ask ghci for the types of these it tells us that f is of type ( Num t ) => ( t , t ) -> t but that g is of type ( t , t1 ) -> t. ghci has spotted that f is making use of an interface exposed by integer types ( the type class Num ) but that g makes no assumptions at all about its arguments .
So in a programming language ( with static types ) we can make the notion above precise by having a type signature that explicitly says something like " I 'm not going to make any assumptions about my arguments " .
But how can we say something like this in the language of set theory , say ?
Set theory does n't come with a mechanism for making such promises .
( Well , ZF out of the box does n't , anyway . )
So consider a set - theoretical function like this What does it mean to say that h does n't use specific facts about its arguments ?
It clearly does n't mean that h does n't depend on its arguments because the right hand side clearly depends on a and b .
We need to say that the right hand side depends on the arguments , but that it somehow does n't make specific use of them .
Consider an example : Part of what we mean by not using specific knowledge is that if we were to replace one argument by another value we expect to perform the same substitution on the right .
For example , replacing 1 by 3 should give : So for any ' substitution ' function k:-> we wantMore generally , we want :
Note that we 've made use of the functions ( a , b ) -> ( k ( a ) , k( b ) ) and ( a , b , c ) -> ( k ( a ) , k( b ) , k( c ) ) to implement the idea of applying the same substitution to each of the elements .
We might want to work with a wide variety of mathematical ' containers ' like tuples and sequences as well as more abstract objects .
Can we generalise to all of these in one go ?
The function that coverts a set X to X x X , or X x X x X forms part of a functor .
The other part maps functions between sets to functions between containers .
So we can work with the usual ordered pair functor L with LX = X x X and Lf( x , y ) = ( f ( x ) , f( y ) ) .
Similarly we can use MX = X x X x X and Mf( x , y, z ) = ( f ( x ) , f(y ) , f( z ) ) .
We can stop talking about ' containers ' now and talk about functors instead .
We can rewrite our rule above asI 've been working with h acting on containers of integers , but if h truly does n't rely on specific properties of its arguments then there is a version of h for any set X , ie .
for any X we have a functionand when we use a function k to substitute values in the arguments there 's no reason to substitute values from the same set .
For example , if we let A be the set of the 26 letters of the alphabet ( using your favourite way to encode letters as sets ) , then we could let k be the function that maps n to the nth letter ( modulo 26 ) and still expectto hold .
For exampleMore generally , h is a family of functions such that for any k:X ->
Y we have : Note that there 's nothing set - specific about this , it 's a statement that could hold in any category .
We can take this as a definition .
A natural transformation between functors L , M:C ->
D is a family of morphisms h , one for each object X in C , such that for any morphism k:X ->
Y in C we have :
And there we have it .
Starting with the idea of a function that does n't ' peek inside ' its arguments , we 're led inexorably to the idea of substitutability of arguments and from there to a categorical definition of a natural transformation .
As the definition has been generalised fromto any category you can have fun unpacking the definition again in other categories .
For - like categories with functions as morphisms you 'll often find that natural transformations are still functions that do n't make too many assumptions about their arguments , but in each case the rule about what exactly constitutes ' too many assumptions ' will be different .
The category of vector spaces is a good place to start .
One last point : Category theory was more or less invented for natural transformations .
And it 's curious how it fits so nicely with the idea of abstraction in computer science , ie .
the idea of a function that is limited to using a particular interface on an object .
One interesting result relating to natural transformations is the Yoneda lemma .
Note also that the Theorems for Free are also largely about similar kinds of substitutions on function arguments .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Across the country , real estate agents and home sellers in wealthy neighborhoods who grew accustomed to seven - figure bidding wars during the boom are feeling the sting of the housing crunch .
Ed McMahon can vouch for that .
The former Johnny Carson sidekick and TV pitchman recently saw his $ 5 million Beverly Hills home go into foreclosure .
In fact , McMahon is a celebrity face to a broader trend .
Three of the nation 's richest zip codes saw particularly steep home - price declines in the three months ending April 30 , compared with the previous three months .
Prices down , foreclosures up
In Palm Beach , Fla. ( zip code 33480 ) , median home prices fell 38 % during that period , according to the real estate Web site Trulia .
Prices in Greenwich , Conn. ( 06831 ) , dropped 15 % , while homes in Wayzata , Minn . ( 55391 ) , are selling for 28 % less .
Prices in other wealthy towns also declined : Gladwyne , Penn. ( 19035 ) , was down 6 % , and Beverly Hills ( 90210 ) , Lincoln , Mass . ( 01773 ) , and Ladue , Mo. ( 63124 ) , each slid 2 % .
" What I 'm finding is that million dollar plus homes declined 4 % or so [ over the past 12 months ] , " said Don Kelly , a spokesman for Zaio , which is building a national data base of home value appraisals .
And foreclosure data tracks the pricing information .
In Beverly Hills , filings nearly doubled to 41 in the first four months of this year , up from 22 in the same period last year , according to RealtyTrac , which compiles foreclosure stats .
In Palm Beach , there were 34 foreclosure filings , up from 9 in the period a year ago .
Greenwich had 23 , up from 10 , while Wayzata had 18 , compared with 14 a year ago .
Kenilworth , Gladwyne and Medina had just one each , while Lincoln had none .
Of course , the high - priced areas have generally held up better than overall home prices , which plunged a record - setting 14.1 % in the 12 months ending March 31 , according to the S&P Case / Shiller Home Price Index .
And a handful of posh outposts are still posting gains .
Prices rose 18 % in the swanky Chicago suburb of Kenilworth , Ill. ( 60043 ) , 9 % in Medina , Wash . , which is home to Bill Gates just outside Seattle , and 5 % in Silicon Valley 's Atherton , Calif . ( 94027 ) .
But many ritzy areas are finding they are not immune to the housing slowdown .
Cautious buyers
Drew Peterson , an agent with Weichert Realtors in Greenwich , says sales volume has slowed as buyers have become more cautious .
" There are motivated sellers , and opportunities for buyers to capitalize on sellers downsizing , " he said .
Some of the owners of large estates are moving out and resettling in Greenwich 's more urban downtown area .
In the Philadelphia suburb of Gladwyne , the wealthiest town in Pennsylvania which lies along the fabled " Main Line , " the market has also slowed , according to Judy Getson , the sales manager for Prudential Fox & Roach in Haverford .
According to Trulia , just six homes sold in Gladwyne during the three months ending April 30 , down from 14 sold in the same three months during 2003 , a boom year .
There are now 42 homes in town on the market for a million dollars or more , according to Realtor.com , ranging from $ 1.195 million to $ 17 million .
Getson is seeing a downsizing phenomenon similar to Greenwich in the Philadelphia area , although not in Gladwyne proper .
" A lot of people are moving from mansions and buying condos in the city , " she said .
Perhaps the hardest hit of the 10 wealthy zips in our sample is Palm Beach , Fla .
Corcoran Group agent Paulette Koch says inventory is building up in the " low end " of the local market there - the $ 2 million to $ 6 million range .
" The volume of sales has declined , " she said , " and the selling season this year started very late and slowly . "
The ultra - high - end has , however , been very good .
" There have been records set all over the place , " she said .
Longer inventories
Sales are also moving much more slowly in the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata , according to Linda Blyth , director of previews for Coldwell Banker Burnet .
" One of our own agents had his own $ 4.2 million house on Lake Minnetonka as part of the waterfront tour we do every Fall .
It sold in April , at full price , to someone who was on that tour , " she said .
" People are taking longer to make a decision . "
Even in stronger markets , like Medina , Wash . , sales volume is down .
The market slowdown has unleashed a " fair amount of inventory , " said Larry Williams , a real estate agent for John L. Scott Real Estate .
And homes are often overpriced .
" Many sellers have n't figured out that it's not a seller 's market anymore , " he said .
Still , Williams sold a $ 2.2 million house recently in less than a day , with multiple offers .
And he had a waterfront lot for $ 4.4 million that went in nine hours .
" The stuff that is selling is going in 30 days or less , and the average sale is more than 100 % of the asking price , " said Williams .
But to sell , it has to be high quality and the marketing - photos , advertising , pricing and staging - all have to be top - drawer as well .
Of course , most of the homeowners in the country 's wealthiest zip codes - hedge fund chiefs , industrial moguls and dot - com billionaires - will probably have the means to wait out a slump .
It 's doubtful that these areas will see the flood of distressed sales that sent so many other areas into a downward spiral .
And that alone can be enough to give places like Beverly Hills a boost .
There are a lot of useless keys on a standard PC keyboard , but only the insert key has the power to fuck with your work .
I would rather the insert key be replaced with a button that gives you a mild electrical shock .
Prior to pointing devices , the insert key might have had some utility , but now it ’s just a trick button .
What it does is it transforms your keyboard into a living nightmare in which everything you type replaces the text in front of it , as if all that other text in your document was just hanging around for decoration .
The only scenario this would be useful is if you wanted to get rid of the proceeding text of your document , but only in a quantity of characters that was exactly equal to your newly - inserted text .
What kind of asshole would make such an edit ?
“ Man , I really need to delete the thirteen characters to the immediate right of my text cursor , and I also need to insert a word that ’s exactly eleven characters long , leaving two extra characters for spaces .
Time for my trusty insert key ! ”
How about you insert a bullet into your head ?
Meanwhile , the insert key is located right next to backspace , which is for people who edit text in an educated fashion .
So I ’m constantly hitting the insert key on accident , and there ’s no way to tell that you ’ve toggled on overtype mode until you notice that your new text is eating the shit out of your old text .
Maybe there ’s a way to disable this — maybe there is .
Maybe there ’s also a way to pry the button off with a carving knife .
But I would like to know if any sort of person needs their insert key , because perhaps I speak out of ignorance .
Do coders use overtype mode ?
Has anybody in the last twenty years hit this key on purpose ?
Or should I organize a protest ?
Via Raganwald , I saw this post by Andrew Birnstock : Perfecting OO ’s Small Classes and Short Methods .
The post is a summary of an essay by Jeff Bay called Object Calisthenics , from the new Pragmatic Programmers book The ThoughtWorks Anthology .
“ Object Calisthenics ” is supposedly an exercise to get you to write better object - oriented code .
Reading through the suggestions , I could n’t decide if the article was serious or not .
From Andrew ’s summary :
Use only one level of indentation per method .
If you need more than one level , you need to create a second method and call it from the first .
This is one of the most important constraints in the exercise .
Do n’t use the ‘ else ’ keyword .
Test for a condition with an if - statement and exit the routine if it ’s not met .
This prevents if - else chaining ; and every routine does just one thing .
You ’re getting the idea .
Wrap all primitives and strings .
This directly addresses “ primitive obsession . ”
If you want to use an integer , you first have to create a class ( even an inner class ) to identify it ’s true role .
So zip codes are an object not an integer , for example .
This makes for far clearer and more testable code .
From what I can tell , this really is serious .
These are supposed to be the object - oriented equivalent of chin-ups , designed to whip you into shape to write better OO code .
This strikes me as so bogus , I ca n’t even begin to describe it .
I ’m not against OO : I ’m a huge fan of Smalltalk , and I cut my programming teeth at one of the oldest object - oriented development shops .
In fact , I keep thinking of something that Steve Northover used to say to me when I was on my first work term at OTI :
“ That which obscures my code is bad . ”
If you ’ve ever seen a large body of code that adheres to The One True OO Style TM — like say , Smalltalk class libraries — you ’ll understand that almost every step you take towards “ true OO ” is just another way of obscuring the meaning of your code .
If you break your code up into 10 different methods , then that ’s 10 different places I have to look to figure out what is going on .
You ’re just writing spaghetti code by a different name .
If you ’re building a very large library , then maybe , just maybe , the additional flexibility is worth it .
I think Paul Graham sums it up best in his essay Why Arc Is n’t Especially Object - Oriented :
What major city in America has some of the most aggressively enforced cannabis laws ( despite the fact that cannabis has been decriminalized there for more than 30 years ) ?
What major city in America arrests nine minorities for every one Caucasian ?
Houston ?
Atlanta ?
Dallas ?
Birmingham ?
New Orleans ?
Miami ?
According to a new and comprehensive report , would you believe the five boroughs that make up New York City ?
What was the New York City Police ’s reaction to the data ?
In the New York Times today they of course attack the groups involved in bringing to the public ’s attention the department ’s overly aggressive and expensive enforcement of what are supposed to be decriminalized cannabis laws , and then make the amazing claim that there were not 350,000 cannabis - related arrests from 1997 - 2006 , but a mere 8,770 .
What the ?!*%$ ?!#@*^$#<:+={/#@7$!!!
The police commissioner , Raymond W. Kelly , has denied that the city ’s police officers are using racial profiling in conducting street stops .
The department ’s chief spokesman , Paul .
J. Browne , said on Tuesday that the report was flawed .
He said there were 8,770 marijuana - related violations from 1997 to 2006 .
In a statement , Mr. Browne said :
The N.Y.C.L.U. has used an advocate for marijuana legalization to mislead the public with absurdly inflated numbers and false claims about bias .
( Note that the report was underwritten by the Marijuana Policy Project , a pro-legalization organization ) .
If the N.Y.C..L.U. is for legalization it should just say so without resorting to smears .
It has repackaged
virtually the same flawed presentation Harry Levine made to the marijuana legalization lobby group NORML in Los Angeles last year .
The report erroneously claims that most of the over 300,000 persons arrested between 1997 and 2006 were not smoking marijuana in public and that they possessed only small amounts of marijuana ; in other words , the
infractions were violations .
But the actual violations total for 1997 - 2006 was 8,770 ; not the 350,000 .
Between 2002 and 2006 , the total was 3,449 .
Here ’s the breakout by year :
1997 : 1062
1998 : 987
1999 : 810
2000 : 1394
2001 : 1068
2002 : 758
2003 : 701
2004 : 663
2005 : 623
2006 : 704 ( It was 683 in 2007 )
Hmmmm ….
I wonder who is telling the truth here , public advocates or the cops ?
At least when NORML confronted Mayor Bloomberg on his 100th day in office in 2002 to stop the NYPD ’s then controversial practices such as ‘ Operation Condor ’ that exploded the cannabis arrest from around 2,000 per year to over 55,000 , the NYPD ’s public spokesperson did not come out and , shall I say , prevaricate regarding New York City ’s verifiable criminal justice data .
Back then , the NYPD ’s top brass in effect said to NORML and the national media ‘ So what if there was an increase in arrest ?
We were tasked with a quality - of - life , ‘ clean up New York City ’s streets ’ campaign under Mayor Giuliani … ’
The documentation of New York City ’s massive increase cannabis arrests have been well documented for years ( and affirmed by both state and federal data ! ) , so why is the NYPD attempting to now downplay , in such a dramatic way , their nearly 15 - year old aggressive policing policy regarding minor cannabis offenses ?
In a report released yesterday in coordination with the New York City Civil Liberties Union that should and hopefully will shake up the way the Bloomberg Administration and the NYPD conduct their cannabis law enforcement , Harry Levine , Ph.D of Queens College and Deborah Peterson Small , Esq. in remarkable breadth and detail reveal startling criminal justice data of excess and institutional racism in New York City ’s criminal justice system .
Also included , which provide interesting insight , are on - the - record interviews with NYPD law enforcement personnel that help to explain the motivations ( preview : ‘ Dollar$ For Collars ’ ) behind what is now truly a deviant cannabis prohibition enforcement policy in the United States — and the world .
Who ’d thunkit ?!
Key Points from The Marijuana Arrest Crusade in New York City : Racial Bias in Police Policy 1997 - 2007
New York City ’s 400,000 marijuana arrests were …
…racially skewed .
From 1997 to 2007 police arrested and jailed nearly 220,000 blacks , more than 112,000 Latinos , but only 58,000 whites .
Over that period , whites represented the largest percentage of the city ’s population .
Government surveys consistently show a higher rate of marijuana use among young whites than in other racial groups .
… extremely skewed by gender .
About 91 percent of people arrested were male .
… ineffective in reducing serious and violent crime .
The arrests may well increase crime by diverting police officers and resources from more effective anti-crime work .
… often the result of stop , frisk and search encounters .
In 2007 , the NYPD stopped nearly 469,000 people .
The vast majority ( 87 percent ) of people stopped were innocent of any wrongdoing .
New York City ’s 400,000 marijuana arrests were not …
… in line with the marijuana arrest rates of other large cities .
New York City now arrests and jails more people for possessing marijuana than any city in the United States or the world .
… part of a similar increase in marijuana arrests nationwide .
While marijuana arrests more than doubled in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000 , they have spiked tenfold in New York City and now represent 10 percent of all arrests in the city .
… the result of an increase in marijuana use , which peaked nationally around 1980 .
… primarily of people caught smoking marijuana in public .
Most people arrested for marijuana possession in the city had small amounts of the drug concealed in their possessions , often in a pocket , purse or backpack .
… of people caught for more serious crimes who happened to be possessing marijuana .
In all of these arrests , marijuana possession was the highest charge and often the only one .
… the result of people committing crimes .
Simple possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is not a crime under New York state law , which classifies marijuana possession as a violation , like a traffic violation .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Japanese scientists found women 's menstrual blood can be used to repair heart damage , according to a study released in the latest Stem Cells online .
Scientists gathered the precursor cells , called mesenchymal cells ( MMCs ) from menstrual blood donated by nine women volunteers and cultivated it for about a month .
After being put together in a culture with cells from the hearts of rats , about 20 percent of the cells began beating spontaneously and eventually formed sheets of heart muscle tissue .
The success rate is 100 times higher than the 0.2-0.3 percent for stem cells taken from human bone marrow , according to Shunichiro Miyoshi , a cardiologist at Keio University 's school of medicine , who is involved in the research .
Another set of experiments showed that live rats that had suffered heart attacks improved after being implanted with the MMCs .
The researchers saw that the implanted MMCs gave rise to cardiomyocytes in the rats ' hearts and decreased the myocardial infarction ( MI ) area .
" There may be a system in the near future that allows women to use it for their own treatment , " Miyoshi told media that women may eventually be able to use their own menstrual blood .
Anyway , it is a new and more abundant sources for use in regenerative medicine which have been identified as a potentially unlimited , noncontroversial , easily collectable , and inexpensive source .

When it comes to spying , the nation 's top officials just can't keep from misleading the American people .
But has two years of end - of - the - world rhetoric and dodgy legalistic explanations from an Administration that secretly turned NSA 's formidable spying apparatus on the American people finally run its course ?
On Sunday , the New York Times ' Eric Lichtblau put paid on accusatiions that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied to Congress when he said there was no internal disagreement over the warrantless wiretapping of Americans .
If the Ashcroft ICU showdown was n't enough to earn Gonzales the official title of liar , the story that FBI employees thought the law was being broken 12 hours after the secret wiretapping of Americans started certainly does .
Tuesday , the Los Angeles Times reports that Democrats no longer trust the " straight shooting " Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell and consider him to be a " lobbyist . "
In letters to lawmakers , McConnell warned that prolonged debate by the House was making the nation " more vulnerable to terrorist attack and other foreign threats . "
In a newspaper interview last year , he said that merely debating the issue meant that " some Americans are going to die , " because terrorists and other adversaries would learn more about America 's surveillance capabilities .
More recently , at a House hearing in February , McConnell was accused of offering misleading testimony when he warned that allowing temporary eavesdropping authority to lapse would cause phone companies to quit cooperating .
For the past year , McConnell has largely been allowed to get away with his fear - mongering and exaggerated claims about the effect of curtails on wiretapping powers because even the most basic facts about the the president 's rogue wiretapping program remain classified .
But even with that cloak of darkness to hide the truth , McConnell still manages to mislead Congress and make statements so absurd that 's its impossible for anyone actually paying attention to the debate to believe him .
Like when he trotted out the Iraqi hostage story after it had been debunked , or told Congress how the powers under Protect America
Act snagged German terrorists and then had to retract the politically convenient exaggeration .
And he 's been yapping all over that a secret court destroyed 70 percent of the nation 's spies ' ability to eavesdrop around the world and then it turns out the problem is all about not being able to harvest every email that enters or leaves switches based in the United States .
You'd think at least that the nation 's top law enforcement official Attorney General Michael Mukasey would tell the truth , but he seems to have caught the same exaggeration flu that McConnell suffers from .
Last week , Mukaskey came to San Francisco and said that the " government should n't need a warrant when someone picks ups a phone in Iraq and calls the United States . "
He 's right and it never has .
He also said that before 9/11 , the government knew about a call from a safe house in Afghanistan to somewhere in the United States .
" We did n't know precisely where it went . "
He suggested that the U.S. might have prevented another terrorist attack if the government could have monitored that call without court approval .
It could have .
It should have .
The CIA and the FBI , under the Bush administration , could have taken Al Qaeda seriously and stopped 9/11 with the tools they had .
They did not .
And now the nation 's top law enforcement official is lying about wiretapping laws .
And he added that companies such as AT&T , Sprint and Verizon that massively violated federal privacy laws should be given amnesty , which he said " was just not fair . "
That 's just absurd .
As we learned over the last two years , even John Ashcroft knew the targeting wiretaps at Americans without warrants was illegal .
The telecoms certainly knew it , too .
And in another stunning revelation in Sunday 's New York Times story , we learn that from the start , the Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson refused to sign off on any applications for full wiretaps that used information from the illegal wiretaps .
To top it off the next day , he tops himself by saying that theft of intellectual property fosters terrorism .
These people have no shame .
Now Congress is returning to session and the White House is now willing to make some sort of deal now that it 's figured out its fear mongering , terror armageddon rhetoric is n't working any more .
The House should n't bargain lightly and the more time passes , the more that this program comes into focus as an immense and illegal operation that violated every legal boundary put into place after the country learned about Nixon and Hoover 's wiretapping excesses .
Just today , John
Yoo 's infamous torture memo was declassified .
There 's no reason that Congress should be in any hurry to hand more wiretapping power to this administration of exaggerators and chicken littles until it releases the other John
Yoo memo – the one that gave legal cover to the government 's spying on American citizens without court orders .
The one that told this President that he had the power to order his minions to collect , store and sift through my phone records and internet usage without getting a judge 's approval .

Sir John Charnley created the hip replacement
In the six decades since the birth of the NHS , treatment has changed almost beyond recognition .
What was the stuff of fantasy in 1948 , such as organ transplants , is now routine .
In 1948 , a cataract operation meant a week without moving with the head which was supported by sandbags - now it is over within 20 minutes , and most patients have day surgery .
The first UK heart transplant patient in 1968 only survived 46 days - now 24 are carried out in the same period .
In 1958 , hip replacements were so unusual that the surgeon who invented them , Sir John Charnley , asked patients to return them after death - now there are 1,000 every week .
From being an area where nothing was possible it has now become a discipline where nearly everything can be repaired and where the whole organ can be transplanted
Tom Treasure , former heart surgeon
To mark the 60th anniversary of the NHS , the Royal College of Surgeons asked members about which developments have made the biggest impact .
Heart surgery
In 1948 any sort of heart surgery was almost unheard of and surgeons could not work a stopped heart as there was no way to keep a patient alive for any length of time .
Former heart surgeon Tom Treasure said two developments in the 1940s and 50s made all this possible .
" From being an area where nothing was possible it has now become a discipline where nearly everything can be repaired and where the whole organ can be transplanted , " he said .
" In 1948 around the birthday of the NHS three surgeons working independently operated successfully inside the beating heart to open up the narrowed heart valve and restore normal flow of blood .
Heart surgery was almost unheard of in 1948 " The second enabling step was the machinery to fully replace the function of the heart and lungs so that surgeons could repair the heart and then restore it to action .
" Ever more ingenious means were being devised to operate on the still beating and functioning heart .
" Total body cooling was used to allow the action of the heart to be paused so that the surgeon could hastily work inside it , and children were supported by blood flow from parents for long enough to allow a repair operation .
" And lastly - viewed perhaps by some as the least likely to succeed - was a contrivance of pumps and tubes to do the work of the heart and lungs .
" In 1953 this was achieved and in due course was refined to become usable as a routine . "
Day surgery
As treatments developed patients needed to spend less time in hospital .
Surgeons say this has not only benefited the patients but the NHS , enabling more operations and cutting hospital stay costs .
FIND OUT MORE
As the NHS turns 60 , BBC News is giving it a health check .
Watch out for reports , features and analysis on TV , radio and the web .
In the 1980s only a few operations were done by day surgery - now 170 different procedures can be done this way .
Douglas McWhinnie , of the British Association of Day Surgery ( BADS ) , said : " In 1948 a relatively simple operation like hernia repair would have meant an average hospital stay of two weeks . "
Laparoscopic or keyhole surgery has had a similar effect , according to Professor Robin Kennedy , of the Association of Coloproctologists ( colon and rectal specialists ) .
" With laparoscopic surgery you can recover better and faster , you shorten the stay and lessen the risk of a hospital acquired infection , " he said .
Reconstructive surgery Reconstructive surgery has also seen a number of big steps forward : from the first toe - to - thumb transplant at East Grinstead to whole sections of the body now .
Professor Simon Kay , vice - president of the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons , said microsurgery - the joining together very small arteries and veins to restore the vital blood supply to a piece of living tissue - helped to transform patients ' lives .
" This technique has been the single biggest advance in plastic surgery in the last 60 years , " he said , " because it allows a surgeon faced with a defect in the body to move tissue from another part of the same body and restore life to the transplanted tissue , so that healing begins immediately .
" An example might be seen after removal of a large cancer from the face , leaving a deep hole that a simple skin graft cannot fill , but which can be repaired by transplanting muscle and skin from the back .
" Microsurgery has moved on to apply this concept widely , so that whole bones may be transplanted to replace diseased structures such as the jaw bone . "
Vascular surgery Peter Taylor , a vascular surgeon at London Bridge Hospital , praised the development of keyhole surgery to treat some aortic aneurysms - a swollen blood vessel below the heart .
" They make it much safer for the patient and the mortality across the board has fallen by at least three percentage points , " he said .
" It reduces the hospital stay so your patient is out in two days as opposed to 10 , and they do not need to go to intensive care or high dependency . "
Silicone revolutionised cosmetic surgery
In 1948 , the NHS had some support available for those with hearing problems such as special schools , sign language and even cumbersome hearing aids .
Over the past 20 years , however , an increasing number of patients have benefited from a surgical innovation .
" Cochlear implantation - surgically implanting a device to directly stimulate the inner ear - is the greatest ever advance in the treatment of profound deafness and has transformed the lives of thousands of adults and children worldwide , " said Richard Ramsden , president of ENT UK .
Douglas McGeorge , president of the British Association of Aesthetic Surgeons , said the advent of new man made materials such as silicone for breast implants had enabled dramatic advances . "
It means that we can rejuvenate breasts we can give people who have been born with very little breast tissue normal breasts . "
Bernard Ribeiro , president of Royal College of Surgeons , summed up the revolution that has taken place .
He said : " Over the last 60 years surgery has transformed almost out of all recognition .
" A patient in 1948 would have almost certainly been treated by a general surgeon covering a wide range of specialties in surgery and could expect a lengthy hospital stay .
" Today , advances have led to much greater degree of specialisation and , as shown by this snapshot of our members , led to sophisticated treatments for previously incurable conditions , better quality of life and shorter hospital stays . "

This frothy flume is what 300,000 gallons of water per second looks like .
A 60 - hour surge of almost 75 billion gallons , it 's part of an effort to revitalize the ecosystem of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon .
Teams from the U.S. Geological Survey , the Grand Canyon Trust and 25 other agencies have been working together since 1995 to develop a plan that will mimic natural flooding to redistribute sediment that would normally wash downriver .
Moving the sediment from the central riverbed to the riverside rebuilds the sandbars downstream that serve as natural habitats and backwater nursery grounds for endangered fish species such as the humpback chub , as well as camping grounds for recreational use .
Katie Gumble and her boyfriend Dean Pickard appeared to be arguing A couple who died when they were hit by a packed commuter train travelling at 80 mph have been named by police .
Dean Pickard , 33 , from Hoddesdon , Hertfordshire , and his girlfriend Katie Gumble , 35 , of Harlow in Essex , appeared to be arguing , police said .
CCTV footage of the incident showed the couple tussling with each other at Harlow Mill station , officers revealed .
The King 's Lynn to London Liverpool Street service via Cambridge had 300 passengers on board .
Det Ch Insp David Shipperlee , from British Transport Police , said witnesses reported hearing " raised voices " .
He added : " It would appear from CCTV evidence that the couple were on the tracks and they were both pulling at each other .
" They were seen on the CCTV to be tussling .
It 's not clear at this stage who was pulling whom and for what reason .
A section of track 300 yards long was cordoned off by police " It may be the male was trying to pull the female away , as was suggested by one witness . "
A 300 - yard ( 274 m ) long section of track at Harlow Mill was cordoned off by police , leading to delays on the West Anglia mainline .
Naveed Riaz , 29 , who was on the National Express East Anglia train when it struck the couple at 0800 BST on Tuesday , said : " We felt a vibration under our feet and I thought we had hit some debris or some rocks .
" It took several seconds for the train to stop .
No one knew what had happened .
" All we were told was that there had been a serious incident on the track .
We were kept on the train for four hours . "
Members of Ms Gumble 's family have visited the scene .

Saturday 's Kentucky Derby was marred by tragedy , as runner - up Eight Belles had to be euthanized on the track after breaking both front ankles .
She was not the first athlete to be struck down on the playing field .
Here are ten other tragic athlete deaths .
1. Bill Masterton , Hockey
Four minutes into a 1968 hockey game between the Minnesota North Stars and the Oakland Seals , the North Stars ' center , Bill Masterton , fell backward and hit his head on the ice .
He died 30 hours later from " massive brain injury , " becoming the first player to be killed during a game in the history of the NHL .
2. Vladimir Smirnov , Fencing
Vladimir Smirnov and Matthias Behr lunged simultaneously during a championship fencing match in Rome in 1982 .
As Behr 's foil struck Smirnov 's chest protector , the blade snapped at the tip , and the jagged end cut through Smirnov 's wire - mesh face protector .
The blade pierced Smirnov 's brain and severed an artery ; the 28 - year - old died 10 days later .
3. Sergei Chalibashvili , Diving
Competitors at the World University Games in 1983 knew that Sergei Chalibashvili 's dive could end in tragedy .
The 21 - year - old Soviet was attempting a 3 - 1/ 2 reverse somersault in tuck position , and he'd struggled with the dive in practice .
Chalibashvili's head struck the ten - meter - high platform , resulting in multiple skull fractures ; he died of heart failure .
His dive became known as the Dive of Death .
4. Lane Frost , Bull Riding
Lane Frost , the 1987 world champion bull rider , was thrown from a bull at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo .
The 25 - year - old was fine after the fall but , as he walked away , the bull charged him from behind , breaking Frost 's ribs and puncturing a major blood vessel .
Frost died from the injuries .
The movie 8 Seconds , directed by John G. Avildsen , depicts Frost 's life and death .
5. Fabio Casartelli , Cycling
The descent from Col du Portet d'Aspet , in the Tour de France , is lined with concrete blocks that prevent cars from going over the edge of the cliff .
In 1995 , Fabio Casartelli , a 24 - year - old Italian cyclist , fell off his bike on a turn , his head striking one of the concrete blocks .
He suffered three heart attacks in a helicopter on the way to the hospital , and was pronounced dead not long after .
6. Raman Lamba , Cricket
In 1998 , a 38 - year - old Indian cricketer , Raman Lamba , was hit by a ball during a cricket tournament .
The blow to the head caused severe brain injuries that three days later resulted in his death .
7. Owen Hart , Professional Wrestling
Owen Hart , a Canadian professional wrestler , was to be lowered into the ring during a WWF match in 1999 .
Unfortunately , the cable was not properly hooked onto Hart .
The 33 - year - old fell to his death in front of more than 16,000 people .
The match was being shown as part of a pay - per - view package called " Over the Edge . "
After Hart 's death , the event continued .
8. Rosbin Yuman & Lester Marrioquin , Soccer
In 2001 , a storm hit a stadium in Chiquimulilla , Guatemala , during a soccer game .
While most fans left , officials made the poor decision to continue the game .
Lightning struck one of the metal guard rails surrounding the field , injuring more than 25 people and killing two of the players , Rosbin Yuman , 16 , and Lester Marrioquin , 24 , instantly .
9. Kim Hyung - Chil , Equestrian
Although there were wet conditions at the 2006 Asian Games , organizers do not believe that slippery conditions caused the accident that killed Kim Hyung - Chil .
The 47 - year - old South Korean rider 's horse , Bundaberg Black , apparently mistimed its jump over a fence and fell , crushing Hyung - Chil .
10 . Lauren Chang , Cheerleading
At the Minuteman Cheerleading Championships this year ( April 2008 ) , a 20 - year - old on an elite cheer squad died from collapsed lungs .
Apparently , Lauren Chang was accidentally kicked in the chest by a tumbler , though witnesses were n't sure exactly what went wrong .
Previously on mental_floss ...
Jockey Frank Hayes , baseball player Ray Chapman , and race car driver J.G. Parry - Thomas are discussed in Stacy Conradt 's December 2007 post on Eight ( and a half ) People Whose Jobs Actually Killed Them .
We already know that Toyota has an eye to the future with the Prius , likely switching up the batteries and adding a plug - in option , but now we 've got a little more news on what shape the next generation fuel - saver will take .
According to Auto Observer , the new model ( said to be showing up at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show ) will sport a larger , 1.8 liter engine , a ten percent increase in fuel efficiency , and will undergo a fairly noticeable redesign ( though we doubt it will end up looking like the concept car above ) .
Pundits say the new Prius will be larger , may be available in a wagon version , and there are suspicions that Toyota will grow the brand and include a compact version of the hybrid as well .
One thing 's for sure : with an increase in production of 60 percent for the next iteration , the eco-friendly car is sticking around .

Anyway , you did set up a second date with me but it was at a courthouse in the early afternoon and you kept telling me I did n't have to go if I do n't want to .
You had the courage to just pull over onto the side of the road to talk to me but you 're being coy about our second encounter ?
What gives ?
Maybe we could go somewhere a little less arrestee instead .
We 'd have to go dutch since I 'll be spending my date money on the fine you gave me but you seemed like a pretty independent woman so I do n't suspect you 'll have too much of a problem with that .
You were really pretty with a surprisingly warm smile given the situation .
I was the one who made a joke about pronouncing " stella " with a proper French accent .
We could be like the lamest cop / criminal romantic comedy ever .
You could be torn between your job and me and ultimately figure out zany ways to thwart my schemes to drink in public without landing me in the slammer .
It 'd be great .
Seriously though officer , do you wanna go on a date ?
Experts wonder where oil 's tipping point is ENERGY
Oil 's tipping point :
Where is it ?
With crude approaching $ 120 , experts look for hints of decline
With oil less than a buck away from $ 120 a barrel , analysts are growing weary at trying to anticipate the tipping point that will bring prices down .
Some say a six - score price could prompt developed countries to pressure the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production whether or not the cartel sees a need to do so .
Others say it 's folly to predict a tipping point until the weak dollar stabilizes and strengthens .
Either way , analysts say , it 's reaching the point where something 's got to give .
" I 'm hopeful that we are in the grand finale of this 2008 event , " said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service in Wall , N.J .
The side effect of high crude prices most visible to consumers , the price at the gasoline pump , also is setting records — and for the first time this week it surpassed its all - time inflation - adjusted high .
Oil crossed that threshold several months ago .
The federal government says the average U.S. price per gallon of gasoline hit $ 3.508 on Monday , nearly a dime higher than the March 1981 high of $ 3.41 in today 's dollars ( $ 1.42 before adjustment for inflation . )
That continued push also prompted analysts to speculate that oil 's run-up is reaching its last rally .
Kloza said attempting to identify the tipping point is " pretty much an exercise in abstract thought . "
Earlier this year , though , he compared $ 100 oil to the pre-dot - com bust Nasdaq stock exchange rally in 1999 and 2000 , though he was n't clear on whether $ 100 oil represented Nasdaq at 4,000 or 5,000 .
" It is now clear that it represented the former , and not the latter , which represented the last throes of the bubble , " Kloza said .
" I hope $ 120 a barrel is the equivalent of the Nasdaq 5,000 , which would put us in the last inning . "
Crude for May delivery came within a dime of $ 120 a barrel Tuesday before closing at a record $ 119.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The push came amid the dollar 's fall to another low against the euro , which makes oil a cheaper buy for foreign investors .
Demand in China , India and the Middle East remains strong , while U.S. demand is flat or falling , awash in worries about a recession fueled by the credit and housing crisis and negative jobs data .
Geopolitical factors that raised concerns about supply in recent days include militant attacks on Royal Dutch Shell 's oil operations in Nigeria that shut down 169,000 barrels a day of production ; a pirate attack on an oil tanker near Yemen ; and revelations that oil production in Russia fell in January and February .
Dollar called driving force
However , Addison Armstrong , director of market research for TFS Energy in Stamford , Conn. , said the weak - and - weaker dollar is driving the ramp - up .
The Federal Reserve has slashed U.S. interest rates to aid efforts to stave off a recession .
The European Central Bank has n't cut interest rates and hinted this week that it may raise rates to address inflation — which could widen the gap between the euro and the dollar .
" Until the dollar really stabilizes and turns , it 's foolish to try to call a top in this market , " he said .
" This crude rally is all about the dollar . "
Cushion of subsidies
Also , consumers in emerging economies like China and India where demand is strong have n't felt the pressure of high prices prevalent in the U.S. because their governments subsidize their gasoline costs , Armstrong noted .
" I think the tipping point really has to come when we see more significant demand destruction here in the U.S. , " he said .
" The longer and deeper the recession in the U.S. is , there is a chance that begins to impact China 's economy and India 's economy and some others where we get a lot of imports .
In a slowdown , we would n't be buying as much , and that could impact what is happening overseas . "
For now , however , demand in emerging economies is more than offsetting slower demand in the U.S. and other developed countries , said Brian Hicks , co-manager of the U.S. Global Investors Resource Fund in San Antonio .
An OPEC increase ?
And Hicks said $ 120 a barrel could prompt developed countries to pressure OPEC to " at least think about or consider " increasing production .
Top policymakers in Saudi Arabia , the world 's biggest oil producer , have said recently the kingdom sees no need to increase output anytime soon .
But International Energy Agency Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said in a speech Sunday that OPEC should help boost oil inventories because prices are too high .
Hicks noted that OPEC has less spare capacity than in the past — now less than 2 million barrels a day — but there 's room to talk about upping output with oil hitting its current level .
" That 's probably at the point where you start to see global leaders maybe get involved , " Hicks said .
" It 's becoming more and more of a headwind to the economy . "
Kloza said $ 120 oil does n't change his prediction that the average U.S. price for gasoline will range from $ 3.50 to $ 3.75 a gallon with exceptions in some areas , such as California .
He has said $ 4 per gallon gasoline is n't reasonable given the sluggish economy and underlying fundamentals of supply and demand .
" Let 's hope so , " he said Tuesday .

Last April 9th , at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah , two soldiers were driving a rented SUV about five kilometers from the part of the range used for live firing .
It was at night , and an F - 16 that thought it was firing at something in the live fire area , lit up the SUV instead .
Only 70 20 mm rounds were fired .
Fortunately , the two people in the SUV were only injured ( both from flying glass , the passenger got a dislocated shoulder as he rapidly exited the vehicle when it quickly turned off the road and stopped . )
The investigation of how this happen has not been completed .

When I put this question to professional philosophers I hear two different kinds of arguments .
One foolish and one cynical .
Should n't philosophers be especially sensitive to the moral and intellectual imperatives of the open access movement ?
Why is it that scientists have been so much more ready to embrace it than philosophers ?
In order to realize the vision of a global and accessible representation of knowledge , the future Web has to be sustainable , interactive , and transparent .
Content and software tools must be openly accessible and compatible .
Our mission of disseminating knowledge is only half complete if the information is not made widely and readily available to society .
New possibilities of knowledge dissemination not only through the classical form but also and increasingly through the open access paradigm via the Internet have to be supported .
We define open access as a comprehensive source of human knowledge and cultural heritage that has been approved by the scientific community .
The Internet has fundamentally changed the practical and economic realities of distributing scientific knowledge and cultural heritage .
For the first time ever , the Internet now offers the chance to constitute a global and interactive representation of human knowledge , including cultural heritage and the guarantee of worldwide access .
Why are there still hard copy philosophical journals and books ?
Why is so much on - line philosophy hidden behind subscription walls ?
Why are universities , students and researchers being forced to pay for access to information authors would happily give away for free ?
The foolish argument goes like this : "
" I know that the stuff published in the journals is selected by the editors because it ’s good .
How will I know what 's good without the journals ?
And if I can't tell who 's writing good stuff how will I know who should be promoted , hired or tenured ? "
The obvious answer is that the journals are only as good as they may be because of the judgment of their philosophical editors and reviewers and those people will not go away just because the hard - copy journals do .
Those editors can publish on - line journals , or best - of lists or run contests or simply offer personal recommendations .
There are many many different ways to do open access peer review and almost all of them are better than what we have now .
But I think this foolish objection really conceals a more cynical worry .
" Artificial and cumbersome though it may be , the economics of hard - copy publication is ultimately the only external discipline on the profession 's standards .
Without the objective constraints imposed by the textbook and library marketplace , the profession would never manage to achieve any sort of consensus about what was better than what ; standards would collapse . "
The cynical worry may not be wrong .
But if it ’s right it is an issue the profession should and must address .
Academic publishing is doomed .
If the end of hard - copy journals means the end of professional standards then the discipline is doomed too .
It seems to me that the transition to open source could come swiftly and relatively smoothly .
What 's needed is a sort of academic version of the eSign Act .
eSign said that courts cannot treat a contract or signature as invalid just because it is in electronic form .
At a stroke , congress made an eContract as good as a paper one .
What we need is for professional philosophers to declare that they are going to stop ranking philosophical quality by counting trees killed .
If significant numbers of philosophers , starting with luminaries and full professors , publicly committed to something like the following , the transition to open access could happen virtually over night .
The Open Philosophy Pledge I will make my academic writings available for viewing without charge on my personal website .
I will do so before , or at least at the same time as , I ( would ) submit them to hard - copy journals .
I will not submit my academic writings to journals whose policies prevent me from continuing to make them available , free of charge , on my own web site .
I will endeavor to make copies of all my previously published academic writings freely available for on - line viewing .
I will encourage journals in which my work has appeared to make their archives of past issues open for general viewing without charge .
When I am asked to judge the quality of scholarly work for any purpose , including hiring , promotion and tenure , I will not assume that fee - charging publication is always superior to open access publication .
I will encourage and participate in the evolution of new practices and mechanisms for objective peer review and evaluation in an open access environment .
The format of academic books and journal articles is , in part , a function of the requirements of hard copy publication .
On - line publication will make possible new forms and structures of expression .
Realizing this , I will not assume that excellent work must take traditional forms .
I will encourage my colleagues and my department as a whole to take this pledge .
I will endeavor to have the standards proposed by this pledge explicitly incorporated into my department ’s and my institution ’s policies on hiring , promotion , tenure , and merit .

At 3 pm on Wednesday , 16th April , the mutilated body of 15 year old Hammad Nidar Khadatbh was found in lands of the illegal Israeli settlement of Al - Hamra by his father , who was out searching for his missing son .
Hammad had left the house at 9 am on Tuesday , 15th April to work on the family�s land , located near the stolen agricultural lands of the settlement .
As the second eldest son , he was picking cucumbers for the family rather than going to school , to help with the income of his struggling family .
At evening he failed to return home , and so his father and other family members immediately went searching for him .
They found nothing .
They set out again the next day , Wednesday , and found his body in a place they had searched the day before - clearly dumped overnight .
Hammad�s body was naked , bloated , and tortured .
His neck was broken , and his face had been smashed in with rocks .
One finger had been cut off and there were multiple holes in his torso , seemingly made by a sharp , round implement - something like a pen , his family explained .
An Israeli police officer who arrived on the scene to investigate the incident confirmed that Hammad had been murdered , but made no comment as to by whom .
Hammad�s body was immediately taken to the coroner in Jerusalem , but the report on the exact cause of his death will not be available for another week .
After speaking to many people in the area , it was established that Hammad had tried to return home via the Al - Hamra ( Arabic for " red area " ) checkpoint , but was refused passage through as being only 15 years old , he had no identification ( IDs are only issued to Palestinians aged 16 years and over ) .
It appears that Hammad was then forced to walk around the long way home , and was taken at this point on Tuesday night .
Given the location of the body - on settlement lands and near an Israeli - only apartheid road - the family are convinced that Hammad was killed by settlers from the Al - Hamra settlement .
His father explained that his son was only a young boy , and had no enemies .
Also , he explained , there are no Palestinians in that area , only settlers from the agricultural settlement .
The 11500 residents of the village of Beit Furiq , located near the northern West Bank city of Nablus , have regular problems with the illegal settlements near their village .
Approximately three years ago a 78 year old man , Mohammad Abu Oday , was killed when settlers from Itamar settlement destroyed his head with large rocks .
Another young man was also shot dead by settlers , and five others have been injured whilst attempting to pick their olives .
Residents advise that these attacks happen when Palestinians go to lands that are anywhere near to settlements , occurring every couple of years .
Interestingly , these attacks elicit no repercussions on the settlers by the Israeli military such as are inflicted upon Palestinian villages in similar , or even lesser situations .
The village of Beita , for example , was shut down for four days last week , with massive roadblocks installed on every road to the village , and residents arrested for attempting to leave after a shooting occurred near an Israeli - only road in which no one was injured .
Hammad was buried at 3 pm on Thursday 17th April , and is survived by his parents and seven siblings .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado today sued the city and county of Denver seeking disclosure of public records related to the purchase of security - related equipment for the upcoming Democratic National Convention .
The city twice has twice denied requests filed by the ACLU under the Colorado Open Records
Act seeking disclosure of the records , the lawsuit filed in Denver District Court states .
Mary Dulacki , the records coordinator for the city ’s Department of Safety , has denied their release on the grounds that disclosure “ was contrary to the public interest ” and because “ it could potentially disclose tactical security information . ”
Mark Silverstein , the legal director for the ACLU of Colorado , said in a prepared statement that the city was being overly restrictive .
He argued that he did not believe the public records requested would contain any “ tactical security information . ”
Even if it did , he said , the Colorado legislature has passed amendments to the open - records laws that would allow disclosure of how the money is being spent while allowing for deletion of more sensitive information .
Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper ’s administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit .
The ACLU filing states the federal government has allocated $ 50 million to reimburse Denver for security - related expenses .
It states that Denver has budgeted $ 18 million for security - related equipment purchases .
A Denver Post request for information regarding security expenditures also was denied .
Katherine Archuleta , the mayor ’s liaison for the convention , recently revealed to the Denver City Council that about half of the $ 50 million federal grant would be used to reimburse
Denver for equipment purchases and that the rest would go to personnel costs .
The city has provided information about some of the equipment purchases by bringing forward contracts and purchase orders for approval by the City Council .
Among the items revealed were a nearly $ 1 million expenditure for wireless security cameras as well as the purchase of a SWAT vehicle .
Still , Silverstein argued that the city had shown an “ unjustified penchant for secrecy . ”
He said the lack of information has prompted rumors , such as whether the city had acquired a “ sonic ray gun ” for crowd control .
“ If Denver is buying such a device , or any other new - fangled so - called ‘ less lethal weapons , ’ the public is certainly entitled to know , ” Silverstein said in a statement .
“ And the public is entitled to ask whether Denver has adequately evaluated the manufacturers ’ self - serving claims of safety , has established appropriate policies to regulate how and when officers may use such weapons , and has adequately trained officers . ”
The lawsuit specifically names Alvin LaCabe , the city ’s safety manager , as well as the city and county of Denver .
Earlier this month , the ACLU , on behalf of 12 advocacy groups , filed a federal lawsuit asking the court to order the city of Denver and the Secret Service to determine where groups can demonstrate during the Democratic National Convention in August .
In response , the city released some details regarding public - demonstration areas and said it would disclose by June 12 the route that parades will be allowed to follow during the Aug. 25 - 28 convention .

Leaked confidential NIST documents concerning the investigation into the collapse of WTC 7 , the 47 - storey skyscraper that was not hit by a plane but imploded in under seven seconds on 9/11 , reveal that an " unusual " event preceded the collapse of the building – a " jet of flames " that shot out of several windows after most of the fire had already died down .
The leaked documents precede a BBC hit piece documentary which airs on July 6th and is set to claim that WTC 7 was the first steel - framed building in history to suffer a complete collapse from fire damage alone — a scientific impossibility .
The documents – entitled Confidential and Predecisonal Document NIST Report on Building 7 – form the preamble for a long - awaited final verdict on what caused a structurally reinforced building to fall like a controlled demolition despite suffering relatively minimal fire damage .
Chapter 1 : WTC 7 Visual Evidence , Damage Estimates , and Timeline Analysis ( William Pitts ) is a thorough analysis of window fires by video and picture evidence , which concludes that all major fires before floors 7 and 13 died out prior to collapse .
The report states , " At 4:38 p.m. all of the windows between 13 - 44A and 13 - 47C were open , and the fires responsible for opening the windows had died down to the point where they could no longer be observed . "
" Just prior to the collapse of the building at 5:20:52 p.m. a jet of flames was pushed from windows in the same area .
The event that caused this unusual behavior has not been identified . "
The report describes the nature of fires from floors 7 - 13 and also states , " With the exception of the fires on the 19th , 22nd , 29th , and 30th floors discussed at the start of this section , there is essentially no direct visual evidence of fires on other floors of WTC 7 . "
The photographs displayed in the report , many of which have never been seen before , do not show any other damage to the building than the small fires from floors 7 - 13 and the relatively minimal " scoop " observed on the lower right - hand west face of the building .
What could have caused this " jet of flames " to shoot out of windows immediately prior to the collapse of the building ?
The decompression force of a series of explosives or an incendiary device ?
The leaked documents precede a BBC hit piece documentary which airs on July 6th and is set to claim that WTC 7 was the first steel - framed building in history to suffer a complete collapse from fire damage alone – a scientific impossibility .
As we reported on Monday , Deputy Director , Emergency Services Department , New York City Housing Authority Barry Jennings , who was trapped inside Building 7 , reported explosions going off and witnessing dead bodies before the collapse of either of the twin towers .
We will be combing through the lengthy NIST documents over the course of the next few days to pick out more irregularities and potential smoking guns over the next few days – stay tuned .

Chondritic meteorites have a similar chemical composition to the sun and are therefore reliable witnesses as to what the solar nebula , from which the planets formed , was composed of .
This can be used to deduce what the Earth consists of chemically .
However , ETH Zurich researchers have now discovered that strictly speaking this fundamental geological assumption is not true .
Many moons ago , geochemists discovered that the Earth must be identical to the so - called chondritic meteorites in terms of its chemical composition .
The latter consist of exactly the same mixture of elements as the sun , which suggests that they mirror the composition of the solar nebula , from which the planets once emerged .
This reasoning enables geologists to draw many significant conclusions .
For example , geochemists can work out which elements make up the Earth ’s core as a result .
Or so they thought : although it may not exactly shatter this geochemical fundamental , a new publication does expose various cracks in the theory .
Based on the results of their experiments , a team of researchers , which includes Bernard Bourdon , Professor of Isotope Geochemistry at ETH Zurich , recently concluded in the journal Nature that the Earth may have a slightly different composition to chondritic meteorites after all .
Theory not all that plausible
The basis for the study was the discovery by another team that the element neodymium in the rock found in the Earth ’s surface has a somewhat different isotopic make - up compared to the meteorites .
As neodymium is a lithophilic element and therefore not present in the Earth ’s core , the team suggests , there must be a hidden reservoir in the Earth ’s mantle that exhibits a different composition to the rest of it .
However , on account of the strong convection in the Earth ’s mantle , which gives rise to a continual mixture of the rock , Bourdon ’s team did not find this theory all that plausible , and so they started looking for another explanation .
The scientists scrutinized the samarium and neodymium isotopes in rocks from the Earth , meteorites from Mars and the asteroid Vesta more closely and supplemented the values with data from the literature on moonstones .
The two elements samarium and neodymium are closely related : the isotopes samarium 147 and samarium 146 namely decompose in the daughter isotopes neodymium 143 and neodymium 142 .
If you measure the isotopic composition of the two elements , you can reconstruct the processes that occurred in the early stages of the solar system on account of the degradation ’s different half - lives .
The new data reveals that rocks on the moon and Mars also exhibit an isotopic composition that differs significantly from that of the chondritic meteorites .
However , the values match those of the terrestrial rocks : according to this , the Earth , Moon and Mars have a samarium - neodymium ratio that is five to eight percent above that of the chondritic meteorites .
“ The variance may not seem all that much ” , explains Bourdon .
“ But it is significant enough to be inconsistent with the classic model ” .
How homogenous was the solar nebula ?
According to Bourdon , the fact that the three celestial bodies the Earth , the Moon and Mars could have the same isotopic composition proves that the theory of a hidden reservoir in Earth ’s mantle is far from holeproof .
“ Our analyses indicate that a process must have occurred in the first 30 million years of our solar system which resulted in the uneven distribution of matter in the solar system . ”
As far as the scientists are concerned , there are two possibilities : the first is that the matter in the solar nebula ceased to be homogenous even before the planets formed , a theory which astrophysicists consider perfectly plausible .
This explanation is supported by that fact that the meteorites from the asteroid Vesta , which is considerably further from the sun than Mars , has a different isotopic composition compared to rocks from the Earth , the Moon or Mars .
The data indicates that Vesta could have a similar composition to the chondritic meteorites , which also come from the asteroid belt .
The second explanation assumes that a crust formed on the first planetary bodies , the so - called planetesimals .
In the course of this , the crusts and mantles of these bodies each exhibited a different composition .
According to this theory , when the planets collided with one another their crust was blown away .
This left bodies that had another isotopic composition to the original solar nebula , from which today ’s planets later emerged .

Daniel Williams decided he ’d listen to his girlfriend and his 8 - year - old son and finally quit smoking , with the help of a new prescription drug called Chantix .
He started taking the medication , and a couple of nights later , as he was driving his pickup truck on a country road in Louisiana , Williams suddenly swerved left .
His girlfriend , Melinda Lofton , who was with him , later told him that his eyes had rolled back in his head and that it had seemed as if he was frozen at the wheel , accelerating .
Moments later , they were in a bayou , struggling to escape the murky water , Williams said .

“ Since I was a kid , never had anything like this ever happened before , ” he said .
“ It never happened before , and it has n’t happened since .
And all the tests I ’ve taken say I have nothing wrong with me at all . ”
The nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices last week linked Chantix to more than two dozen highway accidents reported to the Food and Drug Administration , saying the mishaps may have resulted from such drug side effects as seizures .
The FDA had earlier issued a warning about suicidal thoughts and suicides among patients taking Chantix and is now evaluating whether it needs to expand and strengthen that precaution .

Pfizer , the drug ’s manufacturer , said that as early as May of last year , it had added a warning to the prescribing literature for Chantix that patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery until they know how the medication affects them .
But such admonitions apparently did n’t get much notice from busy doctors .
Even some government transportation agencies missed them .
The Federal Aviation Administration continued , until last week , to list the drug as approved for pilots .
The federal truck safety agency was also unaware of the risk .
“ That is a problem , ” said Janet Woodcock , head of the FDA ’s drug evaluation center , adding that her office needs to find ways to communicate safety information more effectively .

The military , which bans Chantix for flight and missile crews , is considering whether other precautions are needed , Pentagon officials said .
Woodcock said the FDA believes the medication should remain on the market as an option for smokers trying to quit .
Approved two years ago , it differs from other smoking - cessation drugs by acting directly at sites in the brain affected by nicotine , blocking the pleasure that comes from smoking as well as the cravings .
But Williams , 28 , said he was surprised that a drug he had hoped would help turn him into a healthier person instead , he believes , caused an accident in which he could have been seriously hurt , even killed .

Lofton is still struggling with a neck injury she suffered .
Williams , a telephone service technician , lives near Rayville , La. , between Shreveport and the Mississippi River .
He said he went to see his doctor last year for help quitting his nearly two - pack - a - day habit .
He ’d started smoking in high school and had failed in previous attempts to quit .
But he knew people who recommended Chantix .

“ They were talking about how good it was supposed to be , and it seemed like the right thing to do since I was trying to quit , ” Williams said .
The crash occurred July 15 , two days after he started taking Chantix .
He said the last thing he remembers is heading home after checking on the house of a friend who was out of town .
“ I woke up in the bayou , with water coming into the truck , ” he said .
“ I did n’t know where I was . ”

Lofton had gotten out first and was on the bank , calling to him .
He followed the sound of her voice and paddled to safety .
Williams said he had no history of seizures and does not drink alcohol .
His doctor , who has treated Williams from childhood , made the connection to Chantix .
Williams said he was considering suing Pfizer .
His lawyer , Kristian Rasmussen of Birmingham , Ala. , said he was aware of at least one other Chantix accident , involving a deliveryman who fell out of a moving truck .
Advertisement
The FDA has received more than 3,000 reports of serious problems involving Chantix , but Pfizer said that had to be put into context , since more than 5 million people in the U.S. had taken the medication .
The company said that no direct cause and effect had been proved between the drug and the problems .
The FDA is most concerned about reports of mental health problems , including more than 400 cases involving Chantix users who reported suicidal thoughts and more than 30 who killed themselves .
Yet many patients report success with the medication .

Kathy MacInnis , 44 , of Kingston , Mass. , said she had been smoking for more than 30 years and quit on New Year ’s Day .
“ Without Chantix , I had never been able to quit , ” she said .
“ It just put me in a calm place . ”
She was smoking close to two packs a day when her 12 - year - old daughter confronted her .
“ She came home from school and said her health teacher asked her if her parents smoked , because she could smell it on her , ” MacInnis said .
“ That was my turning point . ”
Advertisement
MacInnis videotaped her story for Pfizer but she said the company did not pay her other than covering the costs of traveling to New York for an interview session .
She reported no unpleasant side effects while taking the medication , only vivid dreams that some call “ Chantix dreams . ”
“ The first few days , I kind of felt funny , ” said MacInnis .
“ You kind of feel high . ”

Scarlett Johansson found fame in the hit film Lost In Translation
US actress Scarlett Johansson and her boyfriend Ryan Reynolds have announced their engagement .
The star 's publicist , Marcel Pariseau , confirmed the news but says the couple have not set a wedding date .
The 23 - year - old showed off her engagement ring on Monday night at New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala .
The couple started dating last year after Reynolds , 31 , split up with fiancee Alanis Morissette in 2006 .
Johansson 's recent film credits include The Other Boleyn Girl , The Nanny Diaries and Lost in Translation .
Ryan Reynolds has appeared in movies like Smokin ' Aces , The Nines Chaos Theory and Definitely , Maybe .
Five space tourists have so far flown to the space station
The first private manned mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) is set to go ahead in 2011 , a US space tourism company has announced .
The mission has been agreed between the company Space Adventures and the Russian federal space agency .
A Soyuz spacecraft will be specially manufactured for this mission .
Space Adventures has so far bought seats on Soyuz missions to the ISS for five clients , with the price of a seat costing upwards of $ 20 m ( £ 10 m ) .
This private mission ... will not interfere with the implementation of the ISS programme or the obligations of the Russian space agency
Alexey Krasnov , Roscosmos
This fully dedicated private Soyuz mission , scheduled to take place in the second half of 2011 , will have two seats available in the craft for space tourists .
Earlier on Wednesday , Space Adventures announced that Google co-founder Sergey Brin had made a $ 5 m ( £ 2.5 m ) down payment to book a seat on a future orbital spaceflight .
" The Soyuz to be used for this mission shall be a specially manufactured craft , separate from the other Soyuz vehicles designated for the transportation of the ISS crews , " said Alexey Krasnov from the Russian space agency , Roscosmos .
He added : " This private mission , flying two Space Adventures clients at once , will not interfere with the implementation of the ISS programme or the obligations of the Russian space agency .
" On the contrary , it will add flexibility and redundancy to our ISS transportation capabilities . "
New ventures
The first space tourist to fly to the ISS was Dennis Tito in 2001 .
Four others have followed in his footsteps : Mark Shuttleworth , Greg Olsen , Anousheh Ansari and Charles Simonyi .
The sixth client , Richard Garriott , son of Nasa astronaut Owen Garriott , is currently in cosmonaut training with his launch to the ISS scheduled for 12 October 2008 .
Several other companies have also been pressing ahead with commercial space ventures .
Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic business will carry six passengers on sub-orbital flights at a price of $ 200,000 ( £ 100,000 ) per seat .
Virgin says it has sold more than 200 tickets ; the first flight is scheduled for no earlier than 2009 .
European aerospace contractor EADS - Astrium has announced that it is developing a four - person spacecraft to make suborbital trips .
And US space entrepreneur Elon Musk is working on a capsule that would be able to carry crew to the space station .

Today Bush pleads with China and Japan to save him from his economic failures .
Bush likes to say that his enormous tax cuts that give hundreds of billions of dollars to America 's wealthiest people are job - creation programs .
But America has bled millions of jobs since Bush 's tax cuts became law , so it 's time to try something new .
Bush 's new tactic ?
Beg China and Japan to increase the value of their currencies , which will make American manufacturers more competitive .
But Bush has nothing to offer in return -- and has done little to make other countries inclined to offer him favors .
Instead of making pointless pleas to other countries , maybe Bush should come up with an economic plan that would actually create jobs instead of just putting more money in the pockets of those who need it least .
10-15-2003 Washington Post Bush uses EPA funds to make campaign ads .
Well , the EPA probably has a lot of money sitting around , what with it not enforcing environmental regulations anymore .
So why not spend some of that dough getting President Bush reelected ?
The EPA runs Spanish - language ads on radio touting the Bush environmental policies that destroy the environment .
10-15-2003 CBS
Bush misrepresents evidence on Iraq to the United Nations .
Colin Powell 's speech to the United Nations was a watershed moment in the run-up to the Iraq war .
Powell 's reputation as a moderate and credible voice made the evidence he presented about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction seem that much more impressive .
But as State Department employee Greg Thielmann reveals , it was nothing but twisted and misleading evidence , trumped up to sell Bush 's Iraq war .
10-11-2003 Washington
Post Bush proposes loosening protections of endangered species .
Sure , species extinction is a bad thing , but is it as bad as , say , not having a wastebasket made out of real ivory ?
That 's the position of the Bush administration , anyway , which lifts restrictions on killing and trading endangered species .
But at least it 's only foreign animals .
Who cares about those animals in other countries ?
10-10-2003 Associated Press Bush overturns limits on mining waste sites .
In another victory for the mining industry , which has been as generous to President Bush as a donor as he has been to it as a president , the Interior Department overturns a rule put in place by the Clinton administration that limited the land mining sites could use to dispose of waste .

Bush starts new public relations campaign on Iraq .
Faced with failure , effective leaders change policy .
Ineffective leaders figure out new way to sell their current policies .
President Bush chooses to do the latter in Iraq , creating a new public relations push to make people feel better about the soldier - per - day death rate since Bush declared " Mission Accomplished . "
10-3-2003 White House Proclamation Bush declares Marriage Protection Week .
Is the institution of marriage in danger ?
Because as far as I can tell , people are still getting married .
But President Bush apparently thinks marriage is in dire need of protection , and hops into action by declaring " Marriage Protection Week . "
Bush , of course , thinks that marriage needs protection from gay couples , who want to attack marriage by , uh , getting married .
I 'm not quite sure how that works , but Bush must know what he 's doing , right ?
10-1-2003 CNN
Bush does nothing to reveal who disclosed Valerie Plame 's identity .
The White House likes to tout President Bush as a " strong leader . "
If there 's even a modicum of truth to that , Bush already knows who leaked Valerie Plame 's identity as an undercover CIA agent .
But when asked , he refuses to do anything to reveal the truth , instead just claiming , " I want to know the truth , " and passing the buck ( as usual ) to the Justice Department .
9-28-2003 Washington
Post Bush discloses undercover CIA agent 's identity as retribution against her husband .
When Joseph Wilson revealed that the Bush administration had used false intelligence to justify the war in Iraq , a smear campaign against him was predictable .
But it was impossible to predict that the White House would reveal that Wilson 's wife was an undercover CIA agent who worked on weapons of mass destruction -- supposedly the reason we went to war in the first place -- just to get back at Wilson .
9-24-2003 New York Times Bush tells Congress not to offer a Medicare prescription drug benefit to the poor .
Traditionally , Medicare benefits go to all Medicare recipients .
But President Bush wants millions of low - income seniors to lose out on any new prescription drug benefit .
He would rather those seniors rely on the states '
Medicaid benefits , which vary from state to state ( and year to year ) and worsen the states ' already severe fiscal crises -- which Bush has made worse with his enormous tax cuts .
9-23-2003 Washington
Post Bush takes away the discretion of career prosecutors .
Conservative politicians like to reduce law enforcement to simple " tough on crime " platitudes .
But the actual enforcement of law and prosecution of crime can't be reduced to simple black - and - white thinking .
That 's why prosecutors ought to have discretion over charges they file .
But Attorney General John Ashcroft issues new guidelines forcing federal prosecutors to file the most serious charges possible in every case , because that " tough on crime " stance still looks great in the papers .
9-22-2003 Associated Press Bush gives federal funds to religious groups .
President Bush continues his efforts to chip away at the wall between church and state by issuing new regulations that allow new federal funds to go religious groups .
But this is about more than church - state separation .
It 's also about Bush 's attempt to move the federal government out of the business of helping people .
9-21-2003 The Observer Bush tries to cover up global warming .
Seriously , can we just stop it with the global warming denial already ?
I know it 's inconvenient for conservative ideologues , but facts are facts .
Actually , facts are n't facts if you work for the Bush administration , because facts can always be covered up .
And when it comes to global warming , that 's just what this administration does .
9-17-2003 Washington
Post Bush continues to hide energy task force proceedings .
Back in 2001 , the administration released an energy policy that was filled with gifts to President Bush and Vice President Cheney 's friends in the energy industry .
So it would hardly be surprising to find out that the energy industry dominated the meetings at which the policy was written .
But Cheney goes to the Supreme Court to try and keep records of his energy task force 's meetings secret , simply because of the administration 's distaste for open government .
9-16-2003 New York Times Bush attacks librarians for opposing the Patriot Act.
Librarians have criticized the Patriot Act because it allows the federal government to invade the privacy of library patrons .
And how does the Bush administration respond ?
" Mr. Ashcroft mocked and condemned the American Library Association and other Justice Department critics for believing that the F.B.I. wants to know ' how far you have gotten on the latest Tom Clancy novel . ' "
Silly people who want to protect civil liberties !
Do n't you have something more important to do , like celebrating " Patriots ' Day " ?
9-11-2003 Washington Post Bush uses the September 11 attacks to justify all his policies .
Why should we pass tax cuts for the rich ?
The September 11 attacks .
Why should we clear cut forests and let polluters write environmental policy ?
The September 11 attacks .
Why has America lost millions of jobs since Bush took office ?
The September 11 attacks .
Next thing you know , he 'll be saying we went to war with Iraq because of the September 11 attacks !
Nah , he would n't go that far ...
9-11-2003 Washington Post Bush tries to expand the Patriot Act. President Bush celebrates the second anniversary of the September 11 attacks by calling for an expansion of the Patriot Act , which restricts civil liberties in the name of security .
But at least he renames the day " Patriots ' Day , " so we all know that we 're bad Americans for valuing our freedom .
9-10-2003 Agence France - Presse Bush tries to expand the death penalty .
This really speaks for itself .
In a time when the death penalty ought to be shrinking into nonexistence what with dozens of innocent people being discovered on death row , President Bush pushes for an expansion of the death penalty , saying the current law is one of the " unreasonable obstacles " to fighting terrorism .
9-1-2003 USA
Today Bush allows the sale of PCB - polluted lands .
Remember when EPA stood for Environmental Protection Agency ?
President Bush 's EPA -- who knows what the hell it stands for under that guy -- reverses a 25 - year policy of not selling lands polluted by PCBs .
The bans prevented people from spreading the pollution until the EPA could ensure the lands were clean .
Not any more .
8-29-2003 Associated Press Bush expands global abortion gag rules .
One of Bush 's first acts in office ( see 1-21-2001 below ) was to limit funding to international organizations that provide abortions .
Now he expands that rule so that no federal funds can go to international organizations that provide any abortions , even with their own funds .
The result , of course , is devastating for the health of the world 's poorest women .
8-29-2003 Washington
Post Bush chooses not to regulate auto emissions .
It is n't often that government agencies choose to limit their own power , but President Bush 's EPA is a notable exception .
The agency announces that it conveniently does n't have the power to regulate auto emissions , providing another big win for the auto industry .
The reason ?
The EPA claims carbon dioxide is n't a pollutant .
Which is true , if you do n't believe in global warming .
( See 9-21-2003 , above . )
8-29-2003 Associated Press Bush cuts Energy Star program .
President Bush likes to praise programs in front of the camera and then slash them when the camera is turned off .
One good example is the Energy Star program , which Bush touts ( correctly ) as an effective environmental program , providing $ 70 in benefits for every one dollar spent .
But the EPA shifts funds so that the Energy Star program does n't get the funds Congress intended for it to get .
When Bush praises a program , watch out -- it maybe destined for big cuts .
8-28-2003 Washington Post Bush awards no -bid contracts to Halliburton .
Look , Halliburton may be the best company to provide contracting services in Iraq .
It may not be .
But one thing is certain : it looks awfully suspicious for the Bush administration to award a no- bid contract to Halliburton when Vice President Cheney used to be the company 's CEO .
What 's more , it completely contradicts the White House 's professed distaste for government interference in a free market .
A bidding process would drive down the costs for the taxpayer and guarantee improved services .
But it would mean smaller profits for Cheney 's old firm .
8-27-2003 Associated Press Bush cites war on terror as reason for small federal pay raise .
Justifying a miserly 2 percent raise for federal workers , Bush says that a higher raise would harm our ability to prosecute the war on terror .
So he does realize that we need money to win the war on terror .
But he has n't realized that his multi-trillion - dollar tax cuts do much , much , much more to destroy the nation 's financial health than a decent raise for those who work for the government .
8-23-2003 Washington Post Bush relaxes clean air rules .
We have to be honest with you : we thought this was a done deal back in November 2002 .
( See 11-22-2002 below . )
But apparently the EPA is now getting around to implementing the rules that will gut the Clean Air Act .
Under the new Bush rules , older power plants will be able to expand their operations without installing new anti-pollution technology .
But why should Bush care ?
Prevailing wind patterns push all that pollution toward the northeast , and those states did n't vote for him anyway .
8-22-2003 Associated Press Bush lies about air quality after September 11 attacks .
There 's nothing funny about this at all .
After the September 11 attacks , the EPA told New Yorkers it was safe to live and work near Ground Zero .
It turns out that under White House pressure , the EPA lied about the data it had and omitted important information about the quality of the air and what New Yorkers needed to do to stay healthy .
It may take years to see the effects -- possibly birth defects or increased cancer rates -- of what may be Bush 's worst lie yet .
8-18-2003 Time Bush defunds Teach for America .
If you run a nonprofit organization , beware the photo - op with George W. Bush .
It 's like the kiss of death : it may seem friendly at the time , but you 'll learn to regret it later .
While those who run Teach for America were optimistic after meeting Bush the presidential candidate , they found their funding taken away under Bush the president .
Now the program , which gives top students money for college for teaching in underprivileged communities , has to eliminate scholarships .
8-17-2003 Washington
Post Bush blocks plan to upgrade nation 's power grid .
You would think that in the wake of an enormous power outage that paralyzed much of the northeast United States and southeast Canada , it would n't be difficult to unite behind a plan to upgrade the power grid .
But President Bush opposes his own handpicked chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and sides with ( surprise , surprise ) the energy industry to oppose the plan .
Instead , the administration thinks that more deregulation is the solution , even though deregulation is largely the problem in the first place .
A deregulated power industry has no financial incentive to pay the costs of upgrading the grid .
Apparently , Bush has n't quite learned the lessons from Enron that he needs to learn yet .
8-14-2003 San Francisco Chronicle Bush cuts pay for soldiers in Iraq .
" And tonight , I have a special word ... for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States : America is grateful for a job well done , " said President Bush as he declared an end to fighting " major " combat operations in Iraq .
Bush has a funny way of showing he 's grateful .
Under Bush , the Pentagon cuts imminent danger pay as soldiers die every day in Iraq and family separation pay as soldiers are separated from their families for months .
8-12-2003 New York Daily News
Bush uses the IRS and federal funds to send out a campaign letter -- again .
Just as with his enormous tax cut in 2001 ( see 6-22-2001 below ) , President Bush is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to send a letter to folks letting them know about the rebate checks they 'll receive in the mail .
The purpose of the letter is nothing more than to associate Bush 's name with the checks , providing a little campaign boost for the president 's reelection .
8-11-2003 Associated Press Bush pushes plan to make it easier for timber companies to plunder national forests .
Just as President Bush fights the freedom - hating terrorists by taking away our freedoms , so he fights tree - burning forest fires by selling off the trees .
( See 8-21-2002 below . )
On a break from his annual month - long vacation , Bush takes the opportunity to promote his tree - destroying program and pretend to be an environmentalist .
8-9-2003 New York Times Bush proposes eliminating protections for historical sites from highway projects .
Another no -brainer that 's no-brained by the Bush administration .
Of course protecting historical sites should be of vital importance when you 're deciding where to put a major interstate .
And those protections are written into federal law .
But if the Bush administration has its way , they 'll be taken out , opening all kinds of historical sites to desecration and even destruction .

Bush gives oil companies in Iraq blanket immunity from lawsuits .
Whether you think Iraq 's oil was a small factor in the decision to go to war or the main reason , you cannot deny the potential that some of the companies given contracts to deal with the oil in post - Saddam Iraq may abuse their new privileges .
After all , any company can abuse any contract .
But Bush ensures that oil companies can engage in all the abuse they want with an executive order that gives them blanket immunity from lawsuits .
8-7-2003 Washington
Post Bush seeks retribution for judges who use their discretion in sentencing .
Laws that restrict the ability of judges to use their discretion when sentencing criminals can be the source of grave miscarriages of justice .
Attorney General John Ashcroft wants to make sure those miscarriages happens as often as possible , so he has asked federal prosecutors to report any instances of judges imposing more lenient sentences than the law allows .
The law is a blunt instrument , and discretion in sentencing allows judges to take appropriate action based on mitigating circumstances .
Is it any surprise that Ashcroft does n't approve ?
8-6-2003 New York Times Bush proposes cuts to Medicare funding for cancer drugs .
Cutting government healthcare costs is a good goal .
When it involves cutting services for cancer patients , you 'd hope the compassionate would rule out the conservative .
But not for the Bush administration , as the Department of Health and Human Services proposes cutting the amount of money the government spends on cancer drugs .
The administration says we overpay , but patient advocates say " instead of expanding access to lifesaving drugs , [ the cuts ] would limit access to cancer treatments for some of the most seriously ill Medicare beneficiaries . "

Conservatives believe that gay people getting married somehow threatens heterosexual marriages .
( They never seem particularly clear on how that works . )
President Bush believes that an unsatisfied conservative base somehow threatens his reelection chances .
( It 's pretty clear how that works . )
The solution is clear .
Bush attacks gay marriage , suggesting that his administration is working on a way to make it illegal everywhere in the country .
His attack comes at the expense of equality and dignity for homosexuals , values that Bush has never seemed to hold in high regard .

Bush shuts down nuclear weapons advisory panel .
President Bush has been pushing for new kinds of nuclear weapons ( see 7-6-2003 below ) , and there 's nothing more inconvenient for that kind of goal than independent oversight .
So the Bush administration eliminates the independent advisory board to the National Nuclear Security Administration .
Members of the committee had criticized Bush 's plans for new nukes , and the administration had n't called the committee together in the year before it was disbanded .

Bush creates a system where people can invest in the possibility of terror attacks and international upheaval .
This one did n't last long , and it showed just how important it is to have open government .
From the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the same folks who brought us " Total Information Awareness " ( and , years ago , the Internet ) , comes a project that would encourage investors to risk real money against the possibility of future events , like the overthrow of Jordan 's king , or terrorist attacks .
The idea would be to see whether such a system would have a predictive effect that would help us see world events before they happen .
But the obvious ethical problems of essentially betting on chaos , death , and destruction forces the Pentagon to shut down the sickening project the day it becomes public .
7-22-2003 Reuters Bush threatens veto if Congress overturns new FCC rules .
When President Bush eased media ownership rules ( see 6- 3-2003 below ) , he never expected trouble from the Republican - controlled Congress .
But an unprecedented public outcry against the new rules has put pressure on Congress to overturn the FCC 's decision .
But Bush is n't one to let something like " the will of the people " get in the way of his pro-corporate agenda .
So he lets Congress know that if it overturns the new rules , he 'll exercise his first veto .
How appropriate that it will go to protect the profits of megacorporations !

The Nation Bush exposes an undercover CIA agent in an act of petty vengeance .
Former Ambassador Joseph Wilson recently went public to say that he had investigated President Bush 's State of the Union claim that Iraq tried to purchase uranium from Africa and had found the story not credible nearly a year before Bush 's speech .
Given the Bush administration 's record , you 'd expect some kind of retaliation or attempt to discredit Wilson from the White House or its surrogates .
But Bush hits a new low when " senior administration officials " expose Wilson 's wife as an undercover CIA agent to reporter Robert Novak , ruining her career and possibly endangering her life .
Wilson calls it " a shot across the bow " to others who would speak out against the Bush administration .
Seems like a pretty direct hit to me .
7-9-2003 New York Times Bush obstructs September 11 investigation .
Remember when President Bush 's complaint with the weapons inspectors was that all their interviews were conducted in front of Iraqi government " minders " ?
Apparently he objected to the instance but likes the principle .
When the independent commission ( long opposed by Bush ) investigating the attacks of September 11 interviews intelligence personnel , the Justice Department insists on having a " minder " in the room , chilling testimony before the commission .
And that 's just the tip of the Bush administration obstructionism iceberg .
The commission complains of interference and noncooperation from all over the administration , noting that " problems that have arisen so far with the Department of Defense are becoming particularly serious . "
7-8-2003 Washington Post Bush proposes weakening Head Start .
Head Start is that rarest of gems : an effective and universally lauded educational program .
So why mess with success , right ?
But instead of expanding this preschool program that has been proven to give children a jump on learning , President Bush proposes changing the specific federal outlays to block grants that will give states more " flexibility " to spend the money .
Given that states are in their worst fiscal crises since World War II , it 's likely that they 'll stretch the money and direct as much as possible away from Head Start .

Today Bush continues to push for new nuclear weapons .
Radical conservative activists like the current President Bush a lot more than they did his father , and here 's one reason why .
Where Bush 41 put a moratorium on U.S. nuclear weapons tests in 1992 , Bush 43 not only wants to resume tests , but wants to create entirely new kinds of nuclear weapons .
Continuing with earlier efforts ( see 2-20 - 2003 below ) , the Bush administration argues for smaller nukes that are much more likely to be used in combat .

The Army Times Bush belies pro-military rhetoric with cheap treatment of troops .
President Bush sure talks a good game when it comes to the military , does n't he ?
Whether he 's embedding the media with troops in combat or flying jet planes to victory celebrations , Bush has used the military as a political backdrop more effectively than any president in U.S. history .
But what does his real military record look like ?
Not his personal record of bravely protecting the skies of Texas from the Viet Cong .
Rather , Bush 's record as president shows a pattern of disrespect to the military that the Army Times describes as " nickel - and - dime treatment . "
Whether he 's opposing an increase in payments to families of troops killed in action or capping raises for low - ranking soldiers , Bush never matches his pro-military rhetoric with action .

When it comes to the environment , the Bush administration 's top officials and the career agency staffs just can't seem to agree on anything .
Although a Bush official tries to get Yellowstone National Park taken off the United Nation 's World Heritage Sites list , officials at the Interior Department insist the park still faces " continuing threats to the quality of the park 's streams , bison herd and cutthroat trout populations -- and to visitors ' overall experience of the park .

Bush proposes to eliminate overtime for 8 million American workers .
Back in January ( see 1-31-2003 below ) , President Bush proposed changes to labor laws that could mean millions of workers lose overtime pay .
Now we know just how many millions .
A study from the Economic Policy Institute showed that 8 million American workers would lose the right to overtime under the proposed rule changes from Bush 's Labor Department .

Post Bush pushes school - sponsored religious activities .
Students have a right to pursue their own religious activities in public schools , but any implication that a religious activity is sponsored by the school or any authority figure violates the first amendment by giving the appearance of state - approved religion .
But the Bush administration files an amicus brief asking a court to allow Child Evangelism Fellowship to distribute its materials through school officials , essentially trying to drill another hole in the wall separating church and state .
6-20-2003 The Globe and Mail Bush intimidates non-governmental organizations .
Non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) work closely with the government to provide aid to foreign populations .
But under the Bush administration , NGOs have another role to play : public relations for President Bush .
One NGO director said that under Bush , " It looks like the NGOs are n't independent and can't speak for themselves about what they see and think . "
6-19-2003 New York Times Bush suppresses EPA report on global warming .
President Bush has repeatedly said he 'll base environmental decisions on " sound science . "
Apparently by " sound " he means " funded by polluting industries . "
When the Environmental Protection Agency delivers a draft report to the White House that cites several studies linking industrial and automotive pollution to global warming , the administration makes some minor tweaks here and there , just enough to change the entire thrust of the section on climate change .
An internal EPA memo says that after the White House edits , the report " no longer accurately represents scientific consensus on climate change . "
But it does accurately represent the American Petroleum Institute 's consensus on climate change , and if you can't trust the petroleum industry to do accurate , impartial studies , who can you trust ?
6-17-2003 Washington Post Bush guts Americorps .
President Bush has used both of his State of the Union addresses to highlight volunteerism .
In 2002 , he created a sort of parent agency -- USA Freedom Corps -- for the federal volunteer agencies .
In 2003 he called for even more funding for volunteers .
But when the cameras are turned off , his actions do n't match his rhetoric .
Bush allows Congress to slash funding to AmeriCorps , the successful community service program .
AmeriCorps ' largest group of volunteers faces a reduction from 16,000 to just 3,000 .
6-7-2003 New York Times Bush overstates the case on weapons of mass destruction .
When the military found two trailers in Iraq that might have been used for biological weapons production sometime in the past , President Bush was quick to jump on the find as evidence of WMDs , declaring , " We found the weapons of mass destruction . "
Unsurprisingly , that assessment came a little too quickly .
First of all , there were no weapons .
Second , many analysts dispute that the trailers were used in the production of biological weapons .
But the question remains : even if Bush was right , did we really go to war to defeat two trailers ?
6-7-2003 Washington Post Bush refuses to issue proclamation for Gay Pride Month - - again .
For the third year in a row ( see 6-12-2002 and 6-1-2001 below ) , President Bush throws a bone to his right - wing nut - job base by refusing to issue a proclamation for Gay Pride Month .
Attorney General John Ashcroft jumps on board and bans a gay pride celebration at the Department of Justice , citing the lack of proclamation as a reason .
( Justice held the celebration the previous two years . )
Bush claims he does n't want to " politicize " anyone 's sexual orientation .
Funny , no one in the gay community seems to mind the idea of a month for celebration .
Could it be that Bush is just a bigot ?
6-3-2003 Washington Post Bush eases media ownership rules .
Greater media consolidation means fewer voices and fewer sources of news .
It means people hear fewer perspectives , and that the interests of a few media moguls can influence virtually all the news we consume .
It also means big profits for media conglomerates , which explains why the Bush administration relaxes rules to allow media companies to gobble up more newspapers , radio stations , and TV stations .

Post Bush blocks human rights cases from reaching U.S. courts .
A quirk in a 200 - year - old law allows the United States to provide a legal refuge for the victims of human rights violations , rather an appropriate role for the world 's only superpower .
But sometimes , those human rights abuses can involve oil companies .
( See 8-5-2002 below . )
When Unocal is the subject of a suit in Burma , the Justice Department asks for the suit to be dismissed , saying it will interfere with foreign policy .
Is n't that the State Department 's job ?
Funny , State asked Justice to stay out of this case !
But when it 's Unocal 's bottom line vs. the rights of Burmese laborers , well , we know who wins in the Bush administration , right ?
5-29-2003 Financial Times Bush buries a report warning of disastrously enormous deficits .
One thing we learned from the war in Iraq and the search for weapons of mass destruction is that if there 's evidence that does n't support the Bush administration 's agenda , it wo n't see the light of day .
But this does n't just apply to foreign policy .
When then - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill commissioned a report to gauge the long - term U.S. budget picture under Bush policies , he should have known President Bush would n't like the answer .
So the post - O'Neill Treasury department kept the news -- which warned of a disastrous $ 44 trillion federal debt -- out of the annual budget report .
After all , catastrophic deficits are n't a very good argument for new tax cuts for the super rich .
5-28-2003 CNN
Bush signs another huge tax cut .
Here we go again .
With the economy stagnant , states cutting vital services and raising taxes , and the federal debt growing by record - breaking leaps , President Bush signs another huge tax cut .
( See 6-7-2001 below . )
Two notes .
First of all , although the nominal cost of the tax cut is $ 350 billion over ten years , in fact it will cost $ 800 billion to $ 1 trillion if the administration and Republicans in Congress have their way .
Second , the increase in the child tax credit does n't help the working poor -- those who need it most -- thanks to last - minute Republican maneuvering .
5-28-2003 Mother Jones Bush ensures that hydrogen cars will still pollute .
Hydrogen cars are the wave of the future .
The engines wo n't pollute at all ; the only emission will be water .
Great , right ?
Wrong .
If President Bush and his allies in the fossil fuel industries have their way , the hydrogen fuel will all come from the same fossil fuels we rely on now , and extracting the hydrogen will produce just as much pollution .
So while the smog wo n't come out of your tailpipe , thanks to Bush , you know it will still be there .

Bush plans executions at Guantanamo Bay .
The suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay do n't get access to the guarantees of our judicial system : jury trials , appeals , and the like .
But they will see the worst of our system : executions .
In the past few years we 've seen dozens of cases of innocents on death row .
Imagine how much more likely it is that innocents will be executed when the rights we enjoy are stripped away .
5-25-2003 Scotland on Sunday Bush makes Columbia shuttle investigation more secretive .
The explosion of the shuttle Columbia and the subsequent investigation are not matters of national security .
Clearly this is an example where openness can only improve the investigation , and the only thing secrecy can accomplish is protecting people 's hides .
So why does NASA put the members of the investigation board on the federal payroll , thus allowing them to conduct the investigation in secret ?

Post Bush tries to revive military database of every American with public relations push .
Back in November , the public learned about the Pentagon 's Total Information Awareness system ( see 11-12-2002 below ) a Big Brother database of financial , medical , and other personal information about all Americans .
Predictable public outrage put the kibosh on the system -- temporarily .
The solution ?
In a classic move for this administration , the Pentagon just changed the name -- not even the acronym .
TIA now stands for " Terrorist Information Awareness . "
See , by keeping a big database on all of us , they 'll be able to pick out the baddies .
That 's OK , right ?
If you have n't done anything wrong you have nothing to fear ...

Bush charges dozens of people as terrorists for no reason .
Protestors who opposed the Navy 's bomb tests on Vieques .
Illegal aliens who used fake Social Security numbers to get jobs .
A check forger .
Someone who cheated on a test .
What do all these people have in common ?
They were all charged as terrorists despite having no connections to terrorism whatsoever .
Welcome to a brave new world , where the Justice Department shows no compunction about abusing its broad new powers .
5-12-2003 Newsweek Bush fails to protect Iraqi nuclear site from looting .
We may not have found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , but that does n't mean there is n't anything dangerous lying around .
For example , there 's the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center -- just 12 miles south of Baghdad -- which has two tons of uranium .
Or it did , before the looters got there .
5-8-2003 Washington Post Bush lies about aircraft carrier landing .
Karl Rove is smart .
Really smart .
The image of Bush flying a jet and landing it on an aircraft carrier , emerging in a flight suit surrounded by the military might be the best political image ever created .
Of course , the White House had to lie about the reason for doing it , saying that the carrier was too far away for a helicopter landing .
But it 's a hell of a campaign commercial .

Today Bush interferes with Canada 's decriminalization of marijuana .
Whether you think that first - time marijuana offenders should face a light fine or a harsh jail sentence , it 's hard to argue with one fact : nations should be allowed to make these decisions for themselves .
The Bush administration has already interfered with states ' medical marijuana laws -- usually voted into law by referendum -- so why not interfere with the legislative process of another country ?
Drug czar John Walters goes on a cross-Canada trip to tell Canadians how they should treat their criminals , because Canadians carrying small amounts of pot clearly pose a serious threat to the United States .
5-3-2003 Newsday Bush seeks new domestic investigation powers for the CIA and military .
For obvious reasons ( namely , freedom ) , the CIA and military have been traditionally shut out of domestic law enforcement and intelligence gathering .
But if the Bush administration has its way , that wall will be shattered .
President Bush secretly pursues giving the CIA and military the power to issue subpoenas with no judicial oversight , an unthinkable attack on our most basic civil liberties .
4-30-2003 Newsweek Bush suppresses September 11 report .
Do n't Americans deserve to know the circumstances leading up to and surrounding September 11 ?
Wo n't that knowledge help us prevent future attacks ?
Those rights and that security play second fiddle to President Bush 's political needs as the administration suppresses a report on September 11 that could indicate Bush might have done more to prevent an attack .
4-26-2003 Washington Post Bush defends Senator Santorum after anti-gay remarks .
When President Bush calls Senator Rick Santorum ( R - Pa. ) an " inclusive man , " he 's not kidding .
Santorum includes lots of stuff on his list of activities government should forbid , equating incest , adultery , and polygamy to homosexuality .
Santorum fundamentally believes that his personal religion and its disapproval for gays and lesbians should be enshrined in law .
( Funny how his Catholicism did n't affect his approval for Bush 's war despite the Pope 's opposition . )
Bush 's refusal to offer even the slightest disapproval of Santorum 's remarks is yet another sign of his fealty to the right - wing extremists who make up his political base .

Bush creates stringent proof requirements for earned - income tax credit recipients .
Here 's a quiz .
If you have a large group responsible for about $ 9 billion in fraud and a small group responsible for $ 54 billion in fraud , which group do you pursue ?
If you answered the big group responsible for one - fifth the fraud , you might be President Bush !
Bush 's IRS creates stringent new rules for the working - poor families who receive the earned - income tax credit , requiring " documents that will be difficult or impossible for people to get within the six - month deadline . "
When it comes to choosing between going after the working poor ( responsible for $ 8 - 5 - $ 9.9 billion in tax fraud in 1999 ) or going after big corporations ( responsible for $ 54 billion in tax fraud in 1998 ) , this administration bravely takes on poor families every time .

News Bush lies about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify war .
Now that military action is winding down in Iraq , you 'd expect the U.S. military to be tripping over Iraqi weapons of mass destruction at every turn , judging from the administration 's pre-war rhetoric .
But so far , we have yet to turn up a single cache of WMDs .
Now the administration admits that it may have , well , overstated the case of WMDs a tiny little bit to convince people that the war was a good idea while hiding the real agenda .
But they did n't lie , according to one administration official .
" It was just a matter of emphasis . "
Well that explains everything .
4-22-2003 New York Times Bush plans re-election strategy around September 11 anniversary .
" The convention , to be held in New York City , will be the latest since the Republican Party was founded in 1856 , and Mr. Bush 's advisers said they chose the date so the event would flow into the commemorations of the third anniversary of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks . "
There really is n't anything you can add to that .
Despicable .
4-21-2003 Time Bush sidetracks a study of ballistic fingerprinting .
Ballistic fingerprinting is clearly a good idea , if it works .
If you shoot someone , after all , you have no right to privacy in the matter , even if the shooting was legitimate self - defense .
So the only question is whether it works , but if the Bush administration has its way , we 'll never find out .
Attorney General John Ashcroft puts aside a study to test the efficacy of ballistic fingerprinting , doing the bidding of his extremist friends at the National Rifle Association .
4-19-2003 Washington Post Bush privatizes federal jobs .
When the Bush administration first proposed privatizing thousands of federal jobs , it claimed that the resulting competition would save taxpayers millions of dollars .
But according to a National Park Service memo , Bush 's " competitive sourcing " plan will result in the direct privatization of hundreds of Park Service employees -- with no competition from the public sector .
In other words , it 's not about saving money .
It 's about ending the protections federal employees have won over decades .
The move hardly comes as a surprise , given that Bush insisted that employees of the new Homeland Security Department lose protections .
4-13-2003 Associated Press Bush limits protected wilderness areas .
One top priority of Bush campaign donors in the mining and energy industries is to see as much public land as possible opened up to their potentially exploitive activities .
Step by step , President Bush 's Interior department , led by Secretary Gale Norton , has removed the protections on some of America 's most valuable expanses of land .
Now Norton 's Interior takes an enormous step backward when it stops all review of lands to be designated as protected wilderness .
Under the new rules , no new lands will gain wilderness protections without an act of Congress , and Interior can roll back current protections to reduce the size America 's wilderness even further .
3-26-2003 Associated Press Bush delays declassifying documents .
The Bush administration is quickly becoming famous for its secrecy , restricting Freedom of Information Act Requests ( see 1-6-2002 below ) , making scientific documents secret ( see 2-17-2002 below ) , refusing to turn over records of the energy policy task force ( see 7-19-2001 below ) , and delaying the release of Ronald Reagan 's presidential records ( see 6-9-2001 , 9-1-2001 , and 11-2-2001 below ) .
So it 's hardly a surprise when President Bush issues a new executive order that delays the declassification of decades - old documents and makes certain documents classified by default .
One expert at the National Security Archives pointed out that " making foreign government information presumptively classified drops us down to Uzbekistan 's openness norms . "
3-26-2003 Washington
Post Bush uses the war in Iraq to justify his tax cut .
It is no longer a matter of question whether Bush 's tax cut is good for the economy .
Every serious , nonpartisan economist says it wo n't help , and even the Congressional Budget Office ( run by a former chief economist of Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers ) says the tax cut wo n't have a significant effect .
So the administration resorts to the last resort of a scoundrel : patriotism .
Bush uses the war on Iraq as a political tool to push bad economic policy .
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer says we need the cut " to make sure that the economy can grow and that jobs can be created , so that when our men and women in the military return home , they 'll have jobs to come home to . "
We already know the tax cut wo n't grow the economy .
But there 's another lie here .
Those who serve in the military full time do n't need to worry about employment ; they already have jobs .
And under a 1994 law , employers must reinstate reservists when they return from active service .

News Bush requests secret bids for post - war aid contracts in Iraq .
One thing is certain in the uncertainty of the ongoing conflict in Iraq : some people are going to make some money .
One big profit opportunity will be providing aid to the Iraqi people .
Usually when the US Agency for International Development seeks bids for such contracts , it puts out a public request for proposals and accepts bids from any company .
But that 's not how the Bush administration does business .
Instead , USAID requests bids in secret from some of the administration 's closest friends .
The highlight of the list ?
Halliburton , Dick Cheney 's old stomping grounds .
3-21-2003 Washington Post Bush invades Iraq .
What brought us to this point ?
Perhaps diplomacy never had a real chance .
Certainly no one in the administration save Colin Powell ever seemed that interested in winning the hearts and minds of the world and its leaders .
But we could have done it .
We could have let the inspections go on for a few more months and tried to disarm Saddam Hussein without bombing the hell out of Baghdad .
And if the inspections had failed , any military action would have been backed by a broad international coalition and supported by all but the most ideological pacifists .
Instead , Bush rushes to invade Iraq with glee , even pumping his fist and saying " feels good " before announcing the invasion to the American people .
American soldiers and Iraqi civilians will die needlessly .
I hope that when we win this war , we remember that there were avoidable tragedies .
3-18-2003 Mother Jones Bush undermines international treaty on tobacco .
Undermining international treaties is what the Bush administration does best , whether they are for human rights , the environment , arms control , or a host of other issues .
Working with the tobacco industry , the administration reverses the U.S. position on a treaty that would restrict tobacco advertising , eliminate second - hand smoke from public areas , and set cigarette taxes that would discourage smoking .

Post Bush breaks his promise to call for a second United Nations resolution .
When asked by a reporter on March 6 whether he would call for a second United Nations resolution authorizing military action in Iraq , Bush insisted he would , saying it 's time for nations to " show their cards . "
Not only does Bush break this promise and withdraw the resolution , but he defies logic and blames France 's veto for other countries ' refusal to support the resolution .
If France is going to veto the resolution , and thus make the vote a forgone conclusion , does n't that give the other nations on the Security Council the freedom to take whatever position they want with no consequences ?
Bush simply takes advantage of his ability to trash France with impunity to shift the blame for his own broken promise .
This New York Times editorial does an excellent job of laying out the incompetence and failures of diplomacy that has led up to the conflict with Iraq .
3-16-2003 Washington Post Bush proposes curbs on Medicare appeals .
For someone who claims to dislike Washington bureaucrats , President Bush sure does n't seem to mind them making medical decisions .
The fact is , seniors sometimes do n't get the coverage they need and deserve under Medicare , and rely on appeals to federal judges to ensure they have the coverage they need .
More than half of the people who make those appeals win them .
But Bush has proposed replacing the independent judges with arbitrators at the Department of Health and Human Services .
Because HHS is the department that pays for Medicare , these arbitrators would have a vested interest in rejecting the appeals .
More bureaucrats , fewer health benefits for seniors .
3-11-2003 Washington
Post Bush discontinues budget report to states .
States rely on an annual report from the federal government called " Budget Information for States " to see just how much money they 're getting from the federal government .
But the Bush administration , which has refused to make aid to states a part of its latest tax - cut - for - the - wealthy plan to help the economy ( see 1 - 7-2003 below ) , has decided to discontinue the report beginning in 2004 .
Now states wo n't be able to hold Bush accountable for all the help he is n't giving them .
3-8-2003 Washington Post Bush fakes evidence on Iraq .
President Bush and the administration have consistently insisted that Iraq is currently pursuing nuclear weapons .
But every shred of evidence of that has failed to hold up .
Taking this to the extreme , Secretary of State Colin Powell continues to cite false evidence about anodized aluminum tubes that he says are for nuclear weapons production .
But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency insists that this is untrue , and that the very evidence Powell cites actually shows that the tubes are unsuitable for the purpose the administration claims .
It 's a sad day for Colin Powell , who has bought into the administration 's war - driven rhetoric at the expense of the truth .

Bush exempts oil and gas industries from clean water regulations .
New clean water regulations require small construction sites to ensure that they have plans to handle storm water , preventing pollution from entering waterways .
But the Bush administration is granting the oil and gas industries an exemption to the new rules , claiming that the issue needs " further evaluation . "
But according to six senators who have opposed the exemption , the issue has already received plenty of study .
Could it be that Bush is simply doing a favor for old friends ?

Post Bush proposes pushing seniors into private insurance plans for a Medicare prescription drug benefit .
Again letting his friends in the insurance industry write legislation ( see 3- 5-2003 below ) , President Bush proposes forcing seniors to join private health plans to receive a prescription drug benefit under Medicare .
His plan would give private health plans enormous power over Medicare , allowing them to set the prices for prescription drugs , squeezing seniors for higher profits .
3-5-2003 New York Times Bush proposes caps on malpractice lawsuits .
The rising cost of malpractice insurance is a serious problem affecting the medical industry .
But President Bush 's proposal to cap awards from malpractice suits at $ 250,000 is like using an axe for heart surgery .
Instead of working to prevent frivolous lawsuits , Bush is essentially making the victims of genuine malpractice pay for reform .
He also refuses to hold the insurance industry accountable , and in fact is letting them write the legislation .
I wonder why .
3-1-2003 Washington Post Bush opens Alaska forest to logging .
The Tongass National Forest contains 30 percent of the world 's temperate coastal forests -- for now .
The Bush administration rules that no more of the forest will be declared protected wilderness , opening up hundreds of thousands of acres for logging .
If the administration succeeds in reversing the Clinton ban on new roads in national forests ( see 5 - 4-2001 below ) , then millions of acres could be at risk .

Bush lies about homeland security funding and blames his allies in Congress .
Since September 11 , President Bush has consistently fought to block spending on homeland security , even opposing the creation of a Department of Homeland Security until he saw the political upside .
Looking at the recently passed 2003 budget , the White House praised the Republican Congress for providing " critical funding for our nation 's homeland security . "
He even urged them to block a Democratic proposal to provide an additional $ 5 billion for homeland security needs .
But at least he 's consistent about endangering the nation , right ?
Wrong .
In a breathtaking act of hypocrisy , Bush turns around and blames the Republican Congress for not providing enough funds .
This 180 - degree flip - flop comes as an enormous surprise to his GOP allies , who predictably react with fury .
2-26-2003 Detroit Free Press Bush restricts family - planning programs from AIDS - prevention funds .
When President Bush announced increases for AIDS prevention funding in Africa , even his critics were pleased to see the additional funds ( regardless of the political reasons behind the proposal ) .
But anyone with common sense knows that family - planning advice is crucial to serious AIDS prevention .
Under restrictions attached to the funding , doctors and nurses may not even be able to discuss basic contraception use with people as part of AIDS prevention .
A State Department memo indicates that the administration is using the new AIDS funds as a tool to expand the gag rules it has put on foreign aid as a gift to the right - wing extremists who have Karl Rove 's ear .
2-24-2003 Time Bush relaxes rules on ready - to - eat meat products .
In 2002 , an outbreak of Listeria bacteria killed seven people , caused three miscarriages , and sickened dozens .
In response , the Bush administration proposed tougher rules on plants that produce products at risk for Listeria , including ready - to - eat deli meats .
The meat industry ( which , big surprise , gave a bunch of money to the Bush campaign in 2000 ) cried foul and urged the White House to weaken the regulations they had proposed .
And when campaign donors talk , Bush listens .
So the strong regulations were shelved and replaced with ones the meat industry could live with .
An industry newsletter crowed that " a number of key [ USDA ] personnel have bought into much of the industry proposal " and that the changes came thanks to " industry efforts made at the White House level . "
2-24-2003 LA
Times Bush proposes canceling tests for a missile defense system .
You can argue all you want about whether a national missile defense system will work or not , or whether it 's a good idea in the first place .
But one thing is for certain : if you 're planning on building a NMD system , you should definitely test the thing to make sure it works .
But even this seemingly obvious bit of logic is beyond the Bush administration , which tries to bypass testing requirements for major weapons programs so it can have the system up and running by 2004 .
Given the administration 's reckless and incompetent handling of the North Korea crisis , it 's understandable that it is in a rush to get NMD working .
But should n't they make sure it works first ?
2-23-2003 Newsday Bush lies about economists ' support for his tax plan .
Serious , nonpartisan economists are fairly unanimous about President Bush 's latest tax cut proposal : it wo n't do anything to help the economy .
After all , most of the cuts come years later and most of the benefits go to those most likely to save rather than spend the money .
( Boy , that sounds a lot like his last tax cut plan to help the economy .
Which did n't . )
So when White House spokesman Ari Fleischer claims that the Blue Chip Economic Forecast had endorsed his plan , it comes as quite a surprise .
What is n't surprising is when the editor of the Blue Chip newsletter says that he had published no such endorsement , and that the White House was simply lying .

Bush delays report on the dangers of mercury .
When the public faces danger from environmental hazards , the Bush administration does n't rush to inform them .
When the EPA recently put together a report on a dangerous form of asbestos , the administration kept it from the public for as long as possible .
( See 12-27-2002 below . )
Similarly , a report was due last May on the dangers posed by mercury .
But the administration delayed it , forcing the report to go through an unprecedented review from other federal agencies .
The EPA 's report will be coming out soon .
Who knows what 's missing , thanks the administration 's review ?

Nuclear weapons that do less damage , making it more likely that we 'll use them , especially given Bush 's enthusiasm for preemptive strikes !
( See 9-21-2002 below . )
And now you 'll get those new nukes , thanks to the ridiculously irresponsible Bush administration .
How about this new rule : if the president can't pronounce " nuclear , " then his administration does n't get to create new nuclear weapons .

It is impossible to emphasize this point enough : just because Republican administrations are good for military contractors does n't mean they 're good for the men and women who serve in the military .
Not only did Bush stop telling veterans about the health care benefits they 're entitled to ( see 8 - 1-2002 below ) , but now he 's cutting funds that help pay for the education for the sons and daughters of the people he 's about to send off to war .
When will the military -- and everyone else for that matter -- realize just how bad President Bush treats them ?

News Bush proposes no aid for Afghanistan .
The reason the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s was that they had one thing to offer : law .
It was a harsh and oppressive law , but the lawlessness that preceded the Taliban 's rule set the stage for their ascendance .
The worst possible thing the United States can do now that it has deposed the Taliban is allow Afghanistan to sink back into lawlessness , a country united only in name that is controlled by warlords .
Such conditions would allow extremists to rise to power again , or at the very least , ensure there are always places friendly to terrorists in the country .
But with the Taliban gone , the Bush administration apparently thinks the job is done .
President Bush 's 2003 budget includes no money to aid Afghanistan , despite the fact that Hamid Karzai 's government has no power outside the capital .
If this is the kind of commitment to democracy we are planning to show in Iraq , the Iraqi people should be very worried .
2-11-2003 New York Times Bush cuts federal housing subsidies .
Sometimes little changes are the most devious .
The Bush administration proposes changing the phrase " not more than $ 50 " to " at least $ 50 " in the law setting the amount that those receiving federal housing subsidies pay in rent per month .
Now the sky is the limit on the rent paid by America 's poorest families , those for whom every dollar counts most .
2-8-2003 New York Times Bush proposes national sales tax .
Sales taxes are by far the most regressive taxes .
Unlike income taxes , where higher incomes are taxed at higher rates , sales taxes hit families harder the less they make , since they spend a bigger portion of their incomes on necessities .
Thus it should come as no surprise that Bush is looking at the possibility of eliminating income taxes in favor of a national sales tax , given his earlier attempts to find ways to justify increasing the tax burden on the poor .
( See 12-16-2002 below . )
What 's more , sales taxes are bad for the economy since they reduce consumption -- just what our country needs !

( See 10-26-2001 below . )
In what can only be described as an attempt to gauge just how much political capital the administration has left from the September 11 attacks , the Justice Department is proposing a new law to strengthen law enforcement powers even further .
It would allow more wiretaps and more clandestine searches with even less judicial oversight .
Once again , Bush is trying to stop the " freedom - hating terrorists " by eliminating our freedoms .
A brilliant strategy .

Bush proposes retirement savings plan to benefit the wealthy .
Most retirement savings plans that offer tax benefits include provisions that ensure they do n't bankrupt the Treasury .
Income caps and deposit limits are the most common .
So when President Bush proposes doing away with those restrictions , it is only people with higher incomes who will benefit .
Best of all for Bush , the real costs of the plan are hidden because they do n't appear until 15 or 20 years down the road .
2-4-2003 Washington Post Bush cuts aid to the poor in his budget .
When President Bush declares a war on poverty , he means it .
He 'll do whatever it takes to make sure America 's poor do n't get the help they 'll need .
( What , you thought a war on poverty was supposed to help the poor ? )
His latest budget is an excellent example .
While he creates enormous , record - breaking deficits with big tax cuts for the rich , he cuts programs to the poor , like rural redevelopment , vocational education , Medicaid , the earned income tax credit , and even school lunch programs !
More money in the hands of the wealthy and fewer services for America 's neediest .
Bush 's 2004 budget is an abomination .
2-2-2003 Washington Post Bush weakens " dolphin - safe tuna " regulations .
The idea of " dolphin - safe " tuna was something of a revolution , one of the few times that activism on behalf of animals made an enormous mainstream impact .
Regulations that require tuna fishermen to protect dolphins save tens of thousands of the marine mammals every year .
But now President Bush wants to allow tuna caught by Mexican fisherman to carry the " dolphin safe " label , even though they do n't follow the same recommendations .
Not only will this result in the death of more dolphins , but it will squeeze out the responsible companies that actually make sure the tuna they sell is safe for dolphins .

Such is the case when the administration calls for a revision to labor laws that could make millions of workers no longer eligible for time - and - a - half overtime pay .
The Labor Department is also looking into changing the Family and Medical Leave Act , adding new restrictions on the law that allows people to take care of new children and ailing relatives .

Bush ignores his administration 's own report on snowmobiles in Yellowstone .
Everyone knew President Bush was going to reverse the Clinton - era ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park .
( See 11-12-2002 and 6-24-2001 below . )
But what he has not told the public is that his administration did so despite its own report saying that banning the snowmobiles was the only way to protect the park , its wildlife , and the rangers who work there .
Bush has made a habit of saying that he makes decisions based on " sound science . "
When the science does n't fit his politics -- and that happens a lot -- he tosses it aside .

Times Bush proposes privatizing National Park Service jobs .
Free - market enthusiasts believe that competition is the solution to every problem , and that regulations can only hinder all that is right and good .
But when put into practice , these idealistic laissez faire attitudes often lead to unfortunate circumstances , like environmental destruction .
That 's why the Bush administration 's suggestion to privatize jobs in the department that protects national parks seems ill - advised .
In what could turn out to be the quote of the year , a former Park Service employee who managed Joshua Tree and the Mojave Reserve says of the Bush proposal , " Ask Enron about the efficiency of the unregulated private marketplace . "
1-21-2003 New York Times Bush proposes a tax break for the biggest SUVs .
If the administration is n't going to raise fuel - economy standards for SUVs , the least it could do is not make it more profitable to own one .
But that 's just what the administration is proposing when it suggests increasing the tax deductions for small businesses when they purchase vehicles over 6,000 pounds .
Originally designed to help farm and blue - collar businesses that needed heavy trucks or tractors , this law now helps doctors , accountants , and other professionals who feel like buying a behemoth SUV even though they do n't need it for their work .
Bush 's proposal would only further encourage people to buy a gas - guzzling vehicle , increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and the profit of Bush 's friends in the energy industry .

Once again , given a choice between priceless natural treasures and big corporate profits , the administration picks the profits .

Post Bush joins court fight against affirmative action .
It 's easy to mischaracterize and attack affirmative action .
President Bush did it plenty when he was campaigning .
Just equate it with " quotas " ( which the Supreme Court declared illegal years ago ) , and strongly imply that it favors less qualified applicants .
But affirmative action is n't about giving jobs or educations to less qualified people .
It 's about making sure those who are qualified do n't miss opportunities because of their minority status .
Racism is not dead in America , as much as we wish it were so .
Bush 's decision to intervene in a Supreme Court case against the University of Michigan 's affirmative action policies proves his ignorance of the problems minorities still face in this country .

Bush declares " National Sanctity of Human Life Day . "
Never one to shy away from using public declarations as political tools ( see 6-12-2002 and 6-1-2001 below ) , President Bush appeases the far right extremists of the Republican party by declaring a day for the sanctity of human life .
In a clear ( if mild ) attack on women 's reproductive rights , Bush calls on Americans to " reaffirm the value of human life and renew our dedication to ensuring that every American has access to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
In other words , " please do n't be angry that I have n't declared abortion illegal yet .
Just wait until there 's an opening on the Supreme Court . "

Post Bush proposes yet more tax cuts for the rich .
Paul Krugman put it best ( as usual ) when he said , " Faced with a real problem ... the Bush administration 's response has nothing to do with solving that problem .
Instead it exploits the issue to advance its political agenda . "
That 's just what President Bush does when he proposes a new round of tax cuts that will help the richest Americans .
They include a speeding up of the last cut , which means the richest Americans will get the cuts promised in 2001 even sooner .
They also include a $ 300 billion ending of taxes on dividends .
If you have an enormous income and huge stock holdings , this is pretty good news .
If you 're , say , the American economy , it wo n't do much to help you .
1-3-2003 San Francisco Chronicle Bush kills Labor Department report on mass layoffs .
The Bush administration loves reversing Clinton administration policies , especially if they involve informing the public .
So when Bush 's Labor Department ends a program that reports the numbers of mass layoffs ( more than 50 workers fired ) -- a program killed by his father and revived by President Clinton -- it 's hardly a shock .
It 's also the first shot fired by the Bush camp for the election in 2004 .
Layoffs certainly do n't make a president look good , especially if unemployment is on the rise .
According to the axed program , there were more than 2 million layoffs between January and November of last year .
By ending this report , Bush hides one more bit of bad news for his administration from the public .
1-3-2003 Associated Press Bush grants taxpayer funds to religious organizations to promote marriage .
Everyone knows that staying married is always the best option , no matter what the circumstances .
Well , anyone who follows President Bush 's religion knows that , anyway .
After ignoring Congress and implementing his faith - based initiative by fiat ( see 12-13-2002 below ) , Bush takes the first step of implementing it by granting money to religious groups who will help the poor by teaching them that marriage is really , really great .
A spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State said it best : " Whether a person gets married or stays married is none of the government 's business . "
12-27-2002 St. Louis Post - Dispatch Bush blocks the EPA from issuing a warning about asbestos .
The EPA planned for months to warn Americans that millions of homes could contain an especially lethal form of asbestos .
This would have been an unprecedented move for a public agency , declaring a health emergency that would have ensured those who had been affected by the lethal asbestos got the care they need .
But at the last minute , the White House overruled the EPA and kept the agency from making the announcement .
The White House decision puts millions of Americans at risk for cancer , all to save a few bucks .
Well , we have to pay for those big tax cuts somehow .

Bush attacks reproductive rights at an international conference .
The Bush administration has made an international attack on women 's reproductive rights one of its top priorities from its first day .
( See 1-21-2001 below . )
It has eliminated millions of dollars in funding for programs that provide essential health care services to the world 's poorest women .
But just in case anyone was n't sure about the administration 's position , Assistant Secretary of State Arthur E. Dewey made it clear at a United Nations population conference when he said , " The United States supports the sanctity of life from conception to natural death .
There has been a concerted effort to create a gulf by pushing the United States to violate its principles and accept language that promotes abortion . "
This means that the U.S. wo n't support any programs that condone abortion by , say , providing medical services to women .
Or any programs that condone underage sex by , say , providing information about contraception .
So while third - world populations explode and poor women suffer and die , the Bush administration sits back in self - righteous smugness .

Just before the Commission met , the Bush administration filled the panel with appointments recommended by the lead industry , taking the unprecedented step of rejecting nominees suggested by the CDC .
When it comes to choosing between respected scientists and corporate benefactors , the Bush administration chooses big business every time .

Post Bush supports new methods for calculating tax burdens on the wealthy to garner public sympathy for them .
Pity the folks earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year .
Sure , they never worry about how to pay for things like housing , health care , education , food , transportation , or any of the other day - to - day necessities average Americans sometimes struggle over .
But they pay more taxes than the poor , unless you count payroll taxes and sales taxes !
Why , the situation is so bad the Wall Street Journal editorial page even called America 's poor " lucky duckies ! "
Bush clearly feels sorry for his compatriots among America 's wealthiest , so he instructs the Treasury Department to come up with a new way of calculating the tax burden to make it look as though they pay too much .
That way he can justify increasing the burden on the poor , which will make them want tax cuts , which will make them vote for Republicans .
Now that 's compassionate conservatism !

It sets a dangerous precedent that leads down the road to state - sponsored religion .
For the charities themselves , it can create a dependence on those public funds that can have a chilling effect on their ability to practice in freedom .
When Bush circumvents Congress and implements his faith - based plan by executive fiat , he avoids the most controversial portions of his original plan -- more tax cuts and enabling anti-gay discrimination , for example .
But it 's a step in the wrong direction , and he ignores the proper legislative process to do it .

Bush kills rule allowing new parents to collect unemployment .
Conservative Republicans are the ones voters can depend on when it comes to helping mothers stay home from work and take care of children , right ?
Not if it gets in the way of making money .
The Clinton administration created a rule that would allow new parents to collect unemployment benefits after their children were born , giving the parents a chance to stay home from work without worrying about losing an income .
But President Bush kills the rule before any states put it into effect because business groups opposed it , proving once and for all that conservative Republicans will never let their social agenda get in the way of helping business at the expense of families .

The policy had been discontinued under the Clinton administration for the obvious reason that the bonuses could be given just as much for political loyalty and corruption as for genuine merit .

The very people who are on the front lines of protecting us from terrorism are expected to pay for the war on terrorism now ?
Bush cuts a pay raise passed by Congress from 4.1 percent to 3.1 percent , enough to save the government a billion dollars .

Kissinger has interfered with the peacemaking process -- and lied about it .
He 's bombed innocents -- and lied about it .
He 's overthrown governments -- and lied about it .
He 's wanted by courts all over the world for war crimes , and for good reason .
He may very well be the least trustworthy person ever to hold office in the federal government , even beating out his old boss , Richard Nixon .
If you want someone to subvert the work of a fact - finding commission , you absolutely , positively , could not pick a better man .

In the last year , the Bush administration has removed information on using condoms to prevent AIDS , abortion not causing breast cancer , and running effective programs to reduce teenage sexual activity from websites belonging to the Department of Health and Human Services .
These efforts -- supposedly done to " update " the information -- are clear efforts to push an ineffective , religion - based moral philosophy in place of sound science proven to reduce sexual activity and protect health .
As long as Bush is in office , the ridiculously short sight of conservative social policy might be the number one danger to American teenagers .

The connection between childhood vaccinations and autism is not yet clear .
But the possibility is strong enough that there are several lawsuits in the works , where parents are suing the manufacturers of vaccines .
After making sure the drug companies had protection from these suits built into the homeland security bill ( see 11-19-2002 below ) , President Bush undermines those lawsuits again by fighting to make sure that important information connecting vaccinations to autism never sees the light of day .
Again and again , we see that Bush considers an uninformed public to be his greatest asset .

11-25-2002 Daily Mirror Bush undermines U.N. weapons inspectors as they begin their work in Iraq .
It was a significant victory for the few cautious members of the Bush administration , led by Secretary of State Colin Powell , when President Bush reversed course and decided to seek a U.N. resolution calling for weapons inspections in Iraq instead of pursuing an immediate and meaningless war .
But administration superhawk Richard Perle made it clear yesterday that this strategy was nothing more than misdirection , telling stunned members of the British Parliament that the United States would attack Iraq no matter what the outcome of the inspections .
That 's right .
To Bush and his cronies , the weapons inspections are nothing more than a charade to drum up international support for an inevitable war .

Bush leaves unemployed workers with no benefits .
For decades , it has been a simple matter : in times of recession , Congress passed extensions to unemployment benefits without question .
It was a given .
With a difficult job market , Congress saw it as a duty to make sure those hit by layoffs could still feed their families .
No more .
Democrats have been pushing for such an extension and passed one in the Senate , but the Republicans have refused to pass one in the House of Representatives .
With just one word to GOP leaders , Bush could have made an unemployment benefits extension into law .
But with his silence , Bush ensures that more than 800,000 Americans will lose their benefits on December 28 , with 95,000 losing benefits each week after that .

Three Senators who are wavering , Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , eventually vote the way their president asks them to , ensuring that those provisions stay in the bill .

Because the phrase " reproductive services " reminds Bush of " abortion , " poor women worldwide wo n't have access to the kinds of services that actually prevent abortions , like adequate health care and birth control .

While there is certainly a legitimate debate over the public 's right to own firearms , one thing should n't be a matter of debate : owning and using a gun should n't entitle anyone to more privacy than owning or using a car .
If you use a gun against another human being , no matter how legitimate a use , you have absolutely no right to privacy about the matter .
That 's why opposition to gun " fingerprinting , " which would make it easy for law enforcement to identify what gun shoots what bullets , is limited to the worst gun extremists .
But those extremists have the president 's ear , and he quickly falls in line behind them .

Wait , no .
It was a report from the IAEA in 1991 .
No , that 's not right , either .
The White House has resorted to simply making up facts in order to justify an imminent attack on Iraq .
The Bush administration claimed a 1998 IAEA report said that Iraq was just six months away from developing nuclear weapons .
When the IAEA said the report did n't exist , the White House said ( is this the first time ever ? ) that it had made a mistake : it was a 1991 report .
But the IAEA said that did n't exist , either .
In fact , in 1998 the IAEA said , " There are no indications that there remains in Iraq any physical capability for the production of weapon - usable nuclear material of any practical significance . "
The White House is now telling lies so it can wage a war so it can win an election .

One of President Bush 's favorite catchphrases is " sound science . "
He claims to use sound science when considering everything from stem - cell research to environmental policy .
In reality , science is one of his biggest hurdles .
The problem with science is that the truth tends to get in the way of conservative ideology .
Stem cells might actually prove extremely useful .
The planet really is getting warmer .
But those are just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg .
So Bush is cleaning house at the Department of Health and Human Services , eliminating or restaffing several advisory boards that have come to conclusions at odds with his ideology .
One committee found that certain chemicals may be harmful to your health , so Bush is replacing the staff with scientists friendlier to the chemical industry -- including one who defended Pacific Gas & Electric against Erin Brockovich .

Post Bush pushes phonics on schools .
One of the strangest controversies to arise in the past decade centers on the best way to teach children to read : phonics vs. whole language .
Conservatives have mystifyingly latched on to phonics as the only appropriate way to teach reading ; it even had a plank in the 2000 Republican platform .
Unsurprisingly , the answer lies somewhere in the middle : some children learn better with phonics , others with whole language , and a combination of the two techniques usually proves most effective .
But the Bush administration is siding with small - minded conservatives and abandoning his states - rights principles ( for the umpteenth time ) in pushing phonics - only education programs on schools .
While the concentration on phonics will be a big help to publishing executives who were on the Bush transition team , it 's impossible to tell how it will help children , since the same companies that write the programs also write the standardized tests
Bush seems to think will magically fix our nation 's schools .

8-14-2002 New York Times Bush withholds $ 5.1 billion in antiterrorism and other important funds .
After making a $ 1.35 trillion tax cut heavily tilted to the very wealthy the centerpiece of his economic policy , Bush tries to prove his dedication to fiscal discipline by withholding $ 5.1 billion in spending mandated by Congress .
While in comparison to the tax cut , the spending seems close to nothing ( less than 0.4 percent of the size ) , the money Bush is withholding is vitally important to those waiting for it .
This list includes firefighters ( safety equipment ) , workers at New York 's Ground Zero ( tests of the effects of working there on their health ) , veterans ( health care ) , Israel and Palestinians ( foreign aid ) , overseas AIDS workers , the FBI , the Coast Guard , the National Guard , and on and on and on .
While Bush 's action will have an enormous impact on all of those groups , it will have no impact on the problems he claims to be attacking : the deficit and the economy .

Hey , it could have been worse .
The Bush administration was considering letting pharmaceutical companies use your personal medical information to market their drugs to you .
Thanks to political pressure , Bush caved on that issue .
But the rules issued by the Department of Health and Human Services are still weak enough to please the insurance industry .
They do n't require a patient 's written permission before doctors , hospitals , pharmacies , and -- of course -- insurance companies get to look at your records .
Plus they allow drug companies to pay your pharmacist to recommend a different , more expensive drug no matter how similar it is to what you 're taking .
So next time your pharmacist recommends a particular drug , you 'll have to take the recommendation with a grain of salt , thanks to President Bush .

Bush tries to roll back environmental protections in our oceans .
The United States ' official borders extend three miles from the shore on all our coasts .
But for another 197 miles , there is an " exclusive economic zone , " territory still controlled by the United States .
The navy wants to conduct tests on a new kind of sonar in that zone , but environmentalists fear the sonar could present a risk to marine life .
At issue is whether the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 , which would require the Navy to investigate the impact of the experiments before conducting them , applies to the economic zone .
Bush 's Justice Department sides with the Navy over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in saying that the zone is not subject to NEPA , a decision that could open our shores to all kinds of environmental hazards .

Whether you think he 's entitled to the same rights as the rest of us or none at all , one thing is clear : the courts are a better judge of this question than the Bush administration .
But when a judge requests the information necessary to make that determination , the administration refuses to provide it , insisting that it has the right to pick and choose which of his orders it has to follow .
Bush 's expansion of executive powers is getting ridiculous as he refuses to share information with both the courts and Congress - - not to mention the public .
8-5-2002 Financial Times Bush interferes in a human - rights suit against Exxon Mobil .
A law suit by a human - rights group against Exxon Mobil , the enormous oil company , alleges that the company 's security forces protecting an Indonesian pipeline murdered , raped , and tortured villagers .
Did they do it ?
If the Bush administration has its way , we 'll never find out .
In the name of the war on terrorism , the State Department tries to stop the suit .
Which is more credible : the Bush administration is stopping the suit because it will hurt the war on terror , or the Bush administration stopping the suit because it will hurt Exxon Mobil ?
Bonus fact : when the State Department asked oil companies to institute voluntary measures to prevent the kinds of abuses alleged in the suit , Exxon Mobil chose not to adopt them .
8-1-2002 Boston Globe Bush stops telling veterans about the benefits they 're entitled to .
How do you cut benefits for veterans without cutting benefits for veterans ?
It 's a Zen koan worthy of the Bush administration .
The answer : stop telling them about the benefits they 're entitled to .
And that 's exactly what Bush 's Veterans '
Affairs department does , sending a memo to local VA administrators to stop marketing healthcare programs to veterans and their families .
When there 's a crisis in veteran healthcare , it does n't occur to Bush that stopping his massive tax cut for the rich and increasing the VA 's budget is the answer .
Instead , he decides to stick it to those who served their nation in the armed forces by making them guess about the healthcare programs available to them .

Bush undermines corporate responsibility bill right after he signs it .
President Bush made it clear when he made his Wall Street speech that he supported only weak reforms for corporate responsibility .
When Congress actually managed to send him a strong bill thanks to a public outcry , Bush had no choice but to swallow his pride and sign it .
But veteran Bush watchers know Bush has a way of fighting bills he does n't like even after they become law ( Presidential Records Act of 1978 , anyone ? ) , and this bill was sure to be no exception .
But who knew he'd act so fast !
Just hours after signing the bill , Bush releases a statement that interprets the whistleblower protections to be much weaker than the bill 's authors intended .
Surely this is just the first strike of many as Bush looks to undermine the Sarbanes bill for his corporate cronies .
7-29-2002 Charleston Gazette Bush praises miners ' rescue while cutting the budget for the department that saved them .
Even the most cynical among us must have breathed sighs of joy and relief when the nine miners stuck in a flooded Pennsylvania mine for three days were brought up alive .
It was a victory not only of individuals , but also of government , as the Mine Safety and Health Administration played a vital part in the rescue .
President Bush praises the rescue , of course , as anyone in his position would .
But his budget included massive cuts to the agencies devoted to mine safety , endangering the lives of miners everywhere .
Bush , unsurprisingly , did n't learn his lesson as a result of the three - day ordeal .
He does n't seem able to make a connection between the federal budget and miners stuck in a well .
It 's certainly easier to make budget cuts if you can't imagine the effects they 'll have on real people .
