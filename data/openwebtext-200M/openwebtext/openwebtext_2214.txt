WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Heavy marijuana use can boost blood levels of a particular protein , perhaps raising a person ’s risk of a heart attack or stroke , U.S. government researchers said on Tuesday .

Dr. Jean Lud Cadet of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , part of the National Institutes of Health , said the findings point to another example of long - term harm from marijuana .
But marijuana activists expressed doubt about the findings .
Cadet said a lot of previous research has focused on the effects of marijuana on the brain .
His team looked elsewhere in the body , measuring blood protein levels in 18 long - term , heavy marijuana users and 24 other people who did not use the drug .
Levels of a protein called apolipoprotein C- III were found to be 30 percent higher in the marijuana users compared to the others .
This protein is involved in the body ’s metabolism of triglycerides -- a type of fat found in the blood -- and higher levels cause increased levels of triglycerides , Cadet added .
High levels of triglycerides can contribute to hardening of the arteries or thickening of the artery walls , raising the risk of stroke , heart attack and heart disease .
The study did not look at whether the heavy marijuana users actually had heart disease .
“ Chronic marijuana use is not only causing people to get high , it ’s actually causing long - term adverse effects in patients who use too much of the drug , ” Cadet , whose study is in the journal Molecular Psychiatry , said in a telephone interview .
“ Chronic marijuana abuse is not so benign . ”
The marijuana users in the study averaged smoking 78 to 350 marijuana cigarettes per week , based on self - reported drug history , the researchers said .
The researchers said the active ingredient in marijuana , known as THC , seems to overstimulate marijuana receptors in the liver , leading to overproduction of the protein .
RAISING FUTURE RISK
Cadet said higher levels of the protein in marijuana users could raise future risk for cardiac abnormalities , blood flow problems , heart attack and stroke .
People with major medical or psychiatric illness , alcohol dependency and other drug use such as cocaine or heroin were excluded from the study .
A U.S. group supporting legal sales and regulation of marijuana disputed the findings .
Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Bruce Mirken said , for example , the study involved people who were extremely heavy users .
“ I think the low end was 78 joints a week .
That ’s 10 or 11 joints a day , ” Mirken said in a telephone interview .
“ We ’re talking about people who are stoned all the time .
We ’re talking about the marijuana equivalent of the guy in the alley clutching a bottle of cheap wine .
If you do anything to that level of excess , it might well have some untoward effects , whether it ’s marijuana or wine or broccoli , ” Mirken added .
Cadet ’s team said the findings suggest long - term harm from marijuana beyond issues such as impaired learning , poor memory retention and retrieval and perceptual abnormalities .
But Mirken said : “ Even if you take this finding at face value , it ’s not at all clear that it has any relevance to the real world because there is still no data showing higher rates of mortality among marijuana smokers .
If this was a significant cause of cardiovascular disease , where are the bodies ? ”

Long - suffering air passengers wrongly turned down for compensation after a cancelled flight have a new , if rather unlikely hero - a Dutch air claims handler whose plane - tracking system can expose the lies airlines tell travellers .
Hendrik Noorderhaven is promising to get compensation for people whose claims have been rejected by airlines for what he can prove are spurious reasons .
Since 2005 , passengers who have suffered long delays following flight cancellations have been entitled to compensation of between € 250 ( £ 200 ) and €600 , depending on the length of the flight .
Since the European Commission introduced the measures , the airline industry has found a number of ways to wriggle out of its obligations .
The most popular excuse is the cancellation has been caused by " extraordinary circumstances " or for " safety reasons " , in which case the airline is not required to compensate people .
Critics accuse the airlines of almost universally adopting the " safety " excuse , even if the true reason is that they failed to book enough airplanes .
Thousands of passengers have been denied the money they are owed and fobbed off with excuses , according to Noorderhaven .
He says the airlines have been getting away with it because , unlike in the US , no public body has logged the true reason flights are delayed or cancelled and regulators have proved toothless .
" It is virtually impossible for passengers to object to airline statements about technical circumstances .
As a result , the airlines have been able to effectively hide behind the claim of extraordinary circumstance .
But not any more , " says Noorderhaven , who runs the Brummen - based website EUclaim.co.uk .
He has built a giant database which tracks every commercial airliner as it flies round the globe .
It combines airport departure information , with the departure and expected arrival time data provided between the airlines to build a picture of where each plane is at any time .
The result , he says , enables the company to check whether the excuse passengers are given for not being offered compensation is correct .
" If you look at the data behind cancellations , most flights are withdrawn in the summer when the weather is fine .
In most cases it is simply because the airline has n't got enough planes , so they cancel the flight that will cause them the fewest headaches .
They tell passengers it 's due to extraordinary circumstances , but really they are making a business decision . "
He says that , over the past 12 months , EUclaim has received more than 40,000 enquiries in the Netherlands alone , and has claimed compensation for some 4,500 passengers - collecting an average of £ 865 per filed claim .
His company takes 27 % of the money returned on a no - win no - fee basis and , he says , it has taken on all the well - known airlines , including budget operators such as easyJet and Ryanair .
" You can see some airlines always choose certain flights to cancel .
One major carrier , when it needs to cancel a flight , always cancels its flight to Beijing .
Another airline , which has six flights to operate over a Thursday to Sunday , only ever has an average of 5.2 planes available .
It 's clear why they are cancelling flights - and it's not an extraordinary circumstance . "
" In each case , we have won without the need to go to court .
In the past , airlines have tried to claim their plane was grounded because of safety - related issues , but our database has shown it was flying between two other airports .
Presented with this information , they have to pay up , " he says .
Noorderhaven , who set up the service after spending years flying around the world as an international salesman , now regularly helps bring group actions against airlines that refuse to pay compensation .
He says EC regulation 261/2004 clearly states airlines should inform passengers about their rights in case of an incident , but are failing to do so and in some cases are lying to passengers as to why they are not entitled to compensation .
This week Guardian Money was contacted by reader Matthew Searle .
He was recently booked on an 8.15 am BA flight from Manchester to London , but at 6 am he received a text saying the flight had been cancelled .
He was able to get on a flight with bmi but BA has since insisted he is not entitled to compensation even though the airline has admitted it cancelled the flight because it failed to provide enough cabin crew .
He says he is now going to pursue BA through the small claims court to get the € 125 to which he is entitled .
In recent years , Guardian Money has featured numerous cases of air passengers who have been forced to go to the small claims court to get money back - and many have done so successfully .

Flight log backs up family
One woman endured a 30 - hour delay to the start of her holiday after a flight was cancelled - and was told she and her family could not claim compensation
Samantha Baron , her partner and two children were booked on an XL Airways flight from Manchester to the Greek island of Kefalonia for a week 's holiday in May .
The senior lecturer in social services , who lives in Manchester , contacted Guardian Money to find out whether XL was right to refuse compensation .
Photograph : Christopher Thomond
" At the point of cancellation , XL were advising us to claim against our insurance .
On returning from holiday , I emailed XL and received an email in which they absolved themselves of responsibility , " she says .
XL told Guardian
Money she was not entitled to any compensation in relation to EU regulations because the flight was delayed due to a " technical issue " .
After a delay exceeds five hours , customers can abandon their flight and get a ticket refund - but would not be entitled to a refund of accommodation costs , so most customers do not select this option .
In keeping with other airlines XL has adopted the defence that because the passengers eventually travelled , the flight was not cancelled .
However , Hendrik Noorderhaven of EUclaim sees it differently .
He sent details from the flight log which clearly shows the flight was cancelled .
He says : " XL could n't use the original aircraft because maintenance was planned .
Then they leased a plane that was unfit to land at the destination .
They can't argue it was a delay , as they rescheduled the flight on a different plane the next day . "
Samantha has used his website to claim € 1,600 ( £ 1,273 ) , minus his 27 % .
We 'll let you know how she gets on .
Right and wrongs of passenger charter
The EU's air passenger rights , in force since 2005 , were designed to stop airlines cancelling flights and abandoning passengers at airports .
They affect scheduled and charter flights starting or finishing in the EU .
Passengers bumped off flights that have been overbooked , or those whose flights are cancelled up to two weeks before departure , are entitled to € 250 - €600 ( £ 200 - £ 476 ) compensation - depending on the length of the flight - plus a refund of their ticket , if they choose not to fly .
If the flight is merely delayed , the airline must offer food and drinks after two hours , plus a hotel room if the delay is overnight .
The passenger is entitled to have the fare reimbursed after a five - hour delay , if they then choose not to fly .
The airline has the " exceptional circumstances " get - out clause , in which case compensation is not payable .
Airlines have launched legal challenges to the legislation , all of which have failed .
The main problem is that the law 's wording is highly ambiguous , and the airlines have used this to deny claims made by passengers , aided and abetted by a lack of serious enforcement .
However , the new European transport commissioner Antonio Tajani is on record as saying he wants to make sure the rights are better enforced .
The Italian , a former air traffic controller , is said to take a keen interest in this area - not least because his entourage suffered at the hands of a low - cost airline , which abandoned them and refused to pay compensation to which they were entitled .

Terror struck again in Bangalore , initial reports suggest that six blasts have ripped through different parts of the IT city , the first one in the Madiwala and the second in Adugodi area in Kormangla .
And the third on Hosur Road .
Unconfirmed reports claim that three people dead and many other people are critically injured .
All the wounded are being rushed to nearby hospitals for medical aid .
The blasts are thought to be of low - intensity using gelatin sticks and cylinders .
According to reports , the series of blasts took place between 1:45 till 2:30 pm .
The first explosion took place in the heavily crowded Madiwala locality bus stand , where is there is a vegetable market leading to a shopping mall .
The other blasts took place near the Adugodi and Mysore Road near tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi ’s house .
However barring shattering some window panes , there was no other major damage .
The Police has confirmed only one blast so far .
Primary investigations suggest that the blast was triggered by a timer hidden beneath the ground .
I 'm not even going to try and paraphrase since I was half asleep , but Jonathan Capehart just now on Morning Joe used the word " Uppity " about Obama and an anonymous quote referenced in the Washington Post .
The idiot even prefaced it by saying he was braced for the nasty emails he was going to recieve .
An anonymous quote can get one black man to call another " uppity " ?
Um , I 'm not up on the rules on this , but I 'm thinking this is way over the line .
I 'm looking for the vid .
So , if a black man has called Obama uppity , then it 's okay for everyone else to do it now , right ?
Seems someone was more awake than me .
He gets the quote , and also has a very good diary on this whole thing .
Johnathan Capehart literally just said he 's " bumping up against that uppity line " on TV .
**** UPDDATE - MJ just got an email apparently from someone who was at the meeting where the anon quote came from , and the context makes all the difference .
Bummer Milbank could n't have done his homework and gotten it right .
UPDATE AGAIN - Here 's Mr Capehart 's view -
Mr Chertoff's new measure will affect visitors from 27 countries
The US is to tighten visa restrictions to allow it to screen all short - term visitors from Japan and Western Europe .
US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said visitors to the US who do not need visas will be required to register with the government online .
The security regulation , set to begin next year , will require visitors to register three days before they visit .
The online registration will remain valid for a two - year period , Mr Chertoff said .
He said the changes - which will affect citizens of the 27 countries currently listed under the US visa waiver programme - will allow the US to screen visitors before they travel .
The Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) said it had been reassured that the new measures contained provisions for last - minute travel .
Deterring terror
The waiver programme was initiated in 1986 " with the objective of eliminating unnecessary barriers to travel , stimulating the tourism industry , " according to the State Department website .
The new programme will be rolled out from August , and will be mandatory for all visa - free travel from 12 January , 2009 .
A Homeland Security spokesman said the new registrations would require the same information as the I - 94 card , which is currently filled out by visitors to the US and turned in to customs on arrival in the country .
That information includes passport number , country of residence , and any involvement in terror activities .
The new US Electronic System for Travel Authorization ( ESTA ) aims to make it more difficult for potential terrorists to enter the US .
The visa waiver programme has been under fire by some US lawmakers , who are concerned that militants who are citizens of the participating countries can too easily obtain entry .

A new Tango release is out - 0.99.7
Dominik is mainly a cleanup release , with the introduction of new features like tango.util.container and some others .
Read the full announcement here .
Researchers hope to send an experiment to the International Space Station ( ISS ) by the middle of the next decade that would pave the way for transcontinental transmission of secret messages encoded using the mysterious quantum property of entanglement .
When two particles such as photons are born from the same event , they emerge entangled , meaning they can communicate instantaneously no matter how far apart they are .
Transmitting entangled pairs of photons reliably is the backbone of so - called quantum key distribution — procedures for converting those pairs into potentially unbreakable codes .
Quantum cryptography , as it is known , could appeal to banks , covert government agencies and the military , and was tested in a 2007 Swiss election .
Photons can travel perhaps 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) or so along today 's fiber - optic cables before their quantum character breaks down .
That limit vanishes aboveground .
Last year , a team led by physicist Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna transmitted quantum keys up to 89.5 miles ( 144 kilometers ) between a pair of telescopes in Spain 's Canary Islands .
Now Zeilinger and colleagues want to make the jump to hundreds of miles or more .
The Vienna group is spearheading an international project , called Space - QUEST ( Quantum Entanglement for Space Experiments ) , to prove that a system for generating pairs of entangled photons can fit the constraints imposed by the ISS .
Quantum keys distributed from orbit could be transmitted to any two points in the station 's line of sight , limited only by the ability of transmitters and receivers to keep a tight lock on one another and to distinguish entangled photons from background light .
Earlier this year , Zeilinger and colleagues showed they could detect single photons reflected from an Italian satellite 3,700 miles ( 5,955 kilometers ) above Earth .
The tools for the experiment would be an ultraviolet laser , a special type of crystal for splitting ultraviolet photons into pairs of infrared photons and equipment for keeping the two components aligned during the rigors of spaceflight .
To make it into space , the instruments , including telescopes to transmit the photons , must weigh less than about 220 pounds ( 100 kilograms ) , consume no more than 250 watts of power and be no larger than 4.6 feet ( 1.4 meters ) on its longest side .
The 10 - country Space - QUEST group hopes to build a prototype device and gather preliminary data in time for a November meeting of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , where officials will decide which projects will receive funding and deserve a chance to fly in space , says Rupert Ursin , a postdoctoral researcher in Zeilinger 's lab .
Ursin says the team 's proposal has scored high in preliminary assessments by European funding agencies including the ESA .
" We can do a lot of physics experiments with a relatively small budget " of a few hundred million euros , he says .
In addition to the potential practical application , the Space - QUEST project would give researchers a chance to probe the reaches of entanglement in a new way .
Theory says entangled should be unlimited in range , Ursin says , but to know for sure , " we have to test it . "
With the California hands - free law looming ever closer , it 's prime time for all the hands - free and Bluetooth companies to peddle their wares .

Tom Willis : Should evolutionist be allowed to vote ?
June 12 , 2008 18:26 MST
Remember the movie “ Expelled ” which ‘ argued ’ how ID Creationists were somehow punished for their beliefs ?
I wonder what the producers of this movie think of this somewhat disturbing piece by Tom Willis in CSA ( Creation Science Association for Mid-America ) ?
Tom Willis wrote :
Everywhere the subject of origins is discussed , evolutionists routinely , yea , systematically , denounce creationists as some combination of stupid , ignorant , and … dangerous .
If we recall there are two major methods men make momentous decisions : empirical and theoretical .
I intend to show in a brief space that belief in evolution requires , at minimum , deep delusion allowing one to believe , or pretend to believe , in a manifestly impossible historical scenario .
And it leads , both empirically and theoretically , to grotesquely harmful results in every society in which evolutionists are allowed to have a major influence , including our own .
And “ Expelled ” believes that ID Creationists face problems ?
Willis proposed the following “ solution ”
The arrogance displayed by the evolutionist class is totally unwarrented .
The facts warrent the violent expulsion of all evolutionists from civilized society .
I am quite serious that their danger to society is so great that , in a sane society , they would be , at a minimum , denied a vote in the administration of the society , as well as any job where they might influence immature humans , e.g. , scout , or youth , leader , teacher and , obviously , professor .
Oh , by the way …
What is the chance evolutionists will vote or teach in the Kingdom of God ?
The damage done by some of my fellow Christians who confuse their faith with facts of science seems to range from the foolish to the outright moronic ( and I am holding back here ) .
Depriving people , including fellow Christians of their God and Constitution given rights hardly seems to match my understanding of Christianity .
The Camerahead Project is a Seattle protest group upset about the growing prevalence of CCTV cameras there — they 're staging a bit of theater tomorrow in Cal Anderson Park , walking around with giant cameras on their heads to get people thinking about what it means to have their public spaces under constant surveillance .
Local artist Paul Strong , Jr. says he 's holding the demonstration , called the Camerahead Project , to remind people that video surveillance cameras are recording their every move at Cal Anderson Park and three other parks around town .
" The project not only raises the questions of who is watching who and who is watching the watchers , but also … why we are being watched at all , " he says .
" There is so much going on in the news about wiretapping and data mining , all these little thing that happen locally go right by . "
I met Paul at one of my signings in Seattle for Little Brother and loved his camerahead outfit — he says it was inspired by Pablo Defendini's Little Brother poster .

Current U.S. strategy against the terrorist group al Qaida has not been successful in significantly undermining the group 's capabilities , according to a new RAND Corporation study issued today .
Al Qaida has been involved in more terrorist attacks since Sept. 11 , 2001 , than it was during its prior history and the group 's attacks since then have spanned an increasingly broader range of targets in Europe , Asia , the Middle East and Africa , according to researchers .
In looking at how other terrorist groups have ended , the RAND study found that most terrorist groups end either because they join the political process , or because local police and intelligence efforts arrest or kill key members .
Police and intelligence agencies , rather than the military , should be the tip of the spear against al Qaida in most of the world , and the United States should abandon the use of the phrase " war on terrorism , " researchers concluded .
" The United States cannot conduct an effective long - term counterterrorism campaign against al Qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end , " said Seth Jones , the study 's lead author and a political scientist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" In most cases , military force is n't the best instrument . "
The comprehensive study analyzes 648 terrorist groups that existed between 1968 and 2006 , drawing from a terrorism database maintained by RAND and the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism .
The most common way that terrorist groups end -- 43 percent -- was via a transition to the political process .
However , the possibility of a political solution is more likely if the group has narrow goals , rather than a broad , sweeping agenda like al Qaida possesses .
The second most common way that terrorist groups end -- 40 percent -- was through police and intelligence services either apprehending or killing the key leaders of these groups .
Policing is especially effective in dealing with terrorists because police have a permanent presence in cities that enables them to efficiently gather information , Jones said .
Military force was effective in only 7 percent of the cases examined ; in most instances , military force is too blunt an instrument to be successful against terrorist groups , although it can be useful for quelling insurgencies in which the terrorist groups are large , well - armed and well - organized , according to researchers .
In a number of cases , the groups end because they become splintered , with members joining other groups or forming new factions .
Terrorist groups achieved victory in only 10 percent of the cases studied .
Jones says the study has crucial implications for U.S. strategy in dealing with al Qaida and other terrorist groups .
Since al Qaida 's goal is the establishment of a pan-Islamic caliphate , a political solution or negotiated settlement with governments in the Middle East is highly unlikely .
The terrorist organization also has made numerous enemies and does not enjoy the kind of mass support received by other organizations such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , largely because al Qaida has not engaged in sponsoring any welfare services , medical clinics , or hospitals .
The study recommends the United States should adopt a two - front strategy : rely on policing and intelligence work to root out the terrorist leaders in Europe , North America , Asia and the Middle East , and involve military force -- though not necessarily the U.S. military -- when insurgencies are involved .
The United States also should avoid the use of the term , " war on terror , " and replace it with the term " counterterrorism . "
Nearly every U.S. ally , including the United Kingdom and Australia , has stopped using " war on terror , " and Jones said it 's more than a mere matter of semantics .
" The term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important , because it affects what kinds of forces you use , " Jones said .
" Terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals , not holy warriors , and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism . "
Among the other findings , the study notes :
Religious terrorist groups take longer to eliminate than other groups .
Since 1968 , approximately 62 percent of all terrorist groups have ended , while only 32 percent of religious terrorist groups have done so .
No religious terrorist group has achieved victory since 1968 .
Size is an important predictor of a groups ' fate .
Large groups of more than 10,000 members have been victorious more than 25 percent of the time , while victory is rare when groups are smaller than 1,000 members .
There is no statistical correlation between the duration of a terrorist group and ideological motivation , economic conditions , regime type or the breadth of terrorist goals .
Terrorist groups that become involved in an insurgency do not end easily .
Nearly 50 percent of the time they end with a negotiated settlement with the government , 25 percent of the time they achieved victory and 19 percent of the time , military groups defeated them .
Terrorist groups from upper - income countries are much more likely to be left - wing or nationalistic , and much less likely to be motivated by religion .
" The United States has the necessary instruments to defeat al Qaida , it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that terrorist groups are not eradicated overnight , " Jones said .
The study , " How Terrorist Groups End : Lessons for Countering al Qaida , " can be found at www.rand.org.
The report was prepared by the RAND National Defense Research Institute , a federally funded research and development center that does research for the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Staff , the unified commands and other defense agencies .
Remember the good old days when a zit was the reason you may not have gone out ?
This one , ugly pimple has gotten you so stressed , that you would try to stay home and away from the public .
Are you looking for an innovative way to get rid of your zits ?
Are the creams , diets , and grandma ’s recipes not clearing up your pimples ?
You could always move on with the time and use personal technology to help you .
Zeno Pro is a new FDA approved acne solution , and ‘ NO ’ , it is not an anti-depressant .
This gadget heats up the pimpled area , claiming to speed up the clearing process .
It resembles the size of a small MP3 player , but rather than playing your favorite tunes , the Zeno actually hopes to get rid of your zits .
This new device is currently available through Sharper Image for a price of $ 184.95 , but in all honesty , could you even gather the courage to try the Zeno Pro to burn zits off of your face ?

Note to McCain : Czechoslovakia does n’t exist anymore
This is almost certainly going to sound nitpicky , if not actually petty , but bear with me .
It ’s not unreasonable to note that John McCain continues to make references to a country that does n’t exist .
At a press conference in Phoenix today , for example , McCain referenced Czechoslovakia .
Again .
“ I was concerned about a couple of steps that the Russian government took in the last several days .
One was reducing the energy supplies to Czechoslovakia .
Apparently that is in reaction to the Czech ’s agreement with us concerning missile defense , and again some of the Russian now announcement they are now retargeting new targets , something they abandoned at the end of the Cold War , is also a concern .
So we see the tensions between Russia and their neighbors , as well as Russia and the United States are somewhat increasing . ”
On first blush , this sounds like more antagonistic rhetoric towards Russia — which McCain wants to kick out of the G8 — which is n’t especially helpful .
But more importantly , Russia ca n’t “ reduce energy supplies to Czechoslovakia . ”
Czechoslovakia , of course , does n’t exist .
It split into two countries more than 15 years ago .
McCain has actually been to the Czech Republic and Slovakia since they became independent countries , and he ’s met with their leaders .
So , McCain slipped up .
He ’s 71 and this is going to happen from time to time , right ?
Well , there ’s a little more to it than that .
First , as Greg Sargent noted , McCain has made this same mistake more than once during the campaign .
About three months ago , McCain vowed to “ work closely with Czechoslovakia ” on missile defense .
Last fall , during a Republican debate , McCain said : “ The first thing I would do is make sure that we have a missile defense system in place in Czechoslovakia and Poland , and I do n’t care what his objections are to it . ”
Second , before Republicans condemn
Dems for being picky on this , let ’s not forget that in the 2000 campaign , when McCain also screwed up Czechoslovakia , it was none other than George W. Bush who said it deserved to be a campaign issue : “ A guy gets up and quizzes me [ on world leaders ] … but John McCain says something about the ‘ ambassador to Czechoslovakia . ’
Well , I know there is no Czechoslovakia [ there ’s a Czech Republic and a Slovakia ] , but yet it did n’t make the nightly national news . ”
Look , I know this was just another verbal slip .
McCain has been incompetent about foreign affairs for quite a while , and in the grand scheme of things , it ’s relatively inconsequential that he keeps referencing a country that ceased to be in 1993 .
He ’s said far worse .
But the raison d’etre of John McCain ’s entire presidential campaign is the notion that he ’s an expert on foreign policy , thanks to his decades of experience as a Washington insider .
When the foreign policy expert keeps referencing a non-existent country , it ’s not unreasonable to mention that maybe his expertise is n’t quite as impressive as his campaign and the political media establishment would like us to believe .
Put it this way — in August 2007 , Barack Obama mentioned “ the president of Canada ” in a debate .
Canada , of course , has a prime minister , not a president .
Obama had made a mistake .
What happened ?
Political reporters pounced ( see here , here , here , and here , for example ) , mocking Obama ’s error and highlighting the gaffe as evidence that he ’s “ too inexperienced to become commander in chief . ”
At the time , David Frum argued , “ Barack Obama refers to the ‘ president of Canada , ’ the kind of misstep that would cost a Republican candidate for president dearly . ”
It seems Frum had it backwards .
The media jumped all over Obama ’s inconsequential error .
McCain , meanwhile , makes mistakes like this all the time , almost always with no media scrutiny at all .
How much attention do you suppose McCain ’s Czechoslovakia mistake will get ?
July 3 , 2008
The Supreme Court justices concocted legal precedent on the fly in a decision that defended the profits of oil giant ExxonMobil .
BEFORE CLINCHING the Democratic Party presidential nomination , Barack Obama contrasted his vision for the future role of the U.S. Supreme Court to rival John McCain's , arguing that the current Court 's consistent bias in favor of " the powerful against the powerless " has allowed corporate and government interests to ride roughshod over " what ordinary people are going through . "
In that populist vein , Obama went on to describe as his models for Supreme Court appointments Justices Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter -- who he claimed are " people on the bench who have enough empathy , enough feeling " for those trampled on by Corporate America .
Once securely anointed in June , Obama immediately lost interest in ordinary people and began panting for corporate support .
Perhaps for this reason , he felt no need to criticize the Court for its June 25 ruling on behalf of ExxonMobil that reduced to a mere pittance the amount in punitive damages that the most profitable corporation in history owes to the nearly 33,000 Alaskan fishermen , cannery workers and Natives whose livelihoods were destroyed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill , the worst environmental disaster in corporate history .
The Exxon Valdez gushed at least 11 million gallons of crude oil over 1,300 miles of unspoiled Alaskan coastline
Souter himself penned the decision , which pronounced , " The punitive damages award against Exxon was excessive as a matter of maritime common law . "
Souter did not mention that maritime common law was virtually nonexistent , but was being invented on the fly by the current Supreme Court .
ExxonMobil had based its maritime appeal solely on an obscure 1818 decision known as " the Amiable Nancy , " in which the Court ruled that a privateer ship 's owners were not liable for punitive damages stemming from a robbery by a sailor in its employ .
During questioning , Ginsburg -- who dissented in the current ruling -- noted that it was " an exaggeration to call it a long line of settled decisions in maritime law " as Exxon claimed , apparently to no avail .
Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from the case because he owns ExxonMobil stocks worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000 , according to 2006 financial statements .
But the court remained stacked with Exxon sympathizers .
" So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this ? "
Chief Justice John Roberts asked in exasperation during questioning .
When the plaintiffs ' lawyer , Jeffrey Fisher , noted that Exxon should not benefit from an argument its legal team had not made , Justice Antonin Scalia retorted , " They do n't have to make every tiny little argument . "
IT HAS been nineteen long years since the Exxon Valdez , under the authority of drunken captain Joseph Hazelwood ( who reportedly downed five double vodkas before boarding the ship ) , gushed at least 11 million gallons of crude oil over 1,300 miles of unspoiled Alaskan coastline .
In a scenario worthy of the Titanic , Hazelwood abandoned his post shortly before the ship hurtled toward Bligh Reef on that fateful night in March 1989 .
Eleven hours after the accident , the captain 's blood - alcohol content measured at .241 .
But Hazelwood 's alcohol problem was already well known within the extensive Exxon hierarchy .
Lloyd Miller , a lawyer representing Native villages in the lawsuit , noted a pervasive alcoholic culture in Exxon 's shipping arm .
Indeed , witnesses testifying before the Supreme Court explained that Hazelwood was a well - known alcoholic who had dropped out of an alcoholism treatment follow - up program .
The Supreme Court decision acknowledged , " Although Exxon had a clear policy prohibiting employees from serving onboard within four hours of consuming alcohol ... Exxon presented no evidence that it monitored Hazelwood after his return to duty or considered giving him a shore - side assignment . "
Yet the Court 's majority concluded that Exxon had not acted without " intentional or malicious conduct " -- to justify rejecting Exxon 's responsibility to pay significant punitive damages to the tens of thousands of human victims whose lives were upended by the disaster .
In 1994 , a jury awarded $ 287 million to the Alaskan plaintiffs to compensate for immediate economic losses , averaging roughly $ 15,000 per claimant .
But the jury added an additional $ 5 billion in punitive damages for the company 's " reckless " behavior .
ExxonMobil paid the compensatory damages , but CEO Lee Raymond said privately at the time that he would fight tooth and nail to prevent paying a dime in punitive damages .
Since then , the corporation has spent hundreds of millions of dollars fighting this court case , delaying the outcome for 14 years , with tremendous success .
In 2006 , an appeals court halved the punitive claim to $ 2.5 billion .
And last week , the Supreme Court reduced that amount by 80 percent , to roughly $ 500 million -- an average of $ 15,000 per plaintiff .
When Raymond retired from Exxon years ago , he received a $ 400 million retirement package all to himself .
Now the Exxon Valdez 's nearly 33,000 victims are left to scramble for a tiny share of a settlement amounting to roughly the same real value -- at $ 15,000 per claimant -- or 10 percent of the original 1994 award .
Between 1994 and 2008 , Exxon 's profits have soared , further reducing the punitive impact of the current ruling .
While the 1994 jury required Exxon to pay roughly one year of its profits to the victims of the 1989 oil spill , the Court 's new ruling amounts to just four days ' profits for the oil giant , which raked in a record $ 40.6 billion in profits last year .
The immediate wildlife death toll of the Exxon Valdez oil spill included at least 250,000 birds , 2,800 sea otters , 300 seals , 250 bald eagles and billions of salmon and herring larvae .
Nearly two decades later , many species , including herring - - a source of food for many other species of wildlife -- have yet to return .
As salmon fisherman Buck Meloy commented earlier this year in the Cordova Times , " Even now , 19 years later , one still finds gooey , sticky , stinking , toxic crude oil only a few inches below the surface of some gravel beaches on the heavily oiled western side of the sound . "
FROM THE beginning , the company 's team of spin doctors spared no expense in preparing for the inevitable legal battle to follow , focusing on its contrived public image rather than effective cleanup .
As marine ecologist Thomas Okey , who arrived shortly after the spill , recounted , " I heard that political and legal pressures had influenced the science and muzzled some of the reporting of information during the months immediately following the spill .
In retrospect , I realize that , even then , the involved parties had already started building their legal cases .
The rhetorical showdowns of ' experts ' would soon ensue , a parade deemed not amusing to native Aleut communities , which had gathered their food from Prince William Sound for millennia . "
Exxon inexplicably waited three days after the spill before launching a recovery effort , by which time , the oil had spread too far for containment .
As Alaskan Native Kellie Kvasnikoff described , " Apparently , Exxon was more interested in cleaning up its image than in cleaning the oil .
On tape , we have Don Cornett , Exxon 's chief public relations officer , yelling frantically to Exxon 's cleaners : ' I want something people can see . ' "
In the end , the company chose a dramatic public relations success that worsened the ecological nightmare : hosing scorching hot water at high pressure on the shoreline .
As Kvasnikoff recalled , many scientists judged that this strategy " did as much harm as good .
The hallmark of Exxon 's post - spill cleanup -- 140 - degree water applied at high pressure -- was , according to these scientists , poison to the beach and area 's many animals . "
The company 's public relations campaign since then has relied primarily on a horde of " earth scientists " on Exxon 's payroll who are regularly rolled out to discredit environmentalists ' claims of ecological devastation in Prince William Sound .
Exxon admirer L.D. Sociack commented , " [ I ] n Exxon 's case , public approval has been very much dependent upon what the corporation 's earth sciences people have been able to say and do to convince the public that the environmental damage to the Alaskan coastline is nowhere near as damaging as other earth scientists have claimed ... in order to defend themselves against charges that they are liable for billions of dollars in environmental damage to the ecosystem of Prince William Sound . "
By 1995 , Sociak reported , " Exxon followed up on these efforts with the release of an Exxon - funded study by Christopher Wooley which concluded that Prince William Sound was better off after the spill than it had been before . "
The aftermath continues to devastate the region 's ecosystem and the tens of thousands of human lives intertwined with it .
As Kvasnikoff described , " The Valdez spill severely hurt the towns ' economies and centuries - old reliance on providing themselves food and clothing from the sea .
The result : Increases in clinical depression .
Domestic violence .
Attempted suicide .
Broken families .
Researchers have shown that the more exposed an Alaskan area to Valdez oil , the more social and psychological problems have resulted . "
While ordinary Alaskans mourn , Corporate America is celebrating .
The American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce submitted friends of the court briefings on behalf of Exxon and are relishing the Supreme Court 's gift to businesses shielding themselves from their victims ' lawsuits .
As Tom Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , responded to the ruling , " This is good news for companies concerned about reining in excessive punitive damages . "
It is very possible , however , that these corporate brethren have won this battle while losing the war of public opinion .
As ordinary Americans reel from spiraling gasoline and food prices alongside lower wages , perhaps they are less inclined to empathize with the very corporations that are bilking them at the pump .
More likely , they realize that , in a parallel scenario to Exxon Valdez , the lawyer for a drunk driver who killed someone could not reasonably argue in criminal court that the only compensation they owe is for funeral expenses for the deceased .
Punitive damages would be in order .
Corporate America is celebrating the Supreme Court decision in the Exxon Valdez case that shields the world 's most profitable company from punitive damages .
You may not like paying federal taxes , but chances are you ’re not going to renounce your U.S. citizenship to get out of the obligation .
That ’s probably wise , especially because a tax bill expected to be signed into law this week contains a provision designed to crack down on the roughly 500 rich people who expatriate themselves each year to avoid U.S. income and estate taxes .
Although the number of people who take that path may be small , the government has been enacting increasingly strong measures to stop the practice over the last dozen years .
For that you can thank billionaire and ex-Floridian Kenneth Dart , said Bill Ahern , a spokesman for the Tax Foundation , a nonpartisan research group based in Washington .

Dart is one of the heirs to a multibillion - dollar Styrofoam - cup manufacturing business based in Sarasota , Fla .
In 1994 , he renounced his citizenship and moved to Belize , a small Central American country known as a tax haven .
Belize promptly sought U.S. permission to open a consulate in Sarasota with Dart as its consul .
Foreign diplomats are exempt from U.S. taxes , so the move would have allowed Dart to avoid U.S. taxes while continuing to live here .
The plan earned a “ chutzpah ” award from the late humorist Art Buchwald , but it was rejected by the State Department , which said Belize already was well represented in Florida with a consulate in Miami .
Former President Clinton , who was in office when Dart renounced his citizenship , was so appalled by Dart ’s action that 10 years later he refused to go to a political fundraiser because it was being held at the Dart mansion , owned and occupied by Dart ’s wife .

“ I do n’t know what he is up to now , ” Clinton wrote on his blog in 2005 , “ but I do n’t want to go anywhere near this guy . ”
Dart ’s tactic also so incensed members of Congress that they passed a law in 1996 aimed at stopping others from doing the same thing .
Under that law , people who paid more than $ 124,000 a year in income tax and had more than $ 622,000 in assets when expatriating themselves were required to pay U.S. taxes on worldwide income for at least five years .
In 2004 , that was extended to as long as 10 years .

This year Congress again felt the need to tighten the vise on would - be tax exiles .
Late last month , the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 , which President Bush has promised to sign this week .
Under the bill , which also would give tax breaks to members of the military , wealthy Americans who renounce their citizenship would be taxed as if they had sold all of their property at fair market value the day before .
Moreover , if an expatriate tried to leave money to a U.S. citizen , the gift would be taxed at the highest federal gift tax rate , which is 45 % , said Mark Luscombe , principal tax analyst for CCH Inc. , a publisher of tax information based in Riverwoods , Ill .
The law could affect not only U.S. citizens but also foreigners who work in this country for a period of time before going back to their home countries , said Evelyn Capassakis , principal with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers .

Those who worked here for eight of the previous 15 years would get hit with the tax when they give up their green card -- or when they leave money to their children who were born in the United States , Capassakis said .
“ This law has a long tail on it , ” she said .
The government estimates that the provision aimed at expatriates would generate $ 411 million in extra tax revenue over the next 10 years .
That money would offset the cost of the legislation ’s tax breaks for the military .
The other provisions of the bill would :
Advertisement
* Provide about $ 14 million in economic stimulus payments to U.S. service members who are married to people without Social Security numbers , or who have dependent children who lack valid U.S. identification numbers .
This generally affects service members married to foreign residents .
* Allow military “ death gratuities ” to be paid into Roth IRAs so that heirs of service members who die in combat avoid taxes on investment earnings on the gratuities .
* Give tax breaks to companies that provide “ differential ” pay to military reservists on their payroll who are called up to active duty .
The extra compensation is intended to make up for the difference between the reservists ’ active - duty pay and their civilian pay .
* Let service members count nontaxable combat pay as earned income for purposes of computing the earned income tax credit , a valuable benefit for low - income families .
Advertisement
* Allow the government to finance mortgages for veterans .

Climate change is expected to worsen the food shortage
New chief science adviser , Professor John Beddington , said the crisis could be as serious as climate change and may hit sooner .
The world 's 6.5 billion population is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 .
This , combined with growing consumption as poverty is alleviated , will put huge pressure on food supplies , he said .
No simple solution
Professor Beddington said there would be a huge knock - on effect as economic growth lifts people out of poverty in countries like China and India .
He told BBC News : " Something is actually happening out there for very good reasons , namely that poverty is being alleviated .
" To some extent we are actually trying - and properly so - trying to eliminate poverty .
Now as poverty is eliminated big changes in consumer demand occur . "
Climate change is expected to worsen the problem , reducing rainfall and affecting crop growth .
There is a real , fundamental problem emerging in food policy that , frankly , has been under - recognised
Professor Tim Lang , City University
Added to this , efforts to tackle climate change - by using biofuels instead of fossil fuels - are taking more land away from food production .
Professor Tim Lang of City University has welcomed the chief scientist 's effort to draw attention to a relatively neglected issue .
He told BBC News : " I welcome it , that a chief scientist would do this is a sign that he 's expressing what a lot of us out there feel is a very big shift in the food economy .
" There is a real , fundamental problem emerging in food policy that , frankly , has been under - recognised . "
Professor Beddington said there would be no simple solution and is calling for more agricultural research as a matter of urgency to help tackle the problem .
What will it take to get our troops out of Iraq ?
The roughly 70 percent of Americans who are firmly against the war often ask this question .
Those in power are reluctant to give conditions , but when they do and those conditions are met , the goal post is quietly moved .
Voters were promised , passionately and vehemently , that the new Congress would bring our troops home .
Many were explicitly elected in 2006 under that banner .
But our troops are still overseas , funding has been increased even beyond the administration ’s wish list , and troop withdrawal has been negotiated away .
When things are going badly in Iraq , they say we must stay until the situation improves .
When things improve , they tell us we must stay because our gains cannot be jeopardized .
We are told that we must establish a functioning democracy there , and train Iraqi armed forces so they can keep order in our absence .
Iraq now has a Constitution , an elected parliament , and hundreds of thousands of security forces .
The problem now is that their troops are supposedly not trained quite well enough , and that could take many more years .
Defining an adequate training level for Iraqi troops is highly nebulous and its anyone ’s guess when or how that criteria could be satisfied .
The latest outrage came last week .
For years we heard the administration claim over and over that the Iraqi government wants us there , and is begging us to stay .
On the other hand , all they had to do was ask and we would respect their wishes and leave .
That also has now happened .
Al - Maliki perhaps took his cue from his challenger , al - Sadr , who has been clamoring for us to leave for years .
Popular opinion in Iraq now mirrors that in the United States , with about 70 percent of Iraqis wishing us to leave .
At the end of the year , our Status of Forces Agreement expires .
Without a new agreement and understanding with the Iraqi government regarding our presence there , we officially become occupiers .
Eventually our troops will leave Iraq .
The overwhelming will of the people , in both countries , ca n’t seem to get them out .
Things going well ca n’t get them out .
Things going badly can’t get them out .
Iraqis telling us to leave ca n’t get them out .
Perhaps not even the UN can get them out .
My hope is that it does not take the complete collapse of our financial system , but if we do n’t leave under any other circumstances , economic chaos is inevitable , and will make it impossible to fund the war , even through debt and inflation .
We have been financing this war through inflation , and attempting to paper over reality with misleading economic indicators .
The government has changed the methodology of calculating things like CPI and GDP to hide the bad news .
They wo n’t even publish M3 , the total money supply statistic anymore .
But reality is hitting the American people at gas pumps and grocery stores , sending more Americans into foreclosure and unemployment lines .
More are hurting while Washington keeps forgetting its promises .
Eventually , this will all come to a head .
Perhaps an even greater fear is that even if our financial trouble does n’t get our troops out of Iraq , moving them over to fight a new war in Iran , will .
Washington should be crystal clear on this very important point  just getting the troops out of Iraq means nothing .
Bringing them HOME means everything , and that is what the people in both countries demand .

By June , Bush raised $ 370 k a day for GOP and candidates
President Bush 's record - high unpopularity ratings have not stopped him from drumming up tremendous sums for his party 's 2008 election bids .
According to CBS News , Roll Call reports the President 's fundraising average for 2008 through the end of June has reached $ 370,000 per-day , nearly outpacing presumptive GOP Presidential nominee John McCain .
Bush has raised $ 67 million thus far in 2008 , and is on track to beat President Clinton 's fundraising record of $ 100 million during the 2000 campaigns .
" Further , McCain has agreed to take public financing in the fall and will be limited to spending $ 84 million , " said Roll Call .
" So every penny Bush can raise for the Republican National Committee is another coin gathered to match the Obama juggernaut . "
However , thanks to his radioactive political status , Bush has kept his fundraising relatively private .
In the first half of 2008 , the President hosted or attended 28 fundraising events : all of them closed to the press .
Excerpts from article :
####
According to a CBS News analysis by correspondent Mark Knoller  regarded as the most accurate tracker of presidential activities 
Bush as of the end of June had raised $ 67 million for the GOP and its candidates this year , an average of $ 370,000 a day .
The sum is nearly 70 percent of what the presumptive Republican presidential candidate himself , Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) , has been able to amass .
Former President Bill Clinton , perhaps the most famous  and infamous  fundraiser of all time , culled just over $ 100 million for Democrats in all of 2000 .

Flying has become cheaper than taking a train or driving a car .
Yet , environmental concerns , dwindling fuel reserves and fast rising kerosene prices are threatening to turn airline travel into a privilege for the rich again .
This should not mean the end of mass travel or tourism , however .
Before mass air travel took off in the 1960s , people crossed the globe in majestic passenger ships .
Reintroducing ocean liners would be more than a nostalgic move : it could be a much more energy efficient ( yet slower ) way to travel .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" If we would stuff people in the ' Queen Mary 2 ' like we fold passengers into airplane seats , the ship could transport more than 500,000 people "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airlines all over the world are struggling to lower the energy consumption of their machines - by designing lighter planes and more efficient engines , by getting rid of needless weight inside the cabin , or by flying at lower speeds .
At the same time , they started investigating alternative fuels like algae , coconut oil , hydrogen and solar power .
None of these things will save cheap airline travel when kerosene prices keep going up , though .
There is a limit to energy efficiency , and alternative fuels for airplanes are highly speculative ; maybe we should first try and see if we could run our cars on “ green ” fuels without destroying the environment before we try to implement them in jumbo jets .
There is no alternative for kerosene .
Ocean liners
It has been said that there are no alternatives to airplanes either , when it comes to long distance travel .
This might be true , but this alternative once existed and it disappeared because of planes .
From the mid-19th century to the 1960s , millions of people crossed the oceans on passenger ships .
Many hundreds of ocean liners were built .
Most of these passenger ships were rather small and slow , but the superliners travelling the North Atlantic between Europe and North America were fast vessels with a much larger passenger capacity than that of a present plane ( these sites have a good overview of historical ocean liners ) .
Motorised ships ( first running on steam coal , later on diesel ) brought a spectacular improvement in speed and reliability .
While a sailing ship needed one to two months to cross the Atlantic , the first steamships made the journey in just 15 days .
Steamships also made travelling times predictable , so that regular services could be established .
Both speed and passenger capacity went up fast during the following one hundred years .
The SS United States ( illustration above ) , which was in service from 1952 to 1969 , still holds the record for the fastest ocean liner ever built : she ( ocean liners are female ) crossed the Atlantic in 3 days and 12 hours , at a speed of more than 54 km /h .
That ’s 10 to 20 times faster than a sailing ship .
Contrary to present cruise ships , ocean liners were built for speed .
Nations were in a constant race to possess the fastest passenger ship .
Ocean liners brought thousands of European immigrants to the US , Australia and Canada .
They caused a modest tourist boom in the 1920s and they served as the most important means of transportation between European countries and their colonies .
Yet , the fast growth of ocean liner traffic came to a rather abrupt end when cheap and fast air travel took off .
Propeller driven aircraft like the DC - 3 , which were used in the 1930s and 1940s , revolutionised travel at medium distances , but their speed ( 240 km / h ) and range ( 1,650 km ) were still too limited to present a danger for transatlantic ocean liners .
With the arrival of jet powered planes at the end of the 1950s , however , ocean liners lost their reason for existence .
The death of distance
Most passenger ships were taken out of service in the 1960s - some were converted to cruise ships .
Travelling at speeds of 900 km/h , jet powered planes lowered the travelling time between New York and London to less than 8 hours – 10 times faster than the SS United States .
Jet engines killed distance : today , at least in theory , every place on Earth can be reached in less than 24 hours time .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Ferries take not only passengers on board but also their cars .
Since the cars take more space and weigh more than the passengers , this is a very inefficient way of transporting people "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However , it is interesting to note that distances shrunk at least as much by switching from sailing ships to ocean liners ( which also introduced predictable travelling times ) as they did by changing from ocean liners to planes .
Today , there is only one ship left that services transatlantic crossings : the Queen Mary 2 .
Taking this gigantic ship as an example , replacing air travel by ocean liners does not seem to make a big difference .
At service speed , the ship has an engine output of 90,000 kilowatts .
Since she can take 2,620 passengers , this comes down to 34 kilowatts per passenger .
A Boeing 747 has an average engine output of 65,000 kilowatts and can transport about 500 passengers .
This comes down to 130 kilowatts per passenger ( for comparison : cars can have a maximum engine output from 50 to 300 kilowatts and more ) .
Thus , to transport one passenger across the Atlantic , a plane needs 4 times more engine power than a ship .
Energy output does not say all there is to say about fuel consumption however , since it does not take into account the duration of the trip ( see comments ) and the fuel efficiency of the engines .
It says even less about the emissions of toxic fumes and CO2 , because marine engines burn much dirtier fuel than aeroplanes .
Therefore , to make a case for a revival of ocean liners , more spectacular gains are needed .
These are not hard to find .
Sardines
While passengers in a plane are squeezed together like sardines , the use of space on a ship like the Queen Mary 2 is far from optimal .
The ship might have the speed of an ocean liner , but she is built like a cruise vessel .
The Queen Mary 2 shows off 15 restaurants and bars , 5 swimming pools , a casino , a ballroom , a theatre and a planetarium , to give some examples .
It has cabins with balconies .
In a plane , each passenger is folded into a seat - and that ’s it .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cross-section of the Queen Mary 2 compared to the Titanic and to the Airbus A 380 , currently the largest passenger plane with a capacity of up to 850 people .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
500,000 passengers
How many passengers would fit in the Queen Mary 2 if they would have as less space and leisure options as the passengers of a large jumbo jet ?
The ship has a gross tonnage of almost 150,000 GT – gross tonnage is a measure determining the internal volume ( or enclosed space ) of a ship , and comprises all spaces including engine rooms and crew cabins for instance .
On the Queen Mary 2 , this comes down to 57 gross tonnes per passenger .
A Boeing 747 has a gross tonnage of 129 GT – which comes down to 0.26 gross tonnes per passenger .
If we would stuff people in the Queen Mary 2 like we fold passengers in airplane seats , the ship could transport more than 500,000 people .
This would make transatlantic shipping definitely more eco-friendly than air travel , even without cleaner and more efficient engines .
The Queen Mary 2 transporting 500,000 people would boil down to a power output of 0.18 kilowatts per passenger – comparable to the output of a well - trained cyclist and 700 times more efficient than the engine power per passenger of an airplane .
Taking into account the duration of the voyages , the ship scores 70 times better than the plane .
Staten Island Ferry
Surprisingly , there are a few passenger boats that achieve similar figures .
The best example is the Staten Island ferry , a passenger service that runs between Manhattan and Staten Island in New York .
Ferries generally make far from optimal use of space , because almost all of them take not only passengers on board but also their cars .
Since the cars take more space and weigh more than the passengers , ferries are a very inefficient way of transporting people ( some of them are also as luxurious as cruise ships ) .
Yet , the Staten Island ferry does not take cars ( anymore ) .
These ferries – which have a passenger capacity of up to 6,000 people - have a gross tonnage per passenger of 0.38 to 0.55 GT .
That ’s only slightly more than the available space on a jumbo jet .
Of course , a trip on the Staten Island ferry only takes 25 minutes , and crossing the Atlantic folded in an airplane seat takes less than 10 hours .
Stuffing 500,000 people in the Queen Mary would be a bit optimistic , because the trip would take more than 3 days – a bit of walking space might be very welcome .
Transporting more passengers also means you have to take more food and more lifeboats , and it would mean significantly more garbage .
Therefore , let ’s change those 500,000 theoretical passengers into only 30,000 passengers .
This is not a random number .
A realistic option : 30,000 passengers
The Queen Mary 1 , who sailed the Atlantic from 1936 to 1967 , was just like many other ocean liners converted to a troopship in World War II , often transporting as many as 15,000 American soldiers .
On one trip she took 16,082 soldiers – the largest amount of passengers ever transported on one vessel .
The gross tonnage of the Queen Mary 2 is almost two times larger than that of the Queen Mary 1 , so it must be possible to transport 2 x 15,000 = 30,000 people on a ship like the Queen Mary 2 .
This would come down to 5 gross tonnes per passenger and 3 kilowatts of engine power per passenger .
These figures closely resemble those of the earlier ocean liners at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century .
The SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Große , a German ocean liner launched in 1896 , had a gross tonnage of only 14,350 GT but could take 1,506 passengers , which comes down to a gross tonnage per passenger of only 9.5 GT .
Even the infamous Titanic had a gross tonnage of only 18.5 tonnes per passenger .
If the passengers of the Queen Mary 2 would have the same moving space as the passengers of the ( luxurious ) Titanic , the ship could still hold more than 8,000 people , three times more than its capacity today ( more , in fact , since older steamships had much larger engine rooms ) .
Therefore , transporting 30,000 people on the QM2 is far from unrealistic or uncomfortable ( this is uncomfortable ) .
You would need 60 Jumbo Jets to transport 30,000 people .
Travel in a peak oil world
Every one of those 30,000 passengers on the Queen Mary 2 would have 20 times as much space than a passenger on a plane , while at the same time consuming 43 times less engine power ( taking the view that both engines has similar efficiency ) .
Taking into account the duration of the trip , the ship is 4 times more energy efficient than the plane .
Now this looks like an option that could be useful in a peak oil world .
If flying would become too expensive for most of us , passenger ships might continue to provide mass travel and tourism at a democratic price .
We would pay another price , of course : the world would become bigger again .
London and New York will be 3 days and 12 hours apart .
Engineers could design faster ships , but only at the expense of much higher fuel consumption .
The majority of fast ships ( hovercraft , catamarans , hydrofoils ) were taken out of service because of high fuel costs .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Unfortunately , governments and businesses prefer to keep up their faith in larger airports and faster planes as if there is no alternative "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switching back to ocean liners would surely lower long distance passenger travel and change life as we know it , but it would not be the end of modern civilization , nor the end of tourism or business .
A weekend of shopping in Paris will be hard if you live in New York and only have 3 days free .
But you could still get anywhere you want , if you take the time .
Unfortunately , governments and businesses prefer to keep up their belief in ever larger airports and ever faster planes ( like the Lapcat ) as if there is no alternative .
We are running out of fuel , guys - time to change course .
Dirty fuel
One very important note : replacing planes by ocean liners would be an ecologically sound idea , but only if marine engines become cleaner .
Most ships make use of very dirty ( unrefined ) diesel oil that needlessly poisons the air and heats up the atmosphere .
This is not a technological but a political problem .
All we need is ( much ) stronger regulation ( which is on its way ) .
Wind energy and solar energy can also help to lower the fuel consumption of ships ( see these articles on Low - tech Magazine ) .
Other issues to consider are wastewater treatment and garbage disposal – again things that should not be harmful , but at the moment they are because of a lack of sufficient laws and control ( read more about the rather sickening practices of cruise ships here ) .

BUFFALO , N.Y. -- Florida Panthers forward Richard Zednik
underwent surgery to close a deep gash on the right side of his
neck and was in stable condition Sunday night after he was cut by a
teammate 's skate during a game .
" The surgery was successful and he 's resting comfortably in the
hospital , " Panthers spokesman Brian Goldman said .
Blood gushed from Zednik 's neck after he was hurt midway through
the third period of Buffalo's 5 - 3 victory , creating a frightening
moment that delayed the game for about 15 minutes .
There was also a
brief discussion about postponing the game altogether .
Zednik was behind the play and skating into the right corner of
the Sabres ' zone , when teammate Olli Jokinen was upended by Sabres
forward Clarke MacArthur .
Jokinen fell head - first to the ice , and
his right leg flew up and struck Zednik directly on the side of the
neck .
Clutching his neck , Zednik raced to the Florida bench , leaving a
long trail of blood .
When he arrived , he nearly fell into the arms
of a team trainer , who quickly applied a towel to the cut .
Zednik
was then helped off the ice by the trainer and teammate
Jassen Cullimore , and escorted to the Panthers ' dressing room .
" We should n't have finished the game , " Jokinen said .
" I saw
the replay , that it was my skate that hit him in the throat .
I
think we were all in shock .
I 've never seen anything like that .
There are bigger things than [ finishing the game ] .
It was
terrifying .
" I did n't think anyone on our team was thinking hockey out
there after an injury like that .
If it was my call , I would have
gone to the hospital with him . "
Panthers spokesman Justin Copertino said Zednik was transported
by ambulance to Buffalo General Hospital .
Copertino said the team
was making arrangements to have Zednik 's wife , Jessica , fly from
South Florida to Buffalo by a charter flight Sunday night .
The team was scheduled to return to Miami , but assistant general
manager Randy Sexton and assistant trainer Dave Zenobi planned to
stay behind with Zednik , Copertino said .

Zednik 's injury left players and coaches on both benches
stunned , and a silent hush fell over the crowd at HSBC Arena .
NHL vice president Colin Campbell consulted with Sabres general
manager Darcy Regier and referee Bill McCreary in a tunnel after
Zednik was loaded into an ambulance .
Campbell , who was not
available for comment , attended the game in part because his son ,
Gregory , plays for the Panthers .
In a statement , the NHL said that Campbell talked to
commissioner Gary Bettman and decided to continue the game after
knowing that Zednik was stable , that trainers had stopped the
bleeding , and that the teams were willing to go on .
The league said : " The thoughts and prayers of the NHL family
are with Richard Zednik , his loved ones , his teammates and the
Florida Panthers organization . "
" I can fully understand if they wanted to cancel the whole
game , " Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said .
" It was pretty solemn .
There
was n't a lot being said [ on the bench ] .
There was just more concern
for Richard than anything else .
" When you see something like that , it is n't about playing
anymore .
But I said , ' We 're going to finish the game and it's going
to be what it 's going to be . ' "
As crews scraped the blood from the ice and the surface was
cleaned by Zambonis during the extended delay , the public address
announcer said : " Richard Zednik is in stable condition and on his
way to a Buffalo hospital . "
The crowd stood in applause during the announcement .
Several Florida players were shaken after seeing the gruesome injury .
" It 's something you never want to see , " Panthers center Stephen Weiss told The Miami Herald .
" It 's the worst thing I 've ever seen in hockey .
The worst went through my mind ...
Just his face [ when he was ] coming off [ the ice ] , was just , you know , something you do n't want to see .
I do n't know how to explain it , but it was a scary look .
He looked very scared . "
Florida goalie Tomas Vokoun described the situation off the ice .
" I walked in and saw him on the stretcher , " Vokoun told The Herald .
" I was very concerned when he came off .
He was obviously very scared .
He was conscious , I guess , that 's what the trainer said .
His eyes were closed , but he was moving and moaning . "
Zednik 's injury was eerily reminiscent of an injury sustained by
Sabres goaltender Clint Malarchuk about 19 years ago at Buffalo's
Memorial Auditorium .
On March 22 , 1989 , Malarchuk severed his
jugular vein when St. Louis Blues forward Steve Tuttle was upended
while skating toward the crease , slicing Malarchuk with a skate .
" I was back here watching , and I knew what it was right away , " Sabres longtime equipment manager Rip Simonick told The Buffalo News .
" Just like that night . "
Malarchuk required over 300 stitches but spent only one night in
the hospital , returning to practice after four days .
On April 2 , he
played the final five minutes in the season finale , less than two
weeks after his injury .
Panthers defenseman Steve Montador recalled seeing Zednik in a
state of shock as he got to the bench .
" He looked pale , he was obviously standing and to a degree ,
coherent .
But he did n't look as focused as you or I right now .
He
was staring at nothing , " Montador said .
" That 's a pretty brave
guy to realize what 's going on : Grab your neck and get off the
ice . "
Zednik has 15 goals and 11 assists this season .
It was the second serious injury caused by a skate this weekend .
On Saturday , NHL linesman Pat Dapuzzo needed dozens of stitches
to close a cut on his face after he was hit by the skate of
Philadelphia Flyers forward Steve Downie in a game against the N
ew York Rangers .
Dapuzzo , scheduled to retire at the end of the season , did n't
return after the second - period injury .

Cellphones have never been more popular , but questions about their safety are resurfacing .
On Tuesday the issue grabbed the spotlight on CNN's Larry King Live , where most experts brought on the show expressed concern about the potential health impacts of using cellphones beyond a decade .
Dr. Keith Black , the neurosurgeon who treated high - profile U.S. lawyer Johnnie Cochran before Cochran died of a brain tumour in 2005 , was among them .
" There are a billion people using cellphones and they 'll be using cellphones for many years , " he told King .
" We do n't know if this is going to be a safe practice . "
In fact , three billion people around the world , or nearly half the global population , are now cellphone users .
And they 're beginning to use them at earlier ages and more frequently .
Some even rely on the wireless devices as their primary phone , racking up hundreds – even thousands – of hours of talk time a year .
Parents give them to their kids as a means of staying in touch .
A lot is at stake .
Worldwide cellphone sales reached nearly 300 million units in the first quarter of 2008 , while telecom carriers earn billions in profit , despite stepped - up competition .
In an economy dependent on mobility , cellphones are becoming a sort of Swiss Army Knife of communications , offering a phone , email device , digital camera , MP3 player and Web browser in one convenient package .
Some studies have found no risk from long - term use .
Mobile phone providers , citing the authority of the World Health Organization , maintain the technology poses no health risks and that radiation from cellphones falls well below government safety guidelines .
" They do n't feel there 's any need for precaution , " said Peter Barnes , president and chief executive of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association .
Indeed , most wireless customers either do n't believe there 's a health risk , or they 've weighed past inconclusive studies with the convenience of wireless communications and chosen to keep their cellphones .
But behind the scenes , cellphone makers and service providers are closely following the long - awaited Interphone research project , a massive 13 - country study co-ordinated by the WHO 's International Agency for Research On Cancer .
Canada is a participant , along with Australia , Japan , Israel , New Zealand and eight European countries .
The project , considered the most comprehensive look at the potential link between cellphone use and cancer , involves the pooled analysis of thousands of cases of tumours in the head and neck area : gliomas , meningiomas , acoustic neuromas and parotid gland tumours .
It was originally supposed to be completed in 2004 and published in 2006 .
Years later the final report has still not been released , a source of frustration among some scientists who say such a delay would never be tolerated in the context of a drug study .
" Certain people are embarrassed it 's taking so long , " said Dr. Louis Slesin , who has studied the issue extensively as founder and publisher of New York - based scientific newsletter Microwave News .
" At some point , it becomes a public health scandal that they 're not releasing it . "
Elisabeth Cardis , the Canadian - born researcher who led the WHO - backed project , said the study will be submitted for publication " soon . "
Interpretation of the results has not been easy , she said , pointing to the difficulty of satisfying the more than 50 different researchers who must approve the final manuscript .
The delay , however , has n't stopped individual countries from releasing parts of their own studies .
Israel , Sweden , Denmark and France are among the participants that have gone public with certain results .
Slesin said analysis of those results , in the context of heavy cellphone use of 10 years or longer , has raised some troubling red flags .
One 2007 research paper , co-authored by Finnish scientist Anna Lahkola , looked at glioma cases from studies conducted in five North European countries , including some data from Interphone .
The paper found a significantly increased risk of developing glioma after cellphone use of more than 10 years .
A 2008 analysis , led by Swedish oncologist Dr. Lennart Hardell , looked at 10 European studies published between 2001 and 2007 – most of them country - specific studies from Interphone – and also found a heightened risk from long - term use .
" We conclude that this meta - analysis gave a consistent pattern of an association between mobile phone use and ipsilateral glioma and acoustic neuroma , " after 10 years or more of use .
" Clearly , it 's time to take tumour risk very seriously , " said Slesin , adding that the results of the Lahkola study convinced him that such a risk could no longer be discounted .
Australia , like Canada , has yet to release its Interphone results .
Bruce Armstrong , a professor of public health at the University of Sydney who is leading Australia 's contribution to Interphone , warned there 's nothing conclusive yet .
But he agreed the patterns emerging from recent reports do suggest a possible health risk .

In February , Israeli scientist Dr. Siegal Sadetzki and her team of Interphone researchers published a study showing that heavy cellphone users had a 50 per cent greater risk of developing a tumour of the main salivary gland – or parotid – on the same side of the head where they hold the phone , compared with those who did n't use cellphones .
" I would say our results are in line with previous results that are showing something is going wrong here , " said Sadetzki , speaking from Israel in a telephone interview with the Star .
" After 10 years or more we do see something there . "
Sadetzki said it 's true that the vast body of global research on cellphone use still supports the claim that the wireless technology is safe , but most of those studies were done too early to have any meaning .
" It takes at least 10 , 20 or 30 years to see exposure to cancer , " she said , explaining that while Hiroshima was bombed with atomic weapons in August 1945 , the first study showing brain tumours emerged only decades later .
Combining studies done in the 1990s with those carried out over the past few years only dilutes the outcome , she added , because just recently has data been collected on people who have been heavy cell users for 10 years or more .
" The main argument is that if you take the results from the last three years , you do see an indication . "
Even Barnes from the Canadian wireless association acknowledges some of the recent findings .
" Clearly , they have suggested a possible increased risk over 10 years . "
But Barnes warned about jumping to conclusions .
He said recent research related to Interphone indicates that study subjects considered long - term cellphone users prone to what 's called " recall bias . "
In other words , when they 're asked to think back 10 years or more they often overestimate how much they used their cellphone .
This , Barnes explained , can cause a positive bias in the estimates of disease risk .
Dr. Daniel Krewski , head of Canada 's participation in Interphone , co-authored the latest study on recall bias and found that it had potential to skew the outcome of the 13 - country project .
Such biases must be factored into the final Interphone analysis , said Krewski , otherwise " if you 're recalling your phone incorrectly we 're not going to get accurate results . "
The need to get a better grip on recall and other possible biases is why the final draft of the Interphone study has been several years delayed , said Krewski .
" This is such a high - profile study we want to make sure we get it right before it becomes public . "
But some scientists , including Sadetzki , are already looking beyond Interphone and toward new research aimed at teenagers and pre-teens .
" They have a long way ahead of them , so the exposure will accumulate , " she said , recognizing that the technology – so integrated into our daily life – is here to stay regardless of what the studies suggest .
" Nobody will stop using this technology .
There are car accidents and still we keep driving cars .
The question is what precautions do we take ? "

Michael Schumacher was unhurt in the collision in Lydd on Sunday
A Kent car dealer who was sent flying when a van struck a barrier was shocked to discover the driver was the German ex-Formula 1 ace , Michael Schumacher .
Martin Kingham , 39 , said he was closing the security gate at his premises in Lydd on Sunday afternoon when a Fiat van struck the end of it .
The barrier hit his leg " sending him spinning " on to the bonnet of a car .
Police called to the incident said they helped both men to swap details and no further action was needed .
Mr Kingham was unhurt , while only minor damage was caused to Schumacher 's van in the collision outside Millfield Motors , just before 1600 BST .
' Penny dropped '
He recalled how the police officer called to the scene said : " That chap is claiming to be Michael Schumacher , and I said , ' You know what , he does n't half look like him ' .
" Then the penny suddenly dropped .
When I phoned my business partner later and told him that you 'll never guess who I 've been run over by , he would n't believe me .

" Obviously being a car salesman we do like a wind up but the difference with this story is that it is actually true .
" Michael 's entourage turned up and he left . "
A spokesman for the seven - time Formula 1 world champion confirmed the incident had taken place and that Schumacher had co-operated with police .
You may want to soak your brown rice .
Researchers have found that a compound that helps rice seed grow , springs back into action when brown rice is placed in water overnight before cooking , significantly reducing the nerve and vascular damage that often result from diabetes .
" You have to let it grow , germinate a little bit , " says Dr. Robert K. Yu , director of the Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics and Institute of Neuroscience at the Medical College of Georgia .
" Some of the active ingredients generated as a result of the germination process are beneficial to you . "
Germinated brown rice 's ability to help diabetics lower their blood sugar has been shown but how it works remained unknown .
New research , published online in the Journal of Lipid Research , shows the growth factor acylated steryl glucosides or ASG , helps normalize blood sugar and enzymes that are out - of - whack in diabetes .
" The advantage of knowing this key ingredient and its structure is we can now make a ton of it ; you do n't have to rely on rice to produce it or eating rice to get this beneficial effect , " says Dr. Yu , the paper 's corresponding author .
Studies were done in animal models of type 1 diabetes with two different blood sugar levels that reflect patients ' varying blood sugars .
They were fed diets of white , brown or pre-germinated brown rice .
Unlike white rice , less - processed brown rice still has some of the germ or growth structure that , after about 24 hours in water , resumes activity .
Scientists watched as the resurrected ASG , a growth factor and lipid , helped normalize metabolism .
" When blood sugar levels increase , the metabolic balance changes , " says Dr. Seigo Usuki , neurobiologist in the MCG School of Medicine and the paper 's first author .
" Part of the way we know this growth factor works is by increasing levels of good enzymes that are decreased in diabetes . "
Dr. Usuki is talking about enzymes such as ATPase , which help maintain nerve membranes so they can conduct electricity and communicate .
Decrease of ATPase is a hallmark of the nerve damage that accompanies diabetes .
Also reduced in diabetes is homocysteine - thiolactonase , or HTase , an enzyme that decreases levels of homocysteine , a known risk factor for vascular disease .
The liver produces a low level of homocysteine but that level is elevated in diabetes while the enzyme that controls it decreases .
Unchecked , homocysteine makes oxidative stress compounds that injure and kill cells .
HTase is one way HDL , the so - called " good cholesterol , " helps protect blood vessels from disease .
A regular diet of pre-germinated brown rice diet helps get both back to a healthier level .
Fancl Hatsuga Genmai Co. , Ltd. , in Yokohama , Japan , which funded the studies and supplied the pre-germinated rice , already is working with Dr. Usuki on a supplement that can provide consumers who prefer not to soak – or eat – rice with the benefits of ASG .
The MCG research team reported in December 2007 in Nutrition & Metabolism that pre-germinated brown rice was better at protecting nerves from diabetes than un -soaked brown or white rice .
They showed a then - unidentified lipid helped protect the nerve membrane and increase activity of HTase and the good cholesterol .
Germination also is known to increase levels of the neurotransmitter GABA , which is believed to have many beneficial health effects such as lowering blood pressure , improving cognition and lowering blood glucose levels .
However the MCG scientists have shown the lipid has a more powerful impact on HTase activity .
The germ layer activated by soaking brown rice contains many vitamins and minerals in addition to the bioactive ingredient that would be beneficial to everyone , Dr. Yu says .
The roughage of the rice grain also is helpful .

What is the meaning of your call for Muslims to take arms against America in particular , and what is the message that you wish to send to the West in general ?
The call to wage war against America was made because America has spear - headed the crusade against the Islamic nation , sending tens of thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and above its meddling in its affairs and its politics , and its support of the oppressive , corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control .
These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target .
And not exempt of responsibility are those Western regimes whose presence in the region offers support to the American troops there .
We know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the Western forces and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel .
Surely , their presence is not out of concern over their interests in the region .
...
Their presence has no meaning save one and that is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel .
...
Many of the Arabic as well as the Western mass media accuse you of terrorism and of supporting terrorism .
What do you have to say to that ?
There is an Arabic proverb that says " she accused me of having her malady , then snuck away . "
Besides , terrorism can be commendable and it can be reprehensible .
Terrifying an innocent person and terrorizing him is objectionable and unjust , also unjustly terrorizing people is not right .
Whereas , terrorizing oppressors and criminals and thieves and robbers is necessary for the safety of people and for the protection of their property .
There is no doubt in this .
Every state and every civilization and culture has to resort to terrorism under certain circumstances for the purpose of abolishing tyranny and corruption .
Every country in the world has its own security system and its own security forces , its own police and its own army .
They are all designed to terrorize whoever even contemplates to attack that country or its citizens .
The terrorism we practice is of the commendable kind for it is directed at the tyrants and the aggressors and the enemies of Allah , the tyrants , the traitors who commit acts of treason against their own countries and their own faith and their own prophet and their own nation .
Terrorizing those and punishing them are necessary measures to straighten things and to make them right .
Tyrants and oppressors who subject the Arab nation to aggression ought to be punished .
The wrongs and the crimes committed against the Muslim nation are far greater than can be covered by this interview .
America heads the list of aggressors against Muslims .
The recurrence of aggression against Muslims everywhere is proof enough .
For over half a century , Muslims in Palestine have been slaughtered and assaulted and robbed of their honor and of their property .
Their houses have been blasted , their crops destroyed .
And the strange thing is that any act on their part to avenge themselves or to lift the injustice befalling them causes great agitation in the United Nations which hastens to call for an emergency meeting only to convict the victim and to censure the wronged and the tyrannized whose children have been killed and whose crops have been destroyed and whose farms have been pulverized .
...
In today 's wars , there are no morals , and it is clear that mankind has descended to the lowest degrees of decadence and oppression .
They rip us of our wealth and of our resources and of our oil .
Our religion is under attack .
They kill and murder our brothers .
They compromise our honor and our dignity and dare we utter a single word of protest against the injustice , we are called terrorists .
This is compounded injustice .
And the United Nations insistence to convict the victims and support the aggressors constitutes a serious precedence which shows the extent of injustice that has been allowed to take root in this land .
...
What is your relationship with the Islamic movements in various regions of the world like Chechnya and Kashmir and other Arab countries ?
Cooperation for the sake of truth and righteousness is demanded from Muslims .
A Muslim should do his utmost to cooperate with his fellow Muslims .
But Allah says of cooperation that it is not absolute for there is cooperation to do good , and there is cooperation to commit aggression and act unjustly .
A Muslim is supposed to give his fellow Muslim guidance and support .
He ( Allah ) said " Stand by your brother be he oppressor or oppressed . "
When asked how were they to stand by him if he were the oppressor , He answered them , saying " by giving him guidance and counsel . "
It all goes to say that Muslims should cooperate with one another and should be supportive of one another , and they should promote righteousness and mercy .
They should all unite in the fight against polytheism and they should pool all their resources and their energy to fight the Americans and the Zionists and those with them .
They should , however , avoid side fronts and rise over the small problems for these are less detrimental .
Their fight should be directed against unbelief and unbelievers .
...
We heard your message to the American government and later your message to the European governments who participated in the occupation of the Gulf .
Is it possible for you to address the people of these countries ?
As we have already said , our call is the call of Islam that was revealed to Mohammed .
It is a call to all mankind .
We have been entrusted with good cause to follow in the footsteps of the Messenger and to communicate his message to all nations .
It is an invitation that we extend to all the nations to embrace Islam , the religion that calls for justice , mercy and fraternity among all nations , not differentiating between black and white or between red and yellow except with respect to their devotedness .
All people who worship Allah , not each other , are equal before Him .
We are entrusted to spread this message and to extend that call to all the people .
We , nonetheless , fight against their governments and all those who approve of the injustice they practice against us .
We fight the governments that are bent on attacking our religion and on stealing our wealth and on hurting our feelings .
And as I have mentioned before , we fight them , and those who are part of their rule are judged in the same manner .
...
In your last statement , there was a strong message to the American government in particular .
What message do you have for the European governments and the West in general ?
Praise be Allah and prayers and peace upon Mohammed .
With respect to the Western governments that participated in the attack on the land of the two Holy Mosques regarding it as ownerless , and in the siege against the Muslim people of Iraq , we have nothing new to add to the previous message .
What prompted us to address the American government in particular is the fact that it is on the head of the Western and the crusading forces in their fight against Islam and against Muslims .
The two explosions that took place in Riyadh and in Khobar recently were but a clear and powerful signal to the governments of the countries which willingly participated in the aggression against our countries and our lives and our sacrosanct symbols .
It might be beneficial to mention that some of those countries have begun to move towards independence from the American government with respect to the enmity that it continues to show towards the Muslim people .
We only hope that they will continue to move in that direction , away from the oppressive forces that are fighting against our countries .
We however , differentiate between the western government and the people of the West .
If the people have elected those governments in the latest elections , it is because they have fallen prey to the Western media which portray things contrary to what they really are .
And while the slogans raised by those regimes call for humanity , justice , and peace , the behavior of their governments is completely the opposite .
It is not enough for their people to show pain when they see our children being killed in Israeli raids launched by American planes , nor does this serve the purpose .
What they ought to do is change their governments which attack our countries .
The hostility that America continues to express against the Muslim people has given rise to feelings of animosity on the part of Muslims against America and against the West in general .
Those feelings of animosity have produced a change in the behavior of some crushed and subdued groups who , instead of fighting the Americans inside the Muslim countries , went on to fight them inside the United States of America itself .
The Western regimes and the government of the United States of America bear the blame for what might happen .
If their people do not wish to be harmed inside their very own countries , they should seek to elect governments that are truly representative of them and that can protect their interests .
...
The enmity between us and the Jews goes far back in time and is deep rooted .
There is no question that war between the two of us is inevitable .
For this reason it is not in the interest of Western governments to expose the interests of their people to all kinds of retaliation for almost nothing .
It is hoped that people of those countries will initiate a positive move and force their governments not to act on behalf of other states and other sects .
This is what we have to say and we pray to Allah to preserve the nation of Islam and to help them drive their enemies out of their land .
American politicians have painted a distorted picture of Islam , of Muslims and of Islamic fighters .
We would like you to give us the true picture that clarifies your viewpoint ... .
The leaders in America and in other countries as well have fallen victim to Jewish Zionist blackmail .
They have mobilized their people against Islam and against Muslims .
These are portrayed in such a manner as to drive people to rally against them .
The truth is that the whole Muslim world is the victim of international terrorism , engineered by America at the United Nations .
We are a nation whose sacred symbols have been looted and whose wealth and resources have been plundered .
It is normal for us to react against the forces that invade our land and occupy it ... .
Quite a number of Muslim countries have seen the rise of militant movements whose purpose is to stand up in the face of the pressure exerted on the people by their own governments and other governments .
Such as is the case in Egypt and Libya and North Africa and Algiers and such as was the case in Syria and in Yemen .
There are also other militant groups currently engaged in the fight against the unbelievers and the crusaders as is the case in Kashmir and Chechnya and Bosnia and the African horn .
Is there any message you wish to convey to our brothers who are fighting in various parts of the Islamic World ? ...
Tell the Muslims everywhere that the vanguards of the warriors who are fighting the enemies of Islam belong to them and the young fighters are their sons .
Tell them that the nation is bent on fighting the enemies of Islam .
Once again , I have to stress the necessity of focusing on the Americans and the Jews for they represent the spearhead with which the members of our religion have been slaughtered .
Any effort directed against America and the Jews yields positive and direct results - Allah willing .
It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities .
...
John Miller 's interview begins .
You come from a background of wealth and comfort to end up fighting on the front lines .
Many Americans find that unusual .
This is difficult to understand , especially for him who does not understand the religion of Islam .
In our religion , we believe that Allah has created us for the purpose of worshipping him .
He is the one who has created us and who has favored us with this religion .
Allah has ordered us to make holy wars and to fight to see to it that His word is the highest and the uppermost and that of the unbelievers the lowermost .
We believe that this is the call we have to answer regardless of our financial capabilities .
This too answers the claims of the West and of the secular people in the Arab world .
They claim that this blessed awakening and the people reverting to Islam are due to economic factors .
This is not so .
It is rather a grace from Allah , a desire to embrace the religion of Allah .
And this is not surprising .
When the holy war called , thousands of young men from the Arab Peninsula and other countries answered the call and they came from wealthy backgrounds .
Hundreds of them were killed in Afghanistan and in Bosnia and in Chechnya .
You have been described as the world 's most wanted man , and there is word that the American government intends to put a price on your head - in the millions - when you are captured .
Do you think they will do that ?
And does it bother you ?
We do not care what the Americans believe .
What we care for is to please Allah .
Americans heap accusations on whoever stands for his religion or his rights or his wealth .
...
It does not scare us that they have put a price on my head .
We as Muslims believe that our years on this earth are finite and predetermined .
If the whole world gets together to kill us before it is our time to go , they will not succeed .
We also believe that livelihoods are preordained .
So no matter how much pressure American puts on the regime in Riyadh to freeze our assets and to forbid people from contributing to this great cause , we shall still have Allah to take care of us ; livelihood is sent by Allah ; we shall not want .
...
Mr. bin Laden , you have issued a fatwah calling on Muslims to kill Americans where they can , when they can .
Is that directed at all Americans , just the American military , just the Americans in Saudi Arabia ?
Allah has ordered us to glorify the truth and to defend Muslim land , especially the Arab peninsula ... against the unbelievers .
After World War II , the Americans grew more unfair and more oppressive towards people in general and Muslims in particular .
...
The Americans started it and retaliation and punishment should be carried out following the principle of reciprocity , especially when women and children are involved .
Through history , American has not been known to differentiate between the military and the civilians or between men and women or adults and children .
Those who threw atomic bombs and used the weapons of mass destruction against Nagasaki and Hiroshima were the Americans .
Can the bombs differentiate between military and women and infants and children ?
America has no religion that can deter her from exterminating whole peoples .
Your position against Muslims in Palestine is despicable and disgraceful .
America has no shame .
...
We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans .
Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind .
We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian .
As far as we are concerned , they are all targets , and this is what the fatwah says ... .
The fatwah is general ( comprehensive ) and it includes all those who participate in , or help the Jewish occupiers in killing Muslims .
Ramzi Yousef was a follower of yours .
Do you remember him and did you know him ?
After the explosion that took place in the World Trade Center , Ramzi Yousef became a well known Muslim figure .
Muslims have come to know him .
Unfortunately , I did not know him before this incident .
I of course remember who he is .
He is a Muslim who wanted to protect his religion jealously from the oppression practiced by America against Islam .
He acted with zeal to make the Americans understand that their government was attacking Muslims in order to safeguard the American - Jewish interests .
...
Wali Khan Amin Shah was captured in Manila .
American authorities believe he was working for you , funded by you , setting up training camps there and part of his plan was to plan out the assassination or the attempted assassination of President Clinton during his trip to Manila .
Wali Khan is a Muslim young man ; his nickname in Afghanistan was the Lion .
He was among the most courageous Muslim young men .
He was a close friend and we used to fight from the same trenches in Afghanistan .
We fought many battles against the Russians until they were defeated and put to shame and had to leave the country in disgrace .
As to what you said about him working for me , I have nothing to say .
We are all together in this ; we all work for Allah and our reward comes from him .
As to what you said about the attempt to assassinate President Clinton , it is not surprising .
What do you expect from people attacked by Clinton , whose sons and mothers have been killed by Clinton ?
Do you expect anything but treatment by reciprocity ?
The federal government in the US .
is still investigating their suspicions that you ordered and funded the attack on the US military in Al Khobar and Riyadh .
We have roused the nation and the Muslim people and we have communicated to them the fatwahs of our learned scholars who the Saudi government has thrown in jail in order to please the American government for which they are agents .
...
We have communicated their fatwahs and stirred the nation to drive out the enemy who has occupied our land and usurped our country and suppressed our people and to rid the land of the two Holy Mosques from their presence .
Among the young men who responded to our call are Khalid Al Said and Abdul Azeez Al ... and Mahmud Al Hadi and Muslih Al Shamrani .
We hope Allah receives them as holy martyrs .
They have raised the nation 's head high and washed away a great part of the shame that has enveloped us as a result of the weakness of the Saudi government and its complicity with the American government ... .
Yes , we have instigated and they have responded .
We hope Allah grants their families solace .
You 've been painted in America as a terrorist leader .
To your followers , you are a hero .
How do you see yourself ?
As I have said , we are not interested in what America says .
We do not care .
We view ourselves and our brothers like everyone else .
Allah created us to worship Him and to follow in his footsteps and to be guided by His Book .
I am one of the servants of Allah and I obey his orders .
Among those is the order to fight for the word of Allah ... and to fight until the Americans are driven out of all the Islamic countries .
No one expected the mujahedeen to beat the Russians in Afghanistan .
It came as a surprise to everyone .
What do you see as the future of American involvement in the Middle East , in taking on groups like this ?
...
Allah has granted the Muslim people and the Afghani mujahedeen , and those with them , the opportunity to fight the Russians and the Soviet Union .
...
They were defeated by Allah and were wiped out .
There is a lesson here .
The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan late in December of ' 79 .
The flag of the Soviet Union was folded once and for all on the 25th of December just 10 years later .
It was thrown in the waste basket .
Gone was the Soviet union forever .
We are certain that we shall - with the grace of Allah - prevail over the Americans and over the Jews , as the Messenger of Allah promised us in an authentic prophetic tradition when He said the Hour of Resurrection shall not come before Muslims fight Jews and before Jews hide behind trees and behind rocks .
We are certain - with the grace of Allah - that we shall prevail over the Jews and over those fighting with them .
Today however , our battle against the Americans is far greater than our battle was against the Russians .
Americans have committed unprecedented stupidity .
They have attacked Islam and its most significant sacrosanct symbols ... .
We anticipate a black future for America .
Instead of remaining United States , it shall end up separated states and shall have to carry the bodies of its sons back to America .
What do you see as the future of the Saudi royal family and their involvement with America and the US military ?
History has the answer to your question .
The fate of any government which sells the interests of its own people and , betrays the nation and commits offenses which furnish grounds for expulsion from Islam , is known .
We expect for the ruler of Riyadh the same fate as the Shah of Iran .
We anticipate this to happen to him and to the influential people who stand by him and who have sided with the Jews and the Christians giving them free reign over the land of the two Holy Mosques .
These are grave offenses that are grounds for expulsion from the faith .
They shall all be wiped out .
...
Describe the situation when your men took down the American forces in Somalia .
After our victory in Afghanistan and the defeat of the oppressors who had killed millions of Muslims , the legend about the invincibility of the superpowers vanished .
Our boys no longer viewed America as a superpower .
So , when they left Afghanistan , they went to Somalia and prepared themselves carefully for a long war .
They had thought that the Americans were like the Russians , so they trained and prepared .
They were stunned when they discovered how low was the morale of the American soldier .
America had entered with 30,000 soldiers in addition to thousands of soldiers from different countries in the world .
...
As I said , our boys were shocked by the low morale of the American soldier and they realized that the American soldier was just a paper tiger .
He was unable to endure the strikes that were dealt to his army , so he fled , and America had to stop all its bragging and all that noise it was making in the press after the Gulf War in which it destroyed the infrastructure and the milk and dairy industry that was vital for the infants and the children and the civilians and blew up dams which were necessary for the crops people grew to feed their families .
Proud of this destruction , America assumed the titles of world leader and master of the new world order .
After a few blows , it forgot all about those titles and rushed out of Somalia in shame and disgrace , dragging the bodies of its soldiers .
America stopped calling itself world leader and master of the new world order , and its politicians realized that those titles were too big for them and that they were unworthy of them .
I was in Sudan when this happened .
I was very happy to learn of that great defeat that America suffered , so was every Muslim .
...
Many Americans believe that fighting army to army like what happened in Afghanistan is heroic for either army .
But sending off bombs , killing civilians like in the World Trade Center is terrorism .
...
After our victory over the Russians in Afghanistan , the international and the American mass media conducted fierce campaigns against us ... .
They called us terrorists even before the mujahedeen had committed any act of terrorism against the real terrorists who are the Americans .
On the other hand , we say that American politics and their religion do not believe in differentiating between civilians and military , between infants and animals , or among any human groups .
...
Our mothers and daughters and sons are slaughtered every day with the approval of America and its support .
And , while America blocks the entry of weapons into Islamic countries , it provides the Israelis with a continuous supply of arms allowing them thus to kill and massacre more Muslims .
Your religion does not forbid you from committing such acts , so you have no right to object to any response or retaliation that reciprocates your own actions .
But , and in spite of this , our retaliation is directed primarily against the soldiers only and against those standing by them .
Our religion forbids us from killing innocent people such as women and children .
This , however , does not apply to women fighters .
A woman who puts herself in the same trench with men , gets what they get .
...
The American people , by and large , do not know the name bin Laden , but they soon likely will .
Do you have a message for the American people ?
I say to them that they have put themselves at the mercy of a disloyal government , and this is most evident in Clinton 's administration ... .
We believe that this administration represents Israel inside America .
Take the sensitive ministries such as the Ministry of Exterior and the Ministry of Defense and the CIA , you will find that the Jews have the upper hand in them .
They make use of America to further their plans for the world , especially the Islamic world .
American presence in the Gulf provides support to the Jews and protects their rear .
And while millions of Americans are homeless and destitute and live in abject poverty , their government is busy occupying our land and building new settlements and helping Israel build new settlements in the point of departure for our Prophet 's midnight journey to the seven heavens .
America throws her own sons in the land of the two Holy Mosques for the sake of protecting Jewish interests .
...
The American government is leading the country towards hell .
...
We say to the Americans as people and to American mothers , if they cherish their lives and if they cherish their sons , they must elect an American patriotic government that caters to their interests not the interests of the Jews .
If the present injustice continues with the wave of national consciousness , it will inevitably move the battle to American soil , just as Ramzi Yousef and others have done .
This is my message to the American people .
I urge them to find a serious administration that acts in their interest and does not attack people and violate their honor and pilfer their wealth .
...
In America , we have a figure from history from 1897 named Teddy Roosevelt .
He was a wealthy man , who grew up in a privileged situation and who fought on the front lines .
He put together his own men - hand chose them - and went to battle .
You are like the Middle East version of Teddy Roosevelt .
I am one of the servants of Allah .
We do our duty of fighting for the sake of the religion of Allah .
It is also our duty to send a call to all the people of the world to enjoy this great light and to embrace Islam and experience the happiness in Islam .
Our primary mission is nothing but the furthering of this religion .
...
Let not the West be taken in by those who say that Muslims choose nothing but slaughtering .
Their brothers in East Europe , in Turkey and in Albania have been guided by Allah to submit to Islam and to experience the bliss of Islam .
Unlike those , the European and the American people and some of the Arabs are under the influence of Jewish media .

Get into a car anywhere in the world and you are pretty much guaranteed that you will understand how to drive it .
Cars have the ultimate user interface and Formula 1 cars perhaps represent the pinnacle of this UI , with the most demanding requirements .
As recently as 1992 , F1 steering wheels were round with 3 buttons ( neutral , drinking water supply , radio ) , but since the advent of paddle gear changes there has been a sudden explosion of electronics and feature driven complexity .
The complexity is ubiquitous , all 11 Formula 1 teams produce cars with more or less the same multi button design allowing adjustment and tweaks of traction and aerodynamics from the wheel itself .
Unlike a road car , space and focus constraints mean that the entire dashboard is on the steering wheel .
This is something that will no doubt be copied , unnecessarily , in consumer cars in future , but would that be a UI improvement ?
Given that all 11 F1 teams have converged on a remarkably similar UI , independently , you would think that dashboard steering wheel style was a rational design , however its complexity possibly caused Lewis Hamilton the 2007 F1 championship , when he accidentally pressed the neutral button ( top left of the 2007 McLaren Mercedes wheel ) .
We have gathered together as many of the modern style wheel designs that we could find and put a date to , to demonstrate the UI pattern .
What is clear is that there is no clear accentuation of features ( color , size ) by how often the are used , merely by position .
Even if drivers like Hamilton are experts and fully familiar with the UI , there is a tiny percentage chance of error .
Our guess is that this trend in car UI would be a mistake if it filters through to everyday cars , and that F1 cars will revert to a more simple UI over time .

Curious things are going on in the Middle East .
On the one hand , Israel seems to be taking some early , tentative steps towards peace with its nearest enemies .
It has just agreed a six - month ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza ; it is deep into indirect peace talks with Syria , aimed at a comprehensive treaty ; and earlier this month came word that Israel is keen to have direct negotiations with Lebanon .
Yet all these welcome murmurings of peace are fighting to be heard above a growing drumbeat for war - against the country Israel fears more than any of its immediate neighbours : Iran .
Last week it emerged that no fewer than a hundred Israeli fighter planes had taken part in an exercise in the Mediterranean that looked uncannily like a practice run for an attack on Iran .
Earlier the former defence minister Shaul Mofaz , who still sits in Israel 's security cabinet , announced that " attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable " .
And now , increasing the temperature another couple of degrees , comes the claim , reported in today 's Guardian , that the Syrian site bombed by Israel last September was in fact a joint nuclear venture between Syria , North Korea and Iran .
The defence analyst Shmuel Bar , who sits on Israel 's national security council , is unambiguous : " It is 100 % certain that the Iranians are on track towards a nuclear weapon and 100 % certain that no diplomatic pressure will prevent it . "
The Israelis believe this danger is more imminent than anyone else realises .
They estimate the Iranians will pass " the point of no return " no later than 2010 .
They are utterly dismissive of sanctions .
Bar asks what possible basket of carrots would persuade the Iranians to give up the benefits that would come from acquiring the bomb : " It would become the hegemon of the region , it would dictate oil prices , it would lead the Muslim world .
Against all that , what can you offer ? "
All this has apparently led Israel to conclude that it must act , alone if necessary .
It harbours no delusions that it could take out the Iranian nuclear programme from the sky , as it did when it bombed Iraq 's Osirak reactor in 1981 , but it reckons its airforce could do enough damage to " set back " the Iranian nuclear effort for a year or two or more .
What to make of all this warlike talk ?
The simplest option is to take it at face value , to conclude that Israel is indeed going to act and is preparing the ground , militarily and politically .
It wants its planes ready and also its arguments , so that if action is timetabled for " summer - fall 2008 " as one Israeli analyst wrote this week , then it has at least made some effort to brace world opinion for the shock .
This view - that Israel might really mean it - rests on understanding what , for Israel 's policymakers and public alike , are a series of givens .
First , even though no one doubts that Israel itself is a nuclear power , it still carries a mortal fear of even a single Iranian bomb .
That 's because it believes the old cold war rules of nuclear balance and mutually assured destruction do n't necessarily apply in its neighbourhood .
Israelis recall the words of the former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani , who in 2001 declared that " the use of a single atomic bomb has the power to destroy Israel completely , while it will only cause partial damage to the Islamic world " .
They took that to mean that Iran is big enough to withstand a nuke , while Israel is so small it would be wiped out with just one bomb .
What 's more , Israelis worry that a regime with a strong doctrinal belief in martyrdom might not fear national suicide the way that , say , the Soviet Union once did .
It does not help that Iran 's current president regularly conjures up the threat of annihilation .
There was some dispute over the precise meaning of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's notorious warning that Israel would be wiped off the map , but , as if to avoid any confusion , he repeated the threat earlier this month when he proclaimed that Israel " is about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene " .
In seminar rooms in London or Paris , it 's easy to hear all this as mere metaphor , not to be taken seriously .
But Israelis hear it differently .
" We have a Holocaust complex , " says David Landau , the former editor of Ha'aretz .
Having faced a real attempt at total eradication in living memory it 's quite understandable , he says , if Jews feel especially anxious when a sworn enemy starts threatening obliteration .
Nor does it help that the Iranian president targets this most neuralgic spot , repeatedly questioning the historic truth of the Holocaust .
The result is that Israelis do not assess risk and probability like other states .
It may not be an iron certainty that Iran wants to acquire a nuclear bomb that it will then hold over Israel 's head - but if there is so much as a risk , says Landau , that is too much to live with .
After 2003 , those watching from afar become sceptical when they hear doomsday talk of weapons of mass destruction - especially after December 's US national intelligence estimate said the Iranian nuclear quest had been on hold for four years .
Indeed , western intelligence agencies are said to be wary of sounding the alarm these days , chastened by their Iraq error .
But the experience that haunts Israeli intelligence was the opposite , its underestimate of the threat in 1973 that led to the Yom Kippur war .
It 's underplaying a danger , not overplaying it , that Israel 's military establishment now seeks to avoid .
There is an alternative way to read the current situation .
It would see all the latest , apparently bellicose , moves as goads by the Israelis to spur the rest of the world into action : " Act now , " they are saying , " because if you do n't , we might just do something crazy . "
That warning is surely worth taking seriously , if only because the consequences of military action against Iran are awful to contemplate .
Iran would unleash a fierce retaliation , with American soldiers in next - door Iraq the first target .
Tehran could choke the world 's oil supply through the Gulf , then use its enormous influence not only to destabilise Iraq but to dispatch its proxies around the world on a campaign of attacks on civilian targets , with Hamas and Hizbullah forming the first wave .
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog , Mohammed ElBaradei , has warned that a military strike would turn the region into a " ball of fire " .
A world anxious to avoid that outcome either has to bet that , when it comes to it , Israel will duck confrontation and learn to live with a nuclear Iran - or it must find another way to prevent Tehran getting a bomb .
Despite Israel 's avowed scepticism , that can only mean diplomacy and the sanctions process .
One British official admits that the current effort is " only scratching the surface " .
The west has shut off access to the dollar , the pound and the euro - but it barely hurts the Iranians , who are awash in cash thanks to the soaring price of oil .
What 's needed are sharper sticks and juicier carrots , including tolerance for an Iranian role in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan .
The current western posture - no talks until Iran suspends its nuclear effort - surely cannot hold : Iran loses nothing by carrying on its quest .
Tehran is not yet being forced to make a tough choice .
It has to and soon - before Israel makes an even tougher one .

Police will have powers to frisk people they suspect of carrying lasers and those without reason to have them - such as educators , architects or astronomers - will be fined up to $ 5000 .
NSW Premier Morris Iemma said today the Government would ban the most powerful laser pointers and make it a summary offence to carry any laser pointer without a lawful reason .
Class three and four laser pointers will be declared prohibited weapons and carrying them could attract a maximum penalty of 14 years ' jail , he said .

Risk and Culture
The Second National Risk and Culture Study , conducted by the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School .
Abstract : Cultural Cognition refers to the disposition to conform one ’s beliefs about societal risks to one ’s preferences for how society should be organized .
Based on surveys and experiments involving some 5,000 Americans , the Second National Risk and Culture Study presents empirical evidence of the effect of this dynamic in generating conflict about global warming , school shootings , domestic terrorism , nanotechnology , and the mandatory vaccination of school - age girls against HPV , among other issues .
The Study also presents evidence of risk - communication strategies that counteract cultural cognition .
Because nuclear power affirms rather than threatens the identity of persons who hold individualist values , for example , proposing it as a solution to global warming makes persons who hold such values more willing to consider evidence that climate change is a serious risk .
Because people tend to impute credibility to people who share their values , persons who hold hierarchical and egalitarian values are less likely to polarize when they observe people who hold their values advocating unexpected positions on the vaccination of young girls against HPV .
Such techniques can help society to create a deliberative climate in which citizens converge on policies that are both instrumentally sound and expressively congenial to persons of diverse values .
And from the conclusion :
Conclusion :
There is a culture war in America , but it is about facts , not values .
There is very little evidence that most Americans care nearly as much about issues that symbolize competing cultural values as they do about the economy , national security , and the safety and health of themselves and their loved ones .
There is ample evidence , however , that Americans are sharply divided along cultural lines about what sorts of conditions endanger these interests and what sorts of policies effectively counteract such risks .
Findings from the Second National Culture and Risk Study help to show why .
Psychologically speaking , it ’s much easier to believe that conduct one finds dishonorable or offensive is dangerous , and conduct one finds noble or admirable is socially beneficial , than vice versa .
People are also much more inclined to accept information about risk and danger when it comes from someone who shares their values than when it comes from someone who holds opposing commitments .

It 's only been a couple years since Kyle MacDonald first made headlines bartering his way from a red paper clip to a house , and he 's already eager to swap his dwelling for something else .
The 28 - year - old public speaker and author announced Tuesday that he 's accepting offers for his two - story , full - furnished farmhouse ( right ) , which is located in
Saskatchewan , Canada .
" I did n't really think [ a plan ] through when we got the house , and there 's a huge opportunity there ....
So I 'm looking to trade with someone who has an idea for it , " said MacDonald by phone Tuesday .
Beginning in 2005 , MacDonald masterminded the chain of trades – which included a movie role , a snowmobile and an afternoon with heavy metal rocker Alice
Cooper – that led to the deed for his humble abode in rural Canada .
MacDonald and his wife , Dominique Dupuis , rarely spend time in the house due to her work obligations in Montreal .
MacDonald said he was hoping to trade the house to a local , who would build a business and maintain the site as a landmark and tourist destination in the small town .
MacDonald said another big motivating factor behind the move was that he was eager to pick back up where he left off .
" I wanted to start trading again , we were stagnant on that front , " he said .
MacDonald plans to accept offers until July 11 and finalize a deal the following week .
So far , he 's gotten one proposal : a red paper clip .
" They did n't say how big it was , " MacDonald said .
" But maybe I 'd take it . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks fell on Friday as the price of oil set another record and concerns about the financial sector flared up again after American International Group Inc AIG .
N reported a massive loss .
AIG ’s dismal results raised doubts that the end of the credit crisis was near .
The world ’s largest insurer wrote down assets linked to subprime mortgages and said it would need to raise $ 12.5 billion to boost its balance sheet .
Its shares fell almost 9 percent .
Oil rose above $ 126 a barrel , spurring concerns about inflation and that consumers will pare back their spending as higher prices at the pump cut into their discretionary income .
Pharmaceutical companies added to the gloomy picture .
Mylan Inc MYL.N posted a wider loss , while Bristol Myers Squibb Co BMY .N fell on the threat of generic competition in Europe for its top - selling blood thinner .
“ There does n’t seem to be any stopping the price of oil , it hits a record every day , and investors are starting to realize there ’s not going to be a quick fix to this problem , ” said Bucky Hellwig , senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management , in Birmingham , Alabama .
“ Also , we ’re seeing the spiral playing out of declining home prices making financials ’ underlying collateral worth less .
At best , financials will have to keep issuing new capital , which dilutes existing shares , so down the shares go . ”
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.90 points , or 0.94 percent , to close at 12,745.88 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index shed 9.40 points , or 0.67 percent , to end at 1,388.28 , while the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 5.72 points , or 0.23 percent , to 2,445.52 .
For the week , all three indexes ended lower : The Dow lost 2.4 percent , the S&P 500 slid 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq tumbled 1.3 percent .
Another big financial company , Citigroup Inc C.N , said it intends to shed roughly $ 400 billion of non-core assets in a bid to become more competitive .

Citi ’s shares fell 2.8 percent to $ 23.63 , while AIG shares slid 8.8 percent to $ 40.28 .
AIG was the heaviest weight on both the Dow and the S&P 500 .
The Nasdaq fell less than the other indexes .
Its losses were kept in check by a stronger - than - expected profit from video game maker Activision Inc ATVI.O and upbeat broker comments on graphics company Nvidia Corp NVDA.O. Activision shares jumped 14.2 percent to $ 31.64 , while Nvidia 's stock gained 2.6 percent to $ 22.53 .
Despite the rise in oil , Exxon Mobil XOM.N was among the top drags on the S&P 500 and the Dow .
Analysts said investors may be locking in profits after strong gains in recent weeks .
Others noted that when the price of oil reaches a certain level , it becomes more difficult for energy companies to pass on their higher input costs to consumers .
U.S. crude oil futures hit a record $ 126.25 a barrel in post - settlement trading , before pulling back somewhat to $ 126.17 .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , June crude settled at $ 125.96 a barrel , up $ 2.27 .
Shares of Exxon Mobil XOM .N fell 0.8 percent to $ 88.82 on the NYSE .
EOG Resources EOG.N shed 0.9 percent to $ 138.50 .
Mylan stock sank 8.4 percent to $ 11.42 , while Bristol Myers stock declined 4.7 percent to $ 21.71 .
A record drop in U.S. imports because of slowing domestic demand took a big bite out of the U.S. trade deficit in March despite record high oil prices .
The trade gap shrank 5.7 percent in March to $ 58.2 billion , the Commerce Department reported ; that figure was much smaller than expected .
Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange , where about 1.10 billion shares changed hands , below last year ’s estimated daily average .
On the Nasdaq , about 1.71 billion shares traded , below last year ’s daily average of 2.17 billion .
Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 8 to 7 , while on the Nasdaq , about seven stocks fell for every six that rose .
Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich ’s single article of impeachment will get a committee hearing -- but not on removing President Bush from office .
The House on Tuesday voted 238 to 180 to send his impeachment article -- for Bush ’s reasoning in taking the country to war in Iraq -- to the Judiciary Committee , which buried Kucinich ’s previous 35 - article effort in June .
This time , the panel will open hearings , possibly as soon as next week .
But House Democratic leaders said the proceedings would not be about Bush ’s impeachment , a first step in the Constitution ’s process of a removing a president from office .
Instead , the panel will conduct an election - year review -- possibly televised -- of anything Democrats consider to be Bush ’s abuse of power .
Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat , is likely to testify .
So will several scholars and administration critics , Democrats said .

The hearing is a modest gesture by House Democratic leaders to members like Kucinich who insist that Bush ’s reasons for going to war meet the standard for impeachment .
Kucinich had said that if his impeachment article was tabled he would simply propose another one .
In June , he spent four hours on the House floor reading his longer resolution into the record , only to see it buried in committee .
A 10 - year - old Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli gunfire following clashes between troops and protesters demonstrating against the West Bank barrier yesterday .
The Israeli military said it would mount an investigation into the shooting of Ahmed Moussa , which comes just three weeks after an Israeli soldier was captured on video firing at close range a baton round at a Palestinian man who was blindfolded and cuffed .
The incidents occurred in the village of Ni'ilin , near Ramallah , where Palestinian and international protesters regularly rally to demonstrate against the barrier - which cuts the community off from its farmland and protects the Jewish settlements built illegally , according to international law , inside the West Bank .
Protests often turn violent when stone - throwing youths are confronted by Israeli soldiers firing teargas and ammunition .
Scores of Palestinians and troops have been injured over the past few months .
According to witnesses , soldiers fired tear gas and live bullets at the protesters trying to scale a temporary fence , erected to stop them reaching the bulldozers used to clear land to build the barrier .
Others said baton rounds had been used .
One regular demonstrator , Jonathon Pollock , said that 18 people were injured .
" We were trying to get to the barrier like we do every time .
I personally saw soldiers and border policemen using live ammunition , " said Pollock .
By late afternoon yesterday , most of the protesters had dispersed and the violence had subsided , although several youths remained in the area near the village entrance and continued throwing stones , according to some witnesses .
When Israeli soldiers again shot at the youths , Moussa was hit in the forehead .
Israel 's military said it would conduct a " thorough examination with the forces in the region " .
It added the incident was " grave " and that it would consult Palestinian medical personnel .
But it also said it was also examining the possibility that Moussa was killed by Palestinian shooting .
Mohammed Nafa , one of the demonstrators , said he and others carried the boy to an ambulance , cupping his head with a baseball cap .
At a hospital in the nearby town of Ramallah , the boy 's family waited at the morgue .
A paramedic who had driven the body sat on stairs and wept .
" We told him not to go down [ to the protests ] , but he would n't listen , " the boy 's aunt Khadija Moussa , told the Associated Press .
A border police officer was also wounded during the protest when a stone struck his eye .
The escalation in violence came as an Israeli commander , Lieutenant Colonel Omri Bruberg , who leads the battalion operating around Ni'ilin , was suspended for 10 days until military investigators decide whether there is enough evidence to indict him .
Bruberg is under investigation for his alleged role in the close - range shooting of a 27 - year - old Palestinian man , Ashraf Abu - Rahma in the foot this month .
The incident was recorded by a 17 - year - old girl from the village and shows Omri holding him by the arm while another soldier , a metre away , fires at the 27 - year - old Palestinian 's foot .
Abu - Rahma had been protesting at the barrier in Ni'ilin when he was later detained , blindfolded and handcuffed by the army , which then imposed a four - day curfew on the town of Ni'ilin .
The army launched its investigation into the shooting of Abu - Rahma after an Israeli human rights group , B'Tselem released the video of the incident .
It was the latest incident in which a video footage had been used to expose violence against Palestinians in the West Bank .
Although filmed on a privately owned camera , B'Tselem has handed out about 100 video cameras to Palestinians to film human rights abuses by the Israeli army and settlers .
Bruberg was suspended yesterday after failing his second polygraph test , conducted by the military police after he passed an earlier test conducted last week by a private institute .
The soldier who fired the gun and was held in custody says he was following Bruberg 's orders .
But Bruberg told military investigators he only told the soldier to shake his rifle to frighten Abu - Rahma .
B'Tselem filed a second complaint against the commander yesterday , alleging that he kicked and trod on the hands of another Palestinian demonstrator two weeks ago .
The UN 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs says seven Palestinians and one international have been injured by rubber - coated metal bullets fired by the army during protests in Ni'ilin over the past two weeks .

We originally spelled Ni'ilin as Naalin .
This has been corrected .
An off - duty LAPD Officer was shot early this morning around 12:30 a.m. by Long Beach Police responding to a " person with a gun " call .
Few details about what led officers to shoot have come out so far as Long Beach officials are only saying that when officers contacted the suspect , the shooting occurred .
26 - year - old Officer Jason Geggie , a one and a half year veteran of the force assigned to the Central Traffic Division , was booked for exhibiting a firearm in a threatening manner both in the presence of police and the public .
Geggie was sent to a hospital in stable condition with a shot in the arm and torso area .
The LAPD is conducting an Internal Affairs personnel investigation and the Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Office is also conducting an independent investigation , which is routine for all " hit " officer involved shootings in Los Angeles County .

Anyone anticipating something new from id Software might find their next title to be a little surprising .
It is n't a flashy first - person shooter that requiring upgrades of several hardware components to see it in all its graphical glory .
Instead , it 's Quake Live , a free - to - play remake of Quake III Arena , a title almost 10 years old .
This new version will feature slightly updated graphics and a few other tweaks , but the biggest difference is it 'll be launched from a web browser and feature in - game advertising .
Currently the game 's still in a closed beta testing phase though that should soon change .
According to id co-founder John Carmack ( DOOM , Wolfenstein 3D , Quake ) , the title represents a departure and risk for the company .
In an interview with IGN , Carmack expanded on id's philosophy behind bringing Quake Live to the public .
" When we had made the decision at id Software to start growing into a multi- team company whereas historically we had always been one project at a time , one of my other thoughts on this project was that we'd be able to take a small team and start this less demanding project rather than start off with immediately another triple - A title that needs 50 to 80 people or whatever .
A small team could be used on this and grow a kernel that if necessary we could build a larger team around and what happens with that is going to depend a lot on the commercial success of this .
If Quake Live is a good success then it's going to be one of those service model businesses where an active team stays on it forever as long as it's generating any revenue .
If it turns out that we called it wrong and there is no business case here then we 'll have a tested team that we can add more people around to do a more conventional project .
We do have high hopes that this can turn out to be a good business model for us .
" Carmack continued on to expand on the potential risks of developing a game like this .
" There certainly is the worry about the old tale about the pioneers , the one with all the arrows in his back and the people that come afterward and see all the pitfalls to avoid .
We do think that it's at least plausible , there are a lot of online services obviously that are doing well with whatever media types that they 're presenting .
There are a lot of free games that are doing quite well and some very impressive numbers in the casual gaming market .
[ Quake Live ] is obviously not a Flash game or a Java game , it was a state of the art game previously and it has the full features of the development house behind it , but it's an interesting question and we 'll find out hopefully within six months or so the verdict will be in from the jury about whether this is something that works out or not , but I can't say that we 've got a lot of things to look at .
In fact I would assume a whole lot of people would be looking at what we 're doing .
" While the game 's free - to - play , it will feature in - game advertisements .
id Software Executive Producer Marty Stratton was also in on the interview and provided some insight into how the advertising system will work .
" With the game being completely delivered and the interface being in a web browser we have all of the tools you would normally have to deliver ad content through the web browser and our advantage and where we 're really trying to tie those pieces together is in how we link those together for advertisers .
Running promotions on the site that get people to maybe use a sponsored game character , game skin within a game playing for leaderboards where they win something from the advertiser or unlock something that 's advertiser - produced .
And that 's something that advertisers are interested in .
They 've got their media buys , they 've got their web buys , this is a way for them to interact with what we hope is an incredibly large group of consumers in a way that is far more interactive and allows for a greater conversation than just ' there 's a web ad .
'" Carmack jumped in after Stratton to give his own perspective on the subject .
" It 's worth noting that I 've never been a big supporter of in - game advertising in conventional games because I definitely do feel that if you 're playing 50 to 60 bucks for a game , throwing advertising in on top of it is … there 's a justifiable reason for some people to be upset about that .
Quake Arena was always much more of a sporting arena combat sort of thing where integrating advertising directly into the game does n't even feel like a tacky bolt - on .
In fact what we 've done with Quake Live is all of the original levels have been passed over and brought up to a modern level of polish where eight or nine years ago when Quake Arena would have been out , the state of the industry accepted a lot of things like mismatched texture seams and things that just were n't quite up to the level of attention to detail that we follow now .
All the levels have had a pass through them bringing the attention to detail to modern standards without changing anything fundamentally in the graphics engine , just touching up all the data .
They 've also then been modified so that all the levels have billboard type things in them which are nicely integrated with spotlight lighting and so on in there where we can stream in - game ads as well as of course things that happen on the scoreboard and when you die and so on .
It 's a perfect fit for this type of thing because it's not a matter of taking some game we just happened to have around and throwing up ads that you can't skip in between every level or something like that , it fits well with the original tone of the game .
" We asked whether there 'll be any sort of pricing tier that allows players to turn the ads off .
" No , there 's no current plan for that .
Not to say it could n't happen depending on how the market bears out on it .
Actually , turning the ads off right now would make the whole thing look worse .
They really are integrated in such a way that they 're not obtrusive , you 're not waiting for any of the ads .
It 's not like stuff on website where it's like ' watch this ad ' or subscribe or whatever like that where you 're actively frustrated with it .
" Stratton described a few issues that might occur if users were able to shut off ads .
" If we have an advertiser that wants to sponsor a leaderboard over a four week period and on a weekly basis we award prizes or some unlock or some cool content … because somebody has chosen to opt out of advertising do we then not allow them to see that leaderboard ?
Or if an advertiser reskins a character to be like team whatever the advertiser 's name is , and it's a really cool skin that a lot of people would like , and we put a picture of that up on the front page and say ' new skin available , check it out here , brought to you by so and so , ' is that an ad ?
Is that great additional content that players will dig ? "
The 189,000 teenagers not in education , employment or training
Almost one in ten youths aged 16 to 18 are classed as ' Neet ' - ' Not in education , education or training '
Almost 200,000 teenage drifters are living on benefits after dropping out of work and education , official figures revealed .
Almost one in ten youths aged 16 to 18 is classed as ' Neet ' - ' Not in education , employment , or training ' - despite billions of pounds being spent on welfare - to - work schemes .
Numbers were down slightly on last year , but up nearly 30,000 on 1997 - the year Labour came to power .
Business leaders branded the figures ' extremely worrying ' and accused ministers of failing to equip school leavers with the skills and attitudes needed for work .
Ministers were also warned that the economic slowdown could cause Neet numbers to rise further in future .
Studies have suggested that each Neet costs the taxpayer an average of £ 97,000 during their lifetime .
The high cost is a combination of unemployment benefits , handouts to mothers , the costs of clearing up crime and their failure to contribute to society in the form of taxes .
Some 189,000 school leavers - or 9.4 per cent - were registered Neet in 2007 , against 161,000 or 8.9 per cent in 1997 , according to yesterday 's figures from the Department for Children , Schools and Families .
Young men were more likely than women to be left behind , with 104,000 in the Neet category .
The statistics also showed that 22.9 per cent of boys aged 16 to 18 - compared to 19.6 per cent of girls - are in jobs , but not in any form of education or training , although they may be in jobs .
Labour is estimated to have spent £ 3 billion since 1997 on the flagship New Deal scheme , where businesses are paid to take on unemployed workers as a way of getting them back into the jobs market .
But many jobless have simply drifted from scheme to scheme .
In a direct appeal to school leavers , Education Maintenance Allowances were introduced at a cost of £ 500 million a year .
These are weekly payments into students ' bank accounts if they agree to stay on at school or college after 16 , but critics have claimed the cash is too often spent on socialising .
Labour has now drawn up legislation which will raise the education or training leaving age from 16 to 18 from 2015 .
Tory universities and skills spokesman David Willetts said yesterday : ' The Government 's initiatives , from the New Deal to new apprenticeships , are just not working . '
Liberal Democrat schools spokesman David Laws said : ' Given that the number of Neets has actually gone up since 1997 , ministers cannot take any pride in these figures .
' One of the Government 's early pledges was to reduce the number of Neets .
They have clearly failed to do so .
' With the economy slowing , there is a real risk that this category is going to further increase in size . '
David Frost , director - general of the British Chambers of Commerce , said : ' Whilst the overall increase in participation is good news , it remains extremely worrying that despite over half a million vacancies in our economy , there are still so many young British people not in employment , education or training . '
He added : ' The Government is failing our youth by not providing them with the essential skills and attitude required to become productive members of society , as well as British business , who struggle to find a suitably skilled and engaged workforce . '
Schools Secretary Ed Balls said ' good progress ' is being made ahead of Government reforms to raise the leaving age .
' It is really encouraging news that the number of young people who are not in employment , education or training has fallen again , ' he added .
' By 2015 , all young people will stay in education or training until they are at least 18 . '

Photos ' Human flesh search engine : ' an Internet lynching ?
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2008-07-04 17:36
A woman puts the small kitten on the ground and later steps on it with her high - heeled shoes and kills the cat . [ file ]
BEIJING --
Behave yourself in China , or you may find yourself up before a kangaroo court of angry netizens and receive a virtual lynching .
Those whose behavior is deemed wanting by enraged netizens have found their name , birthday , mobile phone number and home address researched and exposed , available for 160 million netizens who might drop you a surprising call .
When farmer Zhou Zhenglong finished faking his South China tiger photo , he never expected that netizens would find the old Lunar New Year commemorative poster he lifted the original picture from just 35 days later and expose him .
After a long drawn out saga , the authorities finally came clean and admitted that the picture was a fake .
Zhou was arrested .
" In finding out truth of the ' paper tiger ' event , our Renrou search engine played an important role , " said an Internet staffer nicknamed Yule on the Mop entertainment website .
Renrou literally means human flesh , and ' Renrou search engine ' , the ' human flesh search engine ' is not the search engine familiar from Baidu and Google , but the idea of a search engine employing thousands of individuals all mobilized with one aim , to dig out facts and expose them to the baleful glare of publicity .
To do this they use the Internet and conventional search engines .
The model has some similarities with Wikipedia and Baidu Knowledge , which both attract 10 million clicks every day , and which pool answers from netizens to a question .
By its narrow meaning , Renrou search started in 2001 , when a netizen posted the photo on Mop of a girl , saying she was his girlfriend .
Some others soon found out that the beauty turned out to be Microsoft 's model Chen Ziyao and publicized her personal information as proof that he was lying .
The term became a catchword in 2006 , when in February , video of a woman stabbing a kitten in the eyes with her high heels and crushing its head stirred rage of netizens .
People analyzed the background of the video , and someone soon located the place as in a county of northeastern Heilongjiang Province .
Less than a week later , information about the woman , including her real name -- Wang Jue , a 41 - year - old nurse , and the fact that she divorced was dug out .
Wang was later suspended from her job .

The problem with the ABC News article entitled “ Will GPS Make Us Dumb ? ” is that it makes a false juxtaposition : map - reading skills with navigation devices ’ turn - by - turn directions :
“ One effect of an increased dependence on GPS will be that peoples ’ ability to read maps will further decay , ” [ Middlebury College geography professor Anne ] Knowles said .
“ Americans are generally poor map readers .
Some cannot read maps at all because it ’s not part of our education .
“ But what will grow , instead , will be better geographic imagination and awareness .
People will see the connections between places more clearly — not quite as accurately — but will better imagine how to get from one place to another because of this technology . ”
People have been giving one another directions — verbally , written out turn - by - turn , or in crude hand - drawn maps — for approximately forever ; a GPS navigation system is not exactly a new paradigm .
It simply allows for geographical awareness without cartographic literacy — in that sense , the analogy with spell - checking is apt , but not in the way that the article ’s author expects : spell - checking does n’t make you less literate ; it removes the requirement for you to be more literate .
Ditto here : GPS is n’t making us dumb ; it ’s making it easier for us to stay dumb .

For the past week or so I ’ve been working on an embedded domain - specific language for rendering simple diagrams with Haskell , and I ’m excited to actually release version 0.1 today !
You can now find it on Hackage .
Version 0.1 is still fairly primitive , and there are a bunch more planned features , but you can already use it to create some pretty pictures .
Here are a few examples .
We ’ll start with a basic ‘ hello world ’ type diagram : a two - by - five rectangle , no frills :
module Main where import Graphics .
Rendering .
Diagrams main = renderToPng " hello.png " 100 100 ( rect 2 5 )
OK , not too exciting , but at least it was easy .
Here ’s another silly example that shows off a few more available features :
module Main where import Graphics .
Rendering .
Diagrams shapes :: Diagram shapes = hcat [ fc blue $ circle 10 , ( fc goldenrod .
lc green . lw 3 $ poly 5 10 ) ## ( fc red . rotate ( 1/10 ) $ rect 4 4 ) , fc grey .
lw 0 . scaleY 3 $ circle 5 ] main = renderToPng " shapes.png " 200 200 shapes
Hopefully , this example is fairly self - explanatory .
We can alter the appearance of diagrams by applying functions to them like fc ( fill color ) , lc ( line color ) , lw ( line width ) , rotate , and scaleY .
We can superimpose two diagrams with ## .
And we can lay out a list of diagrams horizontally with hcat .
There are many other combinators along similar lines , with various options for distributing and aligning subdiagrams .
Now for a couple cooler examples .
How about a Sierpinski triangle ?
module Main where import Graphics .
Rendering .
Diagrams import Graphics .
Rendering .Diagrams .
Types import qualified Graphics .
Rendering .Cairo as C import Graphics .
Rendering .Diagrams .
Shapes ( draw ) data EqTri = EqTri deriving Show instance ShapeClass EqTri where shapeSize _ = ( 2 , sqrt 3 ) renderShape _ = do c $ C.moveTo 1 s c $ C.lineTo 0 ( - s ) c $ C.lineTo ( - 1 ) s c $ C.closePath draw where s = sqrt 3 / 2 sierpinski :: Int ->
Diagram sierpinski 0 = fc black $ lw 0 $ shape EqTri sierpinski n = vcatA hcenter [ s , s <> s ] where s = sierpinski ( n - 1 ) main = renderToPng " sierpinski.png " 300 300 ( sierpinski 6 )
This example illustrates a couple key points .
One is that the library is easy to extend with new shapes .
The built - in poly function is too general to provide a nice equilateral triangle for use in making a sierpinski triangle ( its bounding box is too large , which would lead to ugly spaces in the diagram ) , so we can define our own shape just by making an instance of ShapeClass , and using the Cairo library to draw a path defining the shape .
This is probably not the best way to accomplish this particular task — future versions of the diagrams library will include easier ways — but it ’s a nice example of how easy it is to extend the basic library functionality .
The other key point is how much power we get for free from the fact that this is an embedded DSL .
We can use the full power of Haskell to define a recursive function for computing sierpinski triangle diagrams .
For a final example , here are some nice Ford circles :
module Main where import Graphics .
Rendering .Diagrams import Data.Ratio import System .Random ( <+> ) :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational r1 <+> r2 = ( numerator r1 + numerator r2 ) % ( denominator r1 + denominator r2 ) farey :: Integer -> [ Rational ] farey 0 = [ 0 %1 , 1%1 ] farey n = insertMediants ( farey ( n - 1 ) ) insertMediants :: [ Rational ] -> [ Rational ] insertMediants [ ] = [ ] insertMediants [ x ] = [ x ] insertMediants ( x:y:zs ) = x : ( x <+> y ) : insertMediants ( y:zs ) fordCircles :: Integer -> [ Diagram ] fordCircles n = map toCircle ( filter ( ( <= n ) . denominator ) $ farey n) toCircle r = translateX r' $ circle ( 1 / ( 2 * d ' ^2 ) ) where r' = fromRational r d' = fromIntegral ( denominator r ) dia :: [ Color ] ->
Diagram dia colors = view ( 0 , - 1/2 ) ( 1,0 ) $ unionA hcenter bottom $ zipWith fc colors ( fordCircles 20 ) randomColors :: [ Double ] -> [ Color ] randomColors ( r:g : b:ds ) = rgb r g b : randomColors ds main :: IO ( ) main = do g <- newStdGen let rs = randoms g renderToPng " ford.png " 400 205 ( dia $ randomColors rs )
Plans for future versions of the library include :
text objects
settable backgrounds and better support for transparency
support for line join style and dashing
more primitive shapes : special triangles , ellipses , bezier curves , lines , arrows …
more layouts : grid , tree , circle …
constraint - based placement of objects , e.g. to connect diagrams with arrows
more output modes : ps , svg , pdf
and more !
If this looks interesting to you , I hope you ’ll download the library and play around with it !
( Note that it does require the Cairo bindings , which are packaged as part of gtk2hs , which is unfortunately not yet Cabalized . )
I would be happy to receive any and all feedback , including feature suggestions , bug reports , and pretty pictures .

We ’ve all heard the theory — a chemical imbalance in your brain causes depression .
Although researchers have known for years this not to be the case , some drug companies continue to repeat this simplistic and misleading claim in their marketing and advertising materials .
Why the FTC or some other federal agency does n’t crack down on this intentional misleading information is beyond me .
Most researchers now believe depression is not caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain .
How did we come to this conclusion ?
Through years of additional research .
But now some are jumping on the next brain bandwagon of belief — that depression is caused by a problem in the brain neuronal network .
Jonah Leher makes the case in today ’s Boston Globe :
In recent years , scientists have developed a novel theory of what falters in the depressed brain .
Instead of seeing the disease as the result of a chemical imbalance , these researchers argue that the brain ’s cells are shrinking and dying .
This theory has gained momentum in the past few months , with the publication of several high profile scientific papers .
The effectiveness of Prozac , these scientists say , has little to do with the amount of serotonin in the brain .
Rather , the drug works because it helps heal our neurons , allowing them to grow and thrive again .
Okay , I ’m game …
But Leher fails to bring any sort of balance to his article .
It ’s another love letter to the brain scientists studying in this field , but ignores the decades ’ worth of research showing that non-medical treatments are also effective in treating depression .
Like , you know , psychotherapy .
The obvious answer is that psychotherapy also helps in some way to help “ heal our neurons . ”
Which begs the question — if healing our neurons is key , there are likely dozens of possible ways to do so .
Why only focus and mention the medical cures ?
Because of Leher ’s deification of the power of medicine :
The progress exemplifies an important feature of modern medicine , which is the transition from a symptom - based understanding of a disease – depression is an illness of unrelenting sadness – to a more detailed biological understanding , in which the disease is categorized and treated based on its specific anatomical underpinnings .
This would be true if mental disorders were pure medical diseases .
But they are not and have never been .
They are human constructs of aberrant behavior or emotions .
They are by no means universal ( although some of the big ones , like depression , can be found in most human societies ) .
This new scientific understanding of depression also offers a new way to think about the role of drugs in recovery .
While antidepressants help brain cells recover their vigor and form new connections , Castren says that patients must still work to cement these connections in place , perhaps with therapy .
He compares antidepressants with anabolic steroids , which increase muscle mass only when subjects also go to the gym .
Yeah , because that ’s how all medical treatments work , right ?
You need some encouragement for a drug to take effect ?
This is nonsense .
Drugs either work or do not , they do not need to be “ cemented ” to the brain through therapy .
It also contradicts all of the extensive body of research that shows psychotherapy that works for depression without any drug whatsoever .
What magical process occurs simply through talking with another human being that can change the very structure of your brain ’s neuro networks ?
Perhaps one day science will tell us .
But these love letters in the media to neuroscientists have got to stop .
Neuroscience will one day provide us the “ keys to the kingdom ” of understanding our brains .
But until studies are done on humans ( most of the studies Leher cites in his article — but fails to mention but once — are done on rats , not humans ; a rat ’s brains and a rat ’s “ depression ” may be nothing like ours ) , we should approach this most recent theory with a healthy dose of skepticism .
Many researchers staked their professional careers and reputation on the theory that a “ serotonin imbalance in the brain ” caused depression .
This was incorrect .
This may also be the case of this latest fad brain theory to see the light of day and in another decade , may also be proven to be equally untrue .
Until then , folks ( especially the media ) should keep a healthy skepticism about rat brain studies and new brain theories on depression .
And ensure they account for or have a reasonable explanation for the effectiveness of psychotherapies such as cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) for depression .

Another Brain Fad for Depression ?
Witnesses told police Mr Walendowski appeared to have been drinking
A 56 - year - old man from the Midwestern US state of Wisconsin has been arrested after shooting his lawn mower in his garden because it would not start .
Keith Walendowski was charged by police in Milwaukee with disorderly conduct and possession of a sawn - off shotgun .
He could face a fine of up to $ 11,000 and a maximum prison sentence of six - and - a- half years if convicted .
Police officers said Mr Walendowski had told them : " It 's my lawn mower and my yard , so I can shoot it if I want . "
Police found the shotgun , a handgun and a stungun , as well as ammunition , when they detained Mr Walendowski in the basement of his house .
Witnesses told police that he appeared to have been drinking .
The lawn mower was found sitting outside Mr Walendowski's house , which he shares with his mother , with the rubbish on Friday .
A local retailer said that Mr Walendowski might now have difficulty getting his lawn mower repaired .
" Anything not factory recommended would void the warranty , " said Dick Wagner , of Wagner 's Garden Mart in Milwaukee .

Vincent Bugliosi ’s testimony during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power discussing Stephen Presser ’s testimony that Clinton lying about sex is comparable to lying a country into war , and on whether Saddam was actually a threat to the US since we were trying to provoke him into attacking us .
Responding to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , Vincent Bugliosi shows evidence of the administration lying about WMD and has Steve King looking like his head is going to explode trying to get him to stop during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power .
He makes the point very well that a country having WMD ’s is not a reason to go to war , but instead whether a country is an eminent threat , and that the CIA said that even if he had WMD , Saddam would not have been a threat to the US .

THERE is a story about a science professor giving a public lecture on the solar system .
An elderly lady interrupts to claim that , contrary to his assertions about gravity , the world travels through the universe on the back of a giant turtle .
“ But what supports the turtle ? ” retorts the professor .
“ You can't trick me , ” says the woman .
“ It 's turtles all the way down . ”
The American financial system has started to look as logical as “ turtles all the way down ” this week .
Only six months ago , politicians were counting on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the country 's mortgage giants , to bolster the housing market by buying more mortgages .
Now the rescuers themselves have needed rescuing .
After a headlong plunge in the two firms ' share prices ( see chart 1 ) , Hank Paulson , the treasury secretary , felt obliged to make an emergency announcement on July 13th .
He will seek Congress 's approval for extending the Treasury 's credit lines to the pair and even buying their shares if necessary .
Separately , the Federal Reserve said Fannie and Freddie could get financing at its discount window , a privilege previously available only to banks .
The absurdity of this situation was highlighted by the way the discount window works .
The Fed does not just accept any old assets as collateral ; it wants assets that are “ safe ” .
As well as Treasury bonds , it is willing to accept paper issued by “ government - sponsored enterprises ” ( GSEs ) .
But the two most prominent GSEs are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In theory , therefore , the two companies could issue their own debt and exchange it for loans from the government — the equivalent of having access to the printing press .
Absurd or not , the rescue package notched up one immediate success .
Freddie Mac was able to raise $ 3 billion in short - term finance on July 14th .
But the deal did little to help the share price of either company or indeed of banks , where sentiment was dented by the collapse of IndyMac , a mortgage lender ( see article ) .
The next day Moody's , a rating agency , downgraded both the financial strength and the preferred stock of Fannie and Freddie , making a capital - raising exercise look even more difficult .
As a sign of its concern , the Securities and Exchange Commission , America 's leading financial regulator , weighed in with rules restricting the short - selling of shares in Fannie and Freddie .
The whole affair has raised questions about the giant twins .
They were set up ( see article ) to provide liquidity for the housing market by buying mortgages from the banks .
They repackaged these loans and used them as collateral for bonds called mortgage - backed securities ; they guaranteed buyers of those securities against default .
This model was based on the ability of investors to see through one illusion and boosted by their willingness to believe in another .
The illusion that investors saw through was the official line that debt issued by Fannie and Freddie was not backed by the government .
No one believed this .
Investors felt that the government would not let Fannie and Freddie fail ; they have just been proved right .
The belief in the implicit government guarantee allowed the pair to borrow cheaply .
This made their model work .
They could earn more on the mortgages they bought than they paid to raise money in the markets .
Had Fannie and Freddie been hedge funds , this strategy would have been known as a “ carry trade ” .
It also allowed Fannie and Freddie to operate with tiny amounts of capital .
The two groups had core capital ( as defined by their regulator ) of $ 83.2 billion at the end of 2007 ( see chart 2 ) ; this supported around $ 5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees , a gearing ratio of 65 to one .
According to CreditSights , a research group , Fannie and Freddie were counterparties in $ 2.3 trillion - worth of derivative transactions , related to their hedging activities .
There is no way a private bank would be allowed to have such a highly geared balance sheet , nor would it qualify for the highest AAA credit rating .
In a speech to Congress in 2004 , Alan Greenspan , then the chairman of the Fed , said : “ Without the expectation of government support in a crisis , such leverage would not be possible without a significantly higher cost of debt . ”
The likelihood of “ extraordinary support ” from the government is cited by Standard & Poor 's ( S&P ) , a rating agency , in explaining its rating of the firms ' debt .
The illusion investors fell for was the idea that American house prices would not fall across the country .
This bolstered the twins ' creditworthiness .
Although the two organisations have suffered from regional busts in the past , house prices have not fallen nationally on an annual basis since Fannie was founded in 1938 .
Investors have got quite a bit of protection against a housing bust because of the type of deals that Fannie and Freddie guaranteed .
The duo focused on mortgages to borrowers with good credit scores and the wherewithal to put down a deposit .
This was not subprime lending .
Howard Shapiro , an analyst at Fox - Pitt , an investment bank , says the pair 's average loan - to - value ratio at the end of 2007 was 68 % ; in other words , they could survive a 30 % fall in house prices .
So far , declared losses on their core portfolios have indeed been small by the standards of many others ; in 2008 , they are likely to be between 0.1 % and 0.2 % of assets , according to S&P .
Of course , this strategy only raises another question .
Why does America need government - sponsored bodies to back the type of mortgages that were most likely to be repaid ?
It looks as if their core business is a solution to a non-existent problem .
However , Fannie and Freddie did not stick to their knitting .
In the late 1990s they moved heavily into another area : buying mortgage - backed securities issued by others ( see chart 3 ) .
Again , this was a version of the carry trade : they used their cheap financing to buy higher - yielding assets .
In 1998 Freddie owned $ 25 billion of other securities , according to a report by its regulator , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) ; by the end of 2007 it had $ 267 billion .
Fannie 's outside portfolio grew from $ 18.5 billion in 1997 to $ 127.8 billion at the end of 2007 .
Although they tended to buy AAA - rated paper , that designation is not as reliable as it used to be , as the credit crunch has shown .
Sometimes the mortgage companies were buying each other 's debt : turtles propping each other up .
Although this boosted short - term profits , it did not seem to be part of the duo's original mission .
As Mr Greenspan remarked , these purchases “ do not appear needed to supply mortgage market liquidity or to enhance capital markets in the United States ” .
Joshua Rosner , an analyst at Graham Fisher , a research firm , who was one of the first to identify the problems in the mortgage market in early 2007 , reckons Fannie and Freddie were buying 50 % of all “ private - label ” mortgage - backed securities in some years — that is , those issued by conventional mortgage lenders .
This left them exposed to the very subprime assets they were meant to avoid .
Although that exposure was small compared with their portfolios , it could have a big impact because they have so little equity as a cushion .
Both companies make a distinction between losses on trading assets ( which they take as a hit against profits ) and on “ available - for - sale ” securities which they hold for the longer term and disregard , if they think the losses are temporary .
At the end of 2007 , according to OFHEO , Fannie had pre-tax losses of this type of $ 4.8 billion ; Freddie 's amounted to $ 15 billion .
The companies have also been unwilling to accept the pain of market prices in acknowledging delinquent loans .
When borrowers fail to keep up payments on mortgages in the pool that supports asset - backed loans , Fannie and Freddie must buy back the loan .
But that requires an immediate write - off at a time when the market prices of asset - backed loans are depressed .
Instead , the twins sometimes pay the interest into the pool to keep the loans afloat .
In Mr Rosner 's view , this merely pushes the losses into the future .
Adding to the complexity is the need for both Fannie and Freddie to insure their portfolios against interest - rate risk — in particular , the danger that borrowers may pay back their loans early , if interest rates fall , leaving the companies with money to reinvest at a lower rate .
This risk caused the duo to take huge positions in the derivatives market , and was at the centre of an accounting scandal earlier this decade .
In addition , Fannie and Freddie have bought insurance against borrower defaults when the homebuyer lacks a 20 % deposit .
But the finances of the mortgage insurers do not look that healthy , which may mean the risk ends up back with the siblings .
Just as the rescuers need rescuing , so the insurers may need insuring .
None of these practices seemed to dent the confidence of OFHEO in its charges .
The regulator said as recently as July 10th that both Fannie and Freddie had enough capital .
Indeed , their capital - adequacy requirement was reduced earlier this year so that they could make more of an effort to bolster the housing market .
Capital offence
By its own measure , OFHEO was right .
At the end of the first quarter , the two companies exceeded their minimum capital requirements by $ 11 billion apiece , according to CreditSights .
To fall to the “ critical level ” , which would require OFHEO to take the agencies into “ conservatorship ” ( a fancy word for nationalisation ) , CreditSights says Fannie would have to lose $ 16 billion of capital and Freddie $ 14 billion .
And because neither Fannie nor Freddie has depositors , there is no danger of their suffering a run , as Northern Rock , a British bank , did last year .
So why the crisis ?
Given the gearing in the businesses , things only need to go slightly wrong for there to be a big problem .
Freddie lost $ 3.5 billion in 2007 ; Fannie reported a $ 2.2 billion loss in the first quarter , having lost $ 2.05 billion last year .
Each had credit - related write - downs of between $ 5 billion and $ 6 billion last year .
On a fair - value basis , which assumes that all assets and liabilities are realised immediately , Freddie had negative net worth of $ 5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter .

Clearly , if the pair continue to lose money for much longer , their capital base will be eroded .
And , of course , Congress wanted their businesses to expand — meaning that more , not less , capital would be needed .
That would require shareholders to stump up more money .
But investors tend to anticipate a big equity - raising by selling the shares , and a falling share price makes an equity issue less likely .
The fall was sufficiently speedy in mid-July to prompt Mr Paulson to step in .
The stockmarket had called the government 's bluff .
The rescue package may have reassured the creditors but it did not stop the share price of either Fannie or Freddie from falling .
After all , the government is likely to extract a heavy penalty from shareholders in return for its support ( creditors are another matter , especially as a lot of GSE paper is held by foreign central banks ) .
Nevertheless the hope is that , if confidence can be restored , Fannie and Freddie can survive without raising capital until market conditions improve .
In the short term , as the success of the debt issue on July 14th showed , they should be able to go about their business .
The authorities are keen to avoid nationalisation , which would bring the whole of Fannie 's and Freddie 's debt onto the federal government 's balance sheet .
In terms of book - keeping this would almost double the public debt , but that is rather misleading .
It would hardly be like issuing $ 5.2 trillion of new Treasury bonds , because Fannie 's and Freddie 's debt is backed by real assets .
Nevertheless , the fear that the taxpayer may have to absorb the GSEs ' debt pushed Treasury bond yields higher .
That suggests yet another irony ; the debt of the GSEs has been trading as if it were guaranteed by the American government , but the debt of the government was not trading as if Uncle Sam had guaranteed that of the GSEs .
If Congress approves this package , the Fed will have more authority over the agencies .
But that will give the central bank another headache .
If an institution is struggling , the normal answer is to shrink its activities and wind it down slowly .
But that is the last thing that the housing market needs right now .
With the credit crunch , Fannie and Freddie have become more important than ever , financing some 80 % of mortgages in January .
So they will need to keep lending .
Nor is there scope to offload their portfolios of mortgage - backed securities , given that there are scarcely any buyers of such debt .
And if the Fed has to worry about safeguarding Fannie and Freddie , can it afford to raise interest rates to combat inflation ?
American monetary policy may be constrained .
The GSEs are not the only liability for the government .
IndyMac 's recent collapse is the latest call on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) .
The FDIC has some $ 53 billion of assets , so it is better funded than most deposit - insurance schemes .
But if enough banks got into trouble , the government would be on the hook for any shortfall .
The same is true of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , which insures private sector benefits , but is already $ 14 billion in deficit .
In the end , the turtle at the bottom of the pile is the American taxpayer .
But that suggests that , if Americans are losing money on their houses , pensions or bank accounts , the right answer is to tax them to pay for it .
Perhaps it is no surprise that traders in the credit - default swaps market have recently made bets on the unthinkable : that America may default on its debt .

What happens when you say “ laugh at all my jokes and I ’ll breakdance for you at the end ” –and someone calls you on it ?
This is exactly what happened to me two months ago at the Nielsen Training Conference in Atlanta .
I did n’t choose the music .
The fine art of distraction … and sore hamstrings sans warm -up .
Ahhhhh… public speaking !
A fate worse than death for some , but the pay - off can be tremendous .
The 4HWW hit its tipping point with one presentation at SXSW , and in a digital world , one thought - provoking or rousing speech can propel you or your brand into the stratosphere .
But what are the basics for persuasive content and a delivery that makes evangelists out of disbelievers ?
I think Dan Pink is the right person to ask …
I first contacted Dan after reading his great article “ Japan , Ink ” in Wired magazine .
I was very curious about why , after two bestsellers , he ’d chosen to write his latest business book –which parallels the 4HWW philosophies–in manga format , a first for the English - speaking world .
Johnny Bunko trailer from Daniel Pink .
I found out after - the - fact that Dan was also the chief speechwriter for Al Gore from 1995 - 1997 .
Here are some of his tips for how to prepare and deliver world - class presentations , whether to a small group of colleagues or a huge room of UN delegates and media :
What are the necessary ingredients in a good speech ?
I ’ve said many times that the three essential ingredients in any good speech are brevity , levity , and repetition .
( That bears repeating : brevity , levity , and repetition . )
But at a broader level , the most important aspect of any speech , as Garr Reynolds reminds us in Presentation Zen , is being able to answer two questions :
A . What ’s your point ?
B . Why does it matter ?
That ’s the whole enchilada .
If you have a single point and can explain to a particular audience why it matters to them , you ’re ahead of 90 percent of the business and political speechgivers out there today .
How do you plan and structure presentations ?
There ’s no single formula for making a point and showing why it matters , but you typically wo n’t go wrong if you abide by four principles :
1 . Give the speech a beginning , a middle , and an end .
You do n’t have to take the audience by the hand and walk them through each step .
And you do n’t have to proceed chronologically .
But having that structure in your head will give your speech a shape .
And it will provide your audience some guideposts about where you ’ve been and where you ’re going .
2 . Mix up the elements .
Variety can keep your audience engaged .
For instance , funny stories are great .
But a half - hour of nothing but zany tales can actually undermine your point .
Pelting people with factoids for 40 minutes is usually a mistake .
But removing them altogether is also an error .
Mix it up .
Audiences are so accustomed to predictable speeches that surprise can be your ally .
Indeed , one of my favorite speech models does n’t even have words .
It ’s Haydn ’s Surprise Symphony ( No. 94 in G Major ) .
It engages the listener by offering variety and surprise within an established structure .
3 . Once you ’ve mapped out your speech , remove 20 percent .
In all my years of preparing and watching political and business speeches , I ’ve yet to hear anyone say , “ Gee , I wish that speech were longer . ”
4 . Do n’t forget Bunko ’s third lesson .
Here ’s the key lesson :
It ’s not about you .
That ’s doubly true for speeches .
It ’s not about you .
It ’s about the audience .
Think of it from their perspective .
Again , at the risk of being too critical of all those who stride the stage or command the podium , too many speechmakers – either through nervousness or ego – seem to forget that what really matters is the audience ’s experience , not their own .
What are the keys to world - class delivery ?
Authenticity .
Do n’t ape someone else ’s style .
do n’t try to be Barack Obama or Tom Peters or Margaret Thatcher .
It ’ll only underscore how far you are from being one of these outstanding speechifiers .
As trite as it may sound , just try to be you .
If “ you ” is someone who ’s slightly uneasy , who says “ uh ” a few times on stage , no problem .
As long as you ’re authentic — and as long as you have something interesting and relevant to say –- you ’ll be fine .
I ’ve found audiences are extremely tolerant of people who are less polished but who have something valuable to convey .
But their b.s. detectors go off big time when they see a super - polished presenter spewing vaporous nothings .
Again , assuming you have a point and can explain why it matters , just work on being the best version of you can be .
What are the most common mistakes that presenters make and how do you fix them ?
There are three that I see all the time :
1 . Thinking a speech is a right rather than a privilege .
When you deliver a speech , you ’ve got 10 or 100 or 10,000 people who have decided that the most important thing they can be doing at that moment is n’t taking care of something at the office or being with their families – but sitting there listening to you .
That ’s an extraordinary — and humbling — gift .
Alas , not enough speakers think of it this way .
They believe that their own exalted position somehow confers the right to keep people captive for an hour .
Nonsense .
A speech is a privilege , not a right .
The goal is to for the audience to leave saying , “ I ’m sure glad I listened to that guy for an hour rather than returned those phone calls or answered those emails . ”
2. Forgetting the Lamott rule .
Anne Lamott wrote Bird by Bird , one of my favorite writing guides .
[ Note from Tim : I used this book when writing 4HWW and second the recommendation ]
In the book , she describes how an editor of hers cut out a sizable portion of some chapter she had written .
Outraged , she asked him why .
He said : “ Just because it happened to you does n’t mean it ’s interesting . ”
Great advice for speakers .
3 . Not doing their homework .
This may seem self - evident , but it ’s important to know whom you ’re talking to .
Yet too many speakers ignore this simple truth .
They deliver the same speech to a group of nuns that they delivered three days ago at a punk rock convention .
You do n’t necessarily have to craft an entirely new speech from top to bottom every time you open your mouth .
But there are all kinds of ways to tailor and customize the message to the people at hand .
For example , when I was working for Gore , we used to love to include in his speeches what we called “ How the hells ? ”
For instance , say he was speaking in Sheboygan , Wisconsin .
We ’d find out the most popular coffee shop in Sheboygan and its most popular pastry .
Then somewhere in the speech , we ’d include a place for him to say matter - of - factly , “ If you ’re talking about health care down at Charley Café ’s – and maybe eating one of those cherry - walnut scones – you might wonder whether our Medicare plan covers . . . “ People love that sort of touch .
Homework pays .
What are the 3 most memorable speeches you worked on with Gore ?
1. His 1996 Democratic Convention acceptance speech .
The reason :
We were scrambling and I got to the Teleprompter only about ten minutes before the speech .
When the technician loaded the disk into the machine , the machine could n’t read it .
And we could n’t figure out how to fix it .
The problem continued even as the VP was being announced onto stage — in front a 10,000 people and a live national television audience .
Then , through some kind of divine intervention , about one minute into the speech , we got it to work .
I must have lost 35 pounds of sweat .
2 . His 1999 eulogy for this father .
I was no longer working for him then , but he asked me to lend a hand on this one .
He wrote the entire speech himself – and it was immensely personal and deeply moving .
What ’s more , it was a good reminder that politicians – whom we swat around like badminton birdies – are human beings .
3 . His 1995 commencement speech at MIT .
We prepared for this one for months .
The VP got memos from dozens of remarkable people , including several Nobel Prize winners .
He , a couple of policy people , and I would have these long meetings that were like graduate seminars .
The day before the speech we had a decent draft .
Then that night around 6 , he essentially threw out the whole thing and we ended up doing an all - nighter .
Believe me : Being in the ceremonial office of the Vice President of the United States at 2 am having a conversation about Ilya Prigogine is not an experience I ’m going to have ( or want to have ) again .
Any last advice ?
I ’m a word guy through and through .
I believe in the power of words .
But ultimately speeches are about actions .
The only reason to give a speech is to change the world .
That ’s a high bar .
But that ’s what we should aspire to when audiences give us this privilege .

Odds and Ends : Metro UK swaps “ get laid ” for “ get dates ” and other fun …
Metro UK gets optimistic :
The Metro UK newspaper interviewed me and came up with a most Freudian misquote .
I said “ get dates ” and they heard “ get laid . ”
Alas , though the two might be related , it is not what I said .
Here are a few other recent interviews that do not involve getting laid but are — nonetheless — somewhat fun to read :

The film focuses on breaking down barriers A Pakistani film , based on a real - life story , is being released simultaneously in India for the first time .
The film tells the story of a boy who strays into the Indian side of the border by mistake .
It will be released in both countries on 1 August .
Called Ramchand Pakistani , the film has been praised by the critics .
Political rivalry and three wars have limited people - to - people exchanges between the two countries , which in many respects enjoy similar cultures .
Last year another Pakistani film ,
In the Name of God , was released to critical acclaim in India , but not at the same time as it was in Pakistan .
That is what make the dual release of Ramchand Pakistani such a significant event .
The Indian actor Nandita Das , who has worked in many regional films and has a big part in this one , told the BBC it was fantastic to work in Pakistan .
She said the film would help Indians know more about Pakistan .
" They know a lot about us through Bollywood but we do n't know them enough , " she said .
The film deals with the parents of an eight - year - old boy who inadvertently strays onto the Indian side of the border and is put behind bars .
The producer Javed Jabbar is a former cabinet minister in Pakistan .
He said it was not a political film but a work which focused on the plight of the child and his parents .
There have been limited cultural interactions between the two countries over the last few years .
They have fought three wars since independence in 1947 and are now nuclear powers .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwe 's opposition party said four of its activists and the wife of Harare 's mayor -- an opposition member -- have been killed by supporters of President Robert Mugabe , just days ahead of next week 's presidential runoff .
President Robert Mugabe says war veterans will take up arms again if Tsvangirai wins .
Thursday 's report came as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Mugabe of sponsoring efforts to starve , beat and kill supporters of his opponent Morgan Tzvangirai so he can win the election .
Rice was speaking on the same day that Tendai Biti , the opposition Movement for Democratic Change 's secretary - general , was charged with treason after being held in jail without charges for a week .
If convicted , he could face the death penalty .
His arrest and treason charges have been criticized by African and international leaders who characterize it as a ploy by Mugabe supporters to intimidate the opposition party before his June 27 runoff against Tsvangirai .
A spokesman for the MDC blamed Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party for the five most recent deaths , saying they brought to 70 the number of MDC party members killed since a bitterly contested election three months ago .
The body of the mayor 's wife , 27 - year - old Abigail Chiroto , was found in a mortuary close to the couple 's house north of Harare .
She had been beaten so severely with rocks and iron bars that her face was almost unrecognizable , MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said .
Watch CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse report on the violience »
Chiroto was kidnapped , along with her 4 - year - old son , on Tuesday .
Some of her kidnappers wore military uniforms , Chamisa said .
Chiroto's son was released unharmed .
Her husband , Emmanuel Chiroto , is an MDC member who was recently elected mayor of Harare .
He was not home at the time of the kidnapping .
Also Thursday , the MDC said that four other activists were found dead in Chitungwiza .
The victims ' bodies showed evidence that " they were heavily tortured until they died , " an MDC statement said .
" It 's unbelievable the way people are being killed or murdered , " Chiroto said .
" It 's almost mass butchering . "
Police confirmed the deaths of the activists but did not link the victims to any political party .
Mugabe 's party denied any part in the deaths , saying MDC officials made such accusations frequently .
" They are claiming anyone who dies .
They phone CNN , " said Bright Matonga , a Zanu - PF spokesman .
" Whenever someone dies in the hospital , they rush to claim them . "
Matonga said Harare was run by a commission .
" There is no MDC mayor in Zimbabwe , " he said .
" There is no newly elected mayor in Harare . "

In New York , Rice convened a meeting about the situation in Zimbabwe at the United Nations on Thursday .
" Mugabe is increasing violence against [ the ] opposition .
...
President Mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of Africa , " Rice said at a roundtable discussion attended by representatives from many international governments .
" Clearly we have reached a point where broader , stronger , international effort is needed , " she added .
On Friday , a magistrate judge will determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with a trial against Biti .
The judge also will determine whether Biti will be granted bail or will continue to be jailed until the trial .
Biti was charged Thursday with treason , communicating false information prejudicial to the state , bringing the office of the president into disrepute and causing disaffection among armed forces , according to a journalist who was in the Harare courtroom .
He denies all the charges .
Watch Biti arrive for his court hearing »
Biti , wearing a red jacket and looking exhausted , held his head in his hands as the proceedings took place in the packed courtroom .
" I think that one must express very serious objection to the manner in which this whole case is being handled , " said Tsvangirai , who was in court .
" The accusations are frivolous . "
Three of the charges stem from a document titled " The Transitional Strategy , " which Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election .
Biti is denying that he wrote the document , and his lawyers described it as " doctored . "
The fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that Biti announced that Tsvangirai had won the March presidential election by an outright majority , meaning no runoff vote would be needed .
In recent weeks , opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings , torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of Mugabe .
Zanu - PF members have been suspected of being behind the acts .
Zanu - PF claims that the MDC is behind the violence .
It said MDC members attacked the mayor of Kadoma , a city 140 km ( 87 miles ) southwest of Harare .
It also accused MDC activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business .
Last week , Mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if Tsvangirai won .
Watch an ad vilifying Tsvangirai »
The MDC is using word of mouth and file - sharing sites such as YouTube to disseminate its campaign advertisements , claiming that they are banned by state media .
The group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail , asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives .
" Since the regime has denied the MDC access to state media , please send the adverts to as many people as you can , " the e-mail says .
" A new Zimbabwe is near .
The dictator is finished .
Let 's finish it ! "
Mugabe has been Zimbabwe 's only leader since the war ended in 1980 but is blamed for the economic collapse of a country once considered a regional breadbasket .
Zimbabweans increasingly are unable to afford food and other essentials , with agriculture paralyzed by land reform and the world 's highest rate of inflation .
Police have arrested Tsvangirai several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff , most recently on Saturday , with 11 other officials and supporters from his party .
South African President Thabo Mbeki met Mugabe and Tsvangirai on Wednesday in the hope of quelling tensions .
Mbeki was visiting in his capacity as mediator with the 14 - nation Southern African Development Community , the South African government said Wednesday .
He is under domestic and international pressure for his perceived conciliatory stance toward Mugabe , but the South African leader recently said he would continue his quiet diplomacy despite recent events .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .
All About Zimbabwe • Robert Mugabe • Morgan Tsvangirai • Gordon Brown
Dave interviewed investigative journalist Jane Mayer Wednesday about her new book , The Dark Side , which chronicles the Bush administration 's use ( and denial of use ) of torture , and asks her a simple question that we all want to know the answer to .
During the Nuremberg trials Robert H. Jackson said :
" To initiate a war of aggression , therefore , is not only an international crime , it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . "
By that standard -- you know , the internationally agreed upon one -- I think the answer is clear .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) Actually according to George W. Bush himself , he agrees : ( h/t JR )
President Bush signed an executive order on Friday to expand sanctions against what he calls the " illegitimate " regime of Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe and his supporters .[.. ]
" No regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences , " Bush said in a statement .

The threatening letter on the doormat about licence fee non-payment might soon be joined by another from your local internet service provider .
At least it will if you have been virally spreading Coldplay without permission .
Bereft , perhaps , of enough incidents of dangerous dogs to merit new legislation , the government is attempting to cut illegal downloading activity by up to 80 % .
In an initiative involving the record industry trade body , the BPI , the film industry and the government , a memorandum of understanding has been drawn up that will potentially see the half - dozen largest internet service providers in the UK sending out around 1,000 letters a week as a warning to those who use their bandwidth to illegally download , or worse , upload and share music and films .
The move echoes 80s campaigns that tried to persuade students buying bootleg tapes in Camden that their £ 2.99 would immediately go into the pockets of the IRA or the National Front .
But , as the warnings are of a less altruistic and more personal nature - carry on doing this and we will cut off your broadband - the effects might be more immediate and long - lasting .
While nobody should endorse illegal file - sharing , the issue of monitoring internet use is controversial .
It reminds people there is an ability to monitor and store data about individuals at the most granular and unwelcome level .
Obviously , this happens all the time , but the increasingly public reminders raise some very uncomfortable questions about personal freedom versus commercial compliance in the future .
At one end of the thinking on intellectual property , law and the internet , best represented by the US lawyer and open - access campaigner Larry Lessig , the view is , not unreasonably , that the current version of copyright is so broken that we need to rethink it rather than constantly try to enforce it .
( Although only two weeks ago , Europe 's internal markets and services commissioner , Charlie McCreevy , outlined plans to extend copyright on recorded music to 95 years from the current 50 . )
Can the free - content genie of the internet really be forced back into the bottle ?
The answer will depend on how hard companies want to try , how much they are prepared to spend on it and whether they are happy to risk audience extinction .
One of the facets of the viral nature of the internet is that reach trumps revenue - and might occasionally undermine it - but it does n't completely collapse the value chain .
We are all in the music business now : we have to accept that the value of content is going to be essentially nil , but that the opportunity to monetise the experience through live gatherings , merchandising , hard copy sales and new advertising models might partially make up for the end of the distribution monopolies .
The record industry , and the ISPs for that matter , might reflect on the fact that neither they nor governments and regulators have had the greatest effect on reversing the decline in paid - for music .
It was Steve Jobs at Apple who came at the problem with a new model that put the audience at the heart of the equation .
Writing on the Guardian 's website last week , the musician Billy Bragg noted that artists who want to be paid for their efforts are nevertheless uncomfortable about the idea of their fans being harassed or even penalised for listening to their music .
But his suggestion of a kind of licence fee for music evokes images of more letters on the mat .
If the campaign succeeds , then what ?
The free downloaders will not replace the illegal sharing with paid - for music .
They might be less inclined to populate the festivals or buy the T - shirts .
They might turn off their computers and learn an instrument instead or , more likely , find a different online activity to fill the void .
Project for Excellence in Journalism released an excellent study today titled , “ The Changing Newsroom “ .
Based on survey responses from 259 newspapers and in - depth interviews with senior executives at 15 newspapers , it ’s a very thorough study of changes to the content and business models of American newspapers .
If there ’s a single conclusion one could draw from the study , it ’s that newspapers have radically changed their ambitions from providing a wide view of news around the world , to providing excellent local content .
This is n’t always an easy change .
One editor said that the hardest loss in his newsroom has been “ the concept of who and what we are ” .
For those of us who hope that journalism will thrive in a digital age , this report includes the good , the bad and the ugly .
On the good side , there ’s ample evidence that newspapers have embraced the internet and , as Jay Rosen memorably said almost four years ago , “ bloggers versus journalists is over . ”
Not only is virtually every newspaper expanding their web presence and migrating fast - moving content on the web into the next edition of the paper , the majority of papers ( 100 % of large newspaper – circulation 100 k + – and 63 % of smaller papers ) have started staff blogs .
Most of these blogs are either unedited or edited after publication .
And 40 % of papers ( 50 % of large papers ) now incorporate some form of citizen media into their coverage , and very few editors ( less than 10 % ) rejected the idea that citizen media could be incorporated in some form into professional journalism .
( There ’s a possible pro-geek bias in the survey , which was conducted via email , leading participants to an online survey .
True luddite editors were likely left out of the sample set . )
While newspapers are publishing less news overall , they ’re publishing more , shorter pieces , and some editors feel like they ’re providing better breadth of coverage .
And 56 % of editors felt like the quality of their paper was better than 3 years ago , with 29 % conceding that their papers are now “ different ” .
The bad news is that newspapers have n’t figured out how to make money online .
Roughly 90 % of revenue for the newspapers surveyed comes from their print editions , not from online sections .
59 % reported staff cuts in the past three years , and 61 % reported reducing their “ newshole ” , the part of the paper that actually prints news .
And 73 % of papers have physically shrunk , using smaller page size , a move that ’s often associated with shrinking the overall size of a newspaper .
97 % of editors report that they ’re actively involved with searching for new revenue streams for their papers … so much for that Chinese wall between the editor and publisher .
The ugly news , so far as I ’m concerned , has to do with the change of mission of the newspaper , specifically a shift away from foreign and national news to an increased focus on local and community news .
64 % of newspapers reported that they ’d decreased the amount of foreign coverage in their papers , and 46 % said they ’d reduced the number of reporters focused on these stories .
There were dramatic declines in national news coverage as well , with 50 % of papers reporting less space on these sorts of stories .
62 % of papers have increased their coverage of community news , and while 97 % of newspaper editors called local news “ very essential ” to their papers , only 10 % felt that international news was very essential .
This makes a certain amount of sense .
Newspapers realize that they ’re in a different world than ten years ago .
People who are interested in following international news are likely to look for international news online , or in a major newspaper like the New York Times .
What ’s worrisome is that it ’s not clear that the major newspapers are going to step up to the task .
They ’re also looking local , with 94 % calling local news very essential and only 28 % calling international coverage very essential .
The percentage of large circulation papers who ’ve cut international news coverage over the past three years is slightly larger than the percentage of small papers ( which may reflect earlier cuts made by those smaller papers . )
Local coverage makes economic sense for newspapers .
Most newspaper advertisers are local – they may be pleased that the paper ’s coverage can potentially reach international audiences , but they ’re selling to people in the paper ’s geographic area , and they ’re most concerned with content specifically for that local audience .
Local content is much , much cheaper than sending reporters overseas to cover stories , and the temptation to cover international stories using wire services has led newspapers like the Boston Globe and Baltimore Sun to close their last overseas bureas .
The consequence – whatever international content a paper publishes is content that is available elsewhere , published in a major paper like the Times or the Washington Post or available via a wire service .
This trend is n’t new , by the way .
In 1997 , James Hoge Jr. , the editor of the influential journal Foreign Affairs , published an essay memorably titled , “ Foreign News : Who Gives a Damn ? ”
Hoge saw a steep drop in international coverage from the early 1970s to the 1990s , and noted , “ Except for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 - 90 , the coverage of such internaitonal news in American media has steadily declined since the late seventies , when the cold war lost its sense of imminent danger . ”
Depending on who you ask , the trend may be even longer than that – in the brilliant “ The Creation of the Media “ , Paul Starr notes that newspapers in pre-revolutionary America routinely published 75 % or more international news – publishers were skeptical that readers would pay to hear about news they could get from talking to their neighbors .
Hoge suggests that the drop in news coverage from the 1970s to the 1990s had to do with the end of the Cold War , and the perception of the world as a safer – and therefore less interesting – place .
The same circumstances that compelled Francis Fukayama to declare the end of history seemed to offer good reasons to stop reading the international section of the newspaper .
But recent events – 9/11 , bombings in Bali , Riyadh , Casablanca , Jakarta , Istanbul , London and Madrid , long wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Somalia , as well as the international dynamics surrounding global warming , petroleum prices and a worldwide economic downturn – would all seem to offer compelling reasons for readers to care about international news .
If there ’s less international news in newspapers ( and , as other studies suggest , in television newscasts ) , is that the fault of news organizations , who ’ve figured out that it ’s more economical to deliver local coverage , or is it the fault of consumers , who are n’t demanding more international news ?
The PEJ study does n’t address this directly , but offers a depressing note from one editor , who tells the interviewer that readers complain vociferously when the paper removes TV listings or shrinks the crossword , but has n’t complained about cuts in international or domestic coverage .
My fear is that international news will fall victim to a collective action problem , a version of the tragedy of the commons .
For each individual paper , it ’s in their economic interest to focus on local news and hope that readers who have a concern with international news will read that paper as well as the local paper , or access that paper online .
Unfortunately , this appears to be leading to a situation in which only the largest papers are able to deploy resources to cover international stories and small and mid-sized papers are simply delivering wire service content .
What happens if the New York Times or Washington Post decide it ’s not economically viable to continue providing international coverage ?
Recent cuts at the LA Times – one of the papers historically committed to international reporting – are likely to shrink its coverage dramatically .
I wonder if , on some level , a lot of webfolk believe that we ’re going to move into a new media space where everyone focuses on reporting local news well , and where we can get a global picture by reading lots of local news from around the world .
( Indeed , that ’s one way to think about what we do at Global Voices . )
That ’s not going to work , for two reasons .
Local coverage is contextualized for local audiences .
Read a story from a local newspaper across the country or across the world and you ’ll discover there ’s background information missing that you ’d need to understand the story – the editor of the local paper expects you to know the distances between places , the identity and backstory of prominent people mentioned in the paper .
Reading a story without context makes you more likely to misinterpret , and can make it much harder to connect with the story .
I ’m able to read newspaper stories from hundreds of African newspapers via AllAfrica.com , and while I follow African events more closely than most Americans , I often end up needing to do research simply to read the daily news in most of these papers .
It ’s not that the stories are poorly written – they ’re simply not written with me as part of the audience .
( And then , of course , there are language issues .
And issues around censorship and media control .
If you want news from China on protest movements around property rights from local sources , you need context , language skills and experience hunting for underground media that you probably do n’t have . )
There ’s a more important reason why it ’s hard to get global coverage by gluing together local coverage – you do n’t know what to pay attention to .
Local papers publish every day , whether there ’s a lot or a little news – simply reading all of them is n;t an option .
What responsible newspapers have done well for decades is organize information on their front pages so that readers know what they need to pay attention to , locally , nationally and globally .
You may disagree with the decisions made by a publication , but this filtering function is incredibly important … and incredibly powerful .
Without it , you ’re left to search for information on topics you think are important , or seek out local coverage in places you think are important .
My experience is that people come to Global Voices for information on a story or a region when large newspapers or newscasts have declared a topic newsworthy .
We ’ve covered Burmese bloggers for years , but we only saw deep , sustained interest in what those bloggers were saying when the “ saffron revolution ” became front page news in American and European newspapers .
These papers set the news agenda , and even in an age where web surfers can look for information on any concievable topic , my experience is that interest closely follows the news cycle .
And if the newscycle focuses less on international news because newspapers dedicate fewer resources to international coverage , bloggers and net surfers will pay less attention to these stories online , I predict .
In his decade - old paper , Hoge wonders if we ’re entering a period where international news matters only to a small group of people who feel like they ’ve got political or business interests in the international sphere .
I think that ’s become true , with an expansion of that category to include hardcore news junkies , and I think those folks are looking for news in newspapers that have declared themselves to have international ambitions , like The Economist or The Guardian .
What worries me is that , with less international news in newspapers and newscasts , most citizens are going to end up feeling like these are issues they have no information about , no opinions on , and no ability to influence .
In a world where the hard local problems demand global solutions , that ’s an ugly development indeed .
Threats , booby - trapped envelopes rigged with razor blades , and beatings with baseball bats have scared biomedical researchers out of the field and slowed advances in human health care , say endocrinologist Michael Conn and his coauthor , James Parker .
Twenty years ago animal rights activists would meet with scientists to discuss their concerns openly , the authors write , but over the past decade a wing of the movement has become so violent that in 2005 the FBI called it “ one of today ’s most serious domestic terrorism threats . ”
Since Conn began his tenure as associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center in 1994 , animal rights extremists have followed him when he traveled , harassing him every step of the way .
They have spread lies about his methods , accused him of electrocuting monkeys when in fact he was working with cells in culture dishes , and limited his job opportunities .
The Animal Research War is a passionate ( if sometimes disjointed ) rant against these tactics by a scientist on the front lines of modern medicine .
Animal research saves lives , Conn argues , including the lives of animals .
The discovery that insulin treats type 1 diabetes , for instance , came from experiments in 1921 on laboratory dogs ; today even house pets — like Conn ’s own golden retriever , Chestnut — benefit from the breakthrough .
If consumer response is any indication , the public wants their modern technological devices to be hi-speed , visually stimulating , and offer more options than one will ever need or use in their lifetime .
But can these features be detrimental to the overall experience for some people ?
If the user has autism , the answer is a definite " yes " .
John LeSieur , owner of the small software start - up " People CD " , has a six - year - old grandson who has autism .
For Zachery , the entire experience of using a computer is wasted on the countless options that confuse the child .
The episode ends when Zachery hurls the computer mouse in frustration .
Figuring that there must be an easier way for autistic children to navigate their way through the computer , LeSieur began searching for assistive online tools .
He found nothing useful .
Instead , he built his own resource from scratch , named it the Zac Browser For Autistic Children , and made it available to anyone for free .
The Zac Browser simplifies the experience of using a computer , blocking most websites that depict violent , sexual , or other adult - themed materials .
Instead it offers a wide selection of free , public websites designed to promote educational games , music , videos and ( most importantly ) visually stimulating images .
( Source : usatoday.com )
While a number of programs are already designed to restrict child access to adult content , the Zac Browser goes a step beyond , taking over the computer and reducing the controls of children who are constantly bombarded with unnecessary options .
The Zac Browser is free to install .
The Zac Browser promises to restore confidence in autistic children .
The software disables many extraneous keys like the " Print Screen " button and limits the power of the right button on the mouse , eliminating the chance of making a counterproductive click that results in typical fits of frustration and rage .
The Zac Browser allows autistic children to choose their own activities by clicking bigger - than - normal icons , like a sports ball for games or a stack of books for stories .
Best of all , filters are always active , ensuring that no advertisements or other flashing distractions appear on the screen .

Many are confident that the Zac Browser will be received as a resounding success , especially since revenue is not a determining factor .
The death mask has been with the family for more than 250 years
The historic artefacts form the centrepiece of a free exhibition giving fans a rare chance to glimpse into Mary 's tragic life .
The items come from the stately home of Lennoxlove in East Lothian .
Instead of being put into storage , some of the artefacts have been put on display at Edinburgh - based auctioneers Lyon and Turnbull .
The home was once run by the Duke of Hamilton , who opened the exhibition on Tuesday .
He said : " As Lennoxlove will be closed for two years , and while extensive conservation and refurbishment takes place , it was an opportunity to create this unique exhibition .
" It will allow many visitors to Edinburgh the opportunity to enjoy pictures from one of Scotland 's finest collection of family portraits , as well as examples of furniture and porcelain associated with my family which has enjoyed a unique place in Scottish history . "
Historic significance
The wax mask was placed over Mary 's face after her death in order to preserve her features forever .
Eyelashes , eyebrows , hair and paint were added later to give the mask a lifelike appearance .
It has been in the Hamilton family 's possession for more than 250 years .
The exhibition runs until the middle of August
Their dynasty was related to Mary centuries ago .
The casket has major historic significance as it was reputed to have contained the " casket letters " said to have been written by Mary accusing her husband Lord Darnley of being a traitor .
The sapphire ring was left by Mary to the first Marquis of Hamilton .
Other notable items in the exhibition include a portrait of Frances Stewart , Duchess of Lennox , who gave her name to the stately home .
The exhibition will also contain examples of Lennoxlove 's collection of armorial china , from early 18th Century Chinese pieces , to the late 19th Century English artefacts .
The Treasures of Lennoxlove exhibition in Broughton Place opens from 1100 BST to 1700 BST and runs until 18 August .
If you used the Windows Quick Launch toolbar through Windows 98 to XP then you may have been somewhat annoyed when you began using Vista …
Try to drag the Quick Launch off the Vista taskbar and nothing happens !
In a rather strange decision Microsoft decided during the Vista development to ‘ remove ’ this feature .
Maybe because of people panicking when they accidentally dragged the toolbar onto their desktop ?
Well the good news is that the feature has n’t actually been removed from Windows .
Here are the steps to get the Quick Launch bar again :
Right click your desktop and create a new folder .
Simply grab this folder , drag it to the side of your screen and let go .
A sidebar has now been created .
Right click this and select the toolbars that you would like displayed here , such as Quick Launch .
Modify preferences such as unselecting “ show text ” , displaying icons smaller and resizing the bar .
The advantages of using the Windows Quick Launch bar instead of a alternative program is the high responsiveness and tiny system footprint .
For more features and visual goodness however you may wish to have a look at some the following application docks :
Rocket Dock : A popular application launcher based on the Mac Dock .
There are a range of addons and themes that can be downloaded , I recommend the Stacks Docklet for added Mac functionality .
ObjectDock is possibly the best application dock alternative .
It certainly looks fantastic , has the most innovative features and also a range of themes and additional addons that can downloaded as well .
ObjectDock also comes in a ‘ plus ’ version for $ 19.95 although the free version is in no means limited .
This program is constantly being updated and developed , so you can expect new features and performance improvements over time .
Rk Launcher is yet another application dock .
It lacks some of the effects and gloss of ObjectDock , but makes up for by having maybe the best performance of these three launchers .
A doctor who bound a 14 - year - old girl with washing line and raped her has been jailed for 12 years .
The terrified girl hid in a wardrobe after calling 999 following her ordeal , Bradford Crown Court heard yesterday .
Mohammad Sajjad was led weeping to the cells after a judge told him his “ deep remorse ” was just self - pity .
Sajjad , a qualified doctor who was granted asylum in the UK , had been employed as a learning disabilities healthcare assistant in the Bradford area .
The court heard he three times tied the girl ’s hands tightly with red washing line and bound her feet before stripping and violating her .
The girl told police she was a virgin before she was raped by the doctor .
She said she cried as he attacked her .
Sajjad , 43 , pleaded guilty to three charges of raping the girl between last December and February .
Prosecutor Richard Woolfall told the court Sajjad was a British citizen .
He came from the Ukraine , where he had qualified as a doctor , leaving his wife and children behind .
A successful asylum seeker , he lived at Thornbury Crescent , Bradford Moor , at the time of his arrest .
Sajjad was employed as a healthcare assistant but had stopped working because of back problems .
Mr Woolfall said police responding to a 999 call found the distressed girl who told them she had been hiding in a wardrobe .
She showed officers the clothes line that had been bound tightly and painfully round her wrists .
Sajjad told police he was drunk on vodka and could not recall the rape .
When confronted with the washing line , he said : “ No comment ” .
Jailing him Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said Sajjad was an educated man of good character .
He had at first accused the girl of encouraging his advances , although he , in fact , enticed her .
“ You wanted that young woman under your control for one reason , ” the judge said .
“ Such is the depth of her trauma , and the damage to her , that she can not yet begin to express her feelings . ”
The judge made a Sexual Offences Prevention Order against Sajjad without limit of time and banned him from ever working with children .
In mitigation Sajjad ’s barrister , Rukshanda Hussain , said his temptation to deny the offences must have been enormous giving the effect they would have on his standing in society .
He had accepted full responsibility for his actions and was remorseful and ashamed .
Sajjad had been remanded in custody and it was his first taste of prison life , she said .
“ If at three in the afternoon I wanted to have a business cocktail , there was n’t any place to go , ” said Vicki King , whose husband recently resigned from the club .
Ms. King had privileges at the club as the spouse of a member .
As teenage boys saunter into the sumptuously appointed men ’s grill room , their mothers are relegated to the ladies ’ grill , down the hall with a hot plate , some card tables and no bar .
The club also has a formal dining room , where men and women are welcome , but it is closed between meals and is not a spot to get a drink .
“ The ladies ’ grill is a very small room where a bunch of little old ladies gather to play cards , ” said Wanda Diethelm , a health care executive .
“ And if you make any noise , they shush you . ”
Grumbling about the disparity has gone on for years .
But the casus belli was when the Van Sitterts , club members for 30 years , decided two years ago that they wanted to partake in some eggs together in the morning .
They appealed to the board of the club to change its policies so they could eat together in the men ’s grill room , but were rebuffed .
The couple filed a complaint with the civil rights division of the Arizona attorney general ’s office , arguing that although the club is private and not inherently subject to the state ’s antidiscrimination laws , it is the equivalent of a public accommodation because it receives much of its revenue from nonmembers , in speeches , tournaments , Rotary Club meetings and the like .
Earlier this month , the attorney general ’s office agreed with the couple , issuing an advisory legal opinion that the club needed to comply with the state ’s antidiscrimination laws .
Lap Dance Etiquette
Page 1 of 2
Lap dance bars :
Can you think of anything more perfect ?
Almost - naked beautiful women , beer ...
OK , that 's all we 've got so far , but you have to admit that 's all pretty close to perfect .
However , you can't just walk into a strip joint and act the way your caveman brain is telling you .
No jumping on the nearest piece of flesh — there are rules to follow .
While lap dance etiquette is inevitably stacked ( pun not intended ) in favor of the girls , these rules also benefit you .
Be respectful and you 'll be allowed back into this little slice of paradise .
The alternative ?
Your butt will make friends with the curb outside the club very quickly .
Know the house rules
Every strip joint has its own rules .
These ruleswritten in stone .
If the big , flashing sign on the wall says " No Touching , " you can bet your ass that your hands will not be an exception to the rule .
Every cell in your body might be telling youto sit on your sweaty little palms while a semi- naked girl grinds your thigh , but if that 's what you 've got to do , then that 's what you 've got to do , period .
The simplest way to maintain proper lap dance etiquette form is to follow the house rules as if they were the Ten Commandments .
If you do n't , your face , wallet and raging libido wo n't be welcome there again .
Be clean
This is another glaring , do - not - ever - break rule of lap dance etiquette .
Do n't turn up smelling like a dead homeless dude .
Before you head out , shower and prep as if you were heading out on a date .
In fact , take it one step further because you know you 'll be getting up - close and personal with someone .
The key to lap dance etiquette is to make it pleasant for your dancer .
Make sure you smell good and banish any bad breath you suspect you might have .
However , you also do n't want to overdo it .
Drenching yourself in cologne is worse than not wearing any at all .
Present yourself as you would to a potential date — we 're not suggesting she 's going to go home with you at the end of the night , but you want to make sure that , at very least , she 's enjoying her work .
Have money
Never turn up to a strip bar with just enough money for beer .
If you 're going there intending to have a dance , this is a bit of a no - brainer .
However , even if you 're just heading out with the boys — with no intention of enjoying the delights on offer — proper lap dance etiquette suggests you should always pack a few extra bills .
The last thing you want is to be presented with the opportunity for a dance from an absolute goddess only to have to turn it down because you did n't follow proper lap dance etiquette and bring enough cash .
It 's not just the frustration that 'll get you down ; by the time you 've finished counting the loose change in your wallet , every girl in the place will have you pegged as " the poor guy " and will avoid you like an STI .
More rules of lap dance etiquette to keep in mind ...
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Reuters urged the U.S. military on Thursday to immediately release an Iraqi cameraman working for the news organization or to publicly produce evidence to justify his detention .
Reuters journalist Ali al - Mashhadani ( R ) , a television cameraman , embraces a colleague shortly after his release from Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad January 15 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Thaier al - Sudani
Ali al - Mashhadani , who also works freelance for the BBC and Washington - based National Public Radio , was detained in Baghdad on Saturday while he was in the Green Zone government compound for routine checks for a U.S. military press card .
U.S. forces have detained Mashhadani before .
No charge has ever been filed against the cameraman , who is based in Ramadi , the capital of western Anbar province .
“ Any accusations against a journalist should be aired publicly and dealt with fairly and swiftly , with the journalist having the right to counsel and present a defense , ” said Reuters Editor - in - Chief David Schlesinger .
“ Iraqi journalists like Mashhadani play a vital role in telling this story to the world . ”
A spokesman for the BBC said : “ We were concerned to hear of Mashhadani ’s detention , and urge the U.S. military to disclose as a matter of urgency the grounds on which he is being held and what charges , if any , he faces . ”
A U.S. military spokesman said Mashhadani was being held at Camp Cropper , an American prison near Baghdad ’s airport .
“ He is being detained because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of Iraq and coalition forces , ” the spokesman said , declining to elaborate .
The spokesman said Mashhadani ’s case would be reviewed by early next week .
The military contends that under the U.N. mandate governing the presence of foreign forces in Iraq it can detain anyone considered a security risk indefinitely .
U.S. forces previously detained Mashhadani in August 2005 after troops became suspicious of film and photographs of the Sunni Arab insurgency then raging in Anbar that they found on his cameras while searching his home in Ramadi .
He was held until January 2006 .
Mashhadani was also detained for two weeks in mid-2006 .
ANBAR NOW RELATIVELY SAFE
The vast desert region of Anbar , once the most dangerous region for U.S. troops in Iraq , has undergone a dramatic transformation and is now one of the country ’s safest areas .
Reuters and international media rights groups have previously criticized the military ’s refusal to deal more quickly with suspicions apparently arising from reporters ’ legitimate journalistic activities covering violence .
Reuters said it remained committed to improving communications with the U.S. military to help avoid situations where questions over such activity might arise .
Two Iraqi journalists who were in the military press office when Mashhadani was detained on Saturday said U.S. soldiers suddenly appeared , frisked him and led him away .
Two other witnesses told Reuters not long after that they were outside the press office when they saw soldiers escorting a handcuffed man with a hood over his head .
U.S. forces have held other Iraqi reporters working for Reuters along with journalists from different media groups for long periods without charging them .
In April , the U.S. military freed a Pulitzer Prize - winning Iraqi photographer working for the Associated Press after holding him without charge for two years .
The U.S. military had accused Bilal Hussein of working with insurgents in Iraq .
AP had repeatedly denied any improper links .
No formal charges were ever filed , the agency said .
The AP reported this month that an Iraqi cameraman working for AP television who was detained by U.S. and Iraqi forces in June had been ordered held for at least six more months .
The U.S. military said this was for “ imperative reasons of security ” and provided no details about any allegations against Ahmed Nouri Raziak , the agency has said .
Other great things to look at with this device are trees and other plants , it 's hard to explain but they appear disjointed and seem very unreal .
Please see below for new photos of my latest pseudoscope with the front surface mirrors , also the pyramid info and the dimension drawing have been altered .
FS mirrors .
Framework cube , finish and countersink , see the end of this post .-----
There is only one pseudoscope for sale on the market , it 's called the M - X3 and retails for 499 British pounds , which at the time of this post equals $ 882 ( U.S. ) .
It can be purchased here : I 've never seen the M - X3 in person but I recommend buying one just because they look so great , but if you do n't want to spend that much this post will show how to make a pseudoscope for less than $ 10 , and also how to construct better versions for a little more .
Items needed to make the ten dollar pseudoscope : - Two 3 " x3 " mirrors ( $ 1 each ) - Two 3 " x4 " mirrors ( $ 1 each ) - Four 1 - 1/4 " wood cubes ( six for $ 2 ) - One 5 " x12 " x1/4 " piece of wood ( $ 2.50 ) - Four 3/4 " flat head screws ( or longer if you use a thicker base ) - glue You will also need a drill and a screwdriver .
Here is a photo of the finished product :
The illusions seen through this device are caused by switching the input for each eye :
All supplies except for the screws were purchased from a Hobby Lobby craft store .
The diagram below shows the dimensions for the screw holes .
This site is still a work in progress , I 'll be refining these instructions as I test the various pseudoscopes .
I do n't think it 's critical to use these exact dimensions , being off afraction of an inch here or there should n't matter too much .
I did n't glue the cubes to the base because it 's necessary to rotate the mirrors to align them depending on the distance to the subject matter .
If you use different size cubes you will have to work out new dimensions for the holes .
It 's very important that the wood base is flat , take a close look when buying this piece .
Before gluing the mirrors to the cubes , be sure that the bottom and the face where the mirror will be attached are at exactly 90 degrees .
To check this use a right triangle , or place two of the cubes on a flat surface and push them together until two of the sides meet , if you do this several times using different orientations of the cubes , you will notice that all sides will not meet perfectly flush .
Some will have small gaps at the top or bottom and these are the faces that you want to avoid using .
When I find two faces that meet just right , I put a small pencil mark on top of the cube near the side to be glued .
Also before attaching the mirrors , drill a hole in the bottom of the cubes .
If the mirrors are n't glued to the cubes at the proper angle , when you view an object with the scope you will see a double image , with one of them slightly above the other .
If this happens , use a right triangle to test each of the mirrors , when you find one with a bad angle you could either start over with another mirror and cube or place some thin cardboard or paper shims under the cube to get it to 90 degrees .
I do n't know what the best kind of glue for this is , but I happened to have some Goop on hand and it has worked well so far .
Using just a thin layer of glue , I did two at the same time and pushed them together at the mirror surfaces for a few moments to keep them at the right angle .----- Another option is to spend a little more money and have a glass shop cut some better mirrors for you .
The best estimate that I got for cutting the mirrors and sanding the edges : 3" x3 " - $ 3.50 each3 " x6 " - $ 4.75 eachI would definitely call and get estimates from different glass shops , I 've found that prices can vary widely .
I purchased some 3 " x6 " x1/4 " mirrors from a surplus store and cut one in half to get two small ones .
I like the 6 " long mirrors better than the 4 " because there is a wider field of view , and with the shorter ones you can see around the side of the 4 " mirrors which can be a little distracting .
Also , a larger piece of wood about 7 " x16 " is necessary when using the longer mirrors .
Here the 1/4 " mirrors are attached to the small base :----- In the M - X3 article , they mention a hypersphere that when viewed through the scope looks inside out and spins in the opposite direction , I discovered that a balsa wood frame - work pyramid works just as well .
This illusion can easily be seen with the $ 10 pseudoscope .
You could also make one of these out of paper or cardboard .
Below is the new version of the pyramid : Supplies needed to make it : - One 36 " x1/4" x1/16 " piece of balsa wood - Two 36" x3/16 " x1/16 " pieces of balsa wood - wood glue - red and white acrylic paint - a razor knife to cut the wood All segments are 6 " long , the 1/4 " wide pieces were used on the base only .
Make each of the four sides first , the corners will look better if you cut the ends of the pieces on an angle so they meet at a point .
I taped the four sides together , glued them , removed the tape and then added a little more glue .
Hang the pyramid so you can see into the bottom a little as seen in this photo :
When spun slowly and seen through the scope it appears that the outside of it is now red and the direction of spin is opposite of what it really is , I was surprised when this actually worked .
If you close one eye the pyramid will revert back to it 's normal appearance .
This illusion is best seen with strong lighting .
Do n't forget to clean the mirrors before using the scope , fingerprints and smudges will greatly diminish the illusions .-----
The best option for making a pseudoscope is probably using front surface mirrors , in which the reflective surface is on top of the glass , not behind it like in most mirrors .
These do n't have a slight double image that can be seen in regular ones .
I have n't tried using them yet , but I have some on order , I 'm guessing that the expensive pseudoscope uses this type .
I purchased the front surface mirrors from this site :
Item OL8011 , they are less expensive than the estimate that I got from the glass shop , but they only have about 100 in stock .----- I bought a piece of 3/4 " thick walnut on which to mount the longer mirrors , and since I did n't like the plain rectangular shape I had it cut as seen here :
The front surface mirrors finally arrived and have been attached to the base : UPDATE :
The front surface mirrors work very well and do n't have the slight imperfections that the inexpensive ones have , but all optical illusions that I 've seen with them also work with the ten dollar pseudoscope .
I do like the larger size mirrors since they have a wider field of view and require less adjustments .
As I mentioned in the prism post , globes and other spheres look concave when viewed with the scope , though sometimes it might not be apparent at your first look .
It helps if there is printing or a pattern on the sphere and that the subject is equally lit on both sides .-----
The ten dollar scope will look much better if you apply a coat of natural wood finish to the base and cubes .
Also you might want to countersink the holes on the bottom of the base so the screws wo n't scratch table surfaces .
I created a framework cube that works a little better than the pyramid , using twelve 6 " x1/4" x1/4 " pieces of basswood :

Lt. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , the acting commander of American forces in Southwest Asia , made an unannounced visit to the tribal areas on Monday , a further reflection of American concern .
The ISI has for decades maintained contacts with various militant groups in the tribal areas and elsewhere , both for gathering intelligence and as proxies to exert influence on neighboring India and Afghanistan .
It is unclear whether the C.I.A. officials have concluded that contacts between the ISI and militant groups are blessed at the highest levels of Pakistan ’s spy service and military , or are carried out by rogue elements of Pakistan ’s security apparatus .
With Pakistan ’s new civilian government struggling to assert control over the country ’s spy service , there are concerns in Washington that the ISI may become even more powerful than when President Pervez Musharraf controlled the military and the government .
Last weekend , Pakistani military and intelligence officials thwarted an attempt by the government in Islamabad to put the ISI more directly under civilian control .

Mr. Kappes made his secret visit to Pakistan on July 12 , joining Adm . Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , for meetings with senior Pakistani civilian and military leaders .
“ It was a very pointed message saying , ‘ Look , we know there ’s a connection , not just with Haqqani but also with other bad guys and ISI , and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it , ’ ” one senior American official said of the message to Pakistan .
The official was briefed on the meetings ; like others who agreed to talk about it , he spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic delicacy of Mr. Kappes ’s message .
The meetings took place days after a suicide bomber attacked the Indian Embassy in Kabul , killing dozens .
Afghanistan ’s government has publicly accused the ISI of having a hand in the attack , an assertion American officials have not corroborated .

HEDGE funds had a brilliant first half of 2008 , outperforming Wall Street by 12 percentage points .
Hedge funds had an awful six months , producing their worst return on record .
Depending on your point of view , the same statistics can be used to support both those statements .
And the dichotomy shows how confused the image of the industry has become .
One leftish British columnist recently described how he believed that hedge funds work .
“ They set out to make a return of 30 % a year any way they can in no -holds - barred , hyper - aggressive financial gambling , ” he wrote .
By his standards , the average fund 's loss of 0.75 % in the first six months of the year , according to Hedge Fund Research , was a dismal failure .
But this is not how most hedge funds operate any more .
Gone are the days when their main client base was wealthy individuals .
Now hedge funds are trying to market themselves to pension funds and endowments .
What those clients want is a controlled balance between risk and reward , and a return that is not correlated with conventional stockmarkets .
Given that the S&P 500 index lost 12.8 % over the first half , hedge - fund managers kept that promise .
In truth , any attempt to analyse the hedge - fund industry as a whole runs into the problem that it is not an asset class but a style of fund management .
Hedge Fund Research produces figures for 18 different sectors , from “ short bias ” ( funds that make money from falling share prices ) to “ merger arbitrage ” ( funds that exploit movements in bidders ' and sellers ' share prices ) .
In any given period there are likely to be wide divergences between the returns of the different strategies ; the best sector in the first half beat the worst by more than 20 percentage points .
As a result , risk has a lot of different potential meanings for hedge - fund investors .
They could opt for a strategy that is out of favour .
They could choose a manager on the basis of a track record that has been driven by luck or by the excessive use of borrowed money .
At the extreme , they could pick a manager who has relied on fraud .
That helps explain two trends in the industry .
The first is concentration : the assets of the 100 largest funds rose from 47 % of the industry in 2002 to 66 % in 2007 , according to GAM , an asset manager .
Just as no - one used to get fired for buying IBM computers , no one can be blamed for picking funds run by big managers such as Highbridge or D.E. Shaw .
The second is a reliance on funds - of - funds .
It takes an awful lot of due diligence to assess a hedge - fund manager ; pension funds and endowments may well feel it is better left to an expert .
In the first quarter of the year , the number of individual hedge funds in existence fell slightly ( from 7,634 to 7,601 ) ; more funds gave up the ghost than were created .
But a net 110 funds - of - funds came into existence .
The problem for clients is that the expertise of a fund - of - funds manager requires an extra layer of fees .
Those costs turned the net return of a fund - of - funds investor into a loss of 2.3 % in the first half .
For most institutional clients that use the hedge - fund industry , the real risk is not that they will lose their shirts .
It is that the combination of high fees and diversified portfolios will result in mediocre returns .
Clients may slowly be waking up to that reality .
Even though the average hedge fund easily beat equities , the flow of money into the sector in the first half of the year was just $ 29 billion , down from $ 118 billion in the first six months of 2007 .
The headlong growth of the industry , which took it from $ 39 billion of assets in 1990 to more than $ 1.9 trillion at the end of June , may be over for a year or two .
This is not just down to a lack of enthusiasm among clients .
In such difficult markets , traders are less likely to desert the haven of an investment bank for the hard slog of starting their own fund .
And the credit crunch means banks are less willing to give hedge funds the kind of leverage they need to create double - digit returns .
Strikingly , the only sector that really drew in the punters in the first half of the year was “ global macro ” .
Such funds take the kind of big bets on currencies and markets that made the names of George Soros and Julian Robertson .
Having dominated the industry in the 1980s and the 1990s , global macro funds fell out of favour towards the tail of the dotcom boom .
They are now only a small part of the industry .
Astute global macro managers had two great trends to follow in the first half of 2008 , betting in favour of commodities and against financials .
By and large , they got those trends right .
Ironically , the managers thought to be the riskiest have proved to be the best hedges this year .

Before I ’d arrived at this dark , back - alley restaurant in Tokyo , I ’d been told that trust was the most crucial element involved when choosing a fugu chef .
It was like selecting a heart surgeon or a private pilot .
“ The fugu chef has your life in his hands , ” one of my Japanese friends had said .
Which is why my first impulse , upon greeting Mr. Naohisa Hashimoto , is to turn around , in the most diplomatic possible way , of course , and run screaming back to my hotel .
Hashimoto is dressed in a white chef ’s coat that ’s slightly stained around the pockets with fish guts .
He has a spiky haircut , like the wires on a brush , and big , prominent ears , which give him a passing resemblance to Don Knotts .
His little restaurant , called Mukoujima Hashimoto , is located on a lonely residential street in the working - class Sumida section of Tokyo ( “ If we are in New York , this is Queens , ” my interpreter says ) , a tidy establishment with just three low - slung tables set over tatami matting .
The chef lives above his place , like an old - time saloon keeper .
Only tonight , there are no sounds of clattering pots coming from upstairs , no comforting pitter - patter of tiny children ’s feet .
There are no waiters , either ; no dishwashers , no friendly neighbors dropping by for a cup of tea .
As every food - obsessed traveler knows , the first rule when looking for a decent meal in a strange place is to choose a crowded room .
But on this April Friday evening in otherwise bustling Tokyo , this curious little fugu restaurant is as empty as a tomb .
Still addled by jet lag , I ’d come to Mukoujima Hashimoto feeling disoriented , a little frazzled , and also in a blinding rainstorm , much the way , it later occurred to me , Janet Leigh had arrived at the Bates Motel .
Blowfish ( fugu is derived from “ fuku , ” which means “ to blow ” in Japanese ) is mainly a winter delicacy in Japan ( the season runs from October to early spring ) , so many of the city ’s more prominent fugu houses were either closed or had begun serving inferior farm - raised , or “ caged , ” blowfish .
Several calls around the fugu network by my interpreter , Shinji Nohara , had revealed that Chef Hashimoto had just returned from Tokyo ’s famous Tsukiji fish market with a prime tora , or “ tiger , ” fugu , caught in the waters off Miyazaki prefecture , in southern Japan .
Even better , tonight , I ’ve been told , he ’ll be serving that most prized portion of the fugu anatomy known as shira - ko , a .k.a. the engorged fugu sperm sac .
Tiger fugu is considered the filet mignon of blowfish , coveted , according to the twisted logic of fugu connoisseurs , for both its distinctive flavor and its unparalleled concentration of lethal toxins .
And the shira - ko is among the most potentially fatal parts of the famously poisonous fish .
Of all the dishes served in all the restaurants in all the world , you could argue , the particular seafood delicacy I ’ve come fourteen time zones and 6,800 miles to ingest is the one that ’s most likely to kill me dead .
Among the intrepid TV hosts and iron - stomached bloggers who span the globe looking for horrible things to eat , a potentially deadly blowfish dinner is a badge of honor , the thrill - seeking gastronome ’s equivalent to scaling Mount Everest .
Anthony Bourdain made a de rigueur fugu stop in Tokyo for his madcap food travel show A Cook ’s Tour .
In his engaging chronicle The Year of Eating Dangerously , the British food critic Tom Parker Bowles ( the son of Prince Charles ’s wife , Camilla Parker Bowles ) manages to fit his death - defying fugu experience in between a barbecued - rib cook - off in Tennessee and a nutritious helping of boiled dog in South Korea .
“ A six - pound tiger fugu has enough poison to take out at least 32 healthy adults , ” writes the daredevil Englishman with barely suppressed glee .
Ruth Reichl has sampled deadly fugu ( “ It ’s like eating fluke , ” she told me , “ only you ’re playing Russian roulette ” ) , as has Homer Simpson ( the much - loved episode put the dish on the American cultural map ) .
The dish used to be confined , thankfully , to Japan , but adventurous diners can now enjoy it in the States ( Philadelphia , Chicago , and L.A. all have restaurants that serve fugu ) , though not in Europe , where it ’s largely still banned .
Something like a ton of blowfish is imported every year to New York , where fugu now appears , seasonally , on the menus of the city ’s elite Japanese restaurants .
At Morimoto , in the meatpacking district , a creation called “ Fried Fugu Bone ” sometimes appears on Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto ’s elaborate chef ’s - choice omakase menu .
And the great sushi chef Masa Takayama serves fugu , sometimes the sperm sac , on the $ 400 fixed - price menu at his eponymous Time Warner Center restaurant .
After a long , sedentary career grazing smugly in the world ’s finest restaurants , I thought it was time that I did a little daredevil eating of my own .
I could have visited Morimoto or Masa for my fugu dinner , but the dirty little secret of the fugu fish served in New York is this :
Despite what those who sell it or consume it may wish you to believe , it is almost certainly safe to eat .
Restaurants serving blowfish in this country must buy it from a single Food and Drug Administration –approved supplier , Wako International , which imports all the fugu sold in the United States .
The imported fugu is cleaned in a processing plant in Shimonoseki , in southwestern Japan , by workers with a decade or more of experience in this delicate craft .
The meat is then inspected and frozen for its flight across the Pacific .
By the time it arrives in New York ( where it ’s inspected again ) , the fish is probably less toxic than a piece of mercury - saturated tuna sushi at your local Korean deli .
At Mukoujima Hashimoto , by contrast , my tiger fugu was purchased at the market , then cleaned by Hashimoto in his kitchen sink .
That ’s it .
One man , one fish , no processing plants , no nosy government inspectors .
My life was , in fact , in Hashimoto ’s hands .
For true fugu addicts , this is the only way to experience the thrilling , near - death pleasure of the real thing .
My wife was n’t so sure about my plan .
“ You ca n’t do that ! ” she said , when I told her that I would be dining on the notorious Japanese puffer fish .
“ It ’s supposed to be perfectly safe . ”
“ Poison sperm sacs ? ! ”
“ They say it ’s not so bad . ”
“ Think of your children ! ”
After trawling the Internet , late at night , searching for information about this grisly little fish , I had to admit she had a point .
Blowfish , or puffer fish , are found in oceans all over the world , and often gather in brackish , coastal waters at the mouths of great rivers .
Not all blowfish are deadly ( there are over 100 varieties , about 30 of which are found in Japan ) , but the deadly ones are very deadly indeed .
Tetrodotoxin is the name of the poison that collects in the fish , especially in the liver and ovaries .
The compound is thought to be produced by shellfish that blowfish , notorious bottom - feeders , are fond of consuming .
Tetrodotoxin can cause a pleasing numbing sensation when eaten in tiny amounts , but if you ingest too much of the substance , nothing pleasant at all happens .
The symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning include dizziness , exhaustion , and nausea .
Eventually your muscles begin to freeze — first your lips and tongue , then the tips of your fingers , then your hands , then your arms and legs , and finally your heart and lungs .
Victims typically remain conscious , but are eventually paralyzed and can’t move or speak .
( In parts of Japan , legend has it , the bodies of fugu - overdose victims were once laid beside their open caskets for several days to ensure that they were not being buried alive . )
The amount of tetrodotoxin required to kill a man can fit on the head of a pin .
Tetrodotoxin poisoning has no known cure .
Blowfish bones have been excavated in shell mounds in Japan going back more than 2,000 years , and the Japanese remain by far the world ’s largest consumers of the fish , eating an estimated 10,000 tons of it each year .
The country ’s ravenous appetite for fugu is , in part , a simple function of taste .
Connoisseurs say that fugu , an extremely lean fish , has a pure , almost pristine freshness .
“ Cleanliness , ” says chef Masa .
“ That ’s the special fugu umami . ” ( Umami translates literally as a savory Japanese flavor , but the term connotes a kind of mystical deliciousness . )
But much of fugu ’s allure , of course , comes from its air of danger .
As the owner of a fugu museum in Osaka once put it , “ Human beings are funny .
They want to eat what is forbidden . ”
Japanese poets have penned tragic verses referencing fugu ( “ I can not see her tonight / I have to give her up /
So I will eat fugu , ” goes one work by the eighteenth - century haikuist Yosa Buson ) , and the dish was once so popular that during the Tokugawa and Meiji periods ( 1603 –1912 ) , Japanese authorities banned people from eating it .
In modern Japan , it ’s still illegal to serve fugu to the emperor .
The center of the country ’s modern blowfish industry is Shimonoseki , a bustling fishing town known in travel brochures as Fugu City .
Most of the country ’s live catch comes through there , and many more fish are raised in great aqua - farms off the coast .
Only specially licensed chefs are allowed to prepare and sell fugu .
The famous fugu “ licensing exam ” is typically given in the summertime , when the fish are smaller and therefore harder to identify .
Applicants must pass a written exam , differentiate poison fugu species from nonpoisonous ones , identify which parts of the fugu are and are n’t toxic , and clean the fish correctly in front of board of health inspectors .
The trick to preparing the fish safely involves separating the fillets and the other edible parts from the toxic innards without tainting the flesh with so much as a speck of poison .
First , the fins and tail of the fish are cut off , then an incision is made down the back , so that the skin can be peeled away , like a banana ’s .
Next , the poisonous entrails are removed and the head is cut in half so that the fugu ’s eyes can be taken out , since they ’re poisonous , too .
Many fugu chefs perform these delicate tasks wearing rubber gloves .
The traditional fugu - hiki knife they use is a long , sinister - looking implement designed for getting the maximum amount of flesh from the small and expensive fish .
The chefs who pass the exam are given a certificate that must be displayed at their restaurants .
Because people have died foraging in garbage cans behind fugu restaurants , and because fugu innards can be used as a poison , chefs must , by law , keep the fish entrails in a container at their restaurant , under lock and key .
In Tokyo , the containers are taken to fish markets , where city authorities incinerate them .
Despite these precautions , “ accidents , ” the euphemism fugu professionals tend to use when discussing the perils of their trade , still happen .
According to the Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health in Tokyo , 315 cases of poison by fugu were reported between 1996 and 2005 in Japan , 31 of which were fatal .
Most victims were fishermen engaging in Russian - roulette - style bouts of fugu consumption , or amateur cooks who were trying to duplicate cooking demonstrations they ’d seen on TV .
The most notorious death by fugu was in Kyoto , in January 1975 , when a Kabuki actor named Mitsugoro Bando VIII overdosed on the fish ’s deadly liver .
Chefs are now prohibited from serving fugu liver , but the pushy Bando is said to have demanded the delicacy , eaten four servings , and died .
At Mukoujima Hashimoto , I take off my shoes and attempt , with a kind of origami delicateness , to fold my giant lumberjack frame into one of the tiny tables .
Except for Shinji and myself , the room remains ominously deserted .
A cooking show flickers silently on the old TV : Antic Tokyo starlets are learning to cook from a dour gentleman wearing a tall chef ’s hat .
“ Where the hell is everybody ? ” I whisper to Shinji .
“ Maybe it ’s the rain , ” he replies .
“ Or maybe Chef Hashimoto has killed them . ”
My interpreter grins a merry grin .
Shinji is a food writer and former law student who specializes in guiding jet - lagged foreigners on exotic culinary pilgrimages around Tokyo .
He is also something of a fugu promoter , having introduced Anthony Bourdain to the dish when the nomad chef came through town for his TV show .
Like most Japanese , Shinji says fugu is generally safe , and he likes to poke fun at what he considers the hysterical foreign caricature of the dish .
“ We do n’t think about the poison , ” he says .
Fugu ’s appeal , he believes , stems from a different primal force .
“ It ’s seasonal , it ’s ceremonial , and it ’s expensive , so you can impress the girls . ”
As we wait for our first course , I ask Shinji how Bourdain handled his fugu ordeal .
The chef ate his fugu with gusto , Shinji says , although Shinji had suspicions that the fish they ’d been served was actually raised in a cage and therefore possibly not so dangerous after all ( because they ’re raised in a controlled environment , on a controlled diet , farmed fugu are believed by some people to be less lethal than fresh - caught ) .
“ Bourdain was n’t ever going to die ? ! ”
“ I do n’t know , ” he says with smile .
“ Maybe not . ”
But Shinji is certain about the potential deadliness of my dinner .
We ’d spent the day touring fugu establishments around Tokyo , and he ’d been on his cell phone the whole time , searching the city for the last lethal fish of the season .
He ’d never met Hashimoto before tonight , or even heard of his little restaurant , but now that he ’s found his tiger fugu , he ’s a happy man .
“ I suppose if someone wanted to murder you , they would bring you here , ” he says , between sips of sake .
“ We are in a strange neighborhood , you are far from home , there are no witnesses , and nobody knows you are here .
It ’s the perfect situation ! ”
In Tokyo , there are mass - marketed fugu chain restaurants and elite , ceremonial ones , like Ajiman , in Roppongi , where the multicourse omakase dinner can cost $ 450 per person .
At Mukoujima Hashimoto , the elaborate “ All Natural ” prix fixe option costs a relatively modest $ 150 .
But at the chef ’s suggestion , we order a six - course , à la carte , greatest - hits menu , one that includes fugu sashimi ( fugu - sashi ) , fried fugu ribs ( fugu kara - age ) , smoked fugu fins in sake ( fugu hire - zake ) , hot fugu porridge ( fugu - nabe ) , and the fugu sperm sac ( shira - ko ) , which will be served two ways , raw and lightly grilled .
According to my already unsteady notes , the first course of our fugu dinner begins at precisely 8:13 p.m .
In accordance with fugu custom , Hashimoto has sliced the precious shreds of fish so thin that you can see the blue - and - white patterns on the china plate underneath .
The fish has been arranged in concentric circles to resemble a chrysanthemum , which , as Shinji happily explains , is the funeral flower of Japan .
Shinji begins to eat .
I ceremoniously drain another glass of sake , then take my first hesitant bite of the raw fish .
Hashimoto ’s fugu indeed has a certain clean sashimi quality to it , and a resilient chewiness , but otherwise it ’s a letdown .
It tastes flavorless and gummy , like a cross between Reichl ’s fluke and day - old squid .
For a second or two , I begin to relax .
I ’m feeling a little smug , even .
This is the legendary fugu ?
This is the dish that poets and emperors have risked their lives over the centuries to eat ?
It ’s one of the most boring , most tedious , most un - fishy fish I ’ve ever tasted .
If there ’s any poison , I ca n’t taste that either , and the tremulous heart palpitations and gathering dread that have been building since early this morning begin to melt away .
Hashimoto is watching , so I dip more of the fish in the ponzu sauce and chew it , politely nodding and grinning to show my appreciation .
And then the tingling sensation begins .
It starts on my lips and seems to be quickly tracking down the back of my throat .
I put down my chopsticks and shift my legs under the table .
I bring the tips of my fingers to my mouth and begin touching my lips in a tender , slightly agitated way , like a dental patient shot full of Novocain .
“ Do your lips feel numb ? ” I ask Shinji .
“ My lips do n’t feel numb ! ” he cries , between enthusiastic bites of fugu flesh .
“ Oh God . ”
“ What ’s the problem ? ”
“ Do n’t people get numb lips when they eat fugu , ” I hear myself say .
“ Or does that mean I ’m going to die ? ”
By now Hashimoto is aware that I ’m a restaurant critic from New York , and he ’s hovering over the table , looking on in his fish - stained coat .
Shibireru is the Japanese word for “ to become numb , ” and within fugu circles its presence , during the course of the meal , is a matter of debate .
In his book , Parker Bowles writes that a fugu chef ’s skill lies in removing the liver and ovaries intact while “ leaving the slightest trace of poison to gently numb the lips . ”
He goes on to say , however , that “ many gourmands disagree , arguing that the numbing of the lips is urban myth . ”
Hashimoto favors the urban - myth theory .
He suggests that in my excitement , I am probably experiencing a kind of phantom shibireru .
Because of the intensity of the fugu ’s poison , if I were feeling real numbness , my situation would be dire indeed .
“ It is your mind playing tricks , ” the chef says .
“ If your lips are really numb , then nobody can save you .
If your lips are really numb , Mr. Platt , then you are already dead . ”
To attempt to calm my nerves , I order one glass of beer , then another .
But the small room feels even smaller now .
A sheen of flop sweat has collected on my forehead , and my heart is racing like a baboon ’s .
Trying not to act like the terror - stricken foreigner undergoing the classic fugu near - death experience , I take out my notebook and begin professionally asking the chef about his trade .
He tells me he has been preparing the fish since 1986 , when he began working part time at a fugu restaurant while studying sociology in college .
“ I always wanted to be a craftsman , ” Hashimoto says , “ and this is a lot more exciting than sociology . ”
Did he have a favorite part of the fugu experience ?
“ I like every part of the dinner , ” says the chef .
“ You do n’t go to the circus just to see the tigers ; you go to the circus to enjoy the whole show . ”
“ Where the hell is everybody ? ” I whisper to my interpreter in the empty restaurant .
“ Maybe it ’s the rain , ” he replies .
“ Or maybe Chef Hashimoto has killed them . ”
More sake is served , followed by more beer , followed by our next course , which is a little helping of deep - fried fugu ribs .
The bony ribs ( “ These look like hamster ribs , ” I tell Shinji ) are hacked in little pieces , tossed in flour , and seasoned with sea salt and a sprinkling of the dried kelp called kombu .
The ribs have the nice meaty texture of monkfish , they ’re perfectly fried , and they ’re delicious .
( This may simply prove that anything tastes good fried , including bony , potentially fatal fish ribs . )
I eat several of them , trying not to focus on the phantom - shibireru sensation that now seems to be creeping , inexorably , toward my lungs and heart .
I ’m moved , between bites , to ask Hashimoto whether there has ever been a fugu “ accident ” in his restaurant .
Shinji translates my question , and the chef says something that causes the two dignified Japanese gentlemen to laugh out loud .
“ Chef Hashimoto says if someone had an accident in his restaurant , he would n’t tell you , because it would be bad for business , ” says Shinji .
“ But do n’t worry , there was an American in here a few weeks ago , and he did n’t have an accident . ”
“ That ’s good . ”
“ But Mr. Hashimoto thinks you should know something . ”
“ What ’s that ? ”
“ That other American , he did n’t eat fugu sperm sac . ”
With the possible exception of the illicit liver , no part of the fugu creates quite the same flutter of excitement among blowfish lovers as the fugu sperm sac .
The literal translation of shira - ko is “ white babies . ”
( “ In Japan , ” Shinji tells me , “ we have many ways of avoiding direct expression . ” )
In fugu circles , it ’s considered an exotic seasonal treat :
Because the fish spawn in early spring , the delicacy appears only briefly , like the white truffles from Alba that fill the grand New York restaurants every fall .
The appeal of the dish , according to Chef Masa , comes in part from its pure , milky texture ( “ It ’s smooth , ” he says , “ like Brie cheese ” ) and its obvious overtones of virility .
But the dish ’s most enticing quality is its extra touch of lethality .
It ’s the only edible part of the fugu innards , and when not fully engorged , the sperm sac looks uncannily like a set of the deadly fugu ovaries .
“ If you eat fresh ovary by mistake , ” says Hashimoto , “ then you die . ”
Any extreme - food expert will tell you that the best way to dine on a roasted grasshopper in Mexico , say , or a shot of snake blood in Laos , is to do it quickly .
But as Shinji and I await our sperm sac , it occurs to me that the unique thing about the fugu experience , aside from the omnipresent thrill of near death , is the drawn - out , almost leisurely quality of the ordeal .
Slowly , implacably , the tension level is ratcheted higher and higher , until the only option is to keep digging in with gusto or to put down your chopsticks and flee .
Did I contemplate this shameful option when the shira - ko made its appearance at our table ?
In the throes of my phantom shibireru , maybe I did .
After all , my throat had begun to tingle well before the arrival of the dreaded sperm sac .
But at this point the meal has an almost ceremonial quality to it , and I ’m too far inside this strange culinary fun house to quit .
Presently , Hashimoto returns from his little kitchen with what looks like two glistening plastic bags of condensed milk .
He wants us to see the real thing , the raw , unadulterated delicacy , before he starts preparing his dish .
The shira - ko are as white as snow , bouncy to the touch , and disturbingly large , about the size of a pair of healthy water balloons .
As I peer uncomfortably at these wet , slippery , very distended objects , it occurs to me that in a career of diligent and generally indiscriminate eating , these might possibly be the strangest food items I ’ve ever been served .
As we examine them politely , however , Shinji ’s eyes light up .
“ That ’s a really nice sperm sac , ” he says .
The raw version is presented first , in elegant china bowls , with ground radish , bits of green onion , salt , chile , and a few drops of tart , lime - flavored ponzu sauce .
Soy - based ponzu is one of the key ingredients in the fugu experience ( as with barbecue sauce , every chef has his own , closely guarded recipe ) , and Hashimoto proudly tells me about his version ( soy , vinegar , a type of lime called dai dai , and bonito flakes ) , as I gingerly lift the shira - ko with my chopsticks and put it on the tip of my tongue .
I ’m tempted to say the dish I came halfway around the world to eat is disgusting , but it is n’t quite .
It has a clean , creamy consistency , like Masa says , but the taste is so subtle that there ’s really no taste at all .
The pleasures of the dish , if there are any , are all textural .
“ How is it ? ” asks Shinji .
“ It ’s very strange . ”
“ Ha , ha , ha , ha , ” laughs Shinji .
He ’s amused by my predicament , and already a little drunk on sperm sac .
The tingling feeling in the back of my throat is now reaching defcon 2 levels .
It feels less phantom with every bite .
Was this , at long last , my restaurant critic ’s Armageddon , my last meal on earth ?
I might have been better off that way .
It turns out that the unpleasantness of raw sperm sac is mild compared to the horrors of the cooked version .
The grilled shira - ko is cut into bite - size pieces , gently browned over an open flame , and served to us piping hot on a small china plate garnished with a single shiso leaf .
“ We look for the perfect color , the perfect texture , ” says Hashimoto , “ but sometimes the taste is very subtle , even for me . ”
I pop the grilled fish - sac morsel into my mouth , but it ’s too hot to swallow ; so I bite into it , and the hot milt bursts out in a most unnerving , even horrible way .
It tastes like warm curds of milk , but without any of the pleasing , milky flavor .
I put down my chopsticks and begin to scribble absently in my note book .
“ Feeling disoriented , a little panicky , ” read my notes , before trailing off into an illegible scrawl .
Fugu victims , I had heard , get their stomachs pumped and are force - fed charcoal to absorb the poison .
I have images of harried doctors brandishing long green tubes , my face seized in a charcoal - covered grin .
I retreat for a minute to the coffin - size restroom .
I stare in the mirror , and gnaw at my possibly lifeless tongue , like a cow chewing its cud .
I attempt to collect myself before I return to the table , but it ’s no use .
I ’m in the midst of a full - blown paranoid fugu meltdown .
I ask Hashimoto for some more sake , and then , by mistake , pour it into the ponzu sauce .
“ Chef Hashimoto wants to know how you like this dish , ” says Shinji .
“ I do n’t think I like grilled sperm sac , ” I say .
“ Chef Hashimoto is not surprised , ” says Shinji .
“ Chef Hashimoto says shira - ko is an acquired taste . ”
I ’d like to report that my fugu experience ended there , but it did not .
Pickled ovaries are another esoteric fugu specialty ( they ’re only edible if soaked in salt for long periods ) , but mercifully , Chef Hashimoto is out of them tonight .
Instead , we are presented with cups of warm sake infused with smoked fugu tails ( “ like a warm sardine milk shake , ” according to my notes ) , an acquired taste even Shinji ca n’t seem to stomach .
The final course , fugu - nabe , is a kind of porridge , made at the table with the remnants of the fish , including the tail , the spine , and the eyeless skull .
After the neurotic drama of the early courses , the comforting stew is designed to calm the nerves , and it also gives Mr. Hashimoto a chance to display his skills as cook .
He adds watercress and rice to a bubbling clay pot at our table , then breaks an egg into it .
He scatters the steamy mixture with cabbage and fresh chives , then ladles it into white porcelain bowls .
The porridge is aromatic and subtly flavored , the perfect antidote for a rainy night .
Shinji grins his merry grin .
He likes this place ; he might even bring his girlfriend here , he says .
And gradually , as we sip our warm fugu - nabe , the jangling phantom - shibireru sensation I ’ve been experiencing gives way to a peaceful , post - adrenaline calm .
I drink a cup of green tea , and we call for the check .
Outside the restaurant , the rain has stopped , and the people of Sumida are out in the streets again .
We thank Hashimoto and walk back to Shinji ’s car , past a flower store and a tailor sewing an elaborate silk kimono in the window of his shop .
After a memorable dinner , the usual emotions are contentment , pleasure , and , on rare occasions , even delight .
But this was something different .
Is the notorious Japanese fugu worth dying for ?
Of course not .
Is it worth eating ?
That depends on your point of view .
In my professional opinion , there are plenty of things that taste better than blowfish .
But with fugu , perhaps , taste is not the point .
Now that my meal is over , I feel like I ’ve finished the culinary equivalent of bungee jumping , or shooting class - V rapids in an inner tube .
My primary emotion is n’t excitement , or even satisfaction ; it ’s relief .
Maybe it ’s the sake , or the four bottles of beer , but somehow , after my brush with mortality , everything looks fresher , more vivid , a little more alive .
“ Congratulations , you ’re not dead yet , ” says Shinji , as we drive back to my hotel on the freeway , gliding over the rooftops of the city .
For a minute or two , we drive along in a peaceful , even pleasant silence .
Then an idea occurs to me .
“ I ’m hungry , ” I say .
“ Let ’s go get some dessert . ”
At least a dozen British towns and cities will have no single ethnic group in a majority within the next 30 years .
Leicester will become the first ' super - diverse ' city in 2020 , then Birmingham in 2024 , followed by Slough and Luton , according to a new study of population trends in the UK .
The report reveals that Leicester has seen the proportion of its white population fall from 70.1 per cent in 1991 to 59.5 per cent today .
By 2016 the white population will make up 52.2 per cent of the population , falling to 44.5 per cent by 2026 .
' Britain is becoming ever more plural ; our diversity ever more diverse , ' said Danny Dorling , professor of human geography at the University of Sheffield , whose predictions are based on the most comprehensive study into the country 's population trends .
' This increased diversity is most evident in its cities , with plurality becoming commonplace . '
The immigrant and ethnic populations are no longer characterised by large , well organised Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities , said Dorling .
Instead , increasing numbers come from countries scattered across the globe - from Germany to Guyana , from Sweden to Singapore .
' It is going to become increasingly difficult to generalise about Britain 's plurality because different cities are experiencing different levels and types of diversity , ' he said .
' This creates a complex challenge for those responsible for successfully managing the country 's changing population . '
In the Thirties , the proportion of people living in Britain who were born in foreign countries was 2.5 per cent .
Typically these individuals came from one of 15 countries , in particular Ireland and India .
Today more than 10 per cent of the population were born abroad , with no single ethnic group dominating .
Sukhvinder Stubbs , chief executive of the Barrow Cadbury Trust , which commissioned Dorling 's research , said the findings indicate key challenges facing Britain , including a need to reframe the immigration debate and to focus on the changing pressure on the country 's resources .
' For Britain 's major urban centres , ethnic diversity is the reality , ' she said .
' Regardless of future immigration patterns , it is just a matter of time until cities such as Birmingham become plural .
Even if we prohibited another single soul from entering the country , the trends have already laid root . '
In the period from 1991 to 2026 , which will see Leicester 's white population fall from 70.1 per cent to 44.5 per cent , the city 's second largest ethnic group , Indians , is predicted to rise from 22.9 per cent to 26 per cent .
The Pakistani population will triple to 3.3 per cent , while the proportion of Africans will rise from 0.4 per cent in 1991 to 11.2 per cent .
Birmingham 's transition to plural city status will , however , be markedly different to Leicester 's , added Dorling .
The proportion of white people in its population will fall from 77 per cent to 47.7 per cent .
But while much of Leicester 's growth in ethnic minorities will be driven by African growth , Birmingham 's population shift will be dominated by those of Pakistani descent .
Dorling 's research also looks at the shifts in population patterns in towns that are not expected to become plural in the foreseeable future .
Oldham , for example , will remain a town with an overwhelmingly white population .
However , it will witness a significant change in its demographic profile , with the town 's white population falling from more than 90 per cent to 74.4 per cent in the 30 years from 1991 .
' Contrary to popular opinion , Oldham 's ethnic minority population is not homogeneous , ' said Dorling .
' The town 's second largest ethnic group after whites is Pakistani , but by 2021 there are likely to be as many Bangladeshis in Oldham as there are Pakistanis . '
Dorling 's research also shows that , although Greater London 's population is already significantly diverse with a white population of 67.5 per cent , it is not likely to become plural in the near future .
By 2026 the white population is predicted to reach 60.7 per cent , with just eight of London 's 33 local authority areas predicted to become plural .
King Tut 's Curse !

We 've all heard the story of the mummy 's curse , and we 've all heard the popular explanation — but you may not know the numbers behind the story .
Today we 're going to point our skeptical eye at King
Tut 's curse , and find out exactly how the story goes , explore the scientific - sounding explanation proposed by the media , and finally , we 're going to look at what really happened .
In 1922 Howard Carter was exploring the Valley of the Kings in Egypt , with his friend and financial backer George Herbert , the 5th Earl of Carnarvon .
After a 15 year search , they opened the fabulous tomb of King Tutankhamun , the most spectacular tomb found to date , and now known as KV62 .
Carter poked a hole through the seal and peered inside , and when Lord Carnarvon asked if he could see anything , Carter famously replied " Yes , wonderful things . "
But things got less wonderful rather quickly , so the story goes .
Front and center in the antechamber was a clay tablet , deciphered by one of Carter 's colleagues , that read : Death will slay with his wings whoever disturbs the peace of the pharaoh .
None of them seemed too concerned about Death 's wings , because the archaeologists immediately proceeded to apply their early 20th century archaeological ignorance to King Tut and his goodies .
Items were collected and broken , and even King Tut 's mummy itself was said to have been chopped into pieces and set out in the sun where it quickly deteriorated .
According to legend , Lord Carnarvon soon died from a mosquito bite ; and simultaneously , his three - legged dog howled and dropped dead , and all the lights in the city of Cairo suddenly went out .
And then others of Carter 's party began to die of mysterious causes .
In fact , more than two dozen men were said to have fallen to the curse .
Carter himself , it appears , had to suffer the fate of watching all his friends and associates drop off like flies all around him .
Even his beloved pet canary was killed by a cobra in a freak incident .
The newspapers trumpeted the terrors of the mummy 's curse to all the world .
Carter bore these miseries until he finally died himself , sixteen years after unleashing the curse .
Now the critical mind can easily find many causes for skepticism with this story :
First , the accounts of the curse all come from 1920 's - era newspapers , well known for sensationalism and expansion of facts to make great headlines .
Reliable records of what happened to Carter 's people after they left the dig are hard to come by .
References to the simultaneous death of dogs , the canary , and the lights going out in Cairo are found only in these unreliable newspaper reports and so can be considered anecdotal at best .
Second , Lord Carnarvon was known to be in pretty frail health at the time , and infection was a common cause of death .
He had aggravated the mosquito bite on his cheek while shaving , and developed erysipelas resulting in septicemia and pneumonia .
There was no curse needed to explain the dangers of these conditions .
Third , the explanation that the curse 's effect on Carter himself was to leave him alive and well while others died is clearly a post - hoc rationalization .
Sure , I suppose it 's possible that Carter 's long healthy life could be evidence of a curse , but the lack of an effective curse is probably a better explanation for it .
Fourth , and this goes back again to the pulp - fiction nature of the newspapers of the era , is the inconsistencies among various versions of the tale , notably the alleged stone tablet bearing the curse .
It should be noted that there is no record of any written curse , either in Carter 's own documents or in any modern collections ; at least not associated with Tutankhamun 's tomb specifically .
Another post - hoc rationalization exists to explain the absence of a written record :
It was expunged to avoid frightening the locals .
Again , a better explanation is that such a written curse did not exist .
One of the first people to present a serious scientific explanation for the deaths associated with King Tut 's curse was Dr. Caroline Stenger - Phillip , who proposed in 1986 that ancient mold in the tomb could have caused potentially fatal allergic reactions .
Since fruits and vegetables and other organic items were buried in tombs , and since the tombs were completely hermetically sealed , it is plausible that mold spores could have existed and remained viable through the millennia .
This proposal has become known as " tomb toxins " , and has been broadened to include other compounds , such as two molds that are found on ancient mummies , Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus , and that can be potentially harmful to people with weakened immune systems .
Bacteria are also found in tombs , including Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus .
And do n't forget the chemicals used in embalming the mummies : ammonia , formaldehyde , and hydrogen sulfide .
Tomb toxins do sound like a plausible explanation for the mummy 's curse .
Most of us have heard this explanation at one time or another and thought " Ah , that explains it quite neatly . "
But unfortunately , tomb toxins do not explain the deaths from Carter 's group very well at all .
Even in the unlikely event that members of Carter 's party received lethal doses of any or all of the above , such death would have followed quite quickly ; it would n't have been delayed by the months or years reported among the victims of King Tut 's curse .
Even Lord Carnarvon 's death , the one most closely associated with the curse , occurred six months after he entered the tomb .
Another problem with the tomb toxin explanation is that it sounds good to a layperson , but it is , in fact , armchair science .
It 's a reasonably plausible idea , but one that has never actually happened in the real world .
National Geographic is among those who have delved into this subject in detail , and found that working Egyptologists are not concerned about the possibility of tomb toxins .
They 've never heard of any colleagues suffering from it ; thousands of tourists go in and out of the tombs every day with no ill effects , and even when Egyptologists do wear masks during excavations it 's because of dust , not tomb toxins .
F. DeWolfe Miller , professor of epidemiology at the University of Hawaii said " Given the sanitary conditions of the time in general , and those within Egypt in particular , Lord Carnarvon would likely have been safer inside the tomb than outside . "
So we have two things at this point in our investigation : First , really weak and primarily anecdotal evidence that anything unusual happened ; and second , a hypothesized cause that turns out to be quite a poor fit for the observed data .
King
Tut 's curse is beginning to look about as withered up as he looks himself .
In 2002 , the British Medical Journal published a study by Dr. Mark Nelson from Monash University in Australia .
He decided to take a statistical look at the people who were actually there , and see if their dates of death actually were accelerated as a result of exposure to any possible curse .
He performed a retrospective cohort study , which is a specific type of analysis based on medical records of certain groups of people .
Nelson considered only the Westerners in Carter 's party , since there was a difference in life expectancy between Westerners and Egyptians .
He defined " exposure to the curse " as participation in any of four specific events where sacred seals were breached in the tomb , the sarcophagus , and the mummy itself .
And then the number crunching began .
To better understand these results , it 's necessary to comprehend what 's meant by a " p- value " .
It 's a term used by statisticians , and it refers to the probability that your test results could be due to normal random variations .
A p-value of 0 , the lowest possible , means there 's a 0 % chance that your test results are due to normal random variances , so low p-values generally mean that your results are significant .
A p-value of 1 , the highest possible , means that your results are 100 % consistent with what we'd expect to see from normal random variations , therefore your results are quite probably insignificant .
Of 44 Westerners present , 25 were exposed to the curse .
Those 25 lived to an average age of 70 , while those not exposed lived to 75 .
The p-value of this difference was .87 , so there 's an 87 % chance that this difference was merely due to chance .
Average survival after the date of exposure was 20.8 years for the exposed group , and 28.9 years for the unexposed group .
While this sounds like a large difference , the p-value was .95 , meaning there 's a 95 % chance that you 'd have such a difference anyway due to random variation .
Nelson 's conclusion : " There was no significant association between exposure to the mummy 's curse and survival and thus no evidence to support the existence of a mummy 's curse . "
So , we end up with one piece of hard , testable evidence : Statistically speaking , nothing unusual happened in the Valley of the Kings ; but pop culture gained one more rich layer of adventure fiction .

( CNN ) -- Authorities have restored order in a county in southern China after demonstrators burned a police station and government building , state - run news agencies reported .
Some of about 10,000 demonstrators overturned cars and set fires to protest the police investigation into the death of a teenage girl , according to the state - run China Daily and the privately owned Hong Kong Cable TV , a CNN affiliate .
It was the latest of several public demonstrations in China , and it came just weeks before China hosts the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing .
The riot started late Saturday afternoon and lasted until early Sunday morning in Weng 'an County of Guizhou Province , the state - run Xinhua news agency reported .
Images broadcast on Hong Kong Cable TV showed several overturned cars in front of buildings in flames .
The station identified the buildings as a police station and government building .
The amateur video images were recorded by bloggers , the station said .
The unrest stemmed from the June 21 death of Li Shu Fan , 15 , Hong Kong Cable TV reported .
Police said the girl killed herself , and they released several suspects , according to the station .
The state - run China Daily newspaper attributed the rioters ' anger to " officials ' alleged attempt to cover up a murder case . "
Armed police guarded the burned - out government buildings Sunday , according to Hong Kong Cable TV , and life appeared to be returning to normal after the latest of several recent public demonstrations .
The unrest comes as China prepares to welcome thousands of international visitors for the Olympic Games , which are scheduled to start August 8 in Beijing .
In March , thousands of anti-Chinese demonstrators rioted in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa .
Estimates of the death toll ranged from 18 to 140 .
Rioters looted businesses and burned homes , stores and vehicles .
Pro-Tibetan demonstrators also dogged the Olympic torch relay in several cities around the world .
In addition , many parents complained about shoddy construction and threatened to sue the government after several schools collapsed during a devastating earthquake that struck southwestern China on May 12 .

It seems no matter where you look these days , there ’s bad news about the US economy .
Does that extend to the budding green collar jobs market as well ?
Yes and no .
I spoke to Nick Ellis , Managing Partner at Bright Green Talent , a US / UK based recruiting agency with a focus on green jobs , and a commitment to walking the talk within their own company as well .
Ellis was frank , encouraging , and insightful .
Well then , what does the green collar jobs market look like ?
From where Ellis sits , there is an enormous demand on the client side ( those looking to hire ) and there is a shortage of green collar job candidates .
Really ?
Yes , and that includes an intriguing factor :
Many of the client companies have set their expectations so high , who they ’re seeking does n’t exist .
An example Nick gave is asking that the candidate have 5 years experience with LEED certification .
Many people may have tremendous experience in techniques and knowledge that falls within the green building realm , but LEED is fairly new , most do n’t have that much experience with LEED specifically yet .
How to remedy this ?
Bright Green
Talent works with clients to give them a more realistic , broader perspective of who might fit what they ’re seeking .
On the job seeker side , they take time to coach their clients how to craft an effective story and resumé .
This a recipe for both parties being much happier with an eventual hire .
But what of this limping economy , it has to have some effect on green collar job prospects , right ?
Yes , and in a different way than you might expect : Ellis says that the credit crisis has resulted in larger , blue chip / Fortune 500 companies scaling back their green efforts , focusing more on their core business .
However , this has provided an opening to smaller , innovative companies to have a bigger pool of talent interested in working for them , when they may have headed straight for the bigger , more obvious targets .
Ellis gave the example of Intel recently reporting average , rather then stellar earnings , and how an engineer from there could perhaps see the strong viability and interest in cleantech companies , and decide to bring their talent there instead .
So cleantech is hot now , but what about the future , the longevity of this excitement ?
Ellis sees a fair amount of consolidation happening , largely driven by VC trends .
For example , silicon is in short supply , and for solar energy companies that were able to place advance orders 3 years ago , they ’re able to float this tight time .
Those that have not are finding themselves either without supplies or spending much more than they anticipated .
They go to VCs looking for additional funding , and find them more risk averse , choosing to give money to more established solar companies , and perhaps to less established , towards being merged with another more solvent player .
The upcoming US presidential election will also shift the clean energy landscape as well in terms of government subsidies , Ellis predicts .
There has been a lot of emphasis on biofuels , but at this point they are proving problematic , in terms of the use of food crops to make them .
Ellis thinks subsidies may shift to Wind power , as it is starting to prove itself viable .
I would agree , as it becomes more efficient with less wind needed , resulting in a less intrusive execution , it will more likely be accepted by a larger number of communities .
And the production of wind turbines is frequently much less toxic than solar panels .
Not all ( green ) recruiting agencies are the same .
But what of Bright Green Talent ?
What makes them different from the scores of recruiting agencies out there , and those that profess to be green focused ?
A lot .
Ellis , who shepherded the January 08 opening of the San Francisco office of BGT , came from an investment banking background , and he ’s parlayed the “ white glove ” customer service standards to this company .
Their orientation , both with clients and candidates is of an ongoing relationship , rather than find a hire , than disappear in search of new commissions .
They also choose to be highly transparent in their interactions , rather then with guarded secrecy .
The clients know what BG is doing , who the talent pool is , and the talent pool is n’t subjected to an under the gun , “ We ’ve got a job , do you want it or not ? ! ” mentality .
Sudden opportunities yes , but placement despite ill fit , no .
The emphasis is less on quantity but quality of placement , so that companies that are just beginning to commit to being greener do n’t feel burned by having talent sent to them that does n’t fit , therefore sabotaging their and others future enthusiasm for going and hiring green .
Finally , BGT as a business is no mere trend rider , seeking to make a huge profit quickly then sell .
Their aim is to grow big , but in a slow , steady manner , on a solid foundation of strong ethics and green internal practices .
This includes hosting their site completely via renewable energy .
Not mere energy credits / offsets .
And they want to engage the broader world via their internal activities like their Green Olympics .
Though slightly tongue in cheek , this competition among and between their London and SF offices , rolling out on Youtube as episodic videos , will serve as a springboard to talk about the environmental impact / possibilities that the Beijing Olympics holds .
The future does appear bright green .

Soaring gasoline prices are hurting Uncle Sam in the wallet too .
As motorists cut back on their driving and buy more fuel - efficient cars , the government is taking in less money from the federal gasoline tax .
The result :
The principal source of funding for highway projects will soon hit a big financial pothole .
The federal highway trust fund could be in the red by $ 3.2 billion or more next year .
The fund , set to finance about $ 40 billion in transportation projects next year , is increasingly strained .
And the problem has taken on greater urgency as lawmakers face a backlog of projects to maintain the nation ’s aging interstate highway system and ease traffic congestion .

“ The situation has only been exacerbated by rising fuel prices , which are causing motorists to drive less and resulting in less revenue for transportation improvements , ” said David Bauer , senior vice president for government relations at the American Road and Transportation Builders Assn .
California risks losing $ 930 million , or about a third of its federal highway allotment , Caltrans Director Will Kempton said in a letter to the state ’s congressional delegation .
Kempton warned that unless Washington acted to address the shortfall , projects could be delayed , reduced or canceled .
In the short run , lawmakers are scrambling to figure out how to close the gap .
Federal highway spending nationwide could be cut by a third beginning Oct. 1 , according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Assn .
“ The condition of the highway trust fund has been deteriorating for years , but skyrocketing gas prices have made an already dire situation worse , ” said Sen. Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) , head of the Senate transportation appropriations subcommittee .
“ We are now less than a year away from a bankrupt trust fund , which would leave critical construction projects in peril . ”

In the long run , lawmakers must figure out whether the 18.4 - cent - a - gallon federal gasoline tax , which helped bring in money when fuel - hungry SUVs were hot , is still a viable way to fund transportation projects amid heightened concern about gasoline prices , U.S. dependence on foreign oil and global warming .
The federal gasoline tax is tied to every gallon sold , not every dollar spent , so federal gas tax revenue goes up only if consumption increases .
This year , consumption is projected to drop for the first time since 1991 .
Vehicle miles traveled on the nation ’s roads are trending downward for the first time since the oil shocks of the late 1970s and early 1980s , according to the Cambridge Energy Research Associates consulting firm .
Highway trust fund receipts were down more than $ 2 billion through May compared with the same period a year ago , a Treasury Department report said .

The shortfall was projected at $ 3.2 billion this year , but it is expected to be higher when the White House budget office issues a revised estimate this month .
The shortfall was a major reason that Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s proposal for a gas tax holiday to ease the public ’s pain at the pump faced bipartisan congressional resistance .
At the same time , California officials project a decline in revenue from the state ’s 18 - cent - per - gallon gasoline tax -- about $ 62 million less for transportation projects in 2008 - 09 from the record high of $ 2.842 billion in 2006 - 07 .
But the state is expected to take in an additional $ 455 million in the new fiscal year because of a sales tax on gasoline that brings in more money as prices rise .
The federal highway trust fund faced problems even before the run-up in gas prices because of higher costs for asphalt , concrete and steel .

But its condition has been “ exacerbated by the high price of fuel and people changing their driving habits , ” said Stephen E. Sandherr , chief executive officer of the Associated General Contractors of America .
Lawmakers from both parties are eager to find a way to fund politically popular transportation projects .
But one possible solution -- an increase in the gas tax , which was last raised in 1993 -- is considered unrealistic in an election year .
A proposal to shift $ 8 billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund has considerable support in the Senate .
But it faces opposition from a number of Republicans who say it would trade one problem for another by deepening the federal budget deficit .
Reps . Jerry Lewis of Redlands and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , the top Republicans on the House Appropriations and Budget committees , respectively , said in a statement that the transfer “ would do nothing to solve the fundamental problems with the trust fund , leading the way for further massive spending down the road when the funding runs out again . ”

President Bush proposed shifting cash from mass transit to highways , which ran into opposition in Congress because commuters are increasingly turning to bus and rail lines because gas costs too much .
But Murray said : “ Without a fix soon , we could face having to cut all federal highway funds by a third simply to keep the trust fund solvent .
That is the last thing we should be doing when infrastructure needs are up , construction jobs are down and Americans are struggling through tough economic times . ”

In cyberspace they ca n’t hear you scream
It ’s been dubbed “ cybergeddon ” , the “ digital mushroom cloud ” .
What would happen if well - organised hackers – criminal syndicates , agents of hostile nation - states or terrorists – disabled the computer networks that sustain the critical infrastructure of modern societies ?
For Michael Chertoff , the head of the US Department of Homeland Security , the threat is real , and likely to get worse .
And he ’s not shy of offering some alarming examples of how such a devastating attack could unfold .
“ Imagine , if you will , a sophisticated attack on our financial systems that caused them to be paralysed , ” Chertoff told a security conference in San Francisco this month .
“ It would shake the foundation of trust on which our financial system works . ”
Or what if terrorists launched a successful cyber sortie that penetrated the air traffic control system and immobilised it or , even worse , enabled hackers to direct planes to slam into each other or into the ground .

Knife - wielding thug is caught on camera by pregnant woman - moments after he robbed young boy
Brave : Pregnant Nadine Bevis , 32 , took a photo of John King as he made off with a stolen bike
A pregnant woman caught a knife - wielding thug on camera - just moments after he had robbed a teenage boy .
Nadine Bevis stood in John King 's path and told him to ' smile for the camera ' as he tried to make off with the 14 - year - old boy 's mountain bike .
King was then tackled to the ground by members of the public who managed to restrain him until police arrived .
Miss Bevis said she felt she had to act - even though she could see King , 29 , was carrying two knives .
The 32 - year - old had just been to a doctor 's surgery , in Portsmouth , Hampshire , when she spotted King shouting at Toby Randall .
She said : ' I was sitting in traffic when I heard the man shouting at the boy .
' Then I saw him grab the boy 's bike so I leapt out of my car and ran across the road .
' I heard another woman shouting that he had a knife but I just went into a kind of robot mode .
' I was shouting ' give him his bike back ' over and over again and that was when he started to come towards me - so I just said ' smile for the camera . '
' I did n't feel threatened or scared - after all he had just picked on a defenceless child so he obviously was n't that brave .
' I can still see the boy 's poor little face .
He was crying so much that he could n't catch his breath .
Caught on camera : John King , 29 , was photographed just moments after he stole a bike from a teenager
' Too many people stand by and let this happen and I was n't going to be one of them .
Thugs like this can't get away with it .'
After she took the snap , King put the bike down , walked towards her and started hurling abuse at her .
But then two men ran from the crowd that had gathered and tackled him to the ground before disarming him .
Police arrived shortly after 6 pm on June 27 , to find the men pinning King , from Stamshaw , Portsmouth , to the ground .
Victim : Toby Randall , 14 , has been left ' wary of people ' after his bike was stolen by knife - wielding King
King was arrested and today appeared in court where he admitted robbery and two counts of possessing a bladed article in public .
He was remanded in custody until August 1 , when he will be sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court .
Miss Bevis , from Fratton , Portsmouth , added : ' As I was having my confrontation with him the boy ran over and picked his bike up and cycled off .
' Then a man came from the crowd and tackled him to the ground .
' Another bloke then grabbed the knives and he was down .
' It was a real joint effort and shows that the community wo n't stand for this .
' Afterwards I realised I had been a bit stupid because he could have attacked me with the knives - but it was just instinct .
' I did n't think about it .
I just knew that he was going to get away with such a cowardly crime and I had to stop him .
' I 'm pleased I did what I did .
Everyone who stopped this guy from getting away did a great thing . '
PC Kevin Shaw , from Kingston Crescent police station , said : ' The timely intervention allowed police officers to arrest King .
' Hopefully this will give the victim some closure .
All the residents should be proud of their actions . '
Victim
Toby said he was terrified when King waved a knife at him and told him to hand over his bike .
He said : ' I had just been to a mate 's house and was going home when this guy came up to me and told me to get off my bike .
Then he pulled a knife out of his pocket .
' I was so scared .
I was shaking so I just let him have it and tried to get away .
' I did n't see what all the people did to catch him as I was just trying to get away but I owe them a lot .
''I 'm so relieved that he has been caught .
It was a really scary experience and it's made me much more wary of people . '
Toby 's mother , Julie Randall , said her son had been left shocked and upset .
The 45 - year - old , of Eastney , Portsmouth , said : ' I was working in Southampton when I got a call from police .
' Toby was absolutely beside himself .
I could barely get any sense out of him .
' He 's been left very upset by what happened and I think it 's had quite a profound effect .
' But he tries to get on with life and he 's acted very bravely .
' We 're all very thankful for what everyone did that day to help Toby and catch the guy who did this to him .
' Goodness knows what would have happened if people had not stood up to him .
' I think it is a huge comfort to Toby to know that this man has been caught and is in prison . '
( I work in a large electronics retail chain .
A guy asks me to find the latest version of Norton AntiVirus for him , which I do .
He takes a look at the price and starts yelling about how outrageous it is ( $ 100.00 US ) . )
Guy : “ What the h***?
How can you people get away with this ?
This is a scam ! ”
Me : “ Sir , I can suggest another type of protection if this one is too expensive … ”
Guy : “ No way !
This is the one I want , but I ’m not paying this . ”
Me : “ Sir I – ”
Guy : “ I bet I can find it online for much cheaper .
Heck , even free ! ”
Me : “ Sir , I think that – ”
Guy : “ That ’s what I ’ll do … I ’ll find it for free online !
Better than this s***! ”
( A young woman nearby is listening and speaks up . )
Woman : “ Yeah , you can find it online , for free . ”
Guy : “ Really , where ?
Tell me ! ”
Woman : “ [ A disturbing p*rn site that I would not recommend viewing ] . ”
Guy : “ Thanks ! ” * turns back to me , smirking *
“ Ha , guess I wo n’t be spending any money on this s***! ”
Me , to the girl : “ That … was awesome . ”
Woman : “ Well , an a ** hole like that deserves it .
I figured that you could n’t tell him that without getting fired . ”
( The young woman gets a free gift card ; that guy never comes back .
I still wonder what went through his mind when the site popped up . )
WATERTOWN , South Dakota ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama linked Sen. John McCain Friday with what he called " the failed policies " of the Bush administration , accusing the presumed Republican presidential nominee and the White House of " bombastic exaggerations and fear - mongering " in place of " strategy and analysis and smart policy . "
" What we 've done over the last eight years does not work , " the Democratic front - runner said .
Obama accused McCain of supporting a track record from the Bush administration that included the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , a longer and more expensive war in Iraq than was initially projected , the continued freedom of September 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and the strengthening of Iran after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
" The American people are going to look at the evidence , " he said .
" We do n't get a sense that this has been a wise foreign policy or a smart foreign policy or a tough foreign policy .
This has been a policy that oftentimes revolved around a lot of bluster and big talk , but very little performance , and what the American people want right now is performance . "
In a speech at the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association in Louisville , Kentucky , on Friday , McCain defended his foreign policy positions , saying the United States has a realistic chance of success in Iraq after four years of costly mistakes .
McCain called some of Obama 's ideas " reckless " and questioned his understanding of America 's standing in the world .
Watch McCain take on Obama 's comments »
" It would be a wonderful thing if we lived in a world where we do n't have enemies , " the Arizona Republican said .
" That 's not the world we live in .
And until Sen .
Obama understands that reality , the American people have every reason to doubt whether he has strength , judgment and determination to keep us safe . "
The verbal sparring took place a day after President Bush suggested in a speech before the Israeli Knesset that those who want to shift American policy to include direct talks with what he called " terrorists and radicals " were appeasers and delusional .
Watch more of the controversy surrounding Bush 's speech »
" I do n't take what Bush says personally , but I was offended by what is a continuation of strategy from this White House , now mimicked by Sen.
McCain , that replaces strategy and analysis and smart policy with bombast , exaggerations and fear - mongering , " Obama said .
Watch more of Obama 's comments »
" The speech yesterday was not about an actual policy argument .
It was about politics and scaring the American people , and that 's what will not work in this election , " he said .
Obama said he would offer " tough diplomacy " to the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela and North Korea " without preconditions , although with preparation , and I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior . "
On Thursday , McCain spoke warily of Obama 's willingness to meet with dictators and " state sponsors of terrorists . "
" I have some news for Sen. Obama , " McCain told the NRA Friday .
" Talking , not even with soaring rhetoric ... will not convince Iran to give up its nuclear program .
It is reckless to suggest that unconditional meetings will advance our interests . "
Speaking to reporters earlier , McCain said he disagreed with Obama 's desire to talk with Iran 's president .
" What you do , if you sit down face to face , as Sen .
Obama wants to do , is you legitimize a regime that 's dedicated to the extinction of Israel , supports terrorist organizations and is responsible for deaths of brave young Americans , " McCain said .
McCain also said he would not meet with representatives of Hamas , the Palestinian organization listed as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel , which won elections in 2006 and now controls Gaza while U.S. - friendly President Mahmoud Abbas controls the West Bank .
Obama agreed with that position , calling Hamas a terrorist organization that has vowed to destroy Israel .
But Obama said McCain and Bush have to answer for Iran 's benefiting from the invasion of Iraq , Hamas ' gaining control of Gaza and Iran 's continued funding of terrorist organizations , all of which , he said , have affected U.S. security .
" That 's the Bush - McCain record on protecting this country , " he said at a Watertown , South Dakota , town hall meeting .
" Those are the failed policies that John McCain wants to double - down on . "
" I am happy to have a debate with John McCain and George Bush about foreign policy , " Obama said .
" I believe that there is no separation between George Bush and John McCain when it comes to our Middle East policy , and I think their policy has failed . "
In Kentucky , McCain said he would also welcome a debate about " protecting America . "
" No issue is more important , " he said .
" Sen. Obama claimed all I had to offer was a quote ' naive and irresponsible belief ' that tough talk would cause Iran to give up its nuclear program .
He should have known better . "
CNN 's associate political editor Rebecca Sinderbrand and political producer Ed Hornick contributed to this story .

Our understanding of aging in animals owes a great debt to a large body of careful work in a single - celled organism , the brewer ’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
Indeed , as I ’ve argued before , yeast is one of the two organisms with the strongest credible claim to have started modern biogerontology .
An unusually large crop of yeast aging papers have appeared over the last few months , and I thought it would be appropriate to spend a few paragraphs describing them — in honor of this humble organism that rises our bread , ferments our beer , and has done so much to open our eyes to the fundamental mechanisms of aging .
For those unfamiliar with the yeast field or simply wishing a clearly written and nearly comprehensive summary , Steinkraus et al. provide the historical perspective .
The piece thoroughly reviews the development of yeast as a model system in aging , as well as the arguments in favor of a connection between results in yeast and well - established ( but sometimes hard - to - test ) hypotheses in animals .
Based on the influence that yeast has already had on biogerontology as a whole , it seems fair to claim that it will continue to reveal fundamentals of aging that are conserved across evolution .
Now , however , there is quantitative evidence to back up that claim : Smith et al. have used bioinformatic and genomic approaches to study the conservation between known longevity genes in yeast and worm , and they show that yeast mutants in worm longevity genes are significantly more likely to be long - lived than randomly chosen mutants — suggesting that
genes that modulate aging have been conserved not only in sequence , but also in function , over a billion years of evolution .
Given this functional conservation , it is reasonable to use yeast to help answer questions about aging in general , so long as these questions are cell - biological in scope .
For instance : NAD +/ NADH ratios are thought to be an important metric of the cellular energy balance , and appear to have effects both within the mitochondria and the cytosol .
The mitochondrial inner membrane , however , is impermeable to both NAD + and NADH .
How , then , is information about energy balance communicated between the two cellular compartments ?
Easlon et al. report that two components of the malate - aspartate NADH shuttle ( which transports metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane , resulting in equilibration of the cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD + / NADH pools ) are involved in controlling longevity .
The two proteins , Mdh1 and Aat1 , are required for longevity enhancement by calorie restriction ( CR ) , and overexpression of both proteins can increase lifespan independent of caloric conditions ( but in a Sir2 - dependent manner , about which see more below ) .
Another outstanding question involves how cellular energy balance is coordinated with the rates of catabolic and anabolic processes , and how this coordination impinges on regulation of longevity .
We know that in yeast , the effects of CR are mediated by pathways involving the nutrient sensor TOR and the kinase Sch9 .
( Brief aside : longevity - enhancing mutations of Sch9 can also suppress genomic instability ; new results from Qin et al. show that genomic instability is also associated with lifespan variation in yeast ) .
Sch9 regulates , among other things , ribosome biogenesis ; both CR and Sch9 mutation cause ribosome synthesis to decrease — but are the ribosome and longevity phenotypes related ?
Very likely yes : Steffen et al. report that multiple means of downregulating ribosome synthesis all extend lifespan , implying that reducing production of ribosomes is essential in order to reap the benefits of CR .
As the tools of biology have adapted , so has the yeast field ( sometimes leading the charge , as in the case of the earliest microarray - based expression profiling experiments ) .
Murakami et al. have developed a high - throughput method for measuring yeast lifespan .
In this first report , the authors primarily demonstrate the use of their method on known mutants , arguing that their results are similar but with lower variance .
( Brief aside : they also demonstrate that CR - induced lifespan extension does not require SIR2 or any other yeast sirtuin , adding fuel to the controversy about whether sirtuins play any role in CR in yeast ; for more , see here and here . )
The increased precision of their technique will allow detection of subtler aging - related phenotypes than were previously detectable , very likely allowing us to add to the list of genes known to regulate lifespan .
The high - throughput aspects of the method , of course , open the door to testing small - molecule drugs that could delay aging in yeast — historically a fruitful approach though not without its potential pitfalls .
If you ’ve made it this far , feel free to toast S. cerevisiae , perhaps with a beer .
( Before I depart , I just want to mention — since it ’s not necessarily clear from the first authors ’ names — that four of the papers mentioned above , as well as many of the papers described in earlier Ouroboros posts linked above , are the result of the combined work of the Kaeberlein and Kennedy labs at U - Wash Seattle .
Both of them worked together in the Guarente lab back in the day , and they ’ve been in the yeast aging field from its very beginning .
Clearly , their combined work is continuing to advance the field . )
Timeline : 15 years BACKGROUND :
In the past 30 years , hundreds of scientists have investigated the ain - the - zonea feeling that athletes say gives them the sense that they can accomplish anything .
When Boston Celtic Larry Bird talked about the game seeming to actually slow down during crunch time , helping him to read defenses more clearly and feel more fleet - footed , he was probably experiencing a natural dopamine high .
Dopamine increases muscle - reaction speed and alters the perception of time .
But these flow states , as they 're known among psychologists , are probably triggered by a surge of several mindscrambling , euphoria - inducing , reflex - quickening neurochemicals , such as norepinephrine and serotonin .
Although studies have yet to quantify how much flow states actually raise an athlete 's performance , anecdotal evidence has convinced Michael Sachs , a sport psychologist at Temple University .
a Athletic abilities are so elevated by the experience , a he says , a that just about any championship - level , gold - medal peak performance has a flow state at its core .
a 
Elite athletes would do anything for a pill or injection that stimulates this feeling .
WHERE IT'S AT : In 2004 , neuroscientist Arne Dietrich , then at the Georgia Institute of Technology , identified anandaminea € " the body 's version of THC , the psychoactive chemical in marijuanaa € " as the chemical most likely responsible for flow states .
This theory received a boost this spring , when scientists at the University of Bonn in Germany found elevated levels of endorphins in the brains of test subjects .
These molecules are too big to penetrate the blood - brain barrier on their own , so the current thinking is that anandamine ferries them in and that it's the endorphins that provide the actual high .
Still , most scientists think there are other neurochemicals in play , and figuring out the exact combination may take years .
With so much pharmacological interest in neuro - enhancement , though , scientists in the field say it 's only a matter of time .
DETECTION : To spot cheaters , Sachs says , you 'll need to differentiate between the neurochemicals responsible for a natural flow state and one that 's triggered artificially .
a But these chemicals may be perfectly identical to the natural stuff , a he says .
a  I just do n't think detection may ever be possible .
a

When a goalie is ain the zone , a fast - flying pucks are easier to catch .

For a " darling of the left , " Joe Scarborough sure does n't seem to like us all that much .
Today on " Morning Joe , " he and Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) practically made out as they bashed the " angry left " for having the audacity to target the turncoat Democrat over " one issue . "
Download Download ( h/t Logan )
Scarborough : " Me and Mike Barnicle talk a good bit about these bloggers and people on the far , far , far left .
The angry left .
Here we have Joe Lieberman , progressive on civil rights .
progressive on the environment , progressive on economic issues , progressive on union isues , yet they throw him overboard over one issue .
Are n't we talking about extremism on the left and the right ? "
While it 's true that Lieberman has a pretty strong record of supporting traditionally Democratic positions -- something he should be properly recognized for -- the fact remains that he is a Bush loyalist and absolutist on the most transcendental issues of the day .
As I wrote about back in May , Lieberman 's betrayal extends far beyond the " one issue " of the war ; he supports Bush and the Republicans on every single controversial topic , from torture and habeas corpus , to FISA and judicial nominations .
Oh , and did I mention the fact that he is he most outspoken advocate for John McCain , and that he helps spread the most vile of smears about his supposed party 's nominee for President ?
By whatever math you choose to employ , all of those add up to more than " one issue . "
Lieberman has every right to support whatever position he wants to , but ( a ) let us dispense already with this " one issue " nonsense , and ( b ) he should n't be surprised when he is attacked by the Democratic base for embracing every single Republican position .
Then again , what do I know .... I 'm just a card - carrying member of the DFH " angry left . "
John Amato :
What a shock .
Harold Ford was having a grand old time with the crew .
I was very sorry to be missing this , as I 'm out of DC for the weekend , but not as sorry as I am now - - someone just got arrested .
The background : twenty people were at the Jefferson Memorial , dancing to the private groove of their own iPods so as not to disturb anyone .
Apparently cops showed up and ordered them to disperse anyway , despite the fact that they were not doing anything obviously illegal .
One of the libertarians joyfully ( yet tastefully and quietly ) celebrating the birthday of a favorite founding father questioned why they should have to move along -- at which point one of DC 's finest shoved them up against a pillar , cuffed their hands behind their back , and hauled them away .
As a resident of DC , I 'm certainly overjoyed to hear that violent crime has fallen to a level where we can spare valuable police resources to fight the silent scourge of . . . dancing .
Now that we have no more murders or muggings , it seems to me that we should also be looking at newsboys who smoke , women who attend the theater , and of course , the iniquitous habit of playing cards on the sabbath .
Update Julian Sanchez has more .
I was n’t aware dancing at a public monument was prohibited by any statute — but given that my friend ’s immediate social circle is largely composed of journalists , bloggers , and constitutional lawyers who sue the government for fun , I predict hilarity .
Rule # 1 of things like this : know who you 're dealing with .
Of course , respect for one 's civil rights should not be predicated on happening to know a lot of troublemakers with podiums .
Update II Jason Talley offers his account :
First I ’d like to make a few things clear .
We decided to use iPods to be respectful of other people ’s experience at the Jefferson Memorial .
No music was heard by anyone other than those wearing headphones .
We chose midnight so that we would n’t disturb anyone .
There were about six other people there that were not with us or the police .
If you were one of these people I ’d like to hear from you to get your account of what happened .
Perhaps six minutes into the event , security tried to stop us and kick us out of the memorial .
Most of the Jefferson fans questioned the officers to try to understand what authority they citing to use force against us .
Unfortunately I was n’t near the “ Jefferson 1 ” so I ca n’t tell you what she did or did n’t do but she was hauled away , handcuffed , in a police van and charged with disorderly conduct .
So in the 2008 version of the USA you cannot dance at the Jefferson Memorial without being disorderly it seems .
Radley Balko has a similar story .
Everyone I spoke with says there was no noise , there were no threats , and no laws broken ( the park police I spoke with –including the arresting officer ( who , oddly enough , denied to me that he was the arresting officer ) –declined to say why she had been arrested ) .
The police refused to answer any questions , referring all calls to the communication number of the Park Police , which at this hour is closed .
They also refused to give their badge numbers .
I ’ll post some video tomorrow morning of two flash mobbers who say she was doing nothing at all–she was barely even dancing .
Her crime was apparently to ask “ why ? ” when the park police told the group they had to disperse .
Note too that this was at around midnight .
No one was bumping into tourists , or obstructing anyone ’s way .
I guess the only conclusion , here , is that it ’s apparently illegal to dance on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial–even with headphones .
You know , post 9 - 11 world and all .
Harmless fun will be interpreted in the most threatening context imaginable .
As Julian notes , the problem here is not that one of my friends , an educated white girl , had to spend five hours or so being harassed by the police .
It is that the police think that questioning orders constitutes disorderly conduct .
And that the result of questioning them is probably a lot more than moderate harassment when the questioner is not an educated white girl with a lot of camera toting friends .

Gasoline prices skidded sharply lower during the last week partly because motorists have been curbing their driving -- cutting back so much that Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters warned Monday of a looming shortfall in the fund that pays for highway and bridge construction and repairs .
The U.S. average price for a gallon of self - serve regular gasoline dropped below $ 4 a gallon for the first time since June 2 , declining 10.9 cents a gallon to $ 3.955 , according to the Energy Department ’s weekly survey of filling stations .
In California , the average fell 14.3 cents to $ 4.317 a gallon .
Fuel prices have been falling as lower oil prices make their way to the pump and because motorists are driving less .
Model and actress Risako Takahashi on Monday spent more than $ 62 to fill her 2002 Mazda Protege , or about $ 17 more per tank than it cost last year .

As a result , Takahashi has curtailed her driving by about 25 % , having cut back on visits to her favorite Hollywood hangouts and seeing friends in Orange County , she said .
Instead of driving to the beach and jogging on the sand , the 37 - year - old Westwood resident runs in her neighborhood , and she walks to the grocery store instead of driving .
“ It ’s still amazingly expensive , so I just try to stay on the Westside now , ” Takahashi said .
“ The only thing I wo n’t drive less for is an audition . ”
In May , U.S. motorists drove 9.6 billion fewer miles , or 3.7 % less , than in May 2007 , according to a report on traffic volume trends released Monday by the Federal Highway Administration .
It was the seventh consecutive monthly decline , suggesting that U.S. road travel will record the first annual drop since 1980 .
The May total for vehicle miles traveled represented the third - biggest drop recorded in the 66 years that such figures have been tracked , the report said .
The drop was particularly surprising because May is usually a big driving month , launching the summer car - trip season .

The numbers are so significant that officials have become concerned that the nation ’s highway trust fund might not receive enough in gasoline and diesel tax revenue to maintain the country ’s transportation infrastructure .
The fund gets 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline sold and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel .
“ By driving less and using more fuel - efficient vehicles , Americans are showing us that the highways of tomorrow cannot be supported solely by the federal gas tax , ” Transportation Secretary Peters said in a statement .
“ We must embrace more sustainable funding sources for highways and bridges through more sustainable and effective ways such as congestion pricing and private activity bonds . ”
Also on Monday , the Energy Department said U.S. petroleum demand in May fell 4.3 % , or 891,000 barrels a day , compared with May 2007 , the lowest monthly demand in five years .
The agency previously estimated that May demand fell 1.8 % .

The reports sketched a picture of a fundamental change in American driving behavior that could be unprecedented , analysts said .
“ This is only the first act in this opera , and if you think it was bad , wait until Acts 2 and 3 , ” said Fadel Gheit , senior energy analyst for investment firm Oppenheimer & Co . “ Gasoline demand in 2009 will be less than it was in 2008 . ”
Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service , believes that motorists are hitting the brakes permanently .
“ I think we have tilted behavior to the point where this demand does not come back , ” Kloza said .

On the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude oil for September delivery posted a $ 1.47 gain to $ 124.73 a barrel after reports of a rebel attack on a Nigerian pipeline owned by Royal Dutch Shell .
The cost of the U.S. benchmark crude hit a record $ 147.27 a barrel July 11 .
Worries about declining fuel demand in the U.S. have put a damper on prices since then .
Still , oil prices are up 62 % from a year earlier .

How television can be harmful for toddlers - even when they 're not watching it
Television is harmful for toddlers , even when they 're not watching it , according to research
Parents who leave the television on all day are stunting the development of their babies and toddlers , a study claims .
Psychologists say that young children find it ' significantly harder ' to concentrate if a TV is on in the background - even if they appear to pay little attention to it .
The findings are thought to be true for children aged one , two and three .
Dr Marie Evans Schmidt , who carried out the research at the University of Massachusetts , said TV was a potentially ' chronic environmental risk factor ' affecting most children .
' Parents should limit their young children 's exposure to background television , ' she said .
The study looked at the effect of television on 50 children .
Each child came to a laboratory and was invited to play for an hour .
For half the time a television was on , showing an episode of the U.S. game show Jeopardy ! and commercials .
For the rest of the session , the television was turned off .
Even though the toddlers appeared to pay no attention to the adult programme , the television disrupted their playing at every age , the scientists reported in the journal Child Development .
When the TV was switched on , the children played for shorter periods and spent less time focused on the toys compared with when the programme was turned off .
In the past few years separate studies have shown excessive TV in the first few years of life can stunt language skills and contribute to bad behaviour and hyperactivity .
Psychologists say that toddlers and babies learn by interacting .
While television can be a useful babysitter , it can also hinder progress .
Some child development experts say that television 's fast - moving images damage a growing brain , and children watching TV are not spending time with adults or playing with toys .
In 2003 a study found a link between time spent watching television and difficulty in reading .
Last year , a study at Johns Hopkins University found under - fives who watched TV for more than two hours a day were more likely to suffer behavioural problems .
The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends that children under two watch no television and older children are limited to no more than two hours a day .

A year and a half ago , often I was sweetly dismissed when I said that Barack Obama was possibly on his way to the White House and would certainly trounce Hillary Clinton for the nomination .
Click Image to Enlarge © Kevin Lamarque / Reuters SENATOR OBAMA
" You do n't know what they 'll do to him , " they 'd say .
As often as not , the idea was that America could not seriously support a black man for its highest office .
I did n't get this .
The America I live in today does not seem as deeply stamped by bigotry as these people seemed to think .
It seemed as if , on this topic , I was talking to people who had woken up after 25 years and did n't know how the country had changed .
Could n't they see that this man 's color was only going to help ?
Well , here we are .
Are there some bigots ?
Of course .
Did they , or any purported instance of " racism " during the campaign , keep Barack Obama from the nomination ?
His victory demonstrates the main platform of my race writing .
The guiding question in everything I have ever written on race is :
Why do so many people exaggerate about racism ?
This exaggeration is a nasty hangover from the sixties , and the place it has taken as a purported badge of intellectual and moral gravitas is a tire - block on coherent , constructive sociopolitical discussion .
Here 's a typical case for what passes as enlightenment .
On my desk ( top ) is an article from last year 's American Psychologist .
The wisdom imparted ?
To be a person of color these days is to withstand an endless barrage of racist " microaggressions . "
Say to someone , " When I look at you , I do n't see color " and you " deny their ethnic experiences . "
You do the same by saying , " As a woman , I know what you go through as a racial minority , " as well as with hate speech such as " America is a melting pot . "
Other " microaggressions " include college buildings being all named after straight , white rich men ( I 'm not kidding about the straight part ) .
This sort of thing will not do .
Why channel mental energy into performance art of this kind ?
Some may mistake me as implying that it would be okay to stop talking about racism .
But that interpretation is incorrect : I am stating that it would be okay to stop talking about racism .
We need to be talking about serious activism focused on results .
Those who suppose that the main meal in the aforementioned is to decry racism are not helping people .
At this point , if racism was unattended to for 10 years , during that time it would play exactly the same kind of role it does in America now  elusive , marginal , and insignificant .
Note that I did not say that there was no racism .
There seems to be an assumption that when discussing racism , it is a sign of higher wisdom to neglect the issue of its degree .
This assumption is neither logical nor productive .
I reject it , and am pleased to see increasing numbers of black people doing same .
Of course there is racism .
The question is whether there is enough to matter .
All evidence shows that there is not .
No , the number of black men in prison is not counterevidence : black legislators were solidly behind the laws penalizing possession of crack more heavily than powder .
In any case , to insist that we are hamstrung until every vestige of racism , bias , or inequity is gone indicates a grievous lack of confidence , which I hope any person of any history would reject .
Anyone who intones that America remains permeated with racism is , in a word , lucky .
They have not had the misfortune of living in a society riven by true sociological conflict , such as between Sunnis and Shiites , Hutus and Tutsis  or whites and blacks before the sixties .
It 'd be interesting to open up a discussion with a Darfurian about " microaggressions . "
To state that racism is no longer a serious problem in our country is neither ignorant nor cynical .
Warnings that such a statement invites a racist backlash are , in 2008 , melodramatic .
They are based on no empirical evidence .
Yet every time some stupid thing happens  some comedian says a word , some sniggering blockhead hangs a little noose , some study shows that white people tend to get slightly better car loans  we are taught that racism is still mother 's milk in the U.S. of A . " Always just beneath the surface . "
Barack Obama 's success is the most powerful argument against this way of thinking in the entire four decades since recreational underdoggism was mistaken as deep thought .
A black man clinching the Democratic presidential nomination  and rather easily at that  indicates that racism is a lot further " beneath the surface " than it used to be .
And if Mr. Obama ends up in the White House , then it might be time to admit that racism is less beneath the surface than all but fossilized .
I know , I do n't know what they 'll do to him now .
Let 's just wait and see .

Police have recovered the body of missing technology entrepreneur Steven Thomas , the founder of anti-spyware firm Webroot Software .
A body identified as Thomas was discovered by firefighters below the Pali Highway lookout near the Pali Tunnel in Hawaii , Nine News reports .
The 36 - year - old , who was diagnosed with manic depression in April but declined to take medication , met his mother and cousin in a hotel in Waikiki on 30 June before disappearing after claiming he needed to visit the bathroom .
Thomas and his wife Candis were in the process of relocating to Boulder , Colorado - where Webroot is based - around the time of his disappearance .
Candis left Hawaii for Colorado ahead of her husband but returned after his disappearance to hand out flyers and help with the search , which reached a tragic end .
Thomas was reportedly suffering from paranoid delusions running up to the time of his disappearance .
Thomas helped found Webroot in 1997 .
He had the foresight to steer it into the emerging antispyware market before he and business partner Kristen Talley cashed in with a $ 108 m sale to venture capitalists in late 2004 .
He dabbled in real estate but had no involvement in the anti-spyware firm since . ®
Some investors reacted to a report on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal that the International Energy Agency , an Paris - based policy advisory group for industrialized countries , was concerned about a reduction in the long - term world supply of crude oil .
But the agency ’s chief economist said in an interview that the study ’s results were still inconclusive .
“ We are going to revise our oil supply prospects , ” said Fatih Birol , the economist .
“ We do n’t know the results yet . ”
And several oil analysts dismissed the importance of the current anxieties affecting the market .
“ Concerns about future supply  that ’s nothing new , it ’s been there for four years , ” said Antoine Halff , an analyst at Newedge .
Some experts expressed frustration that investors were only focusing on alarmist reports about declining supplies in a few areas and failed to consider that higher prices would eventually tamper demand and attract new production from places like Brazil .
“ The market is reacting to the fact that we might not have enough oil in the market 13 years from now  excuse me ? ” said Edward Morse , the chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers in New York .
“ You never recognize it ’s a bubble until the bubble is over . ”
The International Energy Agency warned about such a disconnect three years ago .
At the time , it said that if investments did n’t keep pace with the growth in consumption , the world might face a shortfall of as much as 15 million barrels a day by 2030 .
Instead of growing to reach 116 million barrels a day , global supplies would struggle to increase to 100 million barrels a day by then , up from today ’s average of 86 million barrels day .
In recent years , a chorus of analysts and oil executives have raised concerns about possible shortfalls in supplies over the next years as new discoveries and production fail to keep up with rising demand .
That , they warned , could lead to a supply crunch and spiking oil prices until demand eventually fell .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures closed Thursday with a nearly $ 5 - a - barrel loss as news that China raised retail fuel prices sparked concern over a slowdown in demand .
Crude oil for July delivery fell $ 4.75 , or 3.5 % , to close at $ 131.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That was the contract 's weakest closing level since June 10 .
Prices on Nymex climbed as high as $ 137.35 earlier on the heels of a shutdown of an oil platform in Nigeria .
The July futures contract expires on Friday , likely adding to volatility .
" The oil prices rollercoaster continues , " said analysts at Action Economics .
" The latest driver comes from reports that China will increase domestic fuel prices starting on Friday . "
" This follows the trend of other Asian countries reducing government fuel subsidies , which should , over time , put a dent in demand , " the analysts said .
China 's National Development and Reform Commission said on its
Web site that it raised gasoline , diesel and jet - fuel prices .
The price of gasoline was raised by 17 % to 6,980 yuan ( $ 1,014.24 ) per ton , from 5,980 yuan ; diesel prices was raised by 18 % to 6,520 yuan per ton , from 5,520 yuan ; and jet - fuel prices was raised by 25 % to 7,450 yuan per ton , from 5,950 yuan .

" This represents a significant increase on the populace that hardly has the staying power of the U.S. consumer , " said Michael Fitzpatrick , an analyst at MF Global , in a research note .
" In terms of it representing the possibility of a definitive price break , it is too early to tell , " he said .
Grabbing a lifeline
But Sean Brodrick , a natural resources analyst for MoneyandMarkets.com , said , " oil bears and stock bulls alike are seizing on this news from China like drowning men grasping at lifelines . "
" I hope they can live with disappointment , " he said in emailed comments .
The effect is to raise China 's gasoline and diesel prices by 46 cents a gallon , he said , and that 's " probably not enough to have much impact on existing demand . "
At the same time , Brodrick points out that China will see at least 6.6 million new cars , trucks and vans hit their roads this year .
“ ' I think this pullback [ in prices ] is one that can be bought .
Give it a few days -- maybe look to enter early next week . ' ” — Sean Brodrick , MoneyandMarkets.com
Given that , " I think this pullback is one that can be bought .
Give it a few days -- maybe look to enter early next week , " Brodrick said .
" No one thought they would raise prices ahead of the Olympics and after the earthquake , " said Phil Flynn , a vice president at Alaron Trading .
James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics , said it would be " even better " if members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would also lift their fuel subsidies .
But in its official announcement Thursday , China 's NDRC did n't mention whether it will reduce the subsidies .
China 's move is " not popular , but it will slow growth in consumption , " said Williams , in emailed comments .
" I had anticipated this move by the Chinese but did not expect it until after the Olympics .
It may have been done now so that they could say that they were doing something at the meeting in Jeddah on the 22 . "
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as representatives from the world 's oil - consuming countries will meet this weekend in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , and an official announcement of an output increase is expected at the summit .
The Saudis are likely trying to " show that they care about high prices and want to contribute to the solution for political reasons " and trying to " talk down prices because they are concerned that they are too high , " Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research , said in emailed comments .
The Saudis also " legitimately fear the hastening of substitution that ultra- high oil prices will bring , " said Bernard Picchi , a senior managing director at Wall Street Access .
See Commodities Corner .
AFP reported Thursday that a statement on Saudi Arabia 's London embassy Web site said that the Middle Eastern country planned to boost daily output by 200,000 barrels per day , which would confirm comments on Sunday from U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon .
But the embassy Web site later withdrew the statement without any comment or elaboration , according to AFP .
Nigerian woes
Earlier Thursday , oil prices had gained on news that a Royal Dutch Shell oil platform in Nigeria was shut down after an attack by local militants .
Shell RDS.A , - 1.68 % ( RDSA ) said Thursday that it has temporarily halted production at its main offshore field in Nigeria in the wake of an overnight attack , the BBC reported on its Web site .
The attack targeted the platform , located about 75 miles off the coast of the Niger Delta , that typically produces about 200,000 barrels a day , the BBC said .
Traders are also focusing on expectations that Saudi Arabia , the world 's biggest oil producer , plans to boost production by 200,000 barrels a day starting next month .
In related news Thursday , major oil companies are getting ready to formally announce historic contracts to return to Iraq some 36 years after the country 's government took control of its giant oil reserves , the New York Times reported .

Natural - gas prices drop
Prices for natural gas fell Thursday , though they fared a bit better than oil - product prices .
July natural - gas futures closed down 34.9 cents , or 2.6 % , to $ 12.861 per million British thermal units .
The contract closed above $ 13 on Wednesday to trade at the highest futures prices have seen on the Nymex since late 2005 .
Natural - gas inventories rose by 57 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 13 , the Energy Department said Thursday .
Global Insight expected the data to show an increase of 65 billion .
But prices fell , taking their cue from the drop in crude futures , as natural - gas traders took a breather from a climb past $ 13 , which is the highest level for natural - gas futures in more than two years , according to Beth Sewell , a managing partner at Quantum Gas & Power Services .
" We blew through $ 13 and made it stick , so now we 'll take a breather , " she said , referring to the market 's mentality at this pointing time .
Total natural - gas stocks now stand at 1.943 trillion cubic feet , down 376 billion cubic feet from the year - ago level and 52 billion cubic feet below the five - year average , the government data said .
Prices for petroleum products also fell .
July reformulated gasoline fell 11.4 cents to finish at $ 3.3526 a gallon and July heating oil dropped 14.6 cents to close at $ 3.7135 a gallon .
The average U.S. price for a gallon of regular gasoline fell slightly for a third straight day to $ 4.073 , but it 's still up 35.9 % from a year ago , according to AAA 's Daily Fuel Gauge Report .
Meanwhile , energy equities fell Thursday , with the Philadelphia Oil Service Index OSX , - 2.83 % closing 1.4 % lower at 345.76 after an earlier high of 355.37 .

... The GIRL with ka-LEI - do - scope EYESSSSS !!!
In this day and age of $ 4.00 gas and emissions concerns , carpooling is good for the environment , AND the wallet .
But , Friends of , I urge you to think long and hard about choosing the right carpool companions .
And this is why .
At my previous job , the office was roughly a 45 minute commute during weekday traffic , and one of the guys in my department -- we 'll call him " The Knave " -- he lived not - so - far from me , and he did n't have a car .
So rather than him taking two buses and spending three hours each day just getting to work , we carpooled .
He paid for some of the gas .
Now the Knave , who I actually work with at my current job as well , is a good guy -- funny and self - aware .
My friendship with him runs toward the similar - sense - of - humor - only - he - likes - to - test - me - occasionally dynamic .
There 's some Little Brother Instinct that bubbles up occasionally in him , and when his actual siblings are not available , it extends to ME .
Most of the time , I 'm prepared for this ... But sometimes I am poorly - caffeinated and driving .
Like the day he decided to introduce me to William Shatner singing " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds . "
Were you aware William Shatner had a brief singing career ?...
If you can call the enthusiastic spoken word crescendos and dénouements of the former Captain James T. Kirk " singing " ... yes , in fact , he did !
You can enjoy one hysterical video example of his stylings by clicking here
At the time , I was not aware of this .
And while manning my Saturn one morning , I really did n't have a proper handle on what was about to ensue ... Meaning , I did n't slap the Knave 's hands and fling the disk from his grasp when he started messing with my CD player .
Imagine : it 's early morning .
The sun is just creeping over the Western Pennsylvania Appalachians , a mist hanging heavy along the roadway and the coffee still steaming in the travel mug in the cup holder ... I am thinking about the work day ahead of me ... copy to write , projects to wind up ... And then comes Mr. Shatner bursting from the audio system shouting at a million decibels , in iambic pentameter :
And that 's when I ran off the road .
So , if you plan to carpool , think about who you choose to ride with .
Do not permit them access to your sound system , no matter how they beg , or how groggy you may be .
Most of all , just say " no " to all things Shatner while operating heavy machinery .
It is for your safety , as well as the safety of your fellow drivers .
Drive carefully -- and Shatner - free .

Self - medication may be the reason the blogosphere has taken off .
Scientists ( and writers ) have long known about the therapeutic benefits of writing about personal experiences , thoughts and feelings .
But besides serving as a stress - coping mechanism , expressive writing produces many physiological benefits .
Research shows that it improves memory and sleep , boosts immune cell activity and reduces viral load in AIDS patients , and even speeds healing after surgery .
A study in the February issue of the Oncologist reports that cancer patients who engaged in expressive writing just before treatment felt markedly better , mentally and physically , as compared with patients who did not .
Scientists now hope to explore the neurological underpinnings at play , especially considering the explosion of blogs .
According to Alice Flaherty , a neuroscientist at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital , the placebo theory of suffering is one window through which to view blogging .
As social creatures , humans have a range of pain - related behaviors , such as complaining , which acts as a “ placebo for getting satisfied , ” Flaherty says .
Blogging about stressful experiences might work similarly .
Flaherty , who studies conditions such as hypergraphia ( an uncontrollable urge to write ) and writer ’s block , also looks to disease models to explain the drive behind this mode of communication .
For example , people with mania often talk too much .
“ We believe something in the brain ’s limbic system is boosting their desire to communicate , ” Flaherty explains .
Located mainly in the midbrain , the limbic system controls our drives , whether they are related to food , sex , appetite , or problem solving .
“ You know that drives are involved [ in blogging ] because a lot of people do it compulsively , ” Flaherty notes .
Also , blogging might trigger dopamine release , similar to stimulants like music , running and looking at art .
The frontal and temporal lobes , which govern speech — no dedicated writing center is hardwired in the brain — may also figure in .
For example , lesions in Wernicke ’s area , located in the left temporal lobe , result in excessive speech and loss of language comprehension .
People with Wernicke ’s aphasia speak in gibberish and often write constantly .
In light of these traits , Flaherty speculates that some activity in this area could foster the urge to blog .
Scientists ’ understanding about the neurobiology underlying therapeutic writing must remain speculative for now .
Attempts to image the brain before and after writing have yielded minimal information because the active regions are located so deep inside .
Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the brain lights up differently before , during and after writing , notes James Pennebaker , a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin .
But Pennebaker and others remain skeptical about the value of such images because they are hard to duplicate and quantify .
Most likely , writing activates a cluster of neurological pathways , and several researchers are committed to uncovering them .
At the University of Arizona , psychologist and neuroscientist Richard Lane hopes to make brain - imaging techniques more relevant by using those techniques to study the neuroanatomy of emotions and their expressions .
Nancy Morgan , lead author of the Oncologist study , is looking to conduct larger community - based and clinical trials of expressive writing .
And Pennebaker is continuing to investigate the link between expressive writing and biological changes , such as improved sleep , that are integral to health .
“ I think the sleep angle is one of the more promising ones , ” he says .
Whatever the underlying causes may be , people coping with cancer diagnoses and other serious conditions are increasingly seeking — and finding — solace in the blogosphere .
“ Blogging undoubtedly affords similar benefits ” to expressive writing , says Morgan , who wants to incorporate writing programs into supportive care for cancer patients .
Some hospitals have started hosting patient - authored blogs on their Web sites as clinicians begin to recognize the therapeutic value .
Unlike a bedside journal , blogging offers the added benefit of receptive readers in similar situations , Morgan explains : “ Individuals are connecting to one another and witnessing each other ’s expressions — the basis for forming a community . ”

Stanford solar research receives $ 25 million grant
Michael McGehee
Saudi Arabia 's new science and technology university has made another large grant to Stanford researchers , this time revolving around solar power .
The $ 25 million grant from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology , or KAUST , spans the next five years beginning this month and will fund a new center at Stanford , the Center for Advanced Molecular Photovoltaics .
The center will be directed by Michael McGehee , associate professor of materials science and engineering .
The deputy director is Peter Peumans , assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Integrated Circuits Laboratory at the Center for Integrated Systems , who is also affiliated with the Woods Institute for the Environment .
Both are intensely involved in designing new types of solar cells at the nanoscale level .
McGehee said that the center 's goal is to make solar electricity at a cost that is competitive with coal plants .
He seeks to construct organic solar cells that can be cheaply printed in a roll - to - roll coating process similar to newspaper printing .
Today 's best organic solar cells have an efficiency of 6.5 percent and last approximately one year under sunlight .
The center has plans for taking the efficiency to at least 15 percent and making the cells stable for 10 years or more .
" We 're doing lots of experiments to see what 's holding back the efficiency , " McGehee said .
KAUST officials would like to see Saudi Arabia become a leader in solar technology as a way to generate revenue with industries other than oil .
" They 're looking to diversify their economy , " McGehee said .
The Saudi goal is to leapfrog into new areas of expertise rather than catch up with existing industries in other countries , he said .
The Saudis are not , for example , attempting to create an electronics sector to compete with the entrenched tech economies of the United States and Asia .
" In the long term they 're looking for something that will continue to work for them even when the oil supplies diminish , " McGehee said .
" They 're looking to move into new directions .
Regardless of where you are in the world , renewable energy is very promising . "
The overarching goal of the Saudis ' new graduate - level university is to establish a world - class research institution .
To that end , Stanford professors are advising KAUST on the hiring of its faculty in applied mathematics and computer science .
KAUST researchers will visit Stanford , and vice versa .
McGehee , for instance , will spend a sabbatical on the Saudi campus , probably next year when the new campus on the eastern shore of the Red Sea is scheduled to open .
In another area of cooperation , Yi Cui , assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford who specializes in nanotechnology , is working with KAUST to develop long - lasting lithium - ion batteries based on silicon nanowires .
The research could be a boon to laptops , cell phones , portable media players and electric cars .
Cui's research group received a $ 10 million KAUST grant earlier this year .

In honor of the national average price for gasoline hitting $ 4 / gallon today , we remind you of this little exchange between a reporter and Dubya ( the former oilman ) that occurred on Feb 28 , less than 4 months ago :
Q : What ’s your advice to the average American who is hurting now , facing the prospect of $ 4 a gallon gasoline , a lot of people facing —
Bush : Wait , what did you just say ?
You ’re predicting $ 4 a gallon gasoline ?
Q : A number of analysts are predicting —
Bush :
Oh , yeah ?
Q : — $ 4 a gallon gasoline this spring when they reformulate .
Bush :
That ’s interesting .
I had n’t heard that .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gas prices have fallen for the third day in a row , backing further away from recent highs , according to a daily survey released Thursday by motorist group AAA .
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas fell two - tenths of a cent to $ 4.073 from $ 4.075 the day before .
Wednesday marks the third consecutive day that gas prices have eased since the national average price hit an all - time high of $ 4.080 on Monday .
Gas prices are highest in California , where a gallon of gas averages $ 4.610 , followed by Alaska at $ 4.489 and Connecticut at $ 4.382 .
Oklahoma has replaced Missouri as the state with the lowest gas prices .
The average gas price in Oklahoma is $ 3.834 a gallon .
Although gas prices have declined in recent days , the national average price is still more than 7 % higher than last month and nearly 36 % higher than year - ago levels .
The added expense has prompted many Americans to cut back on the amount of driving they do .
The Federal Highway Administration said Thursday it estimates that Americans drove 1.4 billion fewer miles on public roads in April .
That 's a decline of 1.8 % compared to April of last year and is the sixth consecutive month that drivers have cut back .
So far this year , the agency estimates that drivers have traveled 20 billion miles less than in previous years .
" We 're burning less fuel as energy costs change driving patterns , steer people toward more fuel efficient vehicles and encourage more to use transit , " Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said .
Peters also noted that midsize SUV sales have decreased in recent months while car sales , which had accounted for less than half of the industry volume in 2007 , have risen .
She said past trends have shown Americans will continue to drive despite high gas prices , but will drive more fuel efficient vehicles consuming less fuel .
Diesel prices also declined .
The national average price for a gallon of diesel fell three - tenths of a cent to $ 4.791 from $ 4.794 the day before .
Meanwhile , crude oil prices fell slightly in electronic trading Thursday morning .
U.S. crude for July delivery fell 33 cents to $ 136.35 a barrel .
At RailsConf , I had the opportunity to speak to a lot of people about Merb .
I also listened to DHH 's keynote , which touched on some related concepts .
People coming from a Rails background , and are looking at Merb for the first time , wonder why they should throw away the phenomenal efficiency improvements they got from switching off of error - prone , tedious configuration scripts for another set of configuration when Rails makes all the decisions for them .
DHH made this point fairly explicitly in his keynote .
To sum up , he argued that people only think they want to make decisions ; instead , they really want to be given a fully working , homogeneous solution so they can get on with their business .
Believe it or not , I agree .
The devil , as they say , is in the details .
In the real world of software applications , the monolithic solution does n't always fit your needs perfectly .
That 's why Rails implemented , very early , a plugin architecture , which immediately reduces homogeneity .
You see , Rails is like a pre-fab house .
For people who have gone through the pain of constructing a house before , pre-fab houses are very appealing .
Suddenly , there 's no need to spend time with architects , contractors , or painters .
You just place an order and you get a house .
It seems great .
You can get the furniture you want , or even repaint it .
And when you need to bring in a contractor for routine maintenance , you can have your pick of contractors .
Because your house is the same as every other house they worked with .
But soon you decide you want a window .
Unfortunately , your house is pre-fab , so you pick up a hacksaw and hack away .
Everything seems great until the first time it rains .
And the water starts coming in .
Undaunted , you pick up the phone and call all those contractors you worked with before .
When they get there , they take one look and let out a sigh .
They have no idea how to deal with the glaring mess you have made for yourself .
After paying a hefty bill to get everything fixed , you tell yourself that it 's still worth it .
After all , you 're still ahead on time compared to Andy down the block who had to do everything from scratch .
But you see , there 's another option .
At a builder 's show , you see a shiny booth run by a new company called Mer Builders .
They have put together a house kit that allows you to put together your house quickly and efficiently .
And when you want a new window , you just pull out one of the wall blocks and replace it with a window block .
Quick and easy .
But wait , you are probably thinking .
I still need to put together the house .
That smacks of all the pain of building a house from scratch .
It 's not as bad , but I 'll still need to decide what pieces I want , figure out how they hook up , hire someone who knows how to put everything together , and more .
Who wants that .
A pre-fab house will do just fine , thank you very much .
As you turn to leave , the Mer Builders salesperson calls after you .
You see , it turns out that they understand that you 'd rather not have to make all those decisions yourself .
And they 've put together a starter kit that looks kind of like the pre-fab house .
You can order it today and have it delivered tomorrow .
But when you want to replace a window , their network of certified Mer engineers will simply and easily swap out a wall block for a window block .
Heck , soon enough you 'll probably be doing all sorts of customizations on your own .
The moral of the story is ...
Use Mer Buil ... er... Merb !
Arizona Republican John McCain and Illinois Democrat Barack Obama say a lot of the same things about energy and environmental policy : Both want to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil and fight global warming .
Both want binding caps on greenhouse - gas emissions .
Both see a stepped - up role for nuclear power .
So does that mean that America will get the same energy strategy no matter which candidate wins ?
Not by a long shot .

WASHINGTON  Johns Hopkins University said Friday that it had programmed its computers to ignore the word “ abortion ” in searches of a large , publicly financed database of information on reproductive health after federal officials raised questions about two articles in the database .
The dean of the Public Health School lifted the restrictions after learning of them .
A spokesman for the school , Timothy M. Parsons , said the restrictions were enforced starting in February .
Johns Hopkins manages the population database known as Popline with money from the Agency for International Development .
Popline is the world ’s largest database on reproductive health , with more than 360,000 records and articles on family planning , fertility and sexually transmitted diseases .
GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden ’s driver went on trial at Guantanamo on Monday in the first U.S. war crimes trial since World War Two , nearly seven years after the September 11 attacks prompted U.S. President George W. Bush to declare war on terrorism .
Salim Ahmed Hamdan , a Yemeni who has admitted driving for the fugitive al Qaeda leader , pleaded not guilty to the charges before the controversial U.S. war court of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism .
He could face life in prison if convicted by a jury of U.S. military officers .
Judge Keith Allred , a Navy captain , seated a six - member jury after he and lawyers for the prosecution and defense questioned the officers on whether they could be impartial .
Several were eliminated after telling the court they were in or knew people who were in the Pentagon when a hijacked plane struck on September 11 , 2001 , including an Army colonel who said he watched the jetliner burn after escaping the building .
“ It simply seems fair that he be excused in a proceeding where the attack on September 11 is going to be very much in evidence , ” Allred said of that officer .
The first trial in the much - criticized military tribunal system got under way 6 - 1/ 2 years after the United States opened the prison camp in Cuba to jail suspected al Qaeda and Taliban fighters .
Prosecutors contend Hamdan , who is in his late 30s , was close to al Qaeda ’s inner circle and was on the way to a battle zone with two surface - to - air missiles in his car when he was captured in November 2001 , shortly after the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan .
Hamdan ’s lawyers say he is not a member of al Qaeda and was merely a driver and mechanic in bin Laden ’s motor pool who needed the $ 200 monthly salary .
He entered a formal not guilty plea through his lawyers .
The Guantanamo naval base became a lightning rod for anger against and criticism of the United States as detainees , held for years without charge as unlawful enemy combatants and denied the rights accorded to formal prisoners of war , complained of torture and abuse .
Human rights advocates condemned the legal system the Bush administration constructed after the September 11 attacks to try those charged with crimes .
Defense lawyers say much of the evidence against their clients may have been extracted through coercion .
HILLTOP COURTHOUSE
Hamdan was being tried in a hilltop courthouse overlooking Guantanamo Bay by a jury selected from a pool of 13 U.S. military officers flown in from around the world .
The final jury includes two Army lieutenant colonels , an Army colonel , a Navy captain , an Air Force colonel and a Marine lieutenant colonel .
Allred ordered their identities kept secret .

During questioning of the prospective jurors , the judge asked if they would have any bias against Hamdan because he was Arab , Muslim or Yemeni .
All said no .
One prospective juror who was eliminated , a Navy captain and former policeman , said he knew the commander of the USS Cole , which was struck by a suicide bombing in 2000 in a Yemeni port , killing 17 American sailors .
“ No one wants to see shipmates hurt and killed .
It angered me , ” he said .
Another was excused because he knew a prosecution witness .
One officer accepted for the panel was a helicopter pilot who said he had served in Panama , Iraq and Kosovo .
Another was an Army officer who said he believed the war on terrorism had started in the 1990s , not after the September 11 attacks .
He said he worked in operations analysis and had seen classified reports on radical Islam .
“ Radical Islam exists and I believe we are at war with it , ” he said .
Just before the start of trial , Allred granted Hamdan ’s defense team a partial victory by throwing out some of his statements to interrogators , including those made at Bagram air field and in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan .
But he allowed others to be entered as evidence .
About 265 prisoners remain at Guantanamo .

In physics , the theory of relativity is a scientific theory describing the effects due to the invariance of the speed of light .
In particular , the meaning of space and time are altered by the motion of the observer .
Relativity proposes time dilation and length contraction for observers moving relative to one another at very high ( " relativistic " ) speeds .
Relativity refers to two closely - related mathematical theories in physics :
[ 1 ] *" I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth .
I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being . "
- Albert Einstein
General Relativity ( GR ) is a theory to explain the laws of motion as viewed from accelerating reference frames and includes a geometric explanation for gravity .
This theory was originally developed by Einstein , with help from David Hilbert in its final mathematical formulation , as a generalization of the postulates of Special Relativity to account for non-inertial , accelerating observers , particularly those in a gravitational field . [ 4 ]
A dramatic but later discredited [ 5 ] claim by Sir Arthur Eddington of experimental proof of General Relativity in 1919 popularized the theory .
These theories have augmented earlier approaches , such as Galilean Relativity .
The theory of relativity is defended with religious - like zeal , such that no college faculty tenure , Ph.D degree , or Nobel Prize is ever awarded to anyone who dares criticize the theory , as the example of denying a Nobel Prize to the most accomplished physicist of the 20th century , Robert Dicke , illustrates .
Other critics of the theory are Nikola Tesla , who called it a " ... magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates , dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors .
The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king ... its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists , not scientists ... " [ 6 ] and Louis Essen [ 1908 - 1997 ] , the man credited with determining the speed of light .
He wrote fiery papers and many feature articles of the subject in science journals with popular audiences against it such as " Relativity and Time Signals " [ 7 ] and " Relativity - Joke or Swindle ? " . [ 8 ]
Perhaps the most famous website opposing relativity is this one , with its Counterexamples to Relativity page .
The cornerstone item in that page involves the experimental measurements of the advance of the perihelion of Mercury that show a shift greater than predicted by Relativity , well beyond the margin of error .
There are some issues of continuity and limits arising in the mathematical analysis of the theory of relativity .
See Counterexamples to Relativity for discussion of this point .
The theory of relativity consist of complex mathematical equations relying on several hypotheses .
For example , at Hofstra University general relativity is taught as part of an upperclass math course on differential geometry , based on three stated assumptions . [ 9 ]
Special relativity assumes that all observers in inertial frames of reference will measure the same value for the speed of light , c and that all inertial frames of reference are equivalent .
These hypotheses that can never be fully tested .
Relativity rejects Newton 's action at a distance , which is basic to Newtonian gravity and also found to be a consequence of quantum mechanics .
The mathematics of relativity assume no exceptions , yet in the time period immediately following the origin of the universe the relativity equations could not possibly have been valid , since quantum effects would not be negligible ( in the same way non-relativistic quantum mechanics is not valid when dealing with particles traveling near the speed of light ) .
The " continuous " nature of space and time postulated by relativity is in conflict with the " discrete " nature in quantum mechanics , [ 10 ] and although theories like string theory and quantum field theory have attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics , neither has been entirely successful or proven .
Unlike Newtonian physics , in which space and time intervals are each invariant as seen by all observers , in SR the only invariant quantity is a quadratic combination of space and time intervals ( x2 - c2 t2 ) .
The instantaneous transmission of Newtonian gravitational effects also contradicts relativity .
In quantum mechanics , the uncertainty principle suggests that virtual particles can sometimes travel faster than the speed of light which would violate causality , but " [t ] he only known way to resolve this tension involves introducing the idea of antiparticles . " [ 11 ]
Consequently , in 1928 Paul Dirac derived the Dirac equation , one of the first quantum mechanical equations compatible with special relativity , by which Dirac predicted the existence of antimatter .
Four years later , antimatter ( the positron ) was discovered by Carl Anderson , as successfully predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics .
Quantum field theory , a generalization of quantum mechanics , is fully compatible with special relativity but not with general relativity , and still lacks a vital piece : evidence of the graviton .
Special Relativity
Lorentz and Poincaré developed Special Relativity as way of understanding how Maxwell 's equations for electromagnetism could be valid in different frames of reference .
Einstein famously published an explanation of Poincaré 's theory [ 12 ] in terms of two assumptions ( postulates ) :
The laws of physics are identical in all inertial reference frames .
The speed of light is the same for all ( inertial ) observers , regardless of their velocities relative to each other .
As an example of the first of these , if one performs an experiment — say , with a pendulum or some similar apparatus — in a railroad car traveling uniformly at 50 miles per hour , one would find the results of the experiment ( positions , speeds , etc. ) to be consistent with the laws of physics in the railroad car .
An outside stationary observer , looking through the window , would also find the results consistent with the laws of physics in his stationary reference frame .
He would simply have to subtract 50 miles per hour from the velocities of the objects in order to get values that agree with the values obtained by the observer on the train .
But the two observations would each be consistent with the laws of physics .
This is all straightforward and obvious to modern people , and has been since the time of Galileo .
This principle is now called " Galilean relativity " .
Another way of stating this is :
There is no " preferred " frame of reference .
Neither observer can claim that his frame of reference is " right " .
Of course , the observer on the train would think that the Earth is moving at 50 miles per hour under the wheels .
The second postulate is what makes relativity what it is .
Using the above principle , if someone in the railroad car shines a beam of light forward , he would observe it moving at a speed of 670,000,000 miles per hour .
One would expect , according to the first postulate , that an observer standing on the ground would measure its speed as 670,000,050 miles per hour .
But the second postulate says that the stationary observer measures the same speed , 670,000,000 miles per hour .
While this seems paradoxical , many experiments , such as the Michelson - Morley experiment show that it is nevertheless true .
Special Relativity explains the apparent inconsistency between these postulates .
Why was this not observed until around 1900 ?
Because the speed of light is so great that the discrepancy is very hard to measure .
For example , in the railroad experiment described above , the discrepancy between the two speeds is 7.5 parts per million .
There are many far - reaching consequences of this , and many experimental verifications , some of which are listed below .
Two of the more interesting consequences are that :
No material object of nonzero mass can travel at or greater than the speed of light .
( Objects of zero mass , such as photons , travel at exactly the speed of light . )
Information can not travel faster than the speed of light . [ 13 ]
This is sometimes stated as :
There is no " action at a distance , " because that would make observations dependent on the frame of reference .
See Action at a distance for a discussion of this point .
When the assumptions are stated clearly as above , the weaknesses in the theory are more apparent .
There “ is ” action at a distance in quantum entanglement and apparently also in gravity , as no gravitons can be found .
However , no information has yet been transmitted via quantum entanglement , so while non-locality violates the spirit of relativity it is consistent with it if relativity is limited to the transmission of information .
Quantum field theory , an attempt to partially reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity , is incomplete at best .
As to the second assumption , it is contrary to the arrow of time , which illustrates the lack of symmetry in time .
Logical defects include the incoherence of relativistic mass ( see discussion below ) and the lack of relativistic constraints near the beginning the universe ( see above ) .
Special Relativity ( SR ) was initially developed by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz , working on problems in electrodynamics and the Michelson - Morley experiment , which had not found any sign of Earth 's orbital motion through the luminiferous aether , which was believed to be the substance which carried electromagnetic waves .
Special relativity alters Isaac Newton 's laws of motion by assuming that the speed of light will be the same for all observers , despite their relative velocities and the source of the light .
( Therefore , if A sends a beam of light to B , and both measure the speed , it will be the same for both , no matter what the relative velocity of A and B .
In Newtonian / Galilean mechanics ,
If A sends a physical object at a particular velocity towards B , and nothing slows it , the velocity of the object relative to B depends on the velocities of the object and of B relative to A. )
At low speeds ( relative to light - speed ) , the Lorentz - Poincaré relativity equations are equivalent to Newton 's equations .
The media - promoted equation E=mc² , implausibly suggests a relationship between typically unrelated concepts of energy , the rest mass of a body and the speed of light .
Under relativity , particles at low mass and low speed can be accurately approximated by classical mechanics ( such as Isaac Newton 's laws of motion ) .
At the two extremes , modeling the behavior of electrons requires that relativistic effects be taken into account ( the chemically significant phenomenon of electron spin arises from relativity ) , and the course of light passing through a region containing many massive bodies such as galaxies will be distorted ( classical mechanics , in which light travels in straight lines , does not predict this ) .
These are both experimentally confirmed ( electron spin was known before relativity arose , and telescopic observations confirm that galactic clusters distort the paths of the light passing through them ) .
Many scientists have indicated problems with the postulates of special relativity .
Paul Davies , formerly of Macquarie University and now at the University of Arizona believes that the speed of light has changed over time .
Since the speed of light is a constant speed ' c ' this indicates problems with the theory light speed .
Other engineers and scientists have written about problems in the basic set of special relativity equations .
Based on the ideas of not Einstein but of the scientist Fitzgerald as well as others , a length contraction effect was predicted as an explanation of the failure of the Michelson - Morley experiment to detect Earth 's orbital motion .
This idea was taken up by Hendrik Lorentz and shown by others to be a useful mechanism by which theory could be derived from experimental results .
In fact , the Michelson - Morley experiment is often cited in textbooks as the derivation of relativity , though there are many other experiments that do this ; see below .
In 2005 , Michael Strauss , a computer engineer , claimed to have shown clear contradictions in Special Relativity , invalidating much of it .
In 2004 he wrote the book Requiem for Relativity ( The Collapse of Special Relativity ) , ASIN 0976312506 .

General Relativity
See the General theory of relativity page for more in - depth coverage of this topic .
General Relativity is a theory of gravity that is compatible with Special Relativity .
Einstein explains a thought experiment involving two elevators .
The first elevator is stationary on the Earth , while the other is being pulled through space at a constant acceleration of g.
Einstein realized that any physical experiment carried out in the elevators would give the same result .
This realization is known as the equivalence principle and it states that accelerating frames of reference and gravitational fields are indistinguishable .
General Relativity is the theory of gravity that incorporates Special Relativity and the equivalence principle .
General Relativity is a mathematical extension of Special Relativity .
GR views space - time as a 4 - dimensional manifold , which looks locally like Minkowski space , and which acquires curvature due to the presence of massive bodies .
Thus , near massive bodies , the geometry of space - time differs to a large degree from that of other parts of the universe .
Just as in classical physics , objects travel along geodesics in the absence of external forces .
Importantly though , near a massive body , geodesics are no longer straight lines .
It is this phenomenon of objects traveling along geodesics in a curved spacetime that accounts for gravity .
The " anomalous precession " of Mercury 's perihelion ( slow shift of the orbit 's major axis ) is explained by the Theory of General Relativity , but not by Newtonian mechanics .
Some precession ( 5600 arcseconds per century ) is caused by purely classical phenomena , mostly the gravitational attraction of other planets .
But a small amount ( 43 arcseconds per century ) of the observed precession , goes beyond that which classical Newtonian mechanics can explain .
General relativity explains it accurately .
There was another explanation based on Newtonian gravity , involving a slight alteration to the precise inverse - square relation of Newtonian gravity to distance , but it was quickly discarded when it gave very bad results for the Moon 's orbit .
The relativistic explanation of the anomalous precession is disputed on the Counterexamples to Relativity page of Conservapedia .
British Historian Paul Johnson declared the turning point in 20th century to have been when fellow Briton Sir Arthur Eddington , an esteemed English astronomer , ventured out on a boat off Africa in 1919 with a local Army unit to observe the bending of starlight around the sun during a total eclipse .
Upon his return to England declared that his observations proven the theory of relativity .
In fact recent analysis of Eddington 's work revealed that he was biased in selecting his data , and that overall his data were inconclusive about the theory of relativity .
The prediction was later confirmed by more rigorous experiments , such as those performed by the Hubble Space Telescope . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
Hendrik Lorentz had this to say on the discrepancies between the empirical eclipse data and Einstein 's predictions .
It indeed seems that the discrepancies may be ascribed to faults in observations , which supposition is supported by the fact that the observations at Prince 's Island , which , it is true , did not turn out quite as well as those mentioned above , gave the result , of 1.64 , somewhat lower than Einstein 's figure . [ 17 ]
The bending of light by gravity is predicted both by Newtonian physics and relativity .
Experimental observation agrees with the latter amount ( 1.75 arcseconds for the Sun ) , rather approximately for Eddington 's measurements , and very accurately for more modern measurements .
Special relativity is the limiting case of general relativity where all gravitational fields are weak .
Alternatively , special relativity is the limiting case of general relativity when all reference frames are inertial ( non-accelerating and without gravity ) .
Lack of evidence for Relativity
The Theory of relativity assumes that time is symmetric just as space is , but the biggest early promoter of relativity , Arthur Eddington , coined the term " arrow of time " admitting how time is not symmetric but is directional .
The passage of time is tied to an increase in disorder , or entropy .
The Theory of relativity cannot explain this , and implicitly denies it , specifically allowing for theoretical time travel ( e.g. , wormholes ) and different rates of passage of time based on velocity and acceleration .
The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) requires exquisitely accurate timekeeping in the satellite clocks — down to the nanosecond .
This precision is so great that the effects of both special relativity and general relativity play an important role .
Without making corrections to the timing signals from the satellite clocks , the results of GPS measurements would be so far off that the system would be useless .
The required amount of correction is well known , and the system makes those corrections .
Those corrections are consistent with special relativity and general relativity , and it is generally accepted that this is no coincidence — relativistic effects are the reason why the corrections are necessary .
But one does n't need to believe that relativity is the reason the corrections are needed ; one only needs to make the corrections in order to get the system to work .
Tom Van Flandern , an astronomer hired to work on GPS in the late 1990s , concluded that " [t ] he GPS programmers do n't need relativity . "
He was quoted as saying that the GPS programmers " have basically blown off Einstein . " [ 18 ]
Asynchronization can be easily addressed through communications between the satellites and ground stations , so it is unclear why any theory would be needed for GPS .
While Van Flandern believed that relativity is unnecessary for GPS , he also asserted that observations of GPS satellites supported both general and special relativity , writing that " we can assert with confidence that the predictions of relativity are confirmed to high accuracy over time periods of many days , " with unrelated factors interfering with longer - term observations . [ 19 ]
Some internet articles claim that GPS timing differences confirm the Theory of Relativity or its Lorentzian counterpart ( which uses a preferred frame of reference ) .
GPS clocks run slower in the weaker gravitation field of the satellites than on ground stations on Earth , with the effects predicted by general relativity far outweighing the effects predicted by special relativity .
However , the articles claiming that the slower GPS satellite clocks confirm relativity do not address the effect , if any , of the weaker gravitational force under Newton 's theory on the GPS satellite clocks , likely because in Newtonian Mechanics every clock in the universe keeps time at the same rate regardless of velocity , acceleration , or the presence or absence of force .
Currently , GPS satellites are synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time by radio signals from the ground ; therefore , they cannot currently be used to test general relativity . [ 20 ]
There are claims that the effects of relativity have been observed with the frequency shift of the signal being sent back to Earth several times as various spacecraft have dipped into the gravity wells around massive objects such as the sun ( see image at right ) [ 21 ] or Saturn . [ 22 ]
A satellite called Gravity Probe B was put in orbit about the Earth to examine the effects of frame dragging and geodetic warping of space , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] but the results were inconclusive .
Note , however , that Newtonian mechanics also predicts deflection of light by gravity , and in the initial theory of relativity it predicted the same amount of deflection , but only if we treat light as capable of being accelerated and decelerated like ordinary matter , which is contrary to all measurements and observations to date . [ 25 ]
Adjustments to the theory of relativity resulted in a prediction of a greater deflection of light than that predicated by Newtonian mechanics , though it is debatable how much deflection Newtonian mechanics should predict .
None of the NASA spacecraft incorporates predictions of relativity into their own timing mechanisms , as Newtonian mechanics is adequate even for probes sent deep into space so long as they do not undergo accelerations near the speed of light or enter any massive gravity wells . [ 26 ]
A decade of observation of the pulsar pair PSR B1913+16 detected a decline in its orbital period , which was attributed to a loss in energy by the system .
It is impossible to measure the masses of the pulsars , their accelerations relative to the observers , or other fundamental parameters .
Professors Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse , who discovered the binary pulsar , found that physical values could be assigned to the pulsars to make the observed decline in orbital period consistent with the Theory of General Relativity , and for this they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physics , which is the only award ever given by the Nobel committee for the Theory of Relativity . [ 27 ]
In 2004 , Professor Taylor utilized a correction to the derivative of the orbital period to fit subsequent data better to the theory .
At most , assumptions can be made and altered to fit the data to the theory , rather than the data confirming the theory .
The perihelion of Mercury 's orbit precesses at a measurable rate , but even after accounting for gravitational perturbations caused all other planets in the solar system , Newton 's theory ( assuming a precise inverse - square relationship for distance ) predicts a rate of precession that differs from the measured rate by approximately 43 arcseconds per century .
While general relativity was developed on purely theoretical grounds , it was soon discovered that it explained these precession observations . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
Newton 's theory can also explain the Mercury precession by making tiny adjustments to parameters in the gravitational equation , but doing so would give the same precession for all orbiting bodies everywhere , a phenomenon which is not observed .
General relativity predicts twice as much bending in light as it passes near massive objects than Newton 's theory might predict . [ 30 ]
This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing .
A large number of instances of gravitational lensing have been observed , and it is now a standard astronomical tool . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
Note , however , that the extent of bending of light predicted by Newton 's theory is open to debate , and depends on assumptions about the nature of light for gravitational purposes . [ 34 ]
In 1972 , scientists flew extremely accurate clocks ( " atomic clocks " ) around the world in both directions on commercial airlines , and claimed to observe relativistic time dilation ; the eastbound clock gained 273 ns and the westbound clock lost 59 ns , matching the predictions of general relativity to within experimental accuracy . [ 35 ]
However , the inventor of the atomic clock , Louis Essen , declared that the experiment was inaccurate . [ 36 ]
Dr A. G. Kelly examined the raw data from the experiment and declared it inconclusive . [ 37 ]
The Nobel Committee chose not to honor this experiment for the significance that was claimed .
Experimental and Observational Evidence Confirming Relativity
The different effects predicted by special relativity , compared to classical formulations , are extremely tiny .
Most relativistic effects are negligible at the speeds of ordinary phenomena observed by humans .
The effects only become significant when the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light , which is meters per second — such speeds are called relativistic .
( However , it 's worth noting that ordinary magnetism can be considered an effect of relativity , dictated by the need for electrostatic theory to be correct under relativity .
The speed of light in fact appears in the formulas ( Maxwell 's Equations ) governing electricity and magnetism , though these equations were developed long before relativity was proposed . )
Because the effects of relativity are so tiny , scientists have been devising sophisticated and sensitive tests ever since the theory was formulated in 1905 .
It is important to be aware that it is fairly rare for an experiment to prove a theory .
In general , experiments can only refute a theory .
They can also be consistent with a theory .
When enough experiments , especially experiments that investigate a wide variety of phenomena , are shown to be consistent with a theory , it lends credence to that theory .
When no other plausible theory can explain those observations , we can say that they validate the theory .
The Mercury observations are just one phenomenon .
By themselves they could n't validate or prove GR .
And there was at one time another competing theory — the Newcomb - Hall exponent - fudging theory .
That one did n't hold up for things other than Mercury .
No other theory has come up explaining the phenomenon ; SR and GR have withstood the test of time .
That goes a long way toward validating them .
There are many other observations and experiments , covering a wide variety of phenomena , described below — bending of light , gravitational time dilation , gravitational waves , geodetic precession , Shapiro effect , etc .
It is these widely disparate observations , and the lack of any alternative theories explaining any of them , that lead people to say that SR and GR are " experimentally validated " .
There 's also the matter of simply " accepting " something , when a phenomenon is consistent with a theory that is already known to be valid .
The recoil from a gun is an example of this .
Everyone knows that there is a backward recoil when a gun is fired .
This is explained to people when they are first being taught how to use a gun , and they get used to it with practice .
The reason for the recoil is that it is an obvious consequence of Newtons ' laws of motion .
But people do n't specifically think about Newton 's laws , or consider this to be a " proof " , when they are firing a gun .
They just accept that the recoil is a known consequence of those laws .
Newton 's laws of motion have been validated through thousands of experiments much more focused than the firing of a gun .
The Cockcroft / Walton experiment is an example of this kind of acceptance .
The results are consistent ( to within 5 % when analyzed carefully ) with Special Relativity , and many people consider it to be a validation of SR .
But there were too many other things going on , such as the use of the newly - invented particle accelerator , to make it a definitive test .
One would have to think very carefully about what assumptions have to be made about what is happening in the experiment if one wanted to use it to assert anything about E=mc² .
However , famous as the experiment was at the time , it is no longer suggested as a validation of this formula .
Special Relativity had already been validated through more focused and definitive tests .
There are no known alternative theories , published in the scientific literature or listed in Counterexamples to Relativity , explaining the loss of mass .
See Cockcroft and Walton Experiment .
The anomalous behavior of the timing signals from GPS satellites is another example .
The phenomenon is well known — the system compensates for this ; otherwise it would n't work — and the phenomenon is known to be a consequence of both special and general relativity .
But the GPS system should not be considered and experiment to test relativity .
No sensible person would build the GPS system as a test of relativity , if only because it exhibits two phenomena ( time dilation of special relativity , 7 milliseconds per day , and time compression of general relativity , 45 milliseconds per day ) that work against each other .
No one would design an experiment that tests two phenomena working against each other .
The bending of light in a gravitational field is another example .
( In fact , it was the first , and , for a while , most famous piece of evidence in favor of GR , even though it was sloppily done . )
Newtonian physics also might predict the bending of light depending on whether one posits the " wave " formulation ( deflection is zero ) or the " particle " formulation ( deflection is 0.875 arc seconds ) .
But the actual deflection is 1.75 arc seconds , and GR predicts this value .
The are no known versions of Newtonian gravity that get this larger value .
While the experimental tests for General Relativity are rather esoteric , those for Special Relativity are fairly straightforward .
So much so that the Michelson - Morley experiment could be said to have single - handedly established the case for SR — the logical syllogism leading from Michelson - Morley to SR and the Lorentz transform was fairly clear once people saw it .
When analyzing an experiment to see whether it validates a theory , one must be careful not to assume the theory in one 's reasoning .
For establishing Special Relativity with the Michelson - Morley experiment , the assumptions are :
Newtonian and Galilean mechanics .
Galilean relativity , that is , the notion that there is no absolute frame of reference .
The universality of the speed of light .
And , of course , proper calibration of the equipment .
The third one was the observation that Michelson and Morley made .
For the derivation of E=mc² , these assumptions are added : Conservation of energy .
Conservation of momentum .
All of the assumptions listed above constitute SR .
It would be nearly inconceivable to derive GR without SR .
Gravitational time dilation , for example , requires a lot of information coming from SR .
So , for the experiments listed below for GR , the assumptions are the 6 above plus : The Equivalence Principle .
So the experiments below for GR are really just establishing that the Equivalence Principle is valid , and that GR follows logically from that .
The most famous experiment , and the one that is commonly cited in textbooks as the experiment that established the case for relativity , [ 38 ] was the Michelson - Morley experiment .
This showed that all observers will obtain the same measured value for the speed of light ( 3x108 meters per second ) no matter what their state of motion .
This is the first of the two fundamental principles :
The speed of light is constant for all observers , regardless of their velocities relative to each other .
The laws of physics are identical in all reference frames .
( The second is just a restatement of Galilean relativity , that is , the " common sense " that had been accepted for centuries . )
A naive " common sense " interpretation of Galilean relativity would require that measurements of the speed of light ( or anything else ) by different observers would get results that differ by the observers ' relative speeds , and hence that principle # 1 can't be true .
Special relativity fixes this apparent paradox .
All of special relativity derives for these two principles , plus assumptions of exact conservation of momentum and energy in all cases .
There are hundreds of experiments or observations that , to varying extents , " prove " , " validate " , or " are consistent with " special and general relativity .
A good survey may be found at this site .
Some experiments can be as simple as a spinning Alnico magnet [ 39 ] [ 40 ] and a voltmeter , that can be performed on a tabletop in a science classroom .
Just a few of the more important ones will be described here .
This is the most famous experiment , and is often taken as the experiment establishing the correctness of special relativity .
It is described elsewhere .
Mass Change Associated With Energy Change
This is the famous formula " E=mc² " .
At the end of Einstein 's original 1905 paper on the subject , [ 41 ] he speculates on the possibility that the equation , which would normally be very hard to verify , could be verified with the extremely high energies of the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity . [ 42 ]
In the 1910s , with the invention of the mass spectrometer , it became possible to measure masses of nuclei accurately .
This led to the clearing up of the mystery of atomic masses not being exact integers , and strongly suggested the existence of a " mass defect " ( or " packing fraction " ) consistent with the mass - energy equivalence .
In the 1930s , experiments with known nuclear reactions showed a very accurate correlation between the masses of the nuclei involved and the energy released .
See Quantitative Analysis of Alpha Decay .
Time Dilation
Another prediction of special relativity was time dilation in rapidly moving objects .
This effect was most famously verified in the anomalously slow decay of relativistic cosmic muons . [ 43 ]
Time dilation has since been verified many times , and is routinely taken into account in all high - energy nuclear physics experiments , as in Hadron collision experiments . [ 44 ]
This one is quite famous , because it was one of the earliest observations of phenomena involving mass change .
But , as noted above , it can't really be taken as a " proof " of relativity .
Bending of Light in a Gravitational Field
Unlike special relativity , predictions of general relativity turn out to be obscure and difficult to test .
The two most famous predictions in the early days were the bending of light in a gravitational field and the precession of the perihelia of orbiting planets .
Several other phenomena have arisen more recently .
The first of these was famously tested during a total eclipse in 1919 .
That test was somewhat muddled by an incorrect initial calculation , by several people including Einstein himself , of what the effect would be , and some " cherry picking " of the data to be used . [ 45 ]
The observed result was about 1.5 arc seconds .
The data selection could be considered " manipulation " or " fudging " , by a person ( Arthur Eddington ) who had a personal stake in the outcome .
His analysis techniques would not pass muster today .
The announcement of this test , flawed though it was , made Einstein world - famous . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
It should be noted that pre-relativistic ( Newtonian ) physics may also predict a bending , depending on whether one uses the 17th century " corpuscular " formulation or the 19th century " wave " formulation .
The former would give a value of 0.875 arc seconds , while the latter would give a value of zero .
Relying on the usual assumptions — Newtonian mechanics , Galilean relativity , conservation of energy and momentum , the universality of the speed of light ( that is , special relativity ) , the Equivalence Principle , and the geodesic equation in empty space ( that is , general relativity ) , and the proper calibration of the instruments , observations of later eclipses , and the observations of quasar 3C273 , confirm predictions of the theory , which is that the bending is 1.75 arc seconds .
No Nobel Prize was awarded for this .
A few years later Einstein won the Nobel Prize for the ( unrelated ) Photoelectric effect .
Precession of the orbit of Mercury
The second " classical " test of general relativity was the advance of the perihelion of the orbit of Mercury .
There are many complex effects contributing to this , including gravitational perturbations from other planets and the effect of the oblateness of the Sun .
These are hard to calculate accurately , but , by 1860 it was known quite accurately that there was an " anomalous " precession , that is , a precession beyond all other known effects , of 43 arc seconds per century .
This is a very tiny effect , but astronomical measurements were sufficiently accurate by that time to show it clearly .
This was based on observations going all the way back to about 1700 . [ 50 ]
It was calculated with great accuracy , and reported in 1859 , by Urbain Leverrier .
This was long before relativity was formulated .
One might wonder how astronomical observations accurate enough to measure such a tiny effect could have been made with the technology of that era .
A clever trick was used : Solar transits of Mercury were observed and timed .
Some of these transits were timed with an accuracy of about 15 seconds .
This created quite a problem — physicists by then were accustomed to having their theories check out very accurately .
One proposal that was made , by Simon Newcomb and Asaph Hall , was that the exponent of the radius in the gravitational formula was n't exactly 2 .
He showed that , by choosing an exponent of , the precession , as a fraction of a full orbit per planet 's year , is .
By setting to .000000157 , that is , an exponent of 2.000000157 , Newcomb was able to get a precession of .000000078 revolutions per Mercury year , or 43 arcseconds per Earth year .
Whatever value is chosen for , it gives the same precession , per revolution , for all orbiting bodies , but gravitational effects from other planets diminish that effect the further the planet is from the sun .
The approximation given at the end of Einstein 's 1916 paper [ 51 ] is revolutions per planet 's " year " , where a is the semi-major axis , T is the length of the planet 's year , and e is the eccentricity .
A much simpler , but less accurate , approximation , designed to show how the precession relates to the planet 's speed , is revolutions per planet 's " year " , where is the planet 's average orbital speed .
These are just approximations .
Getting an accurate value requires integrating the geodesic equation of the Schwartzschild metric , where Ricci 's tensor is zero .
While Newcomb 's theory , and general relativity , do n't lead to closed - form solutions , both theories can be solved numerically to as much precision as one desires .
The following table shows some approximate parameters for the planets .
Note that Mercury has the smallest orbit , and the fastest speed .
Precession of planets other than Mercury is extremely hard to measure , but measurements of the actual anomalous precessions are in good agreement . [ 52 ]
Planet Period , seconds x 106 Semimajor axis , meters x 109 Speed , meters / second x 103 Gravitational force , Newtons per kilogram Anomalous precession , arcseconds per ( Earth ) century , pure Newtonian mechanics Anomalous precession , Newtonian with exponent of 2.000000157 Anomalous precession , general relativity Measured anomalous precession ( estimated uncertainty ) [ 53 ]
Mercury 7.57 58.9 48 .039 0 43 43 43.5(5 ) Venus 19.6 108 35 .011 0 16.6 9 8(5 ) Earth 31.6 150 30 .006 0 10.3 4 5 (1 ) Mars 59.3 227.9 24 .0025 0 5.5 1.4 Jupiter 374 778.4 13 .0002 0 0.87 0.07 Saturn 929 1426 9.7 .00006 0 0.35 0.014 Uranus 2651 2870 6.8 .000016 0 0.12 0.002 Neptune 5200 4498 5.5 .000007 0 0.063 0.0008
Considering only the anomalous precession , that is , the precession that remains after all known other factors ( other planets and asteroids , solar oblateness ) have been accounted for , and using very accurate calculations rather than the approximations given above , general relativity predicts 42.98 ±0.04 arcseconds per century .
Some observed values , as of 2008 , are : 43.11 ± 0.21 ( Shapiro et al. , 1976 ) 42.92 ± 0.20 ( Anderson et al. , 1987 ) 42.94 ± 0.20 ( Anderson et al. , 1991 ) 43.13 ± 0.14 ( Anderson et al. , 1992 ) ( Source : Pijpers 2008 )
These error bars , and that of the general relativity prediction , all overlap .
No Nobel Prize was was awarded for this .
The Shapiro Effect
The Shapiro effect : A spacecraft signal dipping into a gravity well around the Sun is delayed slightly .
Another is the Shapiro effect , involving time delay in radio signals passing through the gravity well of the Sun or a planet .
Various spacecraft ( such as Cassini ) have confirmed this . [ 54 ]
Gravitational Time Dilation
Gravitational time dilation is an effect separate from the time dilation of special relativity .
It was tested by the Pound - Rebka experiment in 1959 .
No Nobel Prize was awarded for this .
Professor Pound had previously shared in the 1952 Nobel for his contributions to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging .
Gravitational Waves
Later in the 20th century , even more subtle phenomena were tested .
One was the phenomenon of gravitational radiation , or " gravitational waves " .
These waves are incredibly difficult to observe , and had never been observed until 2015 .
But extremely dense binary pulsars radiate gravitational waves with sufficient energy loss that , even though we can't detect the waves from Earth , we can see the effect of the energy loss from the radiation .
The extreme precision of the timing of pulses from pulsars makes it possible to observe their energy loss with great accuracy .
Observations by Hulse and Taylor of the pulsar pair known as B1913+16 , found the energy loss to be consistent with the predicted radiation .
This required choosing orbital parameters to be consistent with observation , in the same way that Kepler chose orbital parameters to fit observed planetary motion to his theory .
The rotating pulsars have since moved such that Earth is now out of the beams .
The assumptions required for this , in addition to those listed above , were that pulsars behave consistently .
The 1993 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for this .
In late 2015 ( and announced in 2016 ) , the LIGO instruments directly detected gravitational waves allegedly from colliding black holes .
See Gravitational waves .
Unlike the waves from orbiting pulsars , that could only be detected by the loss of rotation energy , the waves from colliding black holes were strong enough to be detected directly .
The assumptions required for this , in addition to those listed above , were that the objects emitting the radiation ( generally believed to be black holes , of course ) satisfy the Schwartzschild solution to relativistic mechanics .
The 2017 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for this .
Since that very early announcement , further observations of gravitational waves have continued to come in . [ 55 ]
In August 2019 the first detection of the gravitational waves from the merger of a black hole and a neutron star occurred . [ 56 ]
This was event S190814bv , 870 million light years away , and hence actually occurred 870 million years ago . [ 57 ]
In 2018 an observation of the 3 - body system PSR J0337+1715 , consisting of 2 white dwarfs and a pulsar , was consistent with ( and hence tended to confirm ) general relativity under conditions of extremely high gravity , to enormous precision .
The assumptions made were the same as those listed above .
One of the researchers stated " If there is a difference [ between observation and the prediction of the Equivalence Principle ] , it is no more than three parts in a million . " [ 58 ]
In 2018 , observations of a star orbiting the supermassive black hole " Sagittarius A* " at the center of our galaxy , showed that the light was stretched from the black hole 's gravity just as relativity predicted .
The star orbits Sagittarius A* at speeds of up to 16 million miles per hour .
This was the first observation of such intense gravity . [ 59 ]
Local Position Invariance
The equivalence principle , which is the underpinning of gravity under general relativity , states that there is absolutely no perceived effect of gravity on an object in free fall , that is , in a gravitational field .
This has been tested many times , and is the basis of all space - time calculations in relativity .
But in March 2019 , it was reported to have been successfully tested in a gravitational field very much stronger than ever before .
The phenomenon is called local position invariance , or LPI .
It was measured on the light emitted from a star called " S0 - 2 " , closely orbiting the " Sagittarius A * " black hole at the center of the galaxy .
The gravitational field that S0 - 2 is subject to is vastly more powerful than any other gravitational field that has been measured . [ 60 ]
Further Measurements near Sagittarius A*
In July 2019 , another star , S0 - 102 , was characterized accurately by Andrea Ghez and her team . [ 61 ]
It is even closer to the Sagittarius A* black hole than S0 - 2 .
Together , the two stars made it possible to map the gravity well in 3 dimensions , providing an even more accurate test of General Relativity .
" Making a measurement of such fundamental importance has required years of patient observing , enabled by state - of - the - art technology .
Through their rigorous efforts , Ghez and her collaborators have produced a high - significance validation of Einstein 's idea about strong gravity . "
The statistical significance of these measurements is 5 - sigma ( 5 σ ) .
That means that the probability that this result came about by sheer chance is 1 in 3.5 million .
It is the commonly accepted criterion for definitive validations .
Geodetic Precession
Geodetic precession ( also known as " de Sitter precession " ) , and frame dragging ( also known as the " Lense - Thirring effect " ) were tested by the " Gravity Probe B " satellite early in the 21st century . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ]
The precision required to observe this was phenomenal .
The results were announced on May 4 , 2011 .
Predicted consequences of the Theories
Time dilation
Light - cone diagram
One important consequence of relativity is that an observer in one reference frame will not in general observe a clock in another frame to be " ticking " at the same rate as one in the observer 's own frame .
In special relativity , where acceleration and gravitational effects are ignored , this can be derived using basic geometry .
The result is that clocks in all other inertial frames of reference other than the one you are in appear to tick slower .
This can be summarised by the well known phrase " moving clocks run slow " .
However , with general relativity , there are similar effects such as gravitational time dilation where a clockthat is higher in a gravitational field runs faster .
Often the effects of relativity are negligible .
However the high precision required for the GPS system needs relativistic corrections .
The rest of this section will concern only special relativity .
The length of an event , as seen by a ( relative ) stationary observer observing an event is given by :
Where
is the " proper time " or the length of the event in the observed frame of reference .
is the relative velocity between the reference frames .
is the speed of light ( 3x108 m s - 1 ) .
Evidence for time dilation was discovered by studying muon decay .
Muons are subatomic particles with a short halflife of 1.53 microseconds .
When produced by interactions of cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere , they have a speed around 0.994 c .
By putting muon detectors at the top ( D 1 ) and bottom ( D 2 ) of a mountain with a separation of 1900 m , scientists could measure accurately the proportion of muons reaching the second detector in comparison to the first .
The proportion found was different to the proportion that was calculated without taking into account relativistic effects .
Using the equation for exponential decay , they could use this proportion to calculate the time taken for the muons to decay , relative to the muon .
Then , using the time dilation equation they could then work out the dilated time .
The dilated time showed a good correlation with the time it took the muons to reach the second sensor , thereby supporting the existence of time dilation .
The time taken for a muon to travel from D 1 to D 2 as measured by a stationary observer is :
The fraction of muons arriving at D 2 in comparison to D 1 was 0.732 .
( Given by )
Since ( from the equation for exponential decay ) then
This gives the time for the proportion of decay to occur for an observer who is stationary , relative to the muon .
Putting this into the time dilation equation gives :
This is in good agreement with the value calculated above , thereby providing evidence to support time dilation .
Since either reference frame is equally valid , from the muon 's point of view it sees the earth approach it at nearly the speed of light .
Hence time passes faster for the muon ( slower for an observer on the ground ) .
This appears to be a contradiction .
However , the muon sees the height of the mountain contracted and so travels a shorter distance in its own frame .
See length contraction below .
Time Dilation and Creation Science
For a more detailed treatment , see Starlight problem # Humphreys.27_model .
Creation scientists such as physicists Dr. Russell Humphreys and Dr. John Hartnett have used relativistic time dilation to explain how the earth can be only 6,000 years old even though cosmological data ( background radiation , supernovae , etc. ) set a much older age for the universe .
Derivation of Time Dilation
Time dilation is most easily derived using the Lorentz transformations , though geometrical solution is also straight forward .
Using the transformation relating time between two frames of reference , and .
We can find the time difference between two events that occur at the same location in space .
The events shall be called event one and event 2 .
This results in the equations :
where
Subtracting the top equation from the bottom produces the time between the events as measured in each reference frame , so :
This the equation for time dilation and is the same equation as earlier .
Length contraction
When two inertial reference frames move past each other in a straight line with constant relative velocity , an observer in one reference frame would observe a metre rule in the other frame to be shorter along the direction parallel to the relative motion .
The length , , of an object as seen by a ( relative ) stationary observer is given by :
Where
is the " proper length " or the length of the object in its own frame of reference .
is the relative velocity between the reference frames .
is the speed of light m s - 1 is the Lorentz factor
Derivation
Length contraction may be derived using the Lorentz transformations as with time dilation .
This time we use the equation for .
In this case , the time in the undashed frame must be the same .
Following the same procedure as above we find that :
This is the same as above with and being the lengths in the undashed and dashed frames respectively .
Again , geometrical arguments may be used to achieve the same result .
Apparent mass increase
For decades the theory of relativity taught that as a body moves with increasing velocity its mass also increases . [ 70 ]
Under this view , the mass , , of an object as detected by a ( relative ) stationary observer is given by :
Where
is the " rest mass " or the mass of the object measured by an observer in the same reference frame as the object .
is the relative velocity of the object .
is the speed of light ( 3x108 ms - 1 ) .
Since speed is relative , it follows that two observers in different inertial reference frames may disagree on the mass and kinetic energy of a body .
Since all inertial reference frames are treated on an equal footing , it follows that mass and energy are interchangeable .
In recent years most physicists have shifted away from Einstein 's original reliance on relativistic mass and his suggestion that mass increases [ Citation Needed ] .
Instead , most physicists today teach that
where
is the momentum defined by is the standard Lorentz factor is the proper time
Force F defined this way is a vector and thus can handle the directional aspect of the relativistic effects better than the concept of relativistic mass can .
The abandonment by physicists of the concept of relativistic mass , however , has the consequence of undermining the traditional claim under relativity that
also popularly known as
Now a concept of the 4 - momentum of a particle is taught , such that the square of the magnitude of satisfies :
in any inertial reference frame .
The magnitude of the 4 - momentum , in any inertial frame , equals the rest mass of the particle ( in units where ) .
Relativity in everyday life
Due to the small speeds and gravitational fields in normal life , relativistic phenomena such as time dilation and length contraction are rarely observed .
However some things in everyday life can be explained using relativity :
GPS , the satellites experience time dilation due to the difference in speed and the strength of gravitational field between the satellite and the ground .
This is corrected by daily synchronisation between the ground and the atomic clocks in the satellites .
While most elemental metals such as silver , zinc and mercury have a silver / grey appearance , some metals like gold and copper do not .
This difference can be explained using relativistic quantum mechanics . [ 71 ]
Paradoxes
The predictions of the theory of relativity throw up a number of apparent paradoxes and anomalies relating to the effects of time dilatation and length contraction .
Whilst these paradoxes are consistent with the theory , they are contrary to everyday human experience and therefore can seem like impossibilities .
The Twin Paradox
The twin paradox is usually stated as a thought experiment involving two twins , one of whom is sent on a long journey in a spacecraft travelling at close to the speed of light , whilst the other remains on Earth .
Time dilatation means that the travelling twin , on his return to Earth , is younger that the twin who has remained at home .
However , because neither twin is in a special position - each being in an inertial frame of reference - the reverse must also be true , and so the twin remaining on Earth must be younger .
Hence each twin is younger than the other - a paradox .
The problem can be resolved in two ways .
One is to examine the effects of General Relativity : to come back to Earth , the travelling twin must undergo acceleration in order to reverse his course , causing temporal effects which make him permanently the younger .
Alternatively , it can be explained entirely using Special Relativity and noting that the twins are not in symmetrical situations : the one on earth has remained in a single inertial frame of reference , whilst the travelling twin has travelled in two . [ 72 ]
Note that the length of the trip cannot be increased as to make the acceleration negligible .
The Ehrenfest Paradox
The Ehrenfest Paradox considers a rigid wheel or disc rotating a bout its axis at high speed ( somewhat like a bicycle wheel spinning freely on its axle ) .
The rim of the wheel travels at close to the speed of light and therefore undergoes length contraction , whereas the radius ( the spokes , for the bicycle wheel ) does not .
Hence the circumference is no longer equal to 2 r , which is paradoxical .
The apparent paradox was finally resolved in 1975 by the Norwegian scientist Øyvind Grøn . [ 73 ]
Speed " paradox "
This is not a paradox .
It arises from failure to know or understand the " speed addition " formula .
The formula tells how fast each observer measures the speed of the other observer when they are both traveling toward each other , as seen by some outside observer , at speeds and .
Under classical mechanics , the result is just .
But the formula under special relativity is
This formula is a consequence of the Lorentz transform .
It is a well known part of the basic undergraduate physics curriculum .
So , if two spacecraft are approaching each other , each traveling at what an outside observer would measure as half the speed of light , a person ignorant of how relativity works might think they each see the other coming toward them at the speed of light .
But the formula shows that they actually see each other moving at of the speed of light .
If and are both less than the speed of light , one can show that the result of the addition formula will be also .
Variable Speed of Light
The Theory of Relativity implies that physical constants like c , the speed of light in a vacuum , have remained constant .
But at least one study suggests that physical constants , and possibly even the speed of light , have changed as the universe has aged . [ 74 ]
" For the first time , scientists have experimentally demonstrated that sound pulses can travel at velocities faster than the speed of light , c. William Robertson 's team from Middle Tennessee State University also showed that the group velocity of sound waves can become infinite , and even negative .
...
Although such results may at first appear to violate special relativity ( Einstein 's law that no material object can exceed the speed of light ) , the actual significance of these experiments is a little different .
These types of superluminal phenomena , Robertson et al. explain , violate neither causality nor special relativity , nor do they enable information to travel faster than c .
In fact , theoretical work had predicted that the superluminal speed of the group velocity of sound waves should exist .
' The key to understanding this seeming paradox is that no wave energy exceeded the speed of light , ' said Robertson . " [ 75 ]
" A team of researchers from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) has successfully demonstrated , for the first time , that it is possible to control the speed of light – both slowing it down and speeding it up – in an optical fiber , using off - the - shelf instrumentation in normal environmental conditions .
Their results , to be published in the August 22 issue of Applied Physics Letters , could have implications that range from optical computing to the fiber - optic telecommunications industry . " [ 76 ]
Both slowing down and speeding up of light within a substance other than a vacuum is made possible , because the light travels through the material , and that material affects the speed of light , i.e. a photon hits an electron , which then exits and emits a slightly lower energy photon out in the direction that the original photon was traveling , thus maintaining conservation of momentum .
No matter how transparent an object may appear , it radically impacts the speed of the light traveling through it , as demonstrated by the refractive production of a rainbow by a crystal , which Newton himself discovered .
This apparent change in speed can be explained , however , by noting that the constant c refers to the speed of light in a vacuum , i.e. , when it is unimpeded .
The speed of light when traveling through physical media is , in fact , variable .
" A pair of German physicists claim to have broken the speed of light - an achievement that would undermine our entire understanding of space and time .
... Dr Nimtz told New Scientist magazine : ' For the time being , this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of . ' " [ 77 ]
Pending research
Today some physicists are working on hypothesizing how general relativity might have related to the other three forces of nature during the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang .
Two of the more commonly studied attempts are string theory and loop quantum gravity , but they have failed to produce any evidence that science mandates a science must have , and both typically take large amounts of work to even conform to what scientists believe .
Critics increasingly point out that string theory and loop quantum gravity are largely untestable and unfalsifiable , and thus potentially unscientific under the principles of science advanced by Karl Popper . [ 78 ]
Relativity continues to be tested and some physics professors remain skeptical of the theory , such as University of Maryland physics professor Carroll Alley , who served as the principle physicist on the Apollo lunar project . [ 79 ]
Political aspects of relativity
Some liberal politicians have extrapolated the theory of relativity to metaphorically justify their own political agendas .
For example , Democratic President Barack Obama helped publish an article by liberal law professor Laurence Tribe to apply the relativistic concept of " curvature of space " to promote a broad legal right to abortion . [ 80 ]
As of June 2008 , over 170 law review articles have cited this liberal application of the theory of relativity to legal arguments .
[ 81 ]
Applications of the theory of relativity to change morality have also been common . [ 82 ]
Moreover , there is an unmistakable effort to censor or ostracize criticism of relativity . [ 83 ]
Physicist Robert Dicke of Princeton University was a prominent critic [ 84 ] of general relativity , and Dicke 's alternative " has enjoyed a renaissance in connection with theories of higher dimensional space - time . " [ 85 ]
Despite being one of the most accomplished physicists in the 20th century , Dicke was repeatedly passed over for a Nobel Prize , and in at least one case Dicke was insulted by the award being granted to others for contributions more properly credited to Dicke .
There has been little recognition by the Nobel Prize committee of either theory of relativity , and particularly scant recognition of the Theory of General Relativity .
A dubious 1993 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded Hulse and Taylor for supposedly finding the first evidence of gravitational waves in the orbital decay of the binary pulsar PSR1913+16 . [ 86 ]
A close reading of the paper reveals that that is based heavily on assumptions in trying to retrofit the data to the theory .
Government Support for Relativistic research
The Federal Government has funded the building of two gravity wave detectors :
The first to test the principle , and the second ( upgrade ) to actually perform measurements .
As a result of this work , on February 11 , 2016 , the LIGO team reported successful detection of gravitational waves caused by the merging of two black holes . [ 87 ]

Jython Reborn
Here 's a fun game to play at your next developer cocktail party .
If someone asks you what you 're interested in , tell them " Jython . "
Inevitably , their response will be , " Jython is dead . "
Six months ago , I would have agreed , but with recent investment by Sun Microsystems , it appears that Jython is very much alive and ready to be used .
I 'll spend a little bit of time talking about some recent Jython history , and then compile the latest revision of Jython from source and play around with it a bit .
Jython is one of the many dynamic languages built on top of the Java Virtual Machine .
The Jython project began in 1997 .
The original release was written by Jim Hugunin , who worked on it until 1999 .
Jim currently develops IronPython , the .NET implementation of Python .
Between 1999 and 2005 , Jython passed among several lead developers , finally ending up with Frank Wierzbicki .
In March of this year , Frank was hired by Sun Microsystems to work on Jython full time .
Sun 's recent hiring of two lead JRuby developers , plus the hiring of Ted Leung as " Principal Engineer , Dynamic Languages and Tools , " shows just how serious Sun appears to be in its future support of dynamic languages on the JVM .
Jython and JRuby are n't alone ; the JVM language space is getting crowded , Scala , Rhino ( a Javascript implementation written by the Mozilla Foundation ) , Clojure ( a Lisp dialect ) , and Groovy all have their proponents .
The current release of Jython is 2.2 , which conforms to the CPython 2.2 release .
However , after 2.2 , the Jython developers started to move in a new direction for the implementation , choosing ASM and ANTLR to speed development time .
Although it 's still in development , I 'll focus on the 2.3 trunk version of Jython .
A 2.5 implementation ( again , that conforms to the 2.5 release of CPython ) is slated to be the next official release ) .
To get started on the latest version of Jython , you 'll have to check it out of the Sourceforge repository .
On Linux or OSX , you can execute the command :
svn co https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/
jython/trunk/jython
at the command prompt .
On Windows , you can use TortoiseSVN to check out the repository .
The next step is to compile the project into a jar file using Maven .
Change directories into the maven directory in the project , then run mvn install .
After the command is finished , you should have a directory in the root of the distribution called " dist , " and a jar file " jython. jar " inside of it .
You can start the interactive interpreter by executing the jar file , like this :
cotton : dist cmcavoy $ java - jar jython.jar Jython 2.3a0 on java1.5.0_13
Type " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>>
Once in the interpreter , you can use it just as you would the CPython interpreter , with the extra feature of being able to import Java libraries , just as you would a Python library .
The interpreter is a great way to explore what Jython has to offer .
However , Jython becomes very useful as a way to execute scripts .
When writing a standard Python script , you can execute the script by running " python script.py " , or by including " #!/usr/bin/env python " at the top of the script and making it executable .
To execute a Python script with the Jython interpreter , you pass the script name as an argument to Java , like this :
java - Dpython.home=< path >/ dist / - jar < path>/dist/jython.jar script.py
If you replace < path > with the base directory of your Jython distribution , you can execute Python scripts using Jython .
The Jython wiki recommends a simple way to wrap the above in a shell script for easy execution .
Create a file called jython that sits on your path ; inside of it , put :
#!/bin/sh exec java - Dpython.home=< path >/ dist / - jar < path>/dist/jython.jar $* *
You have to replace < path > with the path to your Jython distribution , just as you did when you executed scripts by hand .
Now that you have the ability to execute scripts with Jython , see how it performs compared to CPython .
You 'll use a native Fibonacci calculator for an initial comparison .
The script fib .py looks like this :
scratch = {} def fib( n ) : global scratch try : return scratch [ n ] except KeyError : if n < 2 : return n scratch [ n ] = fib ( n - 1 ) + fib( n - 2 ) return scratch [ n ] for i in range ( 50 ) : print fib( i ) ,
Notice that you keep a ' scratch ' global dictionary as a poor man 's memoizer , so that you do n't recompute previously computed pieces of the sequence .
To carry out your tremendously unscientific speed comparison , you 'll use the Unix ' time ' utility .
Here 's the run in CPython :
cotton : play cmcavoy $ time python fib.py 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 10946 17711 28657 46368 75025 121393 196418 317811 514229 832040 1346269 2178309 3524578 5702887 9227465 14930352 24157817 39088169 63245986 102334155 165580141 267914296 433494437 701408733 1134903170 1836311903 2971215073 4807526976 7778742049 real 0m0.025s user 0m0.013s sys 0m0.012s
That 's pretty fast .
Now , the Jython run :
cotton : play cmcavoy $ time jython fib.py 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 10946 17711 28657 46368 75025 121393 196418 317811 514229 832040 1346269 2178309 3524578 5702887 9227465 14930352 24157817 39088169 63245986 102334155 165580141 267914296 433494437 701408733 1134903170 1836311903 2971215073 4807526976 7778742049 real 0m1.303s user 0m1.065s sys 0m0.099s
Not so fast .
However , computing the Fibonacci sequence is n't really the strength of Jython .
If you 're looking for computational speed , you 're much better off using lower - level languages .
Jython 's sweet spot is where development time needs to be fast , but infrastructure demands require big , well - supported containers to run everything in .
Conclusion
In many cases , running CPython is n't an option for a development team .
Java has really become the lingua franca of the majority .
Companies have invested heavily in Java infrastructures ; writing software in these cases usually means writing to the JVM .
Java is arguably not the world 's most ' agile ' language .
Having options such as Jython and company to work with capitalizes on the big business buy in of Java with the speedy development time of Python .

You remember the anthrax attacks  or do you ?
It often seems , to me at least , that this important catalyst for the invasion of Iraq and our supremely wrong - headed post - 9/11 foreign policy has been flushed down the collective memory hole .
For all the attention that ’s been paid to that spooky chapter in the history of the " war on terrorism " in the intervening years , it may as well have never occurred .
That ’s why news of the former prime suspect ’s ultimate vindication  and his victory in a $ 5.8 million lawsuit in which he accused the feds of unfairly targeting him as a " person of interest " ( as John Ashcroft put it )  seems like a visitation from another time , the ghost of 9/11 past , haunting and mocking us .
It sends chills down my spine  because , you see , the real culprits are still out there .
The FBI ’s non-investigation of this heinous and sinister crime was a joke from the beginning : after all , since when do FBI probes have official names , and why such a silly one as " Amerithrax " ?
Such brazen corniness has about it an unmistakable Keystone Kops air , which was certainly evident throughout the long - playing media circus that will evermore be known as the persecution of Steven J. Hatfill .
Hatfill , you ’ll recall , is the long - suffering victim of this horror story , a bio - weapons expert and " insider " who was targeted as the culprit not only by the FBI and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , but also by dustbin Dylanologist A.J. Weberman , who , with characteristic restraint , accused him of being " the scumbag who killed several people in an attempt to awaken America to the dangers of biological warfare . "
This profile of the killer or killers as a " rogue insider " was also pushed by Barbara Hatch Rosenberg , a biowar expert at the State University of New York at Purchase , who chairs the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Program of the Federation of American Scientists .
It was Rosenberg who became the mainstream media ’s expert - in - residence at the height of the anthrax scare , and , although she never named Hatfill , it was she who relentlessly pushed the " insider " thesis to the major news organizations , which settled on her detective story as the conventional wisdom .
A story that turned out to be spectacularly , disastrously , and tragically wrong .
Tragic , that is , from the perspective of poor Hatfill , who found himself vilified and hounded out of his job , deprived of his position in the community , and practically run out of human society by his relentless pursuers .
The Hatfill - haters ’ narrative went something like this : Senor Hatfill is a right - wing nut - case with dubious connections to South Africa ’s apartheid regime , and quite possibly a " bio-evangelist " ( as Weberman put it ) who might conceivably have planned the attacks to " warn " us of the dangers of biowar  by demonstrating , on a small scale , how terrorists might envelop a nation in a miasma of fear .
Which is precisely what the anthrax attacks accomplished .
The administration invoked them as part and parcel of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and the War Party pointed to Saddam Hussein as the probable culprit .
Andrew Sullivan , who had earlier accused the antiwar movement of being part of a bi-coastal " fifth column , " was so certain the anthrax attacks were proof of Iraq ’s perfidy that he called on the U.S. to drop nuclear bombs on the Iraqis in retaliation .
The anthrax letters that arrived at major media outlets as well as the Senate offices of two prominent Democrats certainly added a special fillip of fear to the war hysteria that ensued in the wake of 9/11 : the senders definitely had an agenda , and there seems little doubt as to what they aimed at : to prepare the nation for war , for some kind of massive retaliation against the Arab world .
That was the agenda , and it largely succeeded  but whose agenda was it ?
Hatfill ’s exoneration raises the question : if he did n’t mail the anthrax letters , then who did ?
The answer is not really a mystery , since all the facts are on the public record , but I ’ll reiterate them here in case you are n’t familiar with my past writings on this fascinating subject .
Just before the anthrax letters became public knowledge but after they ’d been mailed , military police headquarters at Quantico , Virginia , received a letter that accused an Arab scientist who once worked at the USAMRID facility , a biowarfare lab at Ft. Detrick , of being a terrorist about to unleash biological warfare against civilian targets in the U.S .
The author of this anonymous missive claimed to have been one of the scientist ’s former co-workers , and appeared to have a detailed knowledge of Assaad ’s career and daily routine .
When the anthrax letters were opened , the FBI paid a visit to Dr. Ayaad Assaad , a former Ft. Detrick employee , and questioned him extensively .
The FBI cleared Assaad of any connection to the anthrax letters early on , but then seemed to have let this significant clue grow quite cold , failing to follow up on it until the winter of 2004 , when they launched an investigation into the Quantico letter .
It seems clear that whoever sent that letter had at least foreknowledge of the anthrax attacks , and discovering the writers ’ identity could certainly lead us to the source of the attacks .
Yet for years the FBI did nothing : instead , they chased Hatfill around , following him everywhere , blackening his name  and diverting attention away from the only hard evidence that has so far surfaced in this baffling case .
What were the results of the Quantico investigation ?
The Hartford Courant , which ran a series of articles on the anthrax case and the attempted framing of Dr. Assaad , was the only media outlet , to my knowledge , that reported on this development , which seems mysterious in itself .
As for the outcome , that , too , remains a mystery  as does practically everything connected with this murky affair .
Dr. Assaad , an Egyptian - born biologist who worked at USAMRID in the early 1990s , was the target of a hateful harassment campaign that became the subject of a federal lawsuit later settled out of court .
The defendants in the suit were a group of USAMRID employees who targeted Assaad by sending him anti-Arab missives  including a rubber camel outfitted with a sex toy  and composed poems that they left on his desk .
An account in the Courant depicts the bizarre atmosphere in which U.S. government scientists worked on toxins powerful enough to kill off entire populations :
“ Assaad said he was working on the Saturday before Easter 1991 , just after the Persian Gulf War had ended , when he discovered an eight - page poem in his mailbox .
The poem , which became a court exhibit , is 47 stanzas  235 lines in all , many of them lewd , mocking Assaad .
The poem also refers to another creation of the scientists who wrote it  a rubber camel outfitted with all manner of sexually explicit appendages .
“ The poem reads : ‘ In [ Assaad ’s ] honor we created this beast ; it represents life lower than yeast . ’
The camel , it notes , each week will be given ‘ to who did the least . ’
“ The poem also doubles as an ode to each of the participants who adorned the camel , who number at least six and referred to themselves as ‘ the camel club . ’
Two  Dr. Philip M. Zack and Dr. Marian K. Rippy  voluntarily left Fort Detrick soon after Assaad brought the poem to the attention of supervisors . ”
The ideological flavor of the Camel Club ’s jibes is n’t too hard to fathom : they sound just like the participants in the hate - fest over at Little Green Footballs , or , come to think of it , the editorial board of the Weekly Standard .
The anthrax - laden letters read " Death to America " and " Death to Israel , " and invoked the name of Allah .
Clearly this was n’t just an attempt to set up a particular Arab , Dr. Assaad , but to finger all Arab - Americans , and Muslims , as potential terrorists  weeks after bin Laden and his boys downed the World Trade Center and took out the Pentagon .
The trail that leads us to the perpetrators of the anthrax letter terrorist attacks ends at Ft. Detrick , where the " Camel Club " held court .
Check out this Courant story that details the incredible laxity of the security controls in place at one of the U.S. government ’s most sensitive military facilities  and then imagine how easy it was for the terrorists to have smuggled out anthrax and other even more lethal toxins .
Does n’t any of this merit investigation by our " law enforcement ’ agencies  or are they too busy reading ordinary people ’s email and spying on antiwar organizations to bother going after a gang of dangerous poisoners and murderers ?
In settling with Hatfill for mega- bucks , the U.S. government is n’t officially admitting any wrongdoing ,  and we should n’t hold our breath waiting for anything like an apology  but clearly something was going on behind the scenes that looks very much like obstruction of the investigation .
Of course it ’s easy for a libertarian like me to scoff at the inefficiencies of government agencies : that ’s comes with the territory  and is , furthermore , a well - known fact [ .pdf ] .
Yet there seems something a bit more dicey than mere incompetence at work here .

My book , Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement was first published in 1993 , and quickly went out of print .
Warning that the conservative movement was being hijacked by a bunch of war - crazed " neocons , " who were intent on promulgating their nutty doctrine of " benevolent global hegemony , " the book was the first treatment of what I call the War Party as an ideological phenomenon  and an imminent danger to liberty and the peace of the world .
The book also presciently invoked an older , alternative ideological heritage for conservatives in search of sanity on the foreign policy front , presenting portraits of the writers , politicians , and publicists who would later come to be known as the " Old Right . "
Here was an account of a self - avowedly conservative political movement that was anti-imperialist as well as anti-statist , and , what ’s more , was deeply rooted in the American political tradition .
The book caught on with paleoconservatives , and Pat Buchanan contributed a trenchant introduction to the second printing that called it " the Iliad of the American Right . "
Now the Intercollegiate Studies Institute has reissued Reclaiming in a handsome new edition , with a wonderful introduction by Georgetown University political scientist George W. Carey , and essays by Chronicles magazine editor Scott Richert and Mises Insitute scholar David Gordon .
The relevance of this book to today can hardly be underestimated , and this is underscored by the first lines , in which I wonder why , after decades in power , " has the conservative movement failed to make a dent in the growth of big government ? "
As I put it in 1993 , so it is today : " Bewildered , frustrated , and demoralized , the men and women of the Right are asking themselves :
What went wrong ? "
Reclaiming answers : A lot more than George W. Bush .

Most large museums and art galleries today provide some kind of personal audio device that visitors can carry with them if they wish to learn more about the various exhibits on display .
A similar idea has been implemented at the Brühl ’s Terrace in Dresden , Germany , but instead of having to wear headphones or hold some device to their ear , visitors simply need to rest their elbows on a metal rail and cover their ears with their hands .
Using bone conduction technology ( or what they call ‘ Touched Echo ’ ) the sounds of airplanes and explosions simulating the air raid that occurred on February 13 , 1945 are transmitted from the metal rail through the visitor ’s arms and directly into the inner ear .
The sounds are completely inaudible to someone who is n’t touching the rail , and since the terrace is located outside , the bone conduction system is a perfect solution because it ’s completely weatherproof .
I ’ve also included a video that demonstrates how the system is used and what the simulated air raid sounds like .

RELEASE : 08-126
Discovery of Most Recent Supernova in Our Galaxy
WASHINGTON --
The most recent supernova in our galaxy has been discovered by tracking the rapid expansion of its remains .
This result , using NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Large Array , will help improve our understanding of how often supernovae explode in the Milky Way galaxy .
The supernova explosion occurred about 140 years ago , making it the most recent in the Milky Way .
Previously , the last known supernova in our galaxy occurred around 1680 , an estimate based on the expansion of its remnant , Cassiopeia A. Finding such a recent , obscured supernova is a first step in making a better estimate of how often the stellar explosions occur .
This is important because supernovae heat and redistribute large amounts of gas , and pump heavy elements out into their surroundings .
They can trigger the formation of new stars as part of a cycle of stellar death and rebirth .
The explosion also can leave behind , in addition to the expanding remnant , a central neutron star or black hole .
The recent supernova explosion was not seen with optical telescopes because it occurred close to the center of the galaxy and is embedded in a dense field of gas and dust .
This made the object about a trillion times fainter , in optical light , than an unobscured supernova .
However , the remnant it caused can be seen by X -ray and radio telescopes .
"
We can see some supernova explosions with optical telescopes across half of the universe , but when they 're in this murk we can miss them in our own cosmic backyard , " said Stephen Reynolds of North Carolina State University in Raleigh , who led the Chandra study .
" Fortunately , the expanding gas cloud from the explosion shines brightly in radio waves and X - rays for thousands of years .
X -ray and radio telescopes can see through all that obscuration and show us what we 've been missing .
" Astronomers regularly observe supernovae in other galaxies like ours .
Based on those observations , researchers estimate about three explode every century in the Milky Way .
"
If the supernova rate estimates are correct , there should be the remnants of about 10 supernova explosions that are younger than Cassiopeia A , " said David Green of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom , who led the Very Large Array study .
" It 's great to finally track one of them down .
" The tracking of this object began in 1985 , when astronomers , led by Green , used the Very Large Array to identify the remnant of a supernova explosion near the center of our galaxy .
Based on its small size , it was thought to have resulted from a supernova that exploded about 400 to 1000 years ago .
Twenty - two years later , Chandra observations revealed the remnant had expanded by a surprisingly large amount , about 16 percent , since 1985 .
This indicates the supernova remnant is much younger than previously thought .
That young age was confirmed in recent weeks when the Very Large Array made new radio observations .
This comparison of data pinpoints the age of the remnant at 140 years - possibly less if it has been slowing down - making it the youngest on record in the Milky Way .
Besides being the record holder for youngest supernova , the object is of considerable interest for other reasons .
The high expansion velocities and extreme particle energies that have been generated are unprecedented and should stimulate deeper studies of the object with Chandra and the Very Large Array .
"
No other object in the galaxy has properties like this , " Reynolds said .
" This find is extremely important for learning more about how some stars explode and what happens in the aftermath .
" These results are scheduled to appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , manages the Chandra program for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .

The War on Photography
What is it with photographers these days ?
Are they really all terrorists , or does everyone just think they are ?
Since 9/11 , there has been an increasing war on photography .
Photographers have been harassed , questioned , detained , arrested or worse , and declared to be unwelcome .
We ’ve been repeatedly told to watch out for photographers , especially suspicious ones .
Clearly any terrorist is going to first photograph his target , so vigilance is required .
Except that it ’s nonsense .
The 9/11 terrorists did n’t photograph anything .
Nor did the London transport bombers , the Madrid subway bombers , or the liquid bombers arrested in 2006 .
Timothy McVeigh did n’t photograph the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
The Unabomber did n’t photograph anything ; neither did shoe - bomber Richard Reid .
Photographs are n’t being found amongst the papers of Palestinian suicide bombers .
The IRA was n’t known for its photography .
Even those manufactured terrorist plots that the US government likes to talk about — the Ft. Dix terrorists , the JFK airport bombers , the Miami 7 , the Lackawanna 6 — no photography .
Given that real terrorists , and even wannabe terrorists , do n’t seem to photograph anything , why is it such pervasive conventional wisdom that terrorists photograph their targets ?
Why are our fears so great that we have no choice but to be suspicious of any photographer ?
Because it ’s a movie - plot threat .
A movie - plot threat is a specific threat , vivid in our minds like the plot of a movie .
You remember them from the months after the 9/11 attacks : anthrax spread from crop dusters , a contaminated milk supply , terrorist scuba divers armed with almanacs .
Our imaginations run wild with detailed and specific threats , from the news , and from actual movies and television shows .
These movie plots resonate in our minds and in the minds of others we talk to .
And many of us get scared .
Terrorists taking pictures is a quintessential detail in any good movie .
Of course it makes sense that terrorists will take pictures of their targets .
They have to do reconnaissance , do n’t they ?
We need 45 minutes of television action before the actual terrorist attack — 90 minutes if it ’s a movie — and a photography scene is just perfect .
It ’s our movie - plot terrorists that are photographers , even if the real - world ones are not .
The problem with movie - plot security is it only works if we guess the plot correctly .
If we spend a zillion dollars defending Wimbledon and terrorists blow up a different sporting event , that ’s money wasted .
If we post guards all over the Underground and terrorists bomb a crowded shopping area , that ’s also a waste .
If we teach everyone to be alert for photographers , and terrorists do n’t take photographs , we ’ve wasted money and effort , and taught people to fear something they should n’t .
And even if terrorists did photograph their targets , the math does n’t make sense .
Billions of photographs are taken by honest people every year , 50 billion by amateurs alone in the US .
And the national monuments you imagine terrorists taking photographs of are the same ones tourists like to take pictures of .
If you see someone taking one of those photographs , the odds are infinitesimal that he ’s a terrorist .
Of course , it ’s far easier to explain the problem than it is to fix it .
Because we ’re a species of storytellers , we find movie - plot threats uniquely compelling .
A single vivid scenario will do more to convince people that photographers might be terrorists than all the data I can muster to demonstrate that they ’re not .
Fear aside , there are n’t many legal restrictions on what you can photograph from a public place that ’s already in public view .
If you ’re harassed , it ’s almost certainly a law enforcement official , public or private , acting way beyond his authority .
There ’s nothing in any post - 9/11 law that restricts your right to photograph .
This is worth fighting .
Search “ photographer rights ” on Google and download one of the several wallet documents that can help you if you get harassed ; I found one for the UK , US , and Australia .
Do n’t cede your right to photograph in public .
Do n’t propagate the terrorist photographer story .
Remind them that prohibiting photography was something we used to ridicule about the USSR .
Eventually sanity will be restored , but it may take a while .

( Natural News ) A California state advisory panel has recommended that the state conduct an investigation into whether caffeine poses a risk to the unborn children of pregnant women .
"
If I were a pregnant woman or a woman thinking about being pregnant , I would want to know , should I be avoiding caffeine ? " said Renee Sharp of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group .
" It 's a really important question , and I think people are looking for answers .
" The recommendation from the Science Advisory Board Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification Committee is nonbinding , but a spokesperson from the California the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment promised to " give it heavy weight because this is a panel of scientific experts .
"
If the state determines that caffeine poses a risk to unborn children , it would have to place warning labels on certain caffeine - containing beverages as a result .
Under Proposition 65 , a voter initiative that became law in 1986 , any product sold in California that is known to cause cancer or birth defects must carry a warning label .
However , the law applies only to added ingredients , not naturally occurring ones .
This distinction would mean that while caffeinated sodas might end up requiring a warning label , tea or coffee would not .
The panel 's recommendation came as part of a larger two - year review of 283 chemicals that had been identified by state officials as potentially in need of a Proposition 65 warning .
Eight chemicals , including caffeine and bisphenol A , were selected for closer consideration .
According to advisory board member Hillary Klonoff - Cohen , studies have linked caffeine consumption to miscarriages , premature birth and low birth weight .
On the other hand , a variety of health groups including the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the March of Dimes and the Mayo Clinic have said that consuming up to two cups of coffee or seven caffeinated soft drinks per day is safe for pregnant women .
This ambiguity is part of why the board concluded that further studies are needed .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Bob Barr was once a loyal soldier in the Republican Party --­ a lawmaker GOP leaders could count on to return home each weekend and echo their talking points at local political events , town hall meetings and civic lunches .
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr abandoned the Republican Party in 2006 .
As a young political reporter in Marietta , Georgia , I often heard Barr serve up generous helpings of Republican doctrine over buffet lunches and chicken dinners .
For Republican leaders such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich , ­ who represented a neighboring district , ­Barr was a dedicated warrior .
And he remained so even after he lost a primary fight in 2002 to colleague John Linder , ­ a battle set up by redistricting .
But a few years later , Barr went AWOL from the Republican Party -- or , as he tells it , the GOP abandoned him .
Watch Barr describe what caused the split »
He is now the Libertarian Party 's presidential nominee and is crisscrossing the country promoting its principles and hunting for votes .
So why did Barr abandon the Republican Party in 2006 ?
" It probably was n't any one thing , " he said during our conversation last week outside the White House .
" But perhaps listening to the attorney general of the United States , in a purportedly conservative Republican administration of George W. Bush , justify to the American people that the writ of habeas corpus , the great writ , the foundation of civilized society as we know it , is no longer important .
Watching a president and his attorney general try and torture the language of the law and the language of the Fourth Amendment to justify warrantless spying on American citizens in their own country in the name of being a commander in chief .
" Those are so dramatically inconsistent with any notions of legitimate , constitutional , conservative government , that I certainly could not be party to , or remain in a party that advocated those procedures . "
His former colleagues now view him as a traitor at worst , misguided at best .
Barr could be the Ralph Nader of 2008 -- taking away enough support from presumptive Republican nominee John McCain to hand presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama a victory in November .
Even Obama 's campaign has said it is eyeing Georgia and Alaska in large part because of Barr 's presence in the race .
Barr is likely to draw support in his home state as well as the frontier state of Alaska , which is known for its Libertarian streak .
Barr said a GOP senator recently approached him to ask that he drop his White House bid , a request that has come from more than one Republican since he received the Libertarian Party nomination in May .
The senator 's plea­ fell on deaf ears .
( ­Barr would not reveal the lawmaker 's identity ) .
" What they say is , ' It 's not that we disagree with what you 're doing , Barr .
It 's not that we do n't understand .
We do understand , and we actually agree with what you 're saying , but we do n't want to vote against a Republican because that might help the Democrat , ' " Barr said of the talks he has had with those who want him to quit .
" It 's all about partisan politics .
It 's not about substance .
It 's not about principles , which is what I and the Libertarian Party stand for .
It 's all about partisan politics .
That 's what has to change and that 's one of the reasons I 'm running . "
If elected president , Barr said he would " substantively " cut the size of government , including a 10 percent slash in the budget for the " executive office of the president ; " refuse " to sign legislation that ratchets up the ceiling of the national debt ; " and make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent on improving education back home instead sending the money to Iraq .
So , does Barr think he will be to McCain what Nader was to Al Gore in 2000 ?
" I 'm not in this as a spoiler , " he emphatically stated during the interview .
" I am 59 years old .
I have better things to do with my time than worry about spoiling it .
If Sen. McCain is not successful on November 4th , it will be because John McCain and the Republican Party did not present a vision , an agenda , a platform and a candidate to the American people that a plurality of the voters of this country could embrace and buy into . "
To achieve any success in this election , Barr is going to have to tap into the " Ron Paul Revolution " -- a grassroots movement that rallied around Texas Rep.
Ron Paul 's longshot bid for the presidency .
Barr said he has been in touch with Paul to talk strategy but added he has not asked for the Texas Republican 's endorsement .
Paul , himself , ran for president as the Libertarian Party 's nominee in 1988 .
So , with a proposed budget of $ 40 to $ 45 million ( less than half of what McCain will have and eight times less than what Obama is expected to raise ) , a political party whose infrastructure is nowhere near that of the Democratic nor Republican parties , and lots of other hurdles , what does he think of his chances ?
" I intend to be in the White House in January 2009 , " he said without hesitation .
" I know it 's a long shot , I 'm not unrealistic about this .
It is a long shot .
The major two parties stacked the deck tremendously against a third party candidacy such as mine , but the dynamics this election cycle make the possibility of winning as the third party candidate much more realistic , much more doable than any time in the past . "
So will he win ?
No .
But you have to give him credit for trying .

Dear all ,
There is a guy called Ahmed Maher , who is a Kefaya activist and was the person responsible for operating Esra ' s facebook account and the May4th group while she was in jail .
Ahmed has been on the run from even before the May 4th strike , never staying in one area for too long and always hiding .
I thought he was being paranoid .
He was n't .
A couple of days ago as he was about to drive his car , another car stopped in front of him .
When he tried to back away , three cars came up from behind him .
The Boy was trapped , so he gave up and let them take him at 1 pm .
They took him to an isolated location and proceeded to beat the living shit out of him for 13 consecutive hours in order for him to give them his e-mail that he regsiterd with on facebook and his password , in order to shut down that facebook group , finally letting him go a bloody mess at 2 am the next day .
Now , ignore the blatant violation of his human rights and the apparent thuggery of the government for a second , and think about the following :
For a good week , an entire State Security unit- possibly with follow - up by higher command - has been hunting a guy all over cairo , for the mere fact that he has a facebook account and runs a facebook group .
Let that sink in for a second , and then answer me this :
Do n't you feel safer already ?

Pure heaven .
Cynics might argue that the mojito is getting a bit too popular these days , but there 's no denying that this is simply a great drink .
The mix of mint , rum and lime juice is truly refreshing .
For a related drink that 's not quite as well known , see the Caipirinha My wife would say that margaritas are great drinks all year ' round , but I think they are especially delicious during the hot summer .

There are as many sangria recipes out there as there are people who make it , but I 'll share with you a solid , simple , and not - too - sweet red sangria recipe : Cook 's Illustrated apparently did a series of sangria taste tests , using red wines of varying price and quality .

( On a separate note : does anybody know if Cook 's Illustrated is hiring ? )
And of course you do n't have to stop at red sangria .
Try white sangria ( using white wine ) , or if you have some Blue Curacao , you can add it to white sangria for an exotic - looking blue sangria .

Birds such as the puffin could be affected by a decline in zooplankton Experts on invertebrates have expressed " profound shock " over a government report showing a decline in zooplankton of more than 70 % since the 1960s .
The tiny animals are an important food for fish , mammals and crustaceans .
Figures contained in the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) document , Marine Programme Plan , suggested a fall in abundance .
Charity Buglife said it could be a " biodiversity disaster of enormous proportions " .
They said it could have implications for creatures all the way up the food chain , from sand eels to the seabirds , such as puffin , which feed on the fish .
Zooplankton is the basis of many food chains in the marine environment
Craig Macadam
Buglife Defra described the Marine Programme Plan as one of the department 's high impact programmes , reporting directly to the Defra board and used to guide policy .
Buglife director Matt Shardlow has written to Rodney Anderson , director of marine and fisheries at Defra , praising the level of information in the document but also expressing the organisation 's serious concerns .
In his letter , seen by the BBC Scotland news website , Mr Shardlow said : " The disappearance of butterflies , moth , bees , riverflies and other small animals is an environmental tragedy .
" But , despite this experience , we were profoundly shocked to read that zooplankton abundance has declined by about 73 % since 1960 and about 50 % since 1990 .
" This is a biodiversity disaster of enormous proportions . "
A graph shown in the report charts a steady decline in zooplankton from 1990 to 2006 .
Buglife Scottish officer , Craig Macadam , said climate change could be a factor .
He said : " Zooplankton is the basis of many food chains in the marine environment .
" Without them it is going to cause problems further up the chain . "

What are these ?
We first wrote about the idea of seasteading ( building new countries offshore on oil platforms ) in 2009 .
At the time , I had this to offer …
No doubt it ’s an interesting notion , but is this practical ?
Living on the sea ?
Just think of how much risk that could entail .
Of course you ’d do the research to make sure you ’re settling in a place that is n’t prone to natural disaster , but it ’s still THE SEA .
Talk about a wildcard if there every was one .
Commenter Tully had this to say …
Yeah , [ … ] a small settlement of massive egos all working together in perfect harmony !
What could possibly go wrong ? 🙂
Could be fun to watch , though .
From a distance .
Like a too - full cage of fight - trained angry pit bulls .
Well , guess what …
Pay Pal founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel has given $ 1.25 million to an initiative to create floating libertarian countries in international waters , according to a profile of the billionaire in Details magazine .
Thiel has been a big backer of the Seasteading Institute , which seeks to build sovereign nations on oil rig - like platforms to occupy waters beyond the reach of law - of - the - sea treaties .
The idea is for these countries to start from scratch–free from the laws , regulations , and moral codes of any existing place .
Details says the experiment would be “ a kind of floating petri dish for implementing policies that libertarians , stymied by indifference at the voting booths , have been unable to advance : no welfare , looser building codes , no minimum wage , and few restrictions on weapons . ”
“ There are quite a lot of people who think it ’s not possible , ” Thiel said at a Seasteading Institute Conference in 2009 , according to Details .
( His first donation was in 2008 , for $ 500,000 . )
“ That ’s a good thing .
We do n’t need to really worry about those people very much , because since they do n’t think it ’s possible they wo n’t take us very seriously .
And they will not actually try to stop us until it ’s too late .
”
Here ’s the thing …even if it is possible … why would anybody want to live there ?
What are the benefits ?
Fewer taxes ?
Legal prostitution and drugs ?
Also , can you really be free if you ca n’t enjoy all that America has to offer ?
Sorry , I still do n’t get it .
But if you do , tell me how this would work .
WASHINGTON  Senator Barack Obama ’s decision to support legislation granting legal immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with the Bush administration ’s program of wiretapping without warrants has led to an intense backlash among some of his most ardent supporters .
Thousands of them are now using the same grass - roots organizing tools previously mastered by the Obama campaign to organize a protest against his decision .
In recent days , more than 7,000 Obama supporters have organized on a social networking site on Mr. Obama ’s own campaign Web site .
They are calling on Mr. Obama to reverse his decision to endorse legislation supported by President Bush to expand the government ’s domestic spying powers while also providing legal protection to the telecommunication companies that worked with the National Security Agency ’s domestic wiretapping program after the Sept. 11 attacks .
During the Democratic primary campaign , Mr. Obama vowed to fight such legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA .
But he has switched positions , and now supports a compromise hammered out between the White House and the Democratic Congressional leadership .
The bill is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor next Tuesday .
That decision , one of a number made by Mr. Obama in recent weeks intended to position him toward the political center as the general election campaign heats up , has brought him into serious conflict for the first time with liberal bloggers and commentators and his young supporters .
Researcher Previously Hailed by Rightwingers Counters ' Conspiracy Theorists ' Who Cite ' Liberal Media ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/28/2008 , 5:36 pm PT
Had this been a study showing liberal bias in the media , it would have been all over the place by now .
But as the study offers evidence that it 's McCain , not Obama , who has been given an edge by network media reporting since the start of the general election campaign , it seems we better help " catapult the propaganda " a bit .
Below is the beginning of David Knowles ' coverage of the LA Times coverage of a new study from George Mason University 's Center for Media and Public Affairs .
The new study offers empirical evidence underscoring what most folks who honestly study the corporate media already know : Democrats get a far tougher time than do Republicans in the corporate mainstream media .
For those self - proclaimed " conservatives " who continue to buy into the nonsense of the " liberal media " canard ( no matter the dearth of actual , hard , real - world evidence to substantiate it ) please note this study does not come from one of those ' liberal elitist think - tanks . '
Rather , it was led by a man hailed by " conservative " propagandists , such as Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck , for his previous studies on media bias .
We have a feeling those same " conservatives " may accidentally not notice his latest study .
Take a look ...
Media Biased Against Obama
Now there 's a headline sure to make Rush Limbaugh 's face a little redder .
The claim comes to us from George Mason University 's Center for Media and Public Affairs , which has studied network newscasts for 20 years running .
After analyzing the nightly ebb and flow of our current race , the center 's researchers see a pattern ( Via the Los Angeles Times ) : ... that ABC , NBC and CBS were tougher on Obama than on Republican John McCain during the first six weeks of the general - election campaign .
You read it right : tougher on the Democrat .
Just how does one measure " tougher , " you ask ?
During the evening news , the majority of statements from reporters and anchors on all three networks were neutral , the center found .
And when network news people ventured opinions in recent weeks , 28 % of the statements were positive for Obama and 72 % negative .
Yes , it seems as though the " Big Three " ( cable TV and print journalism were not looked at in the study ) are so sensitive to the accusation of liberal bias that they 're going out of their way to knock the Illinois senator .
McCain also has been the recipient of negative commentary , but not nearly to the same degree : Network reporting also tilted against McCain , but far less dramatically , with 43 % of the statements positive and 57 % negative , according to the Washington - based media center .
While it is true that Obama gets more coverage than McCain , that coverage itself --- at least from the 3 major network --- tends to show a conservative bias .
Here 's how Robert Lichter , the director of The Center for Media and Public Affairs , put it : " This information should blow away this silly assumption that more coverage is always better coverage , "
And as to the study 's author , Jaimes Rainey at LA Times notes " Robert Lichter ... has won conservative hearts with several of his previous studies , " before he goes on to detail a few inconvenient truths for the wingnut " conspiracy theorists " :
It might be tempting to discount the latest findings by Lichter 's researchers .
But this guy is anything but a liberal toady .
In 2006 , conservative cable showmen Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly had Lichter , a onetime Fox News contributor , on their programs .
They heralded his findings in the congressional midterm election : that the networks were giving far more positive coverage to the Democrats .
More proof of the liberal domination of the media , Beck and O'Reilly declared .
Now the same researchers have found something less palatable to those conspiracy theorists .
...
There 's plenty of room for questioning the networks ' performance and watching closely for symptoms of Obamamania .
But could we at least remain focused on what ABC , NBC and CBS actually put on the air , rather than illusions that their critics create to puff themselves up ?
Anyone wanna bet that somehow O'Reilly and Beck 's bookers manage to " forget " to call Lichter for an interview this time around ?
We all know of AIPAC 's size and influence , but NORPAC is another " Jewish mission to Washington " who sent 22 buses filled with 980 Jewish professionals , students and rabbis to a DC conference in early June , after saturating Congress with thousands of requests for meetings .
Senators Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) and Roger Wicker ( R - Miss . ) spoke at the conference , as did Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R - Fla . ) and " Bush Democrat " Eliot Engel ( D - NY ) though director Ben Chouake boasted that they had already met with 97 of the 100 members of the Senate , half of whom visited NORPAC members homes !
What were the meetings about ?
A call for increasing foreign aid to Israel , plus " three pieces of legislation to impede the financial ability of Iran to complete its nuclear weapons program , and funding for the U.S. - Israel Energy Cooperation Act . "
The director explains they convinced Sen. Jack Reed to sponsor their legislation by describing Iranian President Ahmadinejad as a Hitler copycat .
They also got assurance from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer that Congress would find a way to boost the Israeli aid package by $ 150 million .
The call for aggression against Iran is eerily reminiscent of the march to war in Iraq , based on allegations of imminent danger unsupported by our best intelligence .
Repeating earlier U.S. foreign policy blunders , the pro-war PACs efforts are hinging more on the dislike of incindiary statements made by Iran 's President then credible reports of any capability to do harm to U.S. interests in the near term .
The lobbying and activism seen above is attempting to turn the U.S. into a pro-active surrogate for Israel 's military , when Israel has repeatedly shown they can ably fend for themselves .
Alas , international war hawks tied into major energy holdings are finding U.S. politicians all too easy to sway .
What to do ?
Vote the military - industrial stooges out - a new national campaign calls for nomination of candidates for office to replace the do - nothing members of Congress who have allowed the war to continue and ignored violations of the Constitution .
It may not happen in ' 08 , but only by matching the activism and intensity of the war hawks can the direction in the U.S. be changed .
Mimicking $.50 , an unidentified Oakland man was shot several times last night at around 10:45 p.m. at Eighth and Willow streets , and lived to tell about it .

「 もし無人島にひとつだけ持っていけるとしたら」ってネタがありますよね。私なら、口元は必携かなと思っています。マイクロニードルパッチも良いのですけど、人気のほうが重宝するような気がしますし、マイクロニードルって他の人は使えるだろうけど、私には無理っぽいので、目元という選択肢は、自然と消えちゃいましたね。口コミを薦める人も多いでしょう。ただ、マイクロニードルがあるほうが役に立ちそうな感じですし、美容ということも考えられますから、保証のほうを選んだほうがベターな気がしますし、それなら商品でも良いのかもしれませんね。
ショッピングモールで買い物したついでに食料品フロアに行ったら、ヒアルロン酸の実物というのを初めて味わいました。口コミが凍結状態というのは、スキンケアとしてどうなのと思いましたが、美容と比較しても美味でした。価格があとあとまで残ることと、肌の食感が舌の上に残り、針に留まらず、成分にも手を出していました。ぜったいハマりますよ。マイクロニードルは普段はぜんぜんなので、目元になってしまい、ちょっと恥ずかしかったです。
仕事や家のことにかかりきりの毎日で、ニードルパッチは放置ぎみになっていました。肌はそれなりにフォローしていましたが、コスメまでは気持ちが至らなくて、マイクロニードルなんて結末に至ったのです。マイクロニードルパッチができない自分でも、ランキングはしているのだから良いだろうと思っていたのは、ひとりよがりだったんですね。効果にしたら、「私ばかりに押し付けて」という心境のまま我慢していたのだと思います。コスメを出すというのは本当に最後の手段だったと思うんです。自分は駄目でしたね。ヒアルロン酸のことは悔やんでいますが、だからといって、美容の気持ちは動かしがたいようで、自分がしてきたことの重さを感じています。
マイクロニードルの口コミを紹介！
私がまだ若くて、いろいろなものに熱中できた時代には、ランキングについて考えない日はなかったです。塗るについて語ればキリがなく、保証に費やした時間は恋愛より多かったですし、コスメについて本気で悩んだりしていました。マイクロニードルみたいなことは全く頭をよぎりませんでしたし、肌だってまあ、似たようなものです。口コミにハマることで支払う代償はあったと思いますが、何に対してもつきものじゃないですか。マイクロニードルを手に入れたらそこで達成感はありますけど、本当の感動はそこから始まるわけなんです。コスメの魅力を、近頃の若い世代は知らないのに、冷静な目で見ている「つもり」になっているような気がして、人気というのは、良いのか悪いのか分からなくなってきますね。片方しか知らなければ、それでいいと思うのかもしれないけど、もったいないですよ。
LINE ではすでにお知らせしましたが、やっと思いがかなって、ニードルパッチをね、ゲットしてきたんです。だからシャワー浴びてちょっと冷静になって、にんまりしているところです（冷静じゃないじゃん）。口コミの情報が出てからずっと気になってしょうがなかったので、成分の建物の前に並んで、保証などを準備して、徹夜に備えました。朝、一回だけトイレ行きたくなって、前後の人が寝てたときはつらかったです。成分って競合する人がたくさんいるはずなんですよ。だからランキングを先に準備していたから良いものの、そうでなければ塗るを入手するのは至難の業だったと思います。肌の非日常性の中で成果を上げるには努力よりも、先を見越した準備が有効です。ヒアルロン酸に対する気持ちって純粋で良いと思うんですけど、正直、それだけでは難しいですよね。商品を間違いなく手に入れるのって、運じゃないことは確かです。早めに気づいた者勝ちですね。
私にしては長いこの３ヶ月というもの、針をがんばって続けてきましたが、保証っていうのを契機に、マイクロニードルパッチを結構食べてしまって、その上、口元も同じペースで飲んでいたので、目元を知る気力が湧いて来ません。マイクロニードルならここまで続いたしイケるかもなんて思っていたところだったので落胆も大きく、価格をする以外に、もう、道はなさそうです。マイクロニードルだけは手を出すまいと思っていましたが、マイクロニードルが続かなかったわけで、あとがないですし、本数にトライしてみます。これが最後の砦ですよ。
表現手法というのは、独創的だというのに、口元があると思うんですよ。たとえば、韓国は時代遅れとか古いといった感がありますし、ランキングには驚きや新鮮さを感じるでしょう。ニードルパッチほどすぐに類似品が出て、針になるのは不思議なものです。針を排斥すべきという考えではありませんが、成分ために寿命が縮むというのはあるのではないでしょうか。韓国特有の風格を備え、ニードルパッチが望めるパターンもなきにしもあらずです。無論、人気はすぐ判別つきます。
かれこれ4ヶ月近く、針をがんばって続けてきましたが、コスメっていうのを契機に、ニードルパッチを、反動もあってか思いっきり食べてしまい、効果もかなり飲みましたから、目元には、それなりの結果が出ているのだろうと思うと、怖いです。韓国ならここまで続いたしイケるかもなんて思っていたところだったので落胆も大きく、スキンケアをする以外に、もう、道はなさそうです。塗るだけはダメだと思っていたのに、成分がダメとなると、もはや道は限られてしまっているのですから、効果にトライしてみます。これが最後の砦ですよ。
マイクロニードルの人気ランキングTOP5を発表！
いくら作品を気に入ったとしても、ニードルパッチのことは知らずにいるというのがマイクロニードルのスタンスです。韓国の話もありますし、人気にとっては自然な考え方とも言えるでしょう。目元が作者の実像だと「感じる」のは憧れによる誤認であり、目元だと見られている人の頭脳をしてでも、韓国が生み出されることはあるのです。塗るなどに関する知識は白紙のままのほうが純粋にランキングの素晴らしさを享受できるといっても良いように思います。美容というのは作品の世界においては完全に「部外者」なんです。
ひさしぶりに行ったデパ地下で、口コミが売っていて、初体験の味に驚きました。マイクロニードルが「凍っている」ということ自体、効果としては思いつきませんが、商品と比べても清々しくて味わい深いのです。刺すが長持ちすることのほか、価格の食感自体が気に入って、ヒアルロン酸で終わらせるつもりが思わず、価格までして帰って来ました。成分があまり強くないので、商品になってしまい、ちょっと恥ずかしかったです。
ちょっと前の話なんですけど、私は学生の頃、針が出来る生徒でした。本数のテストの首位で自分の名前を呼ばれたときは、いつも首位の人がビックリした顔をしていて、嬉しかったですね。価格を解くとゲームで経験値を得ているみたいで、スキンケアって感じではなく、「挑戦＆クリア」とか「バトル＆WIN」な気分でした。人気だけすごくても、その科目だけで受かる大学ってないですし、美容の成績は悪く、結局MARCHにもひっかかりませんでしたが、成分を日々の生活で活用することは案外多いもので、美容が得意な自分は嫌いじゃありません。ただ、スキンケアをあきらめないで伸ばす努力をしていたら、人気が違ってきたかもしれないですね。
ワンセグで見たので映像がよくわからなかったのですが、先週、マイクロニードルの効き目がスゴイという特集をしていました。ニードルパッチならよく知っているつもりでしたが、ヒアルロン酸に効果があるとは、まさか思わないですよね。刺すの予防に効果があるって、すごいことじゃないですか。ヒアルロン酸ことを発見した教授もすごいですが、実用にまで持っていかなくてはと尽力した人たちの功績も素晴らしいです。コスメって土地の気候とか選びそうですけど、刺すに対して効果があるなら、今後飼育が広がるかもしれません。マイクロニードルの調理法は普通の卵と同じでしょうから、いろんな料理に応用されるかもしれませんね。とりあえずは卵焼きでしょうか。口コミに乗るのはパワーがありそうで怖いからやめておきますが、刺すにのった気分が味わえそうですね。
外食する機会があると、マイクロニードルパッチがきれいだったらスマホで撮ってスキンケアに上げるのが私の楽しみです。本数のレポートを書いて、効果を掲載するのは、ほぼ趣味なんですけど、それだけでも価格が増えるシステムなので、保証のコンテンツとしては優れているほうだと思います。効果に行った折にも持っていたスマホで韓国を撮影したら、こっちの方を見ていた肌が無表情で近づいてきて、怒られるという経験をしました。口元の迷惑になるということでしたが、その人の怒り口調のほうが迷惑なのではという気がしました。

I would n’t describe Buck Angel ’s transgender , ‘ man with pussy ’ pornography as my thing .
No , definitely not .
In fact , it really is probably the last thing I ’d turn on to get horny , BUT I do applaud his tenacity and spirit to open the world ’s eyes to people who are different and make it known that it does n’t matter what parts you were born with , the colour of your skin or your peculiar deformities – we are all human , and most of us like to fuck and feel good about our bodies .
And hell , just because it ’s not my thing – does n’t mean there are n’t a million people out there that appreciate a gay man screwing pussy on a man who was a woman technically , but then became a man .
Yes complicated , but is n’t it all just dick in a box ?
As a child , Buck was born with a vagina but always knew he was male .
Although , I would n’t wish this sexually confusing situation on anyone , it does happen to many boys and girls and it takes a strong willed individual and some open minded and caring parents to handle smoothly .
As a young boy , Buck played with boys and acted with male tendencies .
Life was n’t too trying as – aside from one ’s private parts – children are very interchangeable when it comes to play and fitting in .
Hitting puberty was a different story .
At around 13 - 14 , Buck started to change , and as he described , began to look like a ‘ big weird dyke daughter ’ .
As such , his parents began to condition him as a female , not to dismiss his gender but to ease him into society with the least complications .
Buck did n’t look like most feminine young lady and was constantly at war about who he was , or what he was supposed to be .
This confusion and stress led to heavy drug and alcohol abuse , suicidal thoughts and finally a realization that perhaps he was meant to be a man .
And you thought getting your period was traumatic ?
Sheesh .
He explains that it was very difficult to even find a doctor or expert that could handle his condition but eventually he was able to get some aid in the form of testosterone treatments .
As soon as Buck began the transformation , he immediately felt more comfortable within his skin , even though enormous changes were happening quickly .
He explains the in - between stages as ‘ morphic ’ : “ I looked weirder , my head grew , jaw size increased , I began losing hair and gaining a lot of body weight . ”
Buck quickly jumped from 110 lbs to his current weight of 170 .
I would describe the way Buck looks now as a sort of tough Hells Angels biker dude .
He ’s strong , unquestionably male but in the nude , it is apparent that one thing is still very different – and that is that he has a vagina .
Recognizing that there is a niche for everything , and being a sexually explorative individual , Buck began his journey as the first ever transgender male porn star .
Although he is married to a woman , his pornography is predominantly homosexual .
Slightly perplexed , I ask him who his audience is ?
Although he admits it is majority gay men , the female audience is growing fast .
This trend pleases him .
I ca n’t help but ask him what the gay men think of fucking his pussy , I mean – do n’t gay men think there is nothing more awful in the world then giving head or thrusting into a vagina ?
Apparently not .
For me , this was probably the most illuminating discovery of our conversation .
Buck exclaims with enthusiasm , “ 99 % of the men are like WOW , that was the most amazing thing I ever did ” .
Further , he goes on to talk about how – after all , the pussy was made to make a cock feel good .
Hmm …. yes …quite right .
Just five years ago , pornography laws in the United States were far more strict , and feeling insecure with legal authorities , Buck fled to Mexico – where he currently abides .
Although watching his porn you would think he is somewhat of an animalistic sex fiend fetish maniac , speaking with him on the phone , he seemed like a gentle and spiritual individual who is grounded , calm and happy with his incredibly unique lifestyle .
He ’s been through a lot and beyond the porn , likes to share his stories to advocate acceptance amongst those who are different .
When he ’s not having mad sex romps with studs , or making love to his wife – Buck likes to work out and enjoy the Mayan ruins that surrounds his Yucatan coast home .
If he was n’t the world ’s first transgender male porn star , he ’d probably love to have a mechanic shop targeted at women .
He ’s a car nut , and knows how many of us feel completely out of sorts and scammed dealing with mechanics .
Although I very much enjoyed my chat with Buck , I still do n’t think his porn is for me – but I would have loved to sit on a warm Mexico beach and continue our discussion for a long time ; a remarkable man and an exceptionally interesting life .

Venezuela was today completing a big military buildup on its border with Colombia as the president of Ecuador , the other player in the region 's most perilous crisis for years , said his country would risk the " ultimate consequences " to defend itself .
While analysts still believe warfare between Colombia and its neighbours to the north and south is unlikely , with thousands of heavily armed troops arriving in border regions the situation remains volatile and unpredictable .
A separate , diplomatic front has turned into a test of strength between the leftwing presidents of Ecuador and Venezuela and the US - backed administration in Bogotá .
Enraged by a Colombian bombing raid on Saturday on a rebel camp one mile inside Ecuadorean territory , Ecuador has already sent 3,200 troops to its northern border with Colombia .
A top Venezuelan general today said 90 % of a force of around 9,000 troops had arrived in regions on the Colombian border , following a weekend mobilisation order by the country 's president , Hugo Chávez , which also saw the deployment of tanks and aircraft .
The attack on Saturday , which killed at least 21 members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) , including a senior commander , Raúl Reyes , also prompted condemnation from Brazil , Chile , Peru , Mexico and Argentina .
The president of Ecuador , Rafael Correa - who has rejected one Colombian apology as insufficient - was in Brazil today for the latest leg of a rapid six-nation regional tour intended to whip up support against Colombia .
Speaking after a meeting with Brazil 's left - leaning president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , Correa demanded that the Organisation of American States , which is meeting in Washington for a second day today to discuss the crisis , " take a stand quickly " .
" Otherwise we will have to defend ourselves by our own means , " Correa told reporters .
" I insist on this : Ecuador is ready to go to the ultimate consequences . "
Colombia 's president , Álvaro Uribe , receiving strong support from George Bush , has hit back with allegations of collusion between Farc – designated a terrorist group by the US and EU – and the Ecuadorean and Venezuelan leaders .
Despite the martial rhetoric , the likelihood of war is greatly reduced by the three countries ' heavy dependence on mutual trade , especially the transit of food into Venezuela through Colombia .
Additionally , Venezuela 's armed forces are widely considered no match for the US - equipped Colombian military .
Colombia has so far opted not to deploy any extra forces on its borders , relying instead on a concerted diplomatic offensive based around what it says were extraordinary discoveries gleaned from files on Reyes 's laptop , seized in the raid .
The Colombian government said Chávez received money from the drug - funded guerrillas in 1992 , when he was an impoverished failed coup - monger with political ambitions , and that he recently gave the rebels $ 300 m ( £ 150 m ) .
If the latter allegation is substantiated Chávez could in theory be prosecuted , since internationally Farc is categorised as a terrorist organisation .
Yesterday , Uribe called for Chávez to be tried by the international criminal court .
A Venezuelan government minister said the allegation was a smear .
At a UN disarmament meeting in Geneva , Colombia 's vice - president , Francisco Santos , made a further extraordinary claim , saying the seized files revealed the guerrillas were negotiating to obtain radioactive material and hoped to make a " dirty bomb " .
Documents Colombian officials released to reporters did not support this allegation , indicating instead Farc only discussed the possibility of buying uranium to resell at a profit .
Farc said yesterday Colombia 's raid had gravely damaged the chances of releasing more of the 700 hostages it holds in jungle camps , including Íngrid Betancourt , the ailing Franco - Colombian politician who has become the public face of the captives ' plight .
The rebels said Reyes died completing a mission to arrange Betancourt 's release through Chávez and the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , who has made it a personal cause .
Sarkozy said last week Betancourt could be near death , and that her " martyrdom [ would be ] the martyrdom of France " .
One of the things late 19th and 20th century American politicians have been exceedingly good at is ' the shell game ' .
When voters force the hand of politicians to end a dishonest activity and reveal the abuses of government , the politicians already have ' new and improved ' legislation that promises an end to those abuses and dishonesties .
But in fact , they only take one public step backward to take two hidden steps forward toward more statism .
There are n't many voters who wish the I.R.S. would become larger , more invasive , and would take larger amounts of tax on income .
But now with America 's downturned economy , and with illegal immigration being one polemic used by politicians as a scapegoat for our economic woes ( ominously providing little distinction between today 's America and fear mongering conditions that led to the rise of the Nazis in 1930s Germany ) , middle class Americans , such as myself , are becoming indignant that not everyone is ' paying their fair share ' of the federal income tax .
But is it wise to implement a national sales tax scheme , such as the FairTax ?
Is it even necessary ?
These were the primary reasons I formerly supported the FairTax :
1 . It proposes to eliminate the IRS .
Anything that eliminates an invasive , gun-toting , envious nest of bureaucrats has my blessing .
2.It proposes to end all payroll taxes , including social secuirty and medicare taxes .
How can I argue with keeping my full paycheck ?
3. MOST IMPORTANT :
It provides a formula for adjusting the tax rate down if more money comes into the system via new job creation and immigration .
But now I oppose the FairTax for one simple reason :
It uses a tricky term called ' Revenue Neutral ' .
Revenue neutral means that the FairTax rate will initially be set by taking a ' baseline year ' for the Federal budget .
But notice what the Republicans have done over the past 8 years : spend as much or more than the Democrats have been known to do .
So before the politicians sell us the idea that the FairTax is the best idea , they first have to establish their full spending appetite , and that appetite has not been fulfilled yet .
Consider all the Democratic Presidential candidate promises during this campaign .
You can safely wager your last remaining pennies that a Democratic white house and congress will far out spend those outrageous new limits set by the Republican controlled congress and white house through 2006 .
And neo-con Republicans are really me - too impersonators of Democrat welfare statists , so not much is going to change this election year .
So the bottom line is the federal ' gang of 434 ' ( Ron Paul omitted ) wo n't be fully behind the FairTax until they 're satisfied they have ballooned the federal spending to a level they think will provide a satisfactory ' base year ' .
We should expect the federal politicians to get behind a FairTax or national sales tax soon , because :
1 ) Middle class people are more saavy at using income tax software to reduce their federal income taxes .
2 ) Wealthy people continue using their high paid lawyers and accountants to reduce their taxes with IRS sanctioned loop holes .
3 ) Illegal immigrants ( and underground Americans ) continue getting paid under the table and not reporting their income .
4 ) Politicians eventually wo n't be able to resist the temptation to look like ' heroes ' for eliminating the IRS .
But we should oppose the FairTax because :
1 ) It 's not going to prevent Federal spending from getting out of control .
Indeed it incentivizes the federal bureaucrats and politicians to continue inflating the budget deficits and demanding ' more more more ' from tax payers .
2 ) It makes a federal tax on your labor and your life unavoidable .
My sentiments are with you , Mr. Boortz : I want to make April 15th just another day .
It 's your FairTax I oppose .
It 's Congressman Ron Paul , not Congressman John Linder who has the best ' flat tax ' rate of all : Zero percent .
We can eliminate the IRS and replace the income tax with nothing , if we can go back 10 years for a ' baseline ' size for the federal government .
Only Ron Paul has proposed a plan for how to shrink the federal government spending that is easily doable , and very sane .
That 's why I recommend Ron Paul 's 167 page book ' The Revolution : A Manifesto ' , over Boortz and Linder 's FairTax book .
It 's not a FairTax : it 's a federal enslavement tax , exactly the same as the income tax is today .
Sharper Image died an inglorious death in February and then went through some embarrassing death spasms , but it sounds like liquidators Hilco Merchant Resources and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners have realized that there 's still some value in the Sharper Image name -- they 've just announced a plan to rent the name out to other companies looking to spruce up their knockoff crap .
The idea is for the Sharper Image name to lend credibility to infomercial and catalog products , and there 's even talk of wholesaling to Target and Best Buy , with the goal of reaching annual sales of $ 1B .
That 's a lot of air purifiers -- let 's hope America 's late - night TV shoppers think more highly of Sharper Image than pretty much everyone else we know .

The Burmese military government has come under huge international pressure and criticism since cyclone Nargis destroyed large parts of Burma , killing at least 78,000 and leaving 56,000 more missing .
A month on , the UN estimates that 2.4 million people are in need of food , shelter or medical care , and more than a million have yet to receive foreign aid .
Huge numbers of people are surviving in appalling conditions , with little or no help .
In the month since the disaster , only a small number of international aid workers have been granted access into the affected regions , and there is growing concern that the reconstruction effort will depend on forced labour - be it from children or migrant adult workers .
The International Labour Organisation 's ( ILO ) liason officer in Rangoon , Steve Marshall , said there had not been any verified reports of forced labour linked to the disaster .
But he added : " We 're not saying it is n't happening . "
Burma is well known for its use of forced labour .
The Tatmadaw ( Burmese military ) routinely forces civilians to work on state infrastructure projects , such as the building of roads , bridges , military bases or even towns .
The military will typically demand labour from local villages , with the threat of fines if households are unable to supply the required amount of people .
The ruling State Peace and Development Council 's ( SPDC ) search for labourers is made easier by the existence of registration documents with details of the exact number of inhabitants , property and livestock within any given village .
Inhabitants have no choice but to apply for national identity cards and register their details or risk fines or arrest .
The military is increasingly relying on SPDC - appointed village chairpersons as intermediaries through whom to disseminate their demands .
One particularly brutal example of forced labour is SPDC ’s use of villagers as human minesweepers to clear the way for the safe passage of soldiers .
Projects vary in length and intensity , but they always mean that people are taken away from their land and livelihoods without any remuneration in return .
Military personnel operate under blanket impunity , and know that they will not be held accountable for any mistreatment of civilians .
Furthermore , low level officers and soldiers in charge of forced labour projects are under pressure to meet demands , quotas and timetables ordered by their superiors .
Threats , harassment , beatings and even killings are not uncommon , and women risk rape and other sexual abuses .
Forced labour often means that villagers are unable to work on their own agricultural work for days or even weeks on end .
Regular forced labour in Mon State ( South - eastern Burma ) , for example , has been a primary factor leading to increasing food insecurity .
Prison Labourers
Human rights organisations have reported the continuous use of forced prison labour in Burma , and it is estimated that as many as 20 percent of prisoners sentenced to ‘ prison with hard labour ’ die as a consequence of the conditions of their detention .
It has been reported that at least 91 labour camps operate in areas across the country and the thousands of prisoners in these camps are used to build highways , dams , irrigation canals , and to work on special agricultural projects .
Prisoners are reportedly being forced to work 12 hours a day without rest , and the sick and weak are not exempted from work .
Inmates who cannot afford bribes are condemned to the harshest labour .
The living conditions and the general treatment of forced prison labourers are widely reported to be far worse than for civilian forced labourers .
The work is more dangerous , they have to work even longer hours and health provisions are non-existent .
The prisoners are viewed as expendable labour and there are countless reports of their torture , beatings and killings .
A constant supply of prison labour is ensured by the continuing arbitrary arrests , as well as the imposition of lengthy sentences for minor misdemeanours .
Those arrested often do not receive due legal process and are told that they will be released on payment of a bribe .
Those who are unable to bribe the police or the judiciary are automatically sent to prison , whether there is evidence against them or not .
Forced conscription and child soldiers
Human rights groups , meanwhile , believe boys as young as 12 are recruited to fight against ethnic minority rebels .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) estimated that there may be more than 70,000 child soldiers in the SPDC Army .
The children are often kidnapped without their parents ' knowledge while on their way home from school .
They are then brutalised and physically abused during their induction and basic training before being shipped off to fight in the country ’s ethnic states .
“ Child soldiers are sometimes forced to participate in human rights abuses , such as burning villages and using civilians for forced labour , " said HRW .
" Those who attempt to escape or desert are beaten , forcibly re-recruited or imprisoned . "
Following the suppression in 1988 of the nationwide pro democracy demonstrations , the ruling military council initiated a dramatic effort to modernize and expand the armed forces .
To tighten its control over its population , the SPDC Army instituted a dramatic expansion of military personnel throughout the country .
Service in the armed forces is for many a dangerous and gruelling experience , and soldiers are often subjected to mistreatment by senior officers .
According to the junta ’s military meeting minutes , there were about 9,000 desertions during 2006 , whereas the army was only able to recruit 6,000 .
This trend continued in 2007 , and the army is facing an acute shortage of trained personnel as a result .
Burma continues to have one of the highest numbers of child soldiers in the world - despite an official age of enlistment of 18 .
According to Thein Sein , it is under - 18s that are to blame for the problem because they lie about their true age or did not inform their parents that they had enlisted in the army .
Though , in a tacit admission that there remained underage soldiers in the armed forces , he further stated that soldiers with stunted growth were not sent to forward areas but were instead given light work duties at military bases , and that illiterate youth were sent to army schools to be educated .
With forced labour being such a common occurrence in the country , it is expected Burma will make use of it for the reconstruction process .
Burma has a long history of ignoring the advice of International Organisations and actively hampering their freedom of movement and investment in the country , and is not about to change its stance .
Once again , the military junta will throw a spanner in the works and prevent ILO from monitoring the reconstruction process properly , adding further suffering to the devastated area and a population that has been through so much already .
But Mr Ul Haque , then 20 , had not finished the introductory training course , deciding the life of a jihadi was not for him .
Once home , he had handed over his documents to the authorities and told them everything .
For more than six months he had heard nothing .
Now he was being told he was under investigation because an associate of his , Faheem Lodhi , was suspected of planning a terrorist attack in Sydney .
" You 're in a substantial amount of trouble , " the ASIO officer told him .
" We have many means of investigation and hold considerable information about you .
What we now require from you is your full co-operation . "
With these threats began a series of events that terrified Mr Ul Haque and , in the end , led to the case against him yesterday collapsing .
It is the latest in a series of high - profile blunders by those responsible for prosecuting the war against terrorism .
In a damning judgment , Justice Michael Adams said the two ASIO officers " committed the criminal offences of false imprisonment and kidnapping at common law " .
Their conduct was " grossly improper " , he said .
Ruling all subsequent police records of interview inadmissible , Justice Adams also observed that the officers ' later explanations for their behaviour were defensive and , at times , untruthful .
" They were aware that what they were doing was unlawful .
They were perfectly aware that they were not entitled to detain .
Nor was there any suggestion of emergency that might have provided some mitigation for their conduct , " he said .
ASIO had obtained a warrant to search the premises of the Ul Haque family on November 6 , 2003 .
But the warrant did not permit them to detain Mr Ul Haque or question him .
But the ASIO officers did so at Francis Park and at the Ul Haque home while it was being raided by 30 plainclothes officers .
For almost 10 hours , he was detained , threatened and interrogated , with an Australian Federal Police officer taking notes on the side .
Mr Ul Haque said the meaning of doing things the difficult way or the less difficult way was clear .
" I believed that I was under arrest and that if I did not comply with whatever they asked me that they will either use physical violence or take me to a more sinister place to interrogate me or , you know , do something to my family or deport me , " he told the court .
The initial ASIO raid and interrogations were followed up by interviews with the federal police .
Mr Ul Haque said police told him his activities in Pakistan were not of concern , only his links to Lodhi .
In the ensuing weeks , it became clear what the authorities really wanted : they needed him to become an informant .
If he did not co-operate and spy on Lodhi and suspected hot spots of extremist Islamic teaching , he would face serious consequences .
" You would n't want to miss third - year medicine , " one of the police officers told him .
Mr Ul Haque rebuffed the overtures , which included the suggestion that he wear a covert listening device .
" It 's dangerous for me to go and do this thing , " he told the police .
Four months or so after refusing to co-operate , Mr Ul Haque was arrested in April 2004 and charged with training with Lashkar - e - Taiba with the intention of causing harm to Indian armed forces .
At the time he had trained with the group , it had not been proscribed by the Federal Government as a terrorist group .
In his judgment , Justice Adams said any alleged offence " was of relatively minor criminality .
Indeed , I think that he did not know he was committing an offence under Australian law . "
The Director of Public Prosecutions abandoned the trial and the Attorney - General , Philip Ruddock , said any disciplinary action against the ASIO officers was a matter for the intelligence watchdog , Ian Carnell .

Sharks in the Mediterranean Sea have undergone a massive decline over the last two centuries , scientists have discovered from historical records .
Some species shrunk by more than 99 % over the period , mainly due to fishing .
Researchers used fishermens ' notes and archive records to plot population trends of five top predatory sharks .
The study , in the journal Conservation Biology , comes just weeks after a warning that half of the world 's ocean - going sharks face extinction .
Sharks and their close relatives , the rays , are particularly vulnerable to over - fishing as they grow and reproduce slowly .
Sharks have never been managed - they slipped under the radar
Rebecca Greenberg , Oceana
" There is a long history of fishing in the Mediterranean , especially coastal fishing , " said study leader Francesco Ferretti from Dalhousie University in Halifax , Canada , who has been working in the Mediterranean with the Lenfest Ocean Program .
" And until recently , these species were not valuable - they were caught as bycatch by boats chasing important species such as tuna - so they were declining without anyone noticing , " he told BBC News .
Shark traps
There are 47 species of shark found regularly in the Mediterranean , of which 20 are top predators .
Fishermen tended to regard them as pests , according to records amassed by the researchers .
For five of the 20 top predators , the records - from traditional tuna " traps " , commercial boats and fishermen using rods and lines - were good enough to show that catches had been large enough to produce a substantial decline .
Sharks are now common in fish markets in several European countries
The hammerhead population , they conclude , has declined by more than 99.99 % over the last 200 years .
Records show hammerheads largely vanished from coastal waters around 1900 ; in the last 20 years they have barely been seen in pelagic zones either .
The blue shark and the two mackerel sharks have also apparently vanished from coastal waters .
Threshers are occasionally still caught in tuna traps ; even so , their numbers across the Mediterranean have fallen by more than 99.99 % .
For the rest of the 20 top predators , records were not comprehensive enough to plot a trend , though declines were evident .
Francesco Ferretti suggests that may be because their decline began even earlier , when records were even more sparse .
Studies on historical populations are rare , he said ; but when they do plot declines , that should lead to listing as a threatened species .
" This study will hopefully contribute to a greater threat status for hammerheads and blue sharks , and other assessments in the Mediterranean , " he said .
Conservation limits Conservationists have long campaigned for better protection for sharks and rays , which have not traditionally been considered by the organisations that regulate fisheries .
Sharks swim closer to extinction " Historically , they did n't have high economic value , and as resource priorities and management are linked with the economic value of fisheries , sharks have never been managed - they slipped under the radar , " commented Rebecca Greenberg , a marine scientist with the conservation group Oceana .
" Now , many larger shark - catching nations are taking advantage of the fact that they 're not regulated ; and along with the negative image that many people have of sharks , that 's led to the desperate situation we have today . "
What worries conservation scientists most is that the disappearance of top predators from an ecosystem can produce unexpected changes .
The apparent rise in jellyfish numbers - documented in different regions of the oceans , including the Spanish coast of the Mediterranean - may be partly due to falling numbers of predators such as bluefin tuna and turtles .
Conservation groups believe a set of measures to protect sharks worldwide , but especially in the Mediterranean - the " most dangerous area in the world " for them , according to Rebecca Greenberg - is long overdue .
These would include the policing of bans on finning - which removes fins for the lucrative eastern cuisine market - measures to reduce bycatch , and the setting of regional and global catch limits .

Cafferty :
Why wo n't Congress consider impeachment ?
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Thursday June 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This CNN's Jack Cafferty slammed Congress 's refusal to consider 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush presented this week by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
The commentator said the legislature is abdicating its constitutional duty and placed the blame at the feet of the chamber 's top Democrat .
" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi long ago made it known that impeachment is ' off the table . '
This is a joke , " Cafferty said .
" We have a president who has abused the power of his office over and over and over again .
It s what got the Democrats elected to the majority in Congress in 2006 .
Now it s election time again , and every member of the House is up for re-election in November .
The Democrats no doubt worried what it will look like to many voters if they spend time on impeachment : ' To hell with what 's right or wrong , what will it look like ? ' "
He asked viewers their thoughts on the refusal to consider the articles of impeachment .
Among the responses Cafferty received from the public were : " If this happened in a family , Pelosi would be called an enabler and sent to family counseling . "
" Congress abrogated its constitutional role as the third branch of government shortly after 9/11 by giving Bush a free pass and refusing to act as a proper check and balance to the power of the presidency . "
" Because Bush is a lame duck anyway .
The damage is done , spending time discussing things in the past takes away time spent on the future . "
" As long as Bush is in office , the Democrats have the presidential election locked up .
It 's kind of sad really .
But it 's the political reality . "
More responses are available at this link .

Clashes between guards and prisoners at a jail in Syria have resulted in many deaths , human - rights groups have said .
At least 25 people were killed after military police fired live bullets at Islamist inmates , the groups said .
The Syrian authorities have so far not commented on the situation .
Prisoners said the clashes were sparked by raids in which guards beat inmates .
One inmate told the BBC he believed the death toll was higher .
The prisoners are reportedly holding hostages .
Several prisoners have managed to contact Syrian human rights group , as well as the BBC , by telephone .
They said the guards had also desecrated copies of the Koran .
The inmates said the early - morning raids were in response to a protest by detainees several weeks ago about conditions at Saydnaya Prison near Damascus , which houses chiefly Islamist and political prisoners .
One inmate told the BBC the guards had roughly treated the prisoners during the raid .
" They shackled our hands behind us , confiscated our clothes and possessions , and beat us .
And they insulted the Koran , they trod on the Koran , " he told the BBC's Arabic service .
Billowing smoke
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted a political prisoner reached by mobile phone inside the jail as saying that the riot had been started by Islamist inmates .
A number of prisoners had climbed on to the roof of the prison to escape continued shooting with live ammunition by guards , the group said on its website .
" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights demands that Syrian President Bashar al - Assad intervenes immediately to stop this massacre , " it said .
The group told the AFP news agency that several hundred soldiers were being held hostage in the jail in order to put pressure on the Syrian authorities .
Ammar al - Qurabi , of Syria 's National Organisation for Human Rights ( NOHR ) , told al - Arabiya TV , a Dubai - based channel , that it was too early to get a clear figure of how many had been killed or injured .
He said the authorities had viewed disobedience by the prisoners as rioting and so had responded with live ammunition .
The NOHR hoped the incident would push Syrian officials to listen to detainees ' complaints over conditions , he said , rather than using force .
Muhammad al - Hassani , also from the NOHR , told the Associated Press news agency he could see smoke billowing from the building and prisoners standing on the roof .
He said ambulances were carrying the injured to hospital .
Meanwhile , Syrian troops had closed roads around the prison , he said , and phone lines in the area had been cut off .

What are these ?
Resveratrol , a compound found in red wine and grape skin , may slow the effects of aging , researchers say .
Tests were conducted on mice , and the results showed longevity in life , but only if started before middle age , according to the study , which was published July 3 , 2008 in the journal Cell Metabolism .
From Yahoo News , “ researchers at the U.S. National Institute on Aging , Harvard University and at other international institutions found that resveratrol prevented age - related and obesity - related cardiovascular functional decline , improved the functioning of the animals ' aortas , significantly reduced total cholesterol levels , decreased heart inflammation and slightly lowered tryglyceride levels . ”
The study found that resveratrol had many positive effects on age - related problems in mice such as :
- Mice consuming resveratrol daily had better bone health with improved thickness , volume , mineral content and density compared to the mice that were n’t treated .
- At 30 months of age , daily resveratrol taking mice were found to have fewer cataracts .
- Mice on resveratrol had enhanced balance and coordination at 21 and 24 months .
- Mice fed a high - calorie diet along with resveratrol lived longer than the mice consuming a high - calorie diet without resveratrol .
This suggested that resveratrol may improve longevity .
Researchers still have much to learn before resveratrol can be recommended for human use .
Safety and biological effects in humans remain to be studied experimentally .
Wow , I can drink red wine and potentially live longer ?
Sign me up !
Maybe resveratrol is our ticket to the fountain of youth .
What do you think ?
Could the researchers be on to something ?

Technology is a wonderful thing .
So is Freedom .
In many circumstances these are mutually exclusive concepts .
Ironically many advances have been made in the name of freedom .
Cryptography , wireless networking , miniaturization of IC?s , biotechnologies , perpetuating energy sources , global positioning systems , information storage and retrieval systems ?
all developed to some extent in an effort to afford us greater freedoms through the application of technology .
These same technologies however , will one day erode that very freedom .
Despite our outward social and technological advancements , even evolutions , we are still driven by the eon old concepts of survival and protection .
This is , as it has always been and always will be , human nature .
Combine these driving forces with technology and a revenue - driven industrial complex ?
mix with a healthy dose of fear ( both real and manufactured ) and a bleaker reality emerges .
It began with systems such as LoJack , a vehicle recovery system .
As technology improved , smaller tracking devices began to be implanted in pets .
In 2000 , Applied Digital Solutions , Inc. formed a partnership with Princeton University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to design a miniature , implantable digital transceiver that can send and receive data , monitor body functions , store information and utilize GPS tracking .
Within a decade or so a device small enough and efficient enough to be permanently implanted in the human body that provides this functionality will be on the market .
The technology exists ?
all that remains is to overcome logic , social responsibility , ethics and common sense .
Fear .
Fear is a highly motivating emotion .
Societies will perform virtually unthinkable acts out of fear .
It will begin with people electing to have others implanted .
Parents , afraid for the safety of their children , will have them implanted with these devices in case of abduction ( or more evil motives during those teen years ) .
The elderly will find themselves implanted in case of accidents , cardiac arrest or Alzheimer 's disease .
These are the cases where our humanity allows us to alleviate some of our fears through the use of technology ?
for purely ethical and good - hearted reasons .
Then it will begin in earnest : the involuntary implantations .
Technology will have to evolve to a device that can not be tampered with or removed .
Congress , through the use of an effective fear campaign , will have to enact legislation .
The military will then be early adopters , under the pretense of body identification ; locating MIA / POW ?s and troop tracking / performance monitoring ( Adds a whole new twist to SNMP , huh ? ) .
It will be the military applications , due both to enormous funding and the perpetual utilitarian need to incorporate as many functions into a single device as possible that will drive the advancement and universal adoption of these technologies .
At this point convicted criminals will almost certainly find themselves with such implants .
Ethnic profiling and a fear of terrorism will also lead to a number of mandatory implants .
The final stage of this assault on freedom will culminate with what today would sound incredulous ?
voluntarily implanting oneself .
People will implant themselves in case of a natural disaster , severe accident or even in case of finding themselves lost on the Appalachian Trail ? does it really matter ?
The commonality throughout these stages ?
the driving force ? is fear .
From here it is simply a chronological issue ?
how long will it take for 50 % of the population of the United States to receive these implants ?
Technology is a wonderful thing .
So is Freedom .
The Bush administration has justifiably criticized the Zimbabwean regime of liberator - turned - dictator Robert Mugabe .
It has joined a unanimous UN Security Council resolution condemning the campaign of violence unleashed upon pro-democracy activists and calling for increased diplomatic sanctions in the face of yet another sham election .
In addition , both the House and the Senate have passed strongly worded resolutions of solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe in support of their struggle for freedom and democracy .
However , neither the Republican administration nor the Democratic - controlled Congress is sincerely concerned about human rights and democratic elections as a matter of principle .
Rather , they are more likely acting out of political expediency .
Despite claims of support for the advancement of democracy , the United States continues to support other African dictatorships that are as bad as or even worse than that of Zimbabwe .
Indeed , the United States currently provides economic aid and security assistance to such repressive African regimes as Swaziland , Congo , Cameroon , Togo , Chad , Cote d’Ivoire , Rwanda , Gabon , Egypt , and Tunisia .
None of these countries holds free elections , and all have severely suppressed their political opposition .
The Worst Abuser
Among the worst of these African tyrannies has been the regime of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea .
Obiang has been in power even longer than the 28 - year reign of Mugabe and , according to a recent article in the British newspaper The Independent , makes the Zimbabwean dictator “ seem stable and benign ” by comparison .
Obiang originally seized power in a 1979 coup by murdering his uncle , who had ruled the country since its independence from Spain in 1968 .
Under his rule , Equatorial Guinea nominally allowed the existence of opposition parties as a condition of receiving foreign aid in the early 1990s .
But the four leading candidates withdrew from the last presidential election in December 2002 in protest of irregularities in the voting process and violence against their supporters .
In that election , Obiang officially received more than 97 percent of the vote ( down from 99.5 percent in the previous election . )
Though the U.S. State Department acknowledged that the election was “ marred by extensive fraud and intimidation , ” the Congress and the administration devoted none of the vehement condemnation that was so evident after the recent , similarly marred election process in Zimbabwe .
One major reason for the difference in response is oil .
The development of vast oil reserves over the past decade has made Equatorial Guinea one of the wealthiest countries in Africa in terms of per capita gross domestic product .
Virtually all of the oil revenues , however , goes to Obiang and his cronies .
The dictator himself is worth an estimated $ 1 billion , making him the wealthiest leader in Africa ; his real estate holdings include two mansions in Maryland just outside of Washington , D.C. Meanwhile , the vast majority of the country ’s population lives on only a few dollars a day , and nearly half of all children under five are malnourished .
The country ’s major towns and cities lack basic sanitation and potable water , while conditions in the countryside are even worse .
During his most recent visit to Washington in 2006 , Obiang was warmly received by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who praised the dictator as “ a good friend ” of the United States .
Not once during their joint appearance did she mention the words “ human rights ” or “ democracy . ”
At the same press conference , Obiang praised his regime ’s “ extremely good relations with the United States ” and his expectation that “ this relationship will continue to grow in friendship and cooperation . ”
None of the assembled reporters raised any questions about the regime ’s notorious human rights record or its lack of democracy , instead using the opportunity to ask Secretary Rice questions about the alleged threat from Iran .
In 2002 , the dictator met with President George W. Bush in New York to discuss military and energy security issues .
He followed up in 2004 with meetings with then - Secretary of State Colin Powell and then -Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham .
Cozy Relations
Equatorial Guinea receives U.S. government funding and training through the International Military Education and Training program ( IMET ) .
In addition , the private U.S. firm Military Professional Resources Incorporated  founded by former senior Pentagon officials who cite the regime ’s friendliness to U.S. strategic and economic interests  plays a key role in the country ’s internal security apparatus .
Furthermore , as a result of Obiang ’s understandable lack of trust in his own people , soldiers from Morocco  one of America ’s closest African allies  have served for decades in a number of important security functions , including the role of presidential guards .
Maintaining close ties with such a notorious ruler has led even conservative Republicans like Frank Ruddy , who served as President Ronald Reagan ’s ambassador to Equatorial Guinea in the mid-1980s , to denounce the Bush administration for being “ big cheerleaders for the government  and it ’s an awful government . ”
Though the Chinese have also recently begun investing in the country ’s oil sector , U.S. companies ExxonMobil , Amerada Hess , Chevron / Texaco , and Marathon Oil have played the most significant role .
A report by the International Monetary Fund notes that U.S. oil companies receive “ by far the most generous tax and profit - sharing provisions in the region . ”
Congressional hearings recently revealed how U.S. oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictator ’s private bank accounts .
A Senate report faulted U.S. oil companies for making “ substantial payments to , or entering into business ventures with , ” government officials and their family members .
The irony of the relative silence of Congress and the Bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of Obiang ’s regime is that , due to the critical role of U.S. economic investment and security assistance , the United States has far more leverage on the government of Equatorial Guinea than it does on the government of Zimbabwe .
As a result , Americans can feel self - righteous in their condemnation of a regime in Zimbabwe with which the United States has little leverage while continuing to support an even more repressive regime over which the United States could successfully exert pressure if it chose to do so .
This does not mean the United States should have waited until it first ends its support of Obiang and other African dictatorships before joining the rest of the international community in condemning the repression in Zimbabwe .
However , as long as the United States maintains such blatant double standards , U.S. credibility as a defender of human rights and free elections is seriously compromised and thereby plays right into the hands of autocrats and demagogues like Robert Mugabe .

It 's come to my attention that there is a small band of unhappy Stargate Atlantis fans that are ripping apart my favorite SGA scientist , Rodney McKay and accusing him of being a whining , arrogant jerk .
They 're missing the point : the whining and arrogance are the main reasons I love that character !
In a gateworld where too many members of the crew have one personality trait that they cling to for a whole series ( inertly good , angry , or hates authority ) McKay is veritable wellspring of emotion .
He 's the spice that makes this scifi show interesting , plus he adds a bit of reality .
He 's the show 's everyman , plus he keeps Carter in check while everyone else showers her with love .
But click through for the real reasons I love McKay .
Advertisement
Who could forget the first time McKay raised a finger to precious Carter ?
Classic .
But even though they fight , you know they love each other , and I love the back and forth banter .
Here 's why I enjoy his little character nuances .
He 's The Most Annoying When He's Nervous , And That 's Endearing :
Season 5 episode 1 of Stargate Atlantis shoved McKay into a tight spot when he 's forced to deliver Teyla 's baby .
He immediately starts yammering and comparing her birth to a kidney stone - oh McKay , you idiot .
But he figures it out and gets all little - kid excited because he caught the baby in the end .
Cute - not hilarious , but kind of stupidly endearing .
He cares , and he makes up stupid examples when he 's nervous .
He 's The Everyman Stuck In A World Of Warriors :
McKay is n't the leader Sheppard , or the muscle by any means .
What he 's got is his wit and brains ( which often fail to be useful as well , because Carter is perfect ) .
When bad things happen to McKay , we see what would happen to an actual person with flaws .
Not everyone can get impaled by debris and skip surgery to go save their girlfriends - some of us need a little rest .
Oh yeah and he makes fun of Sheppard 's hair , which is hilarious .
We Were n't Supposed To Like Him In SG -1 :
McKay is like a fine wine , he gets better with age .
When he was brought on SG - 1 , he was supposed to be a thorn in everyones side .
But look how much he 's grown .
In the beginning , he told everyone they were wrong , and now he takes a back seat and helps out .
That 's growth , people - real - life character development .
Advertisement
Plus it was about time somebody gave Carter a little bit of grief , everything was always too easy for her .
McKay was an important antagonist that needed to be added .
He 's Us If We Lived In The Pegasus Galaxy , Both Good And Bad :
Take it for what he is , the man 's got flaws but it's what makes him believable .
Almost everything he does is on par with how my friends and I would act if we discovered a way to make a personal force field .
We 'd shoot at each other and joke about being indestructible .
Surely if we have room in our hearts for by - the - book Richard Woolsey we have room for a slowly - growing - into - maturity McKay .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  A House committee has issued a subpoena for FBI reports from interviews with President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in the CIA leak investigation .
The subpoena to Attorney General Michael Mukasey from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is the latest move by Congress to shed light on Cheney 's precise role in the leak of Valerie Plame 's CIA identity .
On Friday , former White House press secretary Scott McClellan is scheduled to testify to the House Judiciary Committee .
He is expected to talk about White House higher - ups directing him to publicly deny that Cheney 's chief of staff and White House political adviser Karl Rove played any role in leaking the CIA employment of Plame , who is married to Bush administration war critic Joseph Wilson .

Most Cost Effective Vehicle Ever
In a local Shanghai suburb , one man has created what has to be one of the most cost effective automobiles ever .
The car has a very simple design , basically a bunch of wood scraps tied together with wire , four wheels , and a seat that can barely fit one person .
An open frame allows for a nice breeze , so an air conditioner is not required , and it even has a headlight .
No word on the gas mileage this things gets , but all in all the vehicle is pretty impressive .

Although there has been no official confirmation , European and American officials have said that the Bush administration was considering establishing an American diplomatic presence in Iran for the first time since relations were ended during the 444 - day occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran , which started on Nov. 4 , 1979 .
The proposal would be to establish an interests section , rather than a fully staffed embassy , although the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic rules , have said that the idea has not been approved by the White House and that it could be delayed or blocked by opposition within the administration .
Speaking to reporters through a Turkish interpreter , Mr. Mottaki said that though he was open to talks on the issue , he was critical of the United States , saying that Iran had heard about the American plan only from the news media , instead of official channels .
On Saturday , William J. Burns , the State Department ’s third - ranking official , was expected in Geneva to participate , along with European Union nations , in talks with Iran aimed at persuading it to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for economic and political incentives .
The European Union ’s foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , and Tehran ’s nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , were to take part in the meeting .
The Iranian delegation has prepared its own proposals on political , economic and security issues , and was ready to discuss them in detail , Mr. Mottaki said .
He described a more positive atmosphere that he said had been created after Mr. Solana ’s recent visit to Tehran in June to present a document of understanding among the six countries participating in the nuclear talks  the United States , Germany , Russia , France , Britain and China .

The world ’s hipsters and rock writers will endlessly debate who the greatest rock bands of all time are .
Some bands like The Beatles or Led Zeppelin will always be included in the discussion but others are sadly ignored .
Some are overlooked for the simple reason that they do not actually exist .
So , to give these sorely under - appreciated bands some recognition , here are the Top Ten Fictional Bands of all time .
10 Scrantonicity The Office
Notable Members : Kevin Malone
Style : Cover Band
Essential Listening : Roxanne , You Were Meant for Me
Originally a Steve Miller tribute band known as “ Jokers and Tokers , ” Scrantonicity now plays covers of The Police ( though they have been known to cover other artists at live shows ) .
The band has recently gone through a huge upheaval as Kevin Malone - the band ’s lead vocalist and drummer - left the group .
He has gone on to form a new band Scrantonicity II .
Immediately the two bands began an intense rivalry that continues to this day .
9 Dr. Funke ’s Band Arrested Development
Notable Members : Tobias Funke , Lindsay Funke , Maeby Funke
Style : Folk
Essential Listening : Teamocil
“ Dr. Funke ’s 100 % Natural Good Time Family Band Solution ” was a 1990 ’s folk trio consisting of the family of Tobias and Lindsay Funke and their daughter , Maeby .
The group was underwritten by the Natural Life Food Company , a division of Chem - Grow , an Allen Crayne acquisition , which was part of the Squimm Group .
As a result the group ’s songs tended to focus upon the various drugs the company offered .
Nevertheless , the band gained a very small but very devoted following .
The band eventually split up due to growing tensions within the family .
A reunion show at a Los Angeles wellness convention ended with Lindsay and Maeby storming offstage leaving Tobias to finish the show with the help of an eager fan .
[ The clip above is a tribute to the show itself as none of the music clips could be found . ]
8 Autobahn The Big Lebowski
Notable Members : Uli Kunkel
Style : Electronica
Essential Listening : Hit and Run , Faking It
German techno - pop pioneers Autobahn released only one album entitled “ Nagelbett ” in the late seventies .
They are perhaps the best example of a band being “ ahead of its time . ”
Though they are now recognized as great innovators in the world of techno , their album was almost universally disparaged by both critics and audiences alike .
Utter demoralized , the band dissolved .
All of its members fell on hard times with band leader Uli Kunkel even resorting to the adult film industry before disappearing from the public eye completely .
7 The Be-Sharps The Simpsons
Notable Members : Homer Simpson , Barney Gumble , W. Seymour Skinner , Apu de Beaumarchais
Style : Barbershop Quartet
Essential Listening : Baby On Board , Number 8
A barbershop quartet hailing from Springfield , USA , The Be-Sharps experienced a meteoric rise to fame following the release of their first album “ Meet the Be - Sharps ” which featured the unlikely hit “ Baby on Board . ”
Success , however , was fleeting .
By the time their sophomore effort “ Bigger Than Jesus ” the band was divided by creative differences which lead the group splitting up .
In recent years they reunited only once for a concert atop Moe ’s Cavern , though reunion tour rumors continue to abound .
6 Jesse and the Rippers Full House
Notable Members : Jesse Katsopolis
Style : Rock
Essential Listening : Forever
Jesse and the Rippers came roaring out of the San Francisco rock scene when they recorded a cover of the classic Beach Boys tune “ Forever . ”
The song became a surprise hit with both fans and the Beach Boys themselves .
In fact , three of the Beach Boys even appeared as the band ’s back - up singers in the official video .
The band split shortly after their first tour .
The break - up was primarily due to lead vocalist and guitarist Jesse Katsopolis ’s unwillingness to put the band ahead of his family .
( He was helping raise his dead sister ’s three daughters in addition to his own twin sons . )
Since then the members have gone on to various other projects .
Most notably Katsopolis ’s new band Hot Daddy and the Monkey Puppets .
5 The Beets Doug
Notable Members : Monroe Yoder , Wendy Nespott , Chap Lippman , Flounder
Style : Pop Rock
Essential Listening : Killer Tofu , I Need Mo’ Allowence
After their first single “ I Sneezed On My Face ” dropped in the mid-nineties , The Beets were an unstoppable force in pop music releasing such modern pop classics as “ Where ’s My Sock ? ” , and “ You Gotta Shout Your Lungs Out . ”
Hit after hit resulted in a huge fan base and a declaration of “ Beet Mania ” by the press .
Eventually the band members decided to go their separate ways but not before releasing their masterful final LP , “ Let it Beet . ”
Each of The Beets has now gone on to a solo career leaving fans only dreaming of a reunion .
4 DriveShaft Lost
Notable Members : Charlie Pace , Liam Pace
Style : Pop Rock
Essential Listening : You All ( Everybody )
DriveShaft exploded onto the modern music scene in 1999 with their infectious single “ You All ( Everybody ) . ”
That single rose all the way to number one in both the UK and the US .
Following the monumental success of their first album , the band experienced a great deal of difficulty in recording a follow - up .
When it was finally released “ Oil Change ” found little popularity with critics or the public .
The group disbanded shortly after .
Charlie Pace , the band ’s bassist and main songwriter , expressed interest in reforming the group in the fall of 2004 .
Sadly , Pace was among those who died on September 22 , 2004 in the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 .
His death , however , sparked renewed interest for the band .
Now , Charlie Pace is widely appreciated as songwriter by the critics and fans who once wrote him off as a one - hit wonder .
3 Disaster Area Restaurant at the End of the Universe
Notable Members : Hotblack Desiato
Style : Loud
Essential Listening : Only The End Of The World Again
The band Disaster Area is commonly cited as being the loudest band in the universe , and in fact the loudest sound of any kind , anywhere .
Their legendary live shows are generally considered to be best when experienced at a safe distance of thirty seven miles away from a well - built concrete bunker .
Their most recent shows have featured a segment in which an actual spaceship is crashed into the nearest sun .
This stunt resulted in the planet of Kakrafoon being transformed from a harsh desert planet into a tropical paradise .
A spokesman for the band commented that it was “ a good gig . ”
The band is currently touring in spite of the fact that photon - ajuitar player Hotblack Desiato is currently spending a year dead for tax purposes .
2 Stillwater Almost Famous
Notable Members : Jeff Bebe , Russell Hammond
Style : Classic Rock
Essential Listening : Fever Dog , Love Comes and Goes
Hailing from Troy , Michigan , Stillwater is still known as one of the wild and raucous bands of the 1970 ’s both on - stage and off .
After stints opening for such legends as Black Sabbath and the Allman Brothers Band , the group embarked on its now notorious Almost Famous Tour in support of their second album ‘ Farrington Road . ”
Sex , drugs and every other rock ‘n roll excess permeated the tour which culminated in a Rolling Stone cover .
The tour also caused tension between the band ’s core members Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond resulting in the band dissolving after only one more album .
1 Spinal Tap This is Spinal Tap
Notable Members : Derek St. Hubbins , Nigel Tufnel , Derek Smalls
Style : Heavy Metal
Essential Listening : Sex Farm , Lick My Love Pump , Big Bottom
In the history of rock ‘n roll , there has never been a career more unlikely than that of Spinal Tap .
Dubbed “ England ’s Loudest Band ” the group has gained far - reaching popularity unrivaled by its musical contemporaries .
This is undoubtedly due to the Marty DeBergi documentary “ This is Spinal Tap ” which chronicled the group ’s 1982 tour which was plagued by band in - fighting and poor ticket sales .
Following the film ’s release the band ’s fan base greatly expanded and the group went on to become one of the most beloved in the history of rock .
They recently reunited for a show at Wembley Stadium in London as a part of Live Earth where they unveiled a new song “ Warmer than Hell . ”

Relax and prosper ,
Google Inc. says Bell Canada Inc. is breaking Canadian telecommunications law by slowing certain internet traffic , and is urging the CRTC to take action against the company .
" Bell claims its throttling of peer - to - peer applications is a reasonable form of network management .
Google respectfully disagrees .
Network management does not include Canadian carriers ’ blocking or degrading lawful applications that consumers wish to use , " the company wrote in a 15 - page submission to the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , which was made public over the weekend .
" From consumer , competition and innovation perspectives , throttling applications that consumers choose is inconsistent with a content and application - neutral internet , and a violation of Canadian telecommunications law , which forbids unfair discrimination and undue or unreasonable preferences and requires that regulation be technologically and competitively neutral . "
Net neutrality at stake
The Mountain View , Calif . - based search engine giant made the comments as part of an investigation by the CRTC into Bell 's limiting of download speeds of peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent .
Bell first started limiting the speeds — known as throttling — of its own Sympatico internet subscribers in November , then extended the practice to its wholesale customers in March .
The company said growing usage by a small number of peer - to - peer users was threatening to cause slowdowns for its overall customer base .
That move prompted a complaint with the CRTC from the Canadian Association of Internet Providers , a group of 55 small ISPs who rent portions of Bell 's network , and sparked the " net neutrality " battle over who controls the internet in Canada .
Aside from Google , CAIP has attracted the support of thousands of users , consumer groups and other technology firms including internet calling provider Skype .
Bell , on the other hand , saw fellow large ISPs Telus Corp. and Rogers Communications Inc. come to its defence last week .
Google said that in order to keep consumer choice and innovation alive on the internet , the CRTC must force Bell — and eventually other large ISPs — to end its throttling practices .
" The internet is simply too important to allow them to act as such a gatekeeper , " the company said .
" Protecting end user choice is the central issue in this proceeding , but also a much larger issue .
It goes to the heart of the internet and how it acts as an extraordinary platform for innovation and fair competition . "
A spokesman for Bell said the company plans to respond in its next submission to the CRTC , which is due on Thursday .
Telus , which says it does not limit the speeds of its internet subscribers , in its submission argued that Bell is within its rights to change how it delivers services to its wholesale customers .
The notification of network changes required by the Telecommunications
Act apply only to other network carriers , a status many of CAIP 's members do not have .
" Customer relations matters that involve no network interface changes do not engage the network change notification requirements , and it would be inefficient and unwieldy to create new requirements in this regard , " wrote Craig McTaggart , director of broadband policy for Telus .
The company argued there is no discrimination because Bell is treating its own Sympatico and wholesale customers the same .
Telus also discounted arguments made by other parties who have made submissions to the CRTC , including Skype , that the traffic - inspection technology used by Bell violates users ' privacy .
McTaggart noted that the current dispute should be limited specifically to the question of whether Bell is violating its wholesale agreement terms and should not be extended to other network owners , such as Telus .
" To the extent that this dispute may raise any policy issues relating to retail internet access services , Telus would expect the commission to initiate a proceeding by way of public notice / notice of consultation before establishing new rules of general application , " he wrote .
" However , in Telus ' view , no such proceeding is necessary . "
Other internet uses not affected : Rogers
Rogers , which also slows peer - to - peer applications , disputed claims by CAIP that such throttling affects services such as voice over internet protocol ( VoIP ) and virtual private networks ( VPN ) .
" This equipment , therefore , does not impact any other traffic such as VoIP , VPN and other online streaming applications because their signatures are different , " wrote Ken Engelhart , senior vice - president of regulatory affairs for Rogers .
" There is therefore no reason why VPN or other encrypted traffic would be affected . "
Engelhart also reiterated that Rogers does not throttle the downloading of files over peer - to - peer applications — it only slows uploading .
However , because the download speeds of many applications are tied to the upload speed , the downloads are effectively slowed as well , which is the fault of the application 's provider .
" Of course , because some P2P applications ( BitTorrent for example ) restrict download speed to the maximum upload speed provided by the user , a customer ’s P2P download speed can be limited by the upstream cap , but that is a result of the business decision taken by the P2P applications provider , " he wrote .
Bell has also been supported by network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. , which said the CRTC should refrain from imposing network management regulations .
Aside from Google and Skype , parties who have made CRTC submissions supporting CAIP include : the University of Western Ontario ; the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic ; the Union des consommateurs ; Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc. ; the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association ; and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance , which counts network equipment maker Alcatel Lucent among its members .
The CRTC expects to rule on the CAIP - Bell dispute in September and has said a larger investigation into net neutrality principles is likely .

STFL - Structured Terminal Forms Language / Library
STFL is a library which implements a curses - based widget set for text terminals .
The STFL API can be used from C , SPL , Python , Perl and Ruby .
Since the API is only 14 simple function calls big and there are already generic SWIG bindings it is very easy to port STFL to additional scripting languages .
A special language ( the Structured Terminal Forms Language ) is used to describe STFL GUIs .
The language is designed to be easy and fast to write so an application programmer does not need to spend ages fiddling around with the GUI and can concentrate on the more interesting programming tasks .
The STFL documentation can be found here .
Example Scripts
SPL API : A little database frontend for an address database ( I 've used the data from the linux kernel CREDITS file as example data ) .
The source code of the script can be downloaded from here .
The script is written in SPL .
C API : A simple test for different STFL layout algorithms .
It is written in C and using an external STFL file .

Implementation Status
Rumors have been flying for the last day about some manner of change at the Herald - Sun , which has gone through its share of turmoil in the last several years since the hometown paper 's sale from local ownership to small - market chain Paxton Media .
Today 's H - S confirms further reorganization -- read , cost - cutting -- in both the operational and newsroom aspects of the paper .
Still , it 's not quite clear exactly what these changes will mean for readers of the paper .
Here 's what we know at this point :
First , the Herald - Sun will be laying off staff , " fewer than 10 " positions company - wide , according to editor Bob Ashley 's column today .
These layoffs include newsroom as well as non-newsroom staff ... though Ashley goes out of his way to note that the paper will be " reploy[ing ] " some staff to fill vacant newsroom positions and to add a reporter slot .
Ashley describes these changes as part of an effort to " restructure our editing and production , " which implies to this observer that Paxton may be cutting back there and moving staff from that arena to the reporting team .
Second , the paper -- already thin on some days -- looks to shrink even further , likely a reflection of the shrinking advertising revenue and demand in the print world .
Thursday 's Healthy Living section and Saturday 's Faith and Family section are axed , replaced by condensed or merged versions of same in those days '
Metro sections .
And there 's this worrisome bit : while noting that the paper is working to " produce more local stories , " Ashley implies this is a change to add breadth , not depth :
Frankly , we 'll be looking to some folks to rethink their jobs so that we 'll produce more local stories - and concentrating on how best to present information , with more sidebars , informational boxes and other devices supplementing stories that themselves will be shorter .
Less - length , more - info ?
Sounds to this outside observer like a way to cut newsprint and ink costs , allowing the paper to condense editorial content into a slightly leaner form .
( And hopefully not a reflection on the perceived level of desire in the community for analytical , insightful reporting . )
It 's clear from the phraseology in the article that Ashley 's announcement reflects at best a high - level introduction to what 's changed here .
Worrisome phrases abound in the piece , like " asking more of our editors , " " rethink the way we approach our work , " " avoiding extraneous information , " " innovative ways " to meet challenges .
Sounds like a call to work smarter and work harder -- not exactly the kind of clarion call one hopes to see in one 's hometown paper .
We 'll have more on this one as we learn it .

In a sign of just how poisonous President Bush has become to his fellow Republican ’s election hopes , the sitting President will speak on the opening night of the Republican convention , and there will not be a joint media appearance with John McCain .
While it is not uncommon for a sitting president to speak on the first night of the convention , and then get out the way , a lack of a joint appearance is reflective of the tightrope the McCain campaign has to walk when it comes to Bush .
The problem for McCain is that he needs Bush to ease the minds of some hardcore Republicans who are skeptical about him , and he also needs Bush ’s fundraising abilities .
However , actually being seen with the president in public would reinforce the Democratic theme that McCain represents a third Bush term .
According to the New York Times , Republicans are divided on the issue .
Some see Bush ’s popularity as essential for McCain with the Republican base , while others just wish he would stay home .
In reality , this whole choreographed dance is a ruse designed to fool voters into believing that McCain is his own man , a maverick .
One only has to look at the big issues of this campaign the economy , the war , and healthcare to see his total agreement with George W. Bush .
What this news does emphasize is McCain ’s deeply flawed status as a major party nominee .
Advertisements
A few years ago John McCain made the strategic error of selling out his own base in favor of becoming the heir apparent to Bush .
This seemed like a good idea in the post - 9/11 political world , but when Bush ’s popularity ratings tanked , so did McCain ’s appeal with most of the country .
Now McCain is man without a base , who won his Party ’s nomination by default .
He is saddled with a historically unpopular president , and a party rank and file that does n’t trust his move towards Bush on the issues .
This is why it will take an epic collapse by Barack Obama for John McCain to win the White House in November .
McCain is the leader of a weakened party that does n’t trust his leadership .
Not since the days of Mike Dukakis has a political party been led by such a weak nominee .
A top federal judge who is presiding over an obscenity trial in Los Angeles has been caught posting explicit photos and videos to his web site .
The judge told the * Los Angeles Times * that he did n't think the site was publicly accessible .
Alex Kozinski ( at right ) , a conservative appointee of former president Ronald Reagan who is chief of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , posted a photo of naked women standing on all fours and painted to look like cows , as well as a video of a half - naked man with a farm animal .
A step - by - step pictorial depicted a woman shaving her pubic hair and other images showed masturbation and what the Times called " contortionist sex . "
The images were posted to a subdomain of the judge 's web site that could only be accessed by directly typing in the correct URL .
The domain , however , was not password - protected .
In addition to the pornographic images , the subdomain contained legal writings , music files and the judge 's personal photos .
The judge told the Times that he accidentally loaded the images to his server and would not have intentionally posted them .
He said he thought some of the photos were " funny " but acknowledged that the photo of the women painted as cows was " degrading " and " gross . "
He said , however , that he did n't think the images were obscene .
Kozinski is presiding over a case involving filmmaker Ira Isaacs who allegedly distributed sexual - fetish videos depicting bestiality and other images that are deemed potentially " criminally obscene . "
A New York University professor has called for Kozinski to recuse himself from the Isaacs case saying the images could call into question his objectivity .
" The phrase ' sober as a judge ' resonates with the American public , " Gillers said .
" We do n't want them to reveal their private selves publicly .
This is going to upset a lot of people . "
UPDATE : A tipster sent in this search link showing some of the files Kozinki had on his " stuff " subdomain before he took down his site ( the site is no longer accessible ) .
Many of them are .wmv files that can be found elsewhere on the internet .
A reader has posted another link to a page where you can actually view some of the images that were said to be on Kozinski 's site .

Oil prices pass $ 143 a barrel ; US gas hits high The Associated Press
Published : Monday June 30 , 2008

Print This Email This By PABLO GORONDI
Oil prices surged past $ 143 a barrel for the first time ever Monday , and the price for a gallon of gas hit an all - time high in the United States .
Supply concerns and a fragile global economy continue to drive the price of oil to new highs , as well as continued tensions in the Middle East .
Light , sweet crude for August delivery rose $ 2.13 to $ 142.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
In early electronic trading , the contract hit a record $ 143.67 .
On Friday , crude futures had spiked at a record $ 142.99 a barrel in New York before falling to $ 140.21 .
In London , Brent crude futures rose $ 2.24 to $ 142.55 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London .
Earlier Monday , the price for Brent had peaked at $ 143.91 .
A survey in the U.S. , meanwhile , showed that prices at the pump continued to rise , with the national average for gasoline at $ 4.086 a gallon .
The previous record of $ 4.08 was reached June 16 .
" The main factors behind the rise today are the U.S. dollar remains fragile and geopolitical tensions , particularly surrounding Iran , " said David Moore , a commodity strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney .
" That 's unsettling for the oil market . "
The Iraqi government opened six oil fields to international bidding Monday as the nation attempts to boost daily production by 60 percent .
The potential participation of big Western companies like BP , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Total SA in Iraq 's oil industry has been criticized in recent weeks following published reports that several were close to signing no -bid contracts with the Iraqi government .
Those contracts were expected to be announced Monday , but Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani instead named 35 companies that would be qualified to bid on service contracts for the oil fields of Rumeila , Zubair , Qurna West , Maysan , Kirkuk and Bay Hassan .
Analysts said daily trading volumes for Nymex oil would probably continue last week 's trend and stay on the light side , leading to higher volatility during the trading sessions .
" We would not expect liquidity to be much better this week , as it will be a short trading week due to the July 4 weekend , " Olivier Jakob , of Petromatrix in Switzerland , said in a research note .
Worries about tight oil supplies and growing global demand are also major factors in the doubling of oil prices since last year , Moore said .
Traders were digesting reported comments from the commander of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , who warned that if his country is attacked , Tehran would strike back by barraging Israel with missiles .
In a report published Saturday in the conservative Jam-e - Jam newspaper , Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari said that if Iran were provoked , it would also move to control a key oil passageway in the Gulf .
Iran is the world 's fourth - largest oil exporter and about 60 percent of the world 's oil passes through the strategic Strait of Hormuz .
The report comes after the disclosure of a recent Israeli military exercise over the Mediterranean Sea that was seen as sending a message to Iran to curb its nuclear ambitions .
The dollar has weakened on expectations the Federal Reserve Board wo n't soon raise interest rates as the U.S. economy struggles with low growth .
The Fed left its benchmark rate unchanged last week .
The dollar dipped fell to 105.81 yen Monday from 106.12 late Friday .
The euro also lost some ground on the U.S. currency , down to $ 1.5774 from $ 1.5808 .
" ECB President Jean - Claude Trichet 's hawkish stance ( on ) inflation " could mean the dollar may be headed for further weakness against the euro " and that 's not bearish for oil , " said The Schork Report edited by U.S. analyst and trader Stephen Schork .
A falling U.S. stock market has also led investors to seek higher - yielding investments such as oil and other commodities .
The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two years  and is down nearly 20 percent since its peak in October .
In other Nymex trading , heating oil futures rose 5.86 cents to $ 3.9652 a gallon ( 3.8 liters ) while gasoline prices rose 4.39 cents to $ 3.5451 a gallon .
Natural gas futures increased 15.7 cents to $ 13.355 per 1,000 cubic feet .

The Computing , GIS and Archeology in the UK blog had a post last week entitled Why I Love Open Source .
It recounts a pleasant interaction that they had with an open source developer , culminating in a quick fix / enhancement to the software .
Good for them , and good for the developer .
( Aside : the software is not cost - free for non-commercial usage , but is still free - as - in - speech .
At least it says it is open source , and source is provided , but there is no specific licence mentioned that I could find . )
I do n’t want to come over all Dimitri but this single anecdote ( and remember , the plural of anecdote is not data as someone much smarter than me once said ) is being extrapolated into an open - source - good - closed - source - bad thesis .
Harrumph .
At no stage were any of the four freedoms of open source software exercised .
There seems to be nothing open source - specific at all about this case , just a nice relationship between provider and consumer .
I ca n’t speak for anyone else , but we at Cadcorp make hotfixes / patches / enhancements / call - them - what - you - will available all the time .
So please do not tar everyone with the same big - bad - closed - source brush or you might end up , bizarrely , actually complaining about getting bugfixes .
At the request of LRC , Professor Hoppe discusses his extremely important new book , Democracy : The God That Failed ( Transaction Publishers , Rutgers , NJ : 2001 ) .
Theory and History
On the most abstract level , I want to show how theory is indispensible in correctly interpreting history .
History — the sequence of events unfolding in time — is “ blind . ”
It reveals nothing about causes and effects .
We may agree , for instance , that feudal Europe was poor , that monarchical Europe was wealthier , and that democratic Europe is wealthier still , or that nineteenth - century America with its low taxes and few regulations was poor , while contemporary America with its high taxes and many regulations is rich .
Yet was Europe poor because of feudalism , and did it grow richer because of monarchy and democracy ?
Or did Europe grow richer in spite of monarchy and democracy ?
Or are these phenomena unrelated ?
Likewise , is contemporary America wealthier because of higher taxes and more regulations or in spite of them ?
That is , would America be even more prosperous if taxes and regulations had remained at their nineteenth - century levels ?
Historians qua historians cannot answer such questions , and no amount of statistical data manipulation can change this fact .
Every sequence of empirical events is compatible with any of a number of rival , mutually incompatible interpretations .
To make a decision regarding such incompatible interpretations , we need a theory .
By theory I mean a proposition whose validity does not depend on further experience but can be established a priori .
This is not to say that one can do without experience altogether in establishing a theoretical proposition .
However , it is to say that even if experience is necessary , theoretical insights extend and transcend logically beyond a particular historical experience .
Theoretical propositions are about necessary facts and relations and , by implication , about impossibilities .
Experience may thus illustrate a theory .
But historical experience can neither establish a theorem nor refute it .
The Austrian School
Economic and political theory , especially of the Austrian variety , is a treasure trove of such propositions .
For instance , a larger quantity of a good is preferred to a smaller amount of the same good ; production must precede consumption ; what is consumed now cannot be consumed again in the future ; prices fixed below market - clearing prices will lead to lasting shortages ; without private property in production factors there can be no factor prices , and without factor prices cost - accounting is impossible ; an increase in the supply of paper money cannot increase total social wealth but can only redistribute existing wealth ; monopoly ( the absence of free entry ) leads to higher prices and lower product quality than competition ; no thing or part of a thing can be owned exclusively by more than one party at a time ; democracy ( majority rule ) and private property are incompatible .
Theory is no substitute for history , of course , yet without a firm grasp of theory serious errors in the interpretation of historical data are unavoidable .
For instance , the outstanding historian Carroll Quigley claims that the invention of fractional reserve banking has been a major cause of the unprecedented expansion of wealth associated with the Industrial Revolution , and countless historians have associated the economic plight of Soviet - style socialism with the absence of democracy .
From a theoretical viewpoint , such interpretations must be rejected categorically .
An increase in the paper money supply cannot lead to greater prosperity but only to wealth redistribution .
The explosion of wealth during the Industrial Revolution took place despite fractional reserve banking .
Similarly , the economic plight of socialism cannot be due to the absence of democracy .
Instead , it is caused by the absence of private property in factors of production .
“ Received history ” is full of such misinterpretations .
Theory allows us to rule out certain historical reports as impossible and incompatible with the nature of things .
By the same token , it allows us to uphold certain other things as historical possibilities , even if they have not yet been tried .
Revisionist History
More interestingly , armed with elementary economic and political theory , I present in my book a revisionist reconstruction of modern Western history : of the rise of absolute monarchical states out of state - less feudal orders , and the transformation , beginning with the French Revolution and essentially completed with the end of World War I , of the Western world from monarchical to democratic States , and the rise of the US to the rank of “ universal empire . ”
Neo -conservative writers such as Francis Fukuyama have interpreted this development as civilizational progress , and they proclaim the “ End of History ” to have arrived with the triumph of Western — US — democracy and its globalization ( making the world safe for democracy ) .
Myth One
My theoretical interpretation is entirely different .
It involves the shattering of three historical myths .
The first and most fundamental is the myth that the emergence of states out of a prior , non-statist order has caused subsequent economic and civilizational progress .
In fact , theory dictates that any progress must have occurred in spite — not because — of the institution of a state .
A state is defined conventionally as an agency that exercises a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decison - making ( jurisdiction ) and of taxation .
By definition then , every state , regardless of its particular constitution , is economically and ethically deficient .
Every monopolist is “ bad ” from the viewpoint of consumers .
Monopoly is hereby understood as the absence of free entry into a particular line of production : only one agency , A , may produce X .
Any monopoly is “ bad ” for consumers because , shielded from potential new entrants into its line of production , the price for its product will be higher and the quality lower than with free entry .
And a monopolist with ultimate decison - making powers is particularly bad .
While other monopolists produce inferior goods , a monopolist judge , besides producing inferior goods , will produce bads , because he who is the ultimate judge in every case of conflict also has the last word in each conflict involving himself .
Consequently , instead of preventing and resolving conflict , a monopolist of ultimate decision - making will cause and provoke conflict in order to settle it to his own advantage .
Not only would no one accept such a monopoly judge provision , but no one would ever agree to a provision that allowed this judge to determine the price to be paid for his “ service ” unilaterally .
Predictably , such a monopolist would use up ever more resources ( tax revenue ) to produce fewer goods and perpetrate more bads .
This is not a prescription for protection but for oppression and exploitation .
The result of a state , then , is not peaceful cooperation and social order , but conflict , provocation , aggression , oppression , and impoverishment , i.e. , de-civilization .
This , above all , is what the history of states illustrates .
It is first and foremost the history of countless millions of innocent state victims .
Myth Two
The second myth concerns the historic transition from absolute monarchies to democratic states .
Not only do neoconservatives interpret this development as progress ; there is near - universal agreement that democracy represents an advance over monarchy and is the cause of economic and moral progress .
This interpretation is curious in light of the fact that democracy has been the fountainhead of every form of socialism : of ( European ) democratic socialism and ( American ) liberalism and neo-conservatism as well as of international ( Soviet ) socialism , ( Italian ) fascism , and national ( Nazi ) socialism .
More importantly , however , theory contradicts this interpretation ; whereas both monarchies and democracies are deficient as states , democracy is worse than monarchy .
Theoretically speaking , the transition from monarchy to democracy involves no more or less than a hereditary monopoly “ owner ” — the prince or king — being replaced by temporary and interchangeable — monopoly “ caretakers ” — presidents , prime ministers , and members of parliament .
Both kings and presidents will produce bads , yet a king , because he “ owns ” the monopoly and may sell or bequeath it , will care about the repercussions of his actions on capital values .
As the owner of the capital stock on “ his ” territory , the king will be comparatively future - oriented .
In order to preserve or enhance the value of his property , he will exploit only moderately and calculatingly .
In contrast , a temporary and interchangeable democratic caretaker does not own the country , but as long as he is in office he is permitted to use it to his advantage .
He owns its current use but not its capital stock .
This does not eliminate exploitation .
Instead , it makes exploitation shortsighted ( present - oriented ) and uncalculated , i.e. , carried out without regard for the value of the capital stock .
Nor is it an advantage of democracy that free entry into every state position exists ( whereas under monarchy entry is restricted by the king ’s discretion ) .
To the contrary , only competition in the production of goods is a good thing .
Competition in the production of bads is not good ; in fact , it is sheer evil .
Kings , coming into their position by virtue of birth , might be harmless dilettantes or decent men ( and if they are “ madmen , ” they will be quickly restrained or if need be , killed , by close relatives concerned with the possessions of the dynasty ) .
In sharp contrast , the selection of government rulers by means of popular elections makes it essentially impossible for a harmless or decent person to ever rise to the top .
Presidents and prime ministers come into their position as a result of their efficiency as morally uninhibited demagogues .
Hence , democracy virtually assures that only dangerous men will rise to the top of government .
In particular , democracy is seen as promoting an increase in the social rate of time preference ( present - orientation ) or the “ infantilization ” of society .
It results in continually increased taxes , paper money and paper money inflation , an unending flood of legislation , and a steadily growing “ public ” debt .
By the same token , democracy leads to lower savings , increased legal uncertainty , moral relativism , lawlessness , and crime .
Further , democracy is a tool for wealth and income confiscation and redistribution .
It involves the legislative “ taking ” of the property of some — the haves of something — and the “ giving ” of it to others — the have - nots of things .
And since it is presumably something valuable that is being redistributed — of which the haves have too much and the have - nots too little — any such redistribution implies that the incentive to be of value or produce something valuable is systematically reduced .
In other words , the proportion of not - so - good people and not - so - good personal traits , habits , and forms of conduct and appearance will increase , and life in society will become increasingly unpleasant .
Last but not least , democracy is described as resulting in a radical change in the conduct of war .
Because they can externalize the costs of their own aggression onto others ( via taxes ) , both kings and presidents will be more than ‘ normally ’ aggressive and warlike .
However , a king ’s motive for war is typically an ownership - inheritance dispute .
The objective of his war is tangible and territorial : to gain control over some piece of real estate and its inhabitants .
And to reach this objective it is in his interest to distinguish between combatants ( his enemies and targets of attack ) and non-combatants and their property ( to be left out of the war and undamaged ) .
Democracy has transformed the limited wars of kings into total wars .
The motive for war has become ideological — democracy , liberty , civilization , humanity .
The objectives are intangible and elusive : the ideological “ conversion ” of the losers preceded by their “ unconditional ” surrender ( which , because one can never be certain about the sincerity of conversion , may require such means as the mass murder of civilians ) .
And the distinction between combatants and non-combatants becomes fuzzy and ultimately disappears under democracy , and mass war involvement — the draft and popular war rallies — as well as “ collateral damage ” become part of war strategy .
Myth Three
Finally , the third myth shattered is the belief that there is no alternative to Western welfare - democracies a la US .
Again , theory demonstrates otherwise .
First , this belief is false because the modern welfare - state is not a “ stable ” economic system .
It is bound to collapse under its own parasitic weight , much like Russian - style socialism imploded a decade ago .
More importantly , however , an economically stable alternative to democracy exists .
The term I propose for this alternative is “ natural order . ”
In a natural order every scarce resource , including all land , is owned privately , every enterprise is funded by voluntarily paying customers or private donors , and entry into every line of production , including that of property protection , conflict arbitration , and peacemaking , is free .
A large part of my book concerns the explanation of the workings — the logic — of a natural order and the requirements for the transformation from democracy to a natural order .
Whereas states disarm their citizens so as to be able to rob them more surely ( thereby rendering them more vulnerable also to criminal and terrorist attack ) , a natural order is characterized by an armed citizenry .
This feature is furthered by insurance companies , which play a prominent role as providers of security and protection in a natural order .
Insurers will encourage gun ownership by offering lower premiums to armed ( and weapons - trained ) clients .
By their nature insurers are defensive agencies .
Only “ accidental ” — not : self - inflicted , caused or provoked — damage is “ insurable . ”
Aggressors and provocateurs will be denied insurance coverage and are thus weak .
And because insurers must indemnify their clients in case of victimization , they must be concerned constantly about the prevention of criminal aggression , the recovery of misappropriated property , and the apprehension of those liable for the damage in question .
Furthermore , the relationship between insurer and client is contractual .
The rules of the game are mutually accepted and fixed .
An insurer cannot “ legislate , ” or unilaterally change the terms of the contract .
In particular , if an insurer wants to attract a voluntarily paying clientele , it must provide for the foreseeable contingency of conflict in its contracts , not only between its own clients but especially with clients of other insurers .
The only provision satisfactorily covering the latter contingency is for an insurer to bind itself contractually to independent third - party arbitration .
However , not just any arbitration will do .
The conflicting insurers must agree on the arbitrator or arbitration agency , and in order to be agreeable to insurers , an arbitrator must produce a product ( of legal procedure and substantive judgment ) that embodies the widest possible moral consensus among insurers and clients alike .
Thus , contrary to statist conditions , a natural order is characterized by stable and predictable law and increased legal harmony .
Moreover , insurance companies promote the development of another “ security feature . ”
States have not just disarmed their citizens by taking away their weapons , democratic states in particular have also done so in stripping their citizens of the right to exclusion and by promoting instead — through various non-discrimination , affirmative action , and multiculturalist policies — forced integration .
In a natural order , the right to exclusion inherent in the very idea of private property is restored to private property owners .
Accordingly , to lower the production cost of security and improve its quality , a natural order is characterized by increased discrimination , segregation , spatial separation , uniculturalism ( cultural homogeneity ) , exclusivity , and exclusion .
In addition , whereas states have undermined intermediating social institutions ( family households , churches , covenants , communities , and clubs ) and the associated ranks and layers of authority so as to increase their own power vis-a - vis equal and isolated individuals , a natural order is distinctly un-egalitarian : “ elitist , ” “ hierarchical , ” “ proprietarian , ” “ patriarchical , ” and “ authoritorian , ” and its stability depends essentially on the existence of a self - conscious natural — voluntarily acknowledged — aristocracy .
Strategy
Finally , I discuss strategic matters and questions .
How can a natural order arise out of democracy ?
I explain the role of ideas , intellectuals , elites , and public opinion in the legitimation and de-legitimation of state power .
In particular , I discuss the role of secession — and the proliferation of independent political entities — as an important step toward the goal of natural order , and I explain how to properly privatize “ socialized ” and “ public ” property .
The book grew out of speeches I presented at various Mises Institute and CLS conferences during the 1990s .
These conferences , organized by Lew Rockwell , Burt Blumert , and , until his death in 1995 , Murray Rothbard , had the purpose of advancing libertarianism by locating and anchoring abstract libertarian theory historically , sociologically , and culturally and thereby creating what has become known in the meantime as paleo - libertarianism ( in contrast to left - countercultural - libertarianism and cold - and - hot - war “ new ” and “ neo ” - conservatism ) .
The Rothbard - Rockwell Report , the precusor to LRC , was the first and most immediate expression and reflection of this intellectual movement .

Reg Braithwaite is one of the smartest bloggers out there , but I really do n't agree with his latest post , Why Apple is more expensive than Amazon at all .
Setting aside the question of whether Apple is pro- or anti-DRM , the most problematic meme that is being spread ( not just by Reg , but elsewhere , as well ) is the idea that the music industry is using price fixing to undercut Apple .
Quite simply , this is ridiculous .
Here 's the bottom line : Apple has exercised complete control over item pricing on iTunes , both in terms of setting consumer prices and setting producer prices .
They have a single flat - rate deal that they offer all music producers , and if you do n't like that deal , your songs are n't on iTunes -- it 's that simple .
The record companies want the ability to offer variable pricing -- higher on new hits , lower on catalog titles -- and Apple has refused :
The recording industry and Apple had been at odds over Apple 's insistence to keep its flat rate with some labels wanting variable pricing , including higher prices for new releases .
“ Apple has all the cards , and when you have all the cards , you can play hardball , ” said Ted Schadler , an analyst at market research firm Forrester Research .
AP Wire , May 2 , 2006
So while Amazon is fine with selling some songs for $ 0.99 and some for $ 0.89 , Apple enforces their one - price - fits - all philosophy .
Record companies actually can't offer tracks to iTunes for less , regardless of what they would prefer .
And while Amazon may be operating at a lower margin on some items and a higher margin on others ( as they do with books , CDs , and everything else they sell ) , Apple always takes the same margin on every song .
So , are the record companies obligated to sell Amazon tracks at the same price Apple has fixed ?
If so , why ?
Does Apple have the right to dictate pricing for all vendors , and not merely the price at which they will purchase ?
That does n't even make sense .
Are the record companies trying to undercut Apple ?
Of course they are .
But calling this price fixing is tantamount to saying that Apple has the right to set the royalty rate for the entire digital music industry .
I hope people will stop drinking that particular Kool - Aid .

Thirty minutes north of Omaha , outside Blair , Nebraska , the aroma of steaming corn — damp and sweet — falls upon my car like a heavy curtain .
The farmland rolls on , and the source of the smell remains a mystery until an enormous , steam - belching , gleaming - white architecture of tanks and pipes rises suddenly from the cornfields between Route 75 and the flood plain of the Missouri River .
Behold NatureWorks : the largest lactic - acid plant in the world .
Into one end of the complex goes corn ; out the other come white pellets , an industrial resin poised to become — if you can believe all the hype — the future of plastic in a post - petroleum world .
Related Content How to Turn 8,000 Plastic Bottles Into a Building
The resin , known as polylactic acid ( PLA ) , will be formed into containers and packaging for food and consumer goods .
The trendy plastic has several things going for it .
It ’s made from a renewable resource , which means it has a big leg up — both politically and environmentally — on conventional plastic packaging , which uses an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day in the United States .
Also , PLA is in principle compostable , meaning that it will break down under certain conditions into harmless natural compounds .
That could take pressure off the nation ’s mounting landfills , since plastics already take up 25 percent of dumps by volume .
And corn -based plastics are starting to look cheap , now that oil prices are so high .
For a few years , natural foods purveyors such as Newman ’s Own Organics and Wild Oats have been quietly using some PLA products , but the material got its biggest boost when Wal - Mart , the world ’s largest retailer , announced this past October that it would sell some produce in PLA containers .
The move is part of the company ’s effort to counter criticisms that it has been environmentally irresponsible .
“ Moving toward zero waste is one of our three big corporate goals for the environment , ” says Matt Kistler , vice president of private brands and product development for the retailer .
Wal - Mart plans to use 114 million PLA containers a year , which company executives estimate will save 800,000 barrels of oil annually .
To make plastic packaging and containers from a renewable resource that can be returned to the earth as fertilizer sounds like an unmitigated good .
Selling fruits and veggies in boxes that do n’t leach chemicals into landfills sounds equally wonderful .
But PLA has considerable drawbacks that have n’t been publicized , while some claims for its environmental virtues are downright misleading .
It turns out there ’s no free lunch after all , regardless of what its container is made of , as I learned when I tried to get to the bottom of this marvelous news out of corn country .
At the NatureWorks plant in Blair , I don a hard hat , earplugs , gloves and protective eyewear and swear that I will snap no photographs .
What can be revealed by my hosts is revealed : corn kernels are delivered and milled , dextrose is extracted from starch .
Huge fermenters convert the dextrose into lactic acid , a simple organic chemical that is a by - product of fermentation ( or respiration , in the case of the lactic acid that builds up in muscle tissue after intense activity ) .
Industrial lactic acid is derived from many starchy sources , including wheat , beets and potatoes , but NatureWorks is owned by Cargill , the world ’s largest corn merchant , and so its lactic acid comes from corn .
The compound is converted to lactide , and lactide molecules are linked into long chains or polymers : polylactic acid , PLA .
I did get a chance to see and touch the obscure object of my desire when some liquid PLA , with the color and shine of caramelized sugar , burst from a pipe and solidified in flossy strands on the steel - grated floor .
The next time I saw the stuff , in a box in a warehouse , it had been crystallized into translucent white balls the size of peas : PLA resin .
In the hands of fabricators , the pellets would be melted and reshaped into containers , films and fibers .
Though the polymer , because of its low melting point , does n’t yet have as many applications as does the far more common plastic polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) , used to make soda bottles and some polyester fibers , the company has plans , as a large banner in the office proclaims , to “ Beat PET ! ”
In some ways , corn plastic is clearly easier on the environment .
Producing PLA uses 65 percent less energy than producing conventional plastics , according to an independent analysis commissioned by NatureWorks .
It also generates 68 percent fewer greenhouse gases , and contains no toxins .
“ It has a drastically different safety profile , ” says NatureWorks operations manager Carey Buckles .
“ It ’s not going to blow up the community . ”
For retailers , PLA has a halo effect .
Wild Oats was an early adopter of the stuff .
“ Our employees loved the environmental message of the containers , that they came from a renewable resource , and our customers had a strong reaction when we told them they were compostable , ” says Sonja Tuitele , a Wild Oats spokesperson .
The containers initially boosted the company ’s deli sales by 17 percent , she says , and the chain now uses six million PLA containers a year .
Newman ’s Own Organics uses PLA packaging for its salad mixes .
“ We felt strongly that everywhere we can get out of petroleum products , we should , ” says Newman ’s Own CEO Peter Meehan .
“ No one has ever gone to war over corn . ”
Wal - Mart , which has begun using PLA containers in some stores , has also switched packaging on high - end electronics from PET to a sandwich of cardboard and PLA .
“ It has a smaller packaging footprint , it ’s completely biodegradable and it costs less , ” says Kistler .
What Wal - Mart says about PLA ’s biodegradable nature is true , but there ’s an important catch .
Corn plastic has been around for 20 years , but the polymer was too expensive for broad commercial applications until 1989 , when Patrick Gruber , then a Cargill chemist looking for new ways to use corn , invented a way to make the polymer more efficiently .
Working with his wife , also a chemist , he created his first prototype PLA products on his kitchen stove .
In the beginning , it cost $ 200 to make a pound of PLA ; now it ’s less than $ 1 .
The polymer has had to get over some cultural hurdles .
In the mid-1980s , another bio - based plastic appeared on grocery store shelves : bags made from polyethylene and cornstarch that were said to be biodegradable .
“ People thought they would disappear quickly , ” recalls Steven Mojo , executive director of the Biodegradable Products Institute .
They did n’t .
Will Brinton , president of Woods End , a compost research laboratory in Mt. Vernon , Maine , says the bags broke into small fragments of polyethylene , fragments that were n’t good for compost — or public relations .
“ It was a big step backward for the biodegradability movement , ” he adds .
“ Whole communities abandoned the concept of biodegradable bags as a fraud . ”
According to a biodegradability standard that Mojo helped develop , PLA is said to decompose into carbon dioxide and water in a “ controlled composting environment ” in fewer than 90 days .
What ’s a controlled composting environment ?
Not your backyard bin , pit or tumbling barrel .
It ’s a large facility where compost — essentially , plant scraps being digested by microbes into fertilizer — reaches 140 degrees for ten consecutive days .
So , yes , as PLA advocates say , corn plastic is “ biodegradable . ”
But in reality very few consumers have access to the sort of composting facilities that can make that happen .
NatureWorks has identified 113 such facilities nationwide — some handle industrial food - processing waste or yard trimmings , others are college or prison operations — but only about a quarter of them accept residential foodscraps collected by municipalities .
Moreover , PLA by the truckload may potentially pose a problem for some large - scale composters .
Chris Choate , a composting expert at Norcal Waste Systems , headquartered in San Francisco , says large amounts of PLA can interfere with conventional composting because the polymer reverts into lactic acid , making the compost wetter and more acidic .
“ Microbes will consume the lactic acid , but they demand a lot of oxygen , and we ’re having trouble providing enough , ” he says .
“ Right now , PLA is n’t a problem , ” because there ’s so little of it , Choate says .
( NatureWorks disputes that idea , saying that PLA has no such effect on composting processes . )
In any event , Norcal says a future PLA boom wo n’t be a problem because the company hopes to convert its composters to so - called anaerobic digesters , which break down organic material in the absence of oxygen and capture the resulting methane for fuel .
Wild Oats accepts used PLA containers in half of its 80 stores .
“ We mix the PLA with produce and scraps from our juice bars and deliver it to an industrial composting facility , ” says the company ’s Tuitele .
But at the Wild Oats stores that do n’t take back PLA , customers are on their own , and they ca n’t be blamed if they feel deceived by PLA containers stamped “ compostable . ”
Brinton , who has done extensive testing of PLA , says such containers are “ unchanged ” after six months in a home composting operation .
For that reason , he considers the Wild Oats stamp , and their in - store signage touting PLA ’s compostability , to be false advertising .
Wal - Mart ’s Kistler says the company is n’t about to take back used PLA for composting .
“ We ’re not in the business of collecting garbage , ” he says .
“ How do we get states and municipalities to set up composting systems ?
That is the million - dollar question .
It ’s not our role to tell government what to do .
There is money to be made in the recycling business .
As we develop packaging that can be recycled and composted , the industry will be developed . ”
For their part , recycling facilities have problems with PLA too .
They worry that consumers will simply dump PLA in with their PET .
To plastic processors , PLA in tiny amounts is merely a nuisance .
But in large amounts it can be an expensive hassle .
In the recycling business , soda bottles , milk jugs and the like are collected and baled by materials recovery facilities , or MRFs ( pronounced “ murfs ” ) .
The MRFs sell the material to processors , which break down the plastic into pellets or flakes , which are , in turn , made into new products , such as carpeting , fiberfill , or containers for detergent or motor oil .
Because PLA and PET mix about as well as oil and water , recyclers consider PLA a contaminant .
They have to pay to sort it out and pay again to dispose of it .
NatureWorks has given this problem some thought .
“ If the MRF separates the PLA , we ’ll buy it back from them when they ’ve got enough to fill a truck , ” says spokeswoman Bridget Charon .
The company will then either take the PLA to an industrial composter or haul it back to Blair , where the polymer will be broken down and remade into fresh PLA .
Despite PLA ’s potential as an environmentally friendly material , it seems clear that a great deal of corn packaging , probably the majority of it , will end up in landfills .
And there ’s no evidence it will break down there any faster or more thoroughly than PET or any other form of plastic .
Glenn Johnston , manager of global regulatory affairs for NatureWorks , says that a PLA container dumped in a landfill will last “ as long as a PET bottle . ”
No one knows for sure how long that is , but estimates range from 100 to 1,000 years .
Environmentalists have other objections to PLA .
Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute , questions the morality of turning a foodstuff into packaging when so many people in the world are hungry .
“ Already we ’re converting 12 percent of the U.S. grain harvest to ethanol , ” he says .
The USDA projects that figure will rise to 23 percent by 2014 .
“ How much corn do we want to convert to nonfood products ? ”
In addition , most of the corn that NatureWorks uses to make PLA resin is genetically modified to resist pests , and some environmentalists oppose the use of such crops , claiming they will contaminate conventional crops or disrupt local ecosystems .
Other critics point to the steep environmental toll of industrially grown corn .
The cultivation of corn uses more nitrogen fertilizer , more herbicides and more insecticides than any other U.S. crop ; those practices contribute to soil erosion and water pollution when nitrogen runs off fields into streams and rivers .
NatureWorks , acknowledging some of those criticisms , points out that the corn it uses is low - grade animal feed not intended for human use .
And it processes a small amount of non-genetically engineered corn for customers who request it .
NatureWorks is also investigating better ways to segregate PLA in traditional recycling facilities , and it ’s even buying renewable energy certificates ( investments in wind power ) to offset its use of fossil fuels .
But there ’s not much the company can do about the most fundamental question about corn plastic containers :
Are they really necessary ?
A few miles south of Blair , in Fort Calhoun , Wilkinson Industries occupies a sprawling , low brick building in a residential neighborhood .
Wilkinson converts NatureWorks resin into packaging .
In a warehouse - size room , the pellets are melted , pressed into a thin film and stretched into sheets that a thermoformer stamps into rigid containers — square , tall , rectangular or round .
( PLA can also take the shape of labels , electronics casings , wrap for flowers , gift cards , clothing fiber and pillow stuffing . )
“ We ’re shipping trays to Google ’s cafeteria and to [ filmmaker ] George Lucas ’ studio in San Francisco , ” says Joe Selzer , a Wilkinson vice president .
“ We do trays for Del Monte ’s and Meijer stores ’ fresh cut fruit .
And , oh yeah , we do Wal - Mart . ”
PLA amounts to about 20 percent of the plastic products made by Wilkinson .
The rest is polystyrene and PET .
“ We ’d like to see PLA be the resin of the future , but we know it never will be , ” says Selzer .
“ It ’s cost stable , but it ca n’t go above 114 degrees .
I ’ve had people call me and say , ‘ Oh my god , I had my takeout box in my car in the sun and it melted into a pancake ! ’ ”
Bridget Charon , sitting next to me , raises an eyebrow .
Selzer continues .
“ Our number - one concern is PLA ’s competitive price , and then its applications .
After that comes the feel - good . ”
Selzer leads us up a staircase to an interior room the size of a large pantry .
It ’s crammed with samples of the 450 different containers fabricated by Wilkinson , which also stamps out aluminum trays .
“ Here ’s Kentucky Fried Chicken ’s potpie , ” Selzer says , pointing to a small round tin .
“ This plastic tray is for a wedding cake .
This one ’s for crudités .
This is for cut pineapple . ”
( Wilkinson manufactured the original TV dinner tray , a sample of which resides in the Smithsonian Institution . )
As I look around , I ca n’t help thinking that almost all these products will be dumped , after just an hour or two of use , straight into a big hole in the ground .
Martin Bourque , executive director of the Berkeley Ecology Center , a nonprofit recycling organization , holds a dim view of PLA convenience packaging .
“ Yes , corn - based packaging is better than petroleum - based packaging for absolutely necessary plastics that are n’t already successfully recycled , and for packaging that cannot be made of paper , ” he says .
“ But it ’s not as good as asking , ‘ Why are we using so many containers ? ’
My worry is that PLA legitimizes single - serving , over - packaged products . ”
Many ecologists argue that companies should produce consumer goods that do n’t pollute the earth in their manufacture or disposal .
In Cradle to Cradle : Remaking the Way We Make Things , the architect William McDonough writes about a future in which durable goods , like TVs and cars , are made from substances that cycle back into the manufacturing process , while packaging for short - lived products , like shampoo , will decompose back into the earth .
NatureWorks says it wants to be part of that future .
As the company ’s former CEO , Kathleen Bader , told Forbes magazine , “ We ’re offering companies a chance to preempt embarrassing demands for responsible packaging .
Brands that wait for legislative fiat will be left behind and exposed . ”
Eric Lombardi , president of the Grassroots Recycling Network and a leader in the international Zero Waste movement , takes a nuanced view of PLA ’s progress .
He says it ’s “ visionary ” even to think about biologically based plastic instead of a petroleum - based one .
True , he says , there are problems with PLA , “ but let ’s not kill the good in pursuit of the perfect . ”
He suggests that the difficulty disposing of PLA reflects a larger deficiency in how we handle trash .
He ’s calling for a composting revolution .
“ We need a convenient , creative collection system with three bins : one for biodegradables , which we ’ll compost , one for recycling , and one for whatever ’s left . ”
Until such a system is in place , it ’s going to be hard to have cheap convenience packaging and feel good about its environmental effect — to have our takeout cake and eat it too .
But the manufacture of PLA does save oil and generates far less air pollution .
And we have to start somewhere .
Elizabeth Royte , a resident of Brooklyn , is the author of Garbage Land : On the Secret Trail of Trash .
Photographer Brian Smale is based in Seattle .
Last month , this photo was released of an " uncontacted " tribe in the Amazon rain forest .
It 's an amazing photo , but it 's now come out that the tribe had actually been known since 1910 .
The photographer , José Carlos Meirelles , went to where they were thought to live specifically to take their pictures .
Meirelles works for Funai , the Brazillian Indian Protection Agency , and apparently was trying to attract publicity to help protect indigenous people in the area .
Meanwhile , a post on the blog of Survival International , the indigenous rights group which works with Funai , denies that there 's been any wrongdoing on their part at all .
From The Observer :
Survival International , the organisation that released the pictures along with Funai , conceded yesterday that Funai had known about this nomadic tribe for around two decades .
It defended the disturbance of the tribe saying that , since the images had been released , it had forced neighbouring Peru to re-examine its logging policy in the border area where the tribe lives , as a result of the international media attention .
Activist and former Funai president Sydney Possuelo agreed that – amid threats to their environment and doubt over the existence of such tribes – it was necessary to publish them .
But the revelation that the existence of the tribe was already established will provoke awkward questions over why a decision was made to try to photograph them – a form of contact in itself – in order to make a political point .
Link ( Thanks , Sean Ness ! )
From Survival International :
The only people who ever claimed that the Indians photographed were ' lost ' or ' undiscovered ' were ….
the press , despite the fact that Survival has been campaigning for the protection of the many isolated Indian tribes on the Peru - Brazil border for more than twenty years .
Indeed , you might have thought that the fact that the Indians are living in a government reserve set aside for isolated Indian groups would tend to indicate that they were n't exactly ' unknown ' .
For the avoidance of doubt , let 's just make it clear – yes , the tribe is uncontacted , that is to say , has no peaceful contact with outsiders .
But no , they 're not ' lost ' – they know where they are , and anthropologists , Survival , other NGOs and the Brazilian government have known that there are many isolated Indian tribes living in that region for decades .

Although I agree with Barry 's conclusion here -- it was a lack of regulation that led directly to Big shitpile -- I find his premise somewhat curious :
The immediate gains in compensation for all parties involved seemed to totally overwhelm the longer - term concerns of ensuring loans get repaid .
His contention is that there was something irrational in how we got into Big Shitpile .
If all the actors involved were behaving rationally , they would have taken a longer term perspective and not allowed the excesses in the market to pile up .
I do n't see it .
To my mind , the individual actors -- brokers , bankers , appraisers -- the human beings involved -- were acting completely rationally and that 's the root of the problem .
These people all made a shitload of money over the last decade .
And they 're all going to get to keep it .
Mortgage banks may be failing and mortgage backed bonds may be defaulting , but nobody is asking the mortgage bankers to pay anybody back .
There is absolutely no penalty for the people who created Big Shitpile .
The long term perspective -- and the negative consequences we 're seeing now -- affect the institutions , not the people .
The banks are out of business ; the bankers are still sitting on their cash .
And as long as there are no penalies -- serious financial penalties -- involved in being a human agent of a Big Shitpile , there will continue to be Big Shitpiles -- again and again and again ..

Jimmy Page , one of rock 's all - time guitar heroes , is featured on the cover of this month 's Rolling Stone sporting his from way back .
Lindsay Lohan was photographed wearing hers after she checked out of rehab .
And more than 300 golfers in the PGA wear theirs ; 120 championships on the links have been won with them , and many on the tour say it 's all because of the Q - link .
Bruce Fleisher , 2001 U.S. Senior Open Champ said , " The week after I put it on , I won the Senior Open .
Was it luck ?
Absolutely .
Destiny ?
You better believe it . "
There 's more .
" It was amazing .
In the space of a few weeks , the guy pitching the opener of the World Series , Josh Beckett , flying out of his shirt was the Q - Link and then Alex Shabalov , the U.S. chess champ , was wearing it , " said Richard Gray , president and CEO of Clarus Transphase Scientific Inc. , maker of Q - Link .
" In a chess blog , he said he put it on and it helped him to win the tournament . "
Is this just the latest cool object of the hour or is there something to this supposed magical amulet that celebrities and sports figures alike - supposedly Madonna , Sarah Jessica Parker and Anthony Hopkins are on the list - have gone gonzo for ?
The Q - link is a pendant that , adherents claim , increases energy , improves focus and concentration , reduces stress , enhances stamina and endurance , and protects against electromagnetic radiation from cell phones , power lines and computers .
A random pick from the alphabet led to the Q .
Only later did the founders attach meaning to it .
" We started to think about the Q - Link as being the ' Quantum Link , ' " said Gray over the phone from his Larkspur company .
" Quantum means an ' indivisible unit of energy , ' something that supports the notion of the whole or holistic body . "
What started as a funky pendant sold by alternative practitioners at trade shows has evolved into pieces designed by well - known artists in a range of precious metals .
So what about its supposed powers ?
According to Gray , everyone has an energetic field - known as a biofield - a term coined by the National Institutes of Health in 1994 .
" If you put the physical body into states of stress , the biofield goes out of balance , " he said .
" What the Q - link does is resonate sets of natural frequencies with the biofield , returning it to balance . "
He gives an example :
If you hit a tuning fork and hold it near another , the other will start to ring with the same note .
It 's the same principle with the Q - Link and your biofield .
Gray said that the Q - link is powered by a proprietary system he called Sympathetic Resonance Technology , a process of infusing materials with frequency - specific patterns of energy .
Bay Area inventor and musician Robert Williams claims to have created the technology .
He had been studying subtle energy since 1979 and in 1991 co-founded Clarus , a company committed to improving and enhancing quality of life by working with energy fields .
William Tiller , former chair of material science and engineering at Stanford University , was the senior scientist at Clarus for three years until he retired in 1994 .
According to Gray , inside the Q - Link is crystalline matter imbued with frequencies that exist outside of the electromagnetic spectrum .
This realm of subtle energies is a new area of science and controversial because there is no way to prove the energies exist .
" It 's really no different than a yoga teacher talking about balance , " said Gray .
" What 's so interesting is if you look back over the last 20 years at anyone who ever talked about chakras , meridians , 1,000 years ago it was the basis of science . "
Although there has been some independent research on the supposed effects of the Q - Link that are listed on the Clarus Web site , the scientific evidence is scant .
Gray said the company hopes to do more research .
" We can not make any health claims , nor do we , " said Gray , " we 'd be shut down in a second .
The Q - Link operates by interacting with energy systems of the body , not directly on the body .
All we 're doing is providing a clearer pathway between the body 's energy system and physical body itself . "
Golf pro Fleisher got his Q - Link in the late '90s when the company gave the objects to select players on the PGA .
" They show you numbers , your body makeup .
I do n't understand the molecules , the yin -yang , " said Fleisher from his cell phone .
" I do n't understand any of that , but whatever it does , it mellows you out .
It holds you in a neutral pattern of well - being .
I do n't really know how to explain it . "
The company is glad for all the attention it 's received thanks to celebrities who use Q - Link .
" We 've never paid anybody to wear the product , " said Gray .
" We 're happy to have people wearing our products - we 're never quite sure if they 're doing it because it's the latest thing . "
It does n't hurt that two years ago , typeface king Neville Brody designed a Q - link .
" He was fascinated by the technology and he's a visionary , " said Gray , " He offered to help us out .
We do n't tend to be able to afford design fees that Neville charges .
" It 's like the old saying , it 's all about the company you keep . "
But Gray also believes the interest is more than superficial .
" People are understanding that if we look after the energetic , holistic body , that is the way to a more sustainable health , " he said , " That 's why we 're seeing this resurgence - in yoga , meditation - it's all linked to the idea that the energy body performs an important function in every day life . "
He added , " The wellness market is changing .
When I first started 10 years ago , it was enormously disparate - mostly services - alternative health practitioners , yoga studios .
Now what 's changing is there 's a lot more consideration of products .
Clarus is a big part of that .
Wellness is here to stay .
It 's not a fad . "
Pendants cost between $ 100 and $ 1,000 depending on whether you want acrylic or platinum .
New to the mix is a bracelet .
Tom Williams , PR / branding director of Buffalo Communications , which is helping to get the new product into the golf marketplace , says , " It helps that the bracelet looks good .
It 's not just performance and wellness product , it 's a lifestyle product .
For those who want to look good , it works as a fashion and lifestyle accessory . "
Judge rebukes Bush admin on warrantless spying Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008

This A federal judge in California has rejected President Bush 's stated view that he is authorized to ignore the law and institute warrantless surveillance of Americans .
US District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker confirmed that the 30 - year - old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act is the " exclusive " means for domestic intelligence collection .
Walker , chief judge for the Northern District of California , is hearing legal challenges to the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program as well as lawsuits against telecommunications companies AT&T and Verizon .
Walker 's latest finding comes in the case of an Oregon charity that says it was subject to a warrantless NSA wiretap , the New York Times reports .
The Justice Department has tried for more than two years to kill the lawsuit , saying any surveillance of the charity or other entities was a state secret and citing the presidents constitutional power as commander in chief to order wiretaps without a warrant from a court under the agencys program .
But Judge Walker , who was appointed to the bench by former President George Bush , rejected those central claims in his 56 - page ruling .
He said the rules for surveillance were clearly established by Congress in 1978 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires the government to get a warrant from a secret court .
 Congress appears clearly to have intended to  and did  establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence activities to be conducted ,  the judge wrote .
 Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this regard , FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities and it limits the executive branchs authority to assert the state secrets privilege in response to challenges to the legality of its foreign intelligence surveillance activities .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is representing plaintiffs in lawsuits before Walker , praised the decision on its blog .
" The Court rejected the expansive view of executive power promoted by the government , holding that the President 's authorities under Article II of the Constitution do not give him the power to overrule FISA , " wrote EFF 's Kurt Opsahl .
The " bad news , " though , is that Walker ultimately ruled that the charity , Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , ultimately was unable to sufficiently show they were " aggrieved " under FISA .
The judge did allow the group to re-file its case with more information .
EFF said the ruling " undermines " arguments in favor of granting legal immunity to telecommunications companies that are subject to separate lawsuits .
A FISA update bill in the Senate would effectively eliminate those suits .
Walker ruled against a " routine " dismissal of lawsuits based on state secrets privilege .
In a lawsuit against AT&T , EFF is relying on internal company documents -- obtained from a whistle - blower -- it says show the company gave the NSA unfettered access to its networks .
Such documents have not been declared a state secret , so the group says Walker 's ruling could help that case .
Recognizing that a Congressional endorsement of telecom immunity seems inevitable , though , Wired 's David Kravets says the ruling does n't have much impact .
" If the [ FISA ] bill languishes or is scuttled , Walker 's ruling could embolden the EFF 's suit , which is also before Judge Walker , " he writes .
" If the legislation passes , Walker 's ruling is irrelevant insofar as lawsuits targeting telecoms ' alleged complicity with the Bush administration are concerned . "
The Republicans just reintroduced an amendment to the US Constitution that prohibits gay marriage .
This amendment has no chance of passage — the main purpose of reintroducing it is to stir up the conservative base for the upcoming elections .
But the ironic ( and fun ) part is looking at the list of 10 original sponsors , where you find Senators Larry “ wide stance ” Craig ( who was arrested for soliciting gay sex in an airport restroom ) , and Senator David “ just a massage ” Vitter ( who hired prostitutes ) .
These are the people who are trying to uphold the sanctity of marriage ?

Here 's a Moist Towelette do - it - yourself recipe I found on the web !
Food shortages crop up as our energy crisis kicks into high gear and Indians and Chinese decide they , too , want to nosh like Americans .
Meanwhile , Britons waste $ 20 billion , or a third , of their groceries a year ; Americans trash at least 27 % , or a pound of food per person per day .
This , as grocery prices inflate and millions face starvation or malnutrition daily .
( Oh boy , it ’s all the fault of those foreigners again – the nerve , wanting to dine as Americans do ! )
Anyway .
You see a lot about going green in convenient delivery packets : one month to this !
eight weeks to that !
a single page away from carbon neutral !
And those guides , and books , and plans are not just important – they really are vital .
“ What ’s the single most important thing I can do for the planet ? ” , a common question , is an earnest one .
Repeated actions form habits , and habits create lifestyle .
By all means , test those tips , climb those steps : chip away we must .
I ’m doing them right along with you .
But before any of us does another thing in hopes of it being the thing , let ’s just take a moment to consider the mindset of the over - shopping culture to which we belong .
The fact that every third or fourth bag of food we buy goes into the garbage as our global neighbors starve and fellow citizens charge their groceries to Chevron is not just – well – stupid , it ’s surreal .
As my friend , Carrie , would say , “ Really ? ! ? ”
Our food has been so plentiful and so cheap for so long , we ’ve forgotten how to shop !
My pronoun choice in the headline is not about shame and it ’s not about guilt – for me , it ’s about proactive ownership of a problem ( call me a control freak ) .
If you want to live greener , if you want to help others , if you want to have an impact upon the current interrelated problems we collectively face , here ’s the thing : simply start with your next grocery basket .
So let ’s relearn shopping .
Here are 6 ( you knew this was coming ) tips to start :
1. I ’m making a list .
Even if it ’s just toilet paper and tonic water , make a list and stick to it .
Impulse purchases are rarely necessary .
2. And …I ’m checking it twice .
The goal is conscious consumption , so be sure the items on the list are necessities .
This concept might seem distasteful at first ; we ’re so accustomed to buying snacks and extras on the slightest whim .
Our grandparents grew Victory gardens ( I think within two years we will be doing this again ) ; my Baby Boomer mother scrapes the peanut butter from the jar because that ’s what her mother , who lived through the Depression , taught her to do .
In decades since we ’ve learned to label these actions as “ frugal ” , and we need to unlearn this yesterday , because they ’re actually generous .
To paraphrase Suze Orman , true generosity – with yourself and others – means doing the right thing at the right time in the right measure .
So be generous , and double - check .
3 . It ’s not just what ; it ’s how much .
One of our most popular articles shares tofu - free tips for vegetarian dining .
Most of us know that cutting our meat consumption , even one day a week , can significantly help the planet .
But it ’s not just what we eat – it ’s how much .
We buy too much ; we ’re served too much ; we munch too much .
School yourself .
Relearn shopping : when you get to the check out line , stop and put 1 / 4 of your items back .
If you ’re shopping the way most folks do , you wo n’t eat them .
When you ’re dining out , ask for a half portion or split the entree with your date .
( Feed him a bite or two and he ’ll forget to complain . )
Rework the old diet trick of leaving two unfinished bites on your plate and take a smaller portion to begin with .
I can never manage this , so I use smaller plates .
4 . True numbers .
We do n’t just consume over a pound every day ; we Westerners also waste a pound a day .
That ’s two pounds more impact than any Red tank top could ever hope for .
Relearning grocery shopping starts with knowing the right numbers .
5. Compost .
This one is easy – and can be fun .
Even if you do n’t grow anything , I guarantee your green thumb neighbor or relative will be happy to take your scraps .
6 . Eat the ugly apple .
Going local , buying CSA , choosing organic – there ’s a whole host of greener , tastier , cheaper , better options .
Start by checking out the farmers ’ market this weekend and go ahead – eat that ugly apple .
This is n’t just “ for the planet ” – it ’s to make you more aware of what you buy .
I used to waste whole bags of wilted veggies on a weekly basis until I switched over to shopping at the farmers ’ market .
It takes a little more time and effort to go to the market and I end up thinking a lot more about my purchases .
Even though they tend to be cheaper than the store , I do n’t want to waste them because that means wasted time , which I ca n’t stand .
There are so many ways to ace your grocery shopping – from joining a CSA to choosing better meat to cutting down on your grocery bill .
Start learning !

Engaging Creationists : A Conspiracy of Dunces and Trolls
I love a good debate .
When you have two capable groups discussing all sides of an issue , it can illuminate areas of perspective never before considered ; yield new insights and break through the wall of ignorance and prejudice .
Usually a debate has the objective of seeking truth by performing an autopsy on an issue , stripping away the skin , pushing aside non-essential organs and identifying the causes and effects .
If " Sandra the Astrologer " , a new - age 50 - something living in Oregon who publishes a web site offering peoples star charts and horoscopes , requested a debate with M.I.T. professor Stephen Hawking on the nature of the universe , would she have a chance of participating in such a roundtable ?
If Bob , the likable New Mexico - native , Lithium - prescribed master storyteller of tales of his alien abduction and subsequent visit to the planet Zircon , wanted to debate NASA chief Michael Griffin , who holds multiple PhDs and other degrees in everything from electrical engineering and applied physics to aerospace engineering , what is the likelihood of this event transpiring ?
So why then would someone like Kent Hovind , a fundamentalist evangelical preacher with a minimal flock of followers , whose education primarily consists of a degree in " religious education " from a now - defunct unaccredited diploma mill be able to sit down and contain a long string of prominent and respected scientists and mainstream educators on various television and radio appearances ?
And why is there a seemingly endless stream of religious and politically - motivated , yet specifically uneducated " expert pundits " parading around online and in mainstream media taking on some of the world 's most respected and capable scientists and educators ?
Yes , it 's funny and amusing .
It was funny and amusing , the first hundred times news of creationists having the audacity to challenge atheists that they could prove God exists using their own logic .
It was even more amusing the first hundred times a respected scientist engaged an uneducated , layperson , religious figure over the nature of space , time , history , biology , chemistry , genetics , archeology and evolution .
Like watching a six - year - old using a set of Legos to show Werner Von Braun the proper way to make a rocket ship .
Now it does n't seem as amusing .
It seems kind of sad , and more importantly , it seems like many respected scientists are falling for a trap set by evangelicals designed to give their irrational claims an air of respectability .
Respected scientists and other freethinkers are getting trapped and exploited to achieve the opposite of what they intend .
They 're not introducing the rational , scientific side of an issue .
They are pawns in a game .
They are the intellectual equivalent of Pavlov 's Dog .
They are serving as examples for fundamentalists to cite the legitimacy of their religious campaigns by means of " controversy . "
The virus of superstition and mythology , which previously could only sit outside the science building and make squeaking noises that were mostly ignored , has now walked in the front door and into the classroom of many science curriculums across the country , not because it is a viable " alternative " to existing theories that have held up to centuries of scientific scrutiny , but instead because of an implication that these faith - based ideas are credible because so many respected scientists feel inclined to discuss them , hence the " controversy " is substituted for actual evidence , and the trolls win .
Here 's what Richard Dawkins has to say about the issue :
Sometime in the 1980s when I was on a visit to the United States , a television station wanted to stage a debate between me and a prominent creationist called , I think , Duane P Gish .
I telephoned Stephen Gould for advice .
He was friendly and decisive : " Do n't do it . "
The point is not , he said , whether or not you would " win " the debate .
Winning is not what the creationists realistically aspire to .
For them , it is sufficient that the debate happens at all .
They need the publicity .
We do n't .
To the gullible public that is their natural constituency , it is enough that their man is seen sharing a platform with a real scientist .
" There must be something in creationism , or Dr. So-and - So would not have agreed to debate it on equal terms . "
Inevitably , when you turn down the invitation , you will be accused of cowardice or of inability to defend your own beliefs .
But that is better than supplying the creationists with what they crave : the oxygen of respectability in the world of real science .
I could n't agree more .
Giving any attention to creationists is like sharing the stage with KKK members or Nazis .
They had their time in the sun .
It 's over .
We 're not learning anything new from them .
They just need attention and publicity and they 'll troll anyone and everyone to get it .
Their presence and influence in society should be beneath the margin of common sense .
Any time one of us engages them , we elevate their ridiculous , illogical agenda .
It 's not worth it .
So even if you win the debate every single time , which is n't surprising , you make their side stronger and create the illusion that the battle is tough and worth fighting on both sides .
And you lose the war .
A scientist 's perspective on the notion of debating a creationist
A professor at the University of Vermont , Nicholas Gotelli , got an invitation to debate one of the clowns at the Discovery Institute .
Here 's what they wrote .
Dear Professor Gotelli , I saw your op - ed in the Burlington Free Press and appreciated your support of free speech at UVM .
In light of that , I wonder if you would be open to finding a way to provide a campus forum for a debate about evolutionary science and intelligent design .
The Discovery Institute , where I work , has a local sponsor in Burlington who is enthusiastic to find a way to make this happen .
But we need a partner on campus .
If not the biology department , then perhaps you can suggest an alternative .
Ben Stein may not be the best person to single - handedly represent the ID side .
As you 're aware , he 's known mainly as an entertainer .
A more appropriate alternative or addition might be our senior fellows David Berlinski or Stephen Meyer , respectively a mathematician and a philosopher of science .
I 'll copy links to their bios below .
Wherever one comes down in the Darwin debate , I think we can all agree that it is healthy for students to be exposed to different views -- in precisely the spirit of inviting controversial speakers to campus , as you write in your op - ed .
I 'm hoping that you would be willing to give a critique of ID at such an event , and participate in the debate in whatever role you feel comfortable with .
A good scientific backdrop to the discussion might be Dr. Meyer 's book that comes out in June from HarperCollins , " Signature in the Cell : DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design . "
On the other hand , Dr. Belinski may be a good choice since he is a critic of both ID and Darwinian theory .
Would it be possible for us to talk more about this by phone sometime soon ?
With best wishes , David Klinghoffer Discovery Institute
You 'll enjoy Dr Gotelli 's response .
Dear Dr. Klinghoffer :
Thank you for this interesting and courteous invitation to set up a debate about evolution and creationism ( which includes its more recent relabeling as " intelligent design " ) with a speaker from the Discovery Institute .
Your invitation is quite surprising , given the sneering coverage of my recent newspaper editorial that you yourself posted on the Discovery Institute 's website : http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/ " rel= " nofollow " title= " " >
http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/
However , this kind of two - faced dishonesty is what the scientific community has come to expect from the creationists .
Academic debate on controversial topics is fine , but those topics need to have a basis in reality .
I would not invite a creationist to a debate on campus for the same reason that I would not invite an alchemist , a flat - earther , an astrologer , a psychic , or a Holocaust revisionist .
These ideas have no scientific support , and that is why they have all been discarded by credible scholars .
Creationism is in the same category .
Instead of spending time on public debates , why are n't members of your institute publishing their ideas in prominent peer - reviewed journals such as Science , Nature , or the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ?
If you want to be taken seriously by scientists and scholars , this is where you need to publish .
Academic publishing is an intellectual free market , where ideas that have credible empirical support are carefully and thoroughly explored .
Nothing could possibly be more exciting and electrifying to biology than scientific disproof of evolutionary theory or scientific proof of the existence of a god .
That would be Nobel Prize winning work , and it would be eagerly published by any of the prominent mainstream journals .
" Conspiracy " is the predictable response by Ben Stein and the frustrated creationists .
But conspiracy theories are a joke , because science places a high premium on intellectual honesty and on new empirical studies that overturn previously established principles .
Creationism does n't live up to these standards , so its proponents are relegated to the sidelines , publishing in books , blogs , websites , and obscure journals that do n't maintain scientific standards .
Finally , is n't it sort of pathetic that your large , well - funded institute must scrape around , panhandling for a seminar invitation at a little university in northern New England ?
Practicing scientists receive frequent invitations to speak in science departments around the world , often on controversial and novel topics .
If creationists actually published some legitimate science , they would receive such invitations as well .
So , I hope you understand why I am declining your offer .
I will wait patiently to read about the work of creationists in the pages of Nature and Science .
But until it appears there , it is n't science and does n't merit an invitation .
In closing , I do want to thank you sincerely for this invitation and for your posting on the Discovery Institute Website .
As an evolutionary biologist , I can't tell you what a badge of honor this is .
My colleagues will be envious .
Sincerely yours , Nick Gotelli P.S.
I hope you will forgive me if I do not respond to any further e-mails from you or from the Discovery Institute .
This has been entertaining , but it interferes with my research and teaching .

The Vatican received almost $ 80 m worth of offerings in 2007
The Vatican made a loss last year as the weaker dollar reduced the value of donations from the faithful in the United States .
Almost a quarter of the $ 79.8 m ( £ 40.4 m ) worth of offerings it received came from collections made in US churches .
But as the dollar lost 15 % of its value against the euro , the Catholic Church 's governing body made a loss of 9.1 m euros ( £ 7.3 m : $ 14.3 m ) in 2007 .
That was despite receiving a single anonymous donation of $ 14.3 m .
CHURCH OFFERINGS TO VATICAN United States : $ 18.7 m Italy : $ 8.6 m Germany $ 4 m Spain : $ 2.7 m France : $ 2.4 m Ireland : $ 2.2 m Brazil : $ 1.4 m South Korea : $ 1.1 m Source : Vatican
In a statement it said that it had been affected " primarily to the sudden and noticeable inversion of the previous trends in exchange rates , most noticeably the US dollar " .
Its latest accounts show that the Vatican made 236.7 m euros in 2007 compared with outgoings of 245.8 m euros .
After the US , the largest offerings - which it quotes in dollars - came from Italy , where churchgoers gave $ 8.6 m directly to the Vatican last year and Germany , where the faithful gave $ 4 m .
Vatican TV
The Vatican also generated revenue from a number of other sources last year , including the 4.3 million visitors to its museums , including the Sistine Chapel .
The Vatican Television Centre , which broadcasts the Pope 's regular audiences in St Peter 's Square and reports on his visits abroad , made a profit of almost 500,000 euros , while the Vatican Publishing House ended the year with a surplus of 1.6 m euros .
But Vatican Radio and the Vatican newspaper together made a loss of 14.6 m euros .
The Vatican first revealed its accounts in 1981 under Pope John Paul II to challenge the prevailing idea that it was rich .

' Shut up ' : First presidential debate begins
Posted
Fireworks between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at the first presidential debate in Cleveland , Ohio on Tuesday , as the two struggled to answer a question about a Supreme Court replacement .
The problem is " spoilt little princes and princesses , " who are influenced by a " materialistic society " and a " culture of immediacy " , says the National Association of Schoolmasters , Union Of Women Teachers ( NASUWT ) .
The problem is " incidents increasingly concentrated in a handful of schools serving disadvantaged areas , " suggests the National Union of Teachers ( NUT ) .
The problem is pupils with " deep - seated problems " who are being " failed by social workers , " argues the Association of Teachers and Lecturers ( ATL ) .
The main teaching unions , at their Easter conferences , may have expressed their worries in slightly different ways .
But all are concerned about pupil behaviour , some of it low - level but disruptive to the rest of the class , and a small , but increasing proportion of it extremely serious , involving drugs , knives or guns .
All the unions are concerned , too , at the lack of back - up that teachers often receive when they contact the parents of a misbehaving pupil .
As well they should be .
Without support at home , there is very little that teachers can do to curb poor classroom behaviour .
Sometimes the parents sound no more mature than the children .
One teacher called the mother of a boy who had applied shaving foam to his face in class , for the amusement of his fellow pupils .
The teacher was told in no uncertain terms that the child could not possibly be held accountable because the boy who had brought the foam into school was the real culprit .
The call took place within earshot of the child who had caused the trouble .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Another , who threatened a girl who would not stop talking in class with a call to her mother was told : " Call her then .
She 's slapped three teachers already . "
The teacher then spoke to the mother , and listened with feigned sympathy as she related the trio of incidents that had ended in violence .
By the end of the conversation , the mother agreed that none of this was helping her daughter , and that she , too , did not know what to do with her , because she could n't prevail upon the teenager to obey instructions either .
The teachers who describe such incidents emphasise that these pupils do not come from materially underprivileged backgrounds .
Echoing the observations made at this week 's NASUWT conference , about little princes and princesses , they say that family hostility to education often comes from households who have achieved some affluence without being well - educated themselves .
They have their own tales of woe , about how their teachers told them that they would never amount to anything , and how their success has proved their former tormentors wrong .
They distrust and despise teachers themselves , and see them as losers and mugs .
These families have jettisoned the idea of education as a route out of poverty , and their influences can be seen in the anti-learning attitudes that are common among many school children , and can seem almost contagious even in primary schools .
One listens to these tales of frustration in the classroom with a sinking heart .
What could possibly motivate professional people to put up with such behaviour , from children and from adults ?
A large proportion of teachers continue to train , teach for a time , and then give up the profession .
It is easy to see why .
Attempting to teach people when their entire families are hostile to education must be a nightmare .
But when the NUT calls for " more support from parents on discipline " , it is hard to work out exactly how this can really be achieved , given the prejudices of the parents most likely to send their children to school with poor attitudes .
Some of the methods suggested by the unions in the last week have been disturbing .
The ATL , traditionally the most moderate of the teaching unions , has agreed that all children who have reached the age of criminal responsibility – which in England and Wales is , grotesquely , just 10 – must be prosecuted if they assault a teacher .
While it is easy to understand that this demand is born of frustration , it is still deeply worrying that schools should be so willing to provide a conduit into the criminal justice system .
A pupil who assaults a teacher , almost by definition , is one who has " deep - rooted problems " .
The criminal justice system has a far from unblemished record on either dealing with these problems or with setting children back on the educational straight and narrow .
There is no alternative for pupils this troublesome , at the moment , except pupil referral units .
Yet the NUT , the biggest and most powerful teaching union , has at this year 's conference made explicit once again its opposition to " sin-bin " schools .
Do schools specialising in children with behavioural problems have to be " sin-bins " , as so many presently are ?
Or could they not simply be schools that embrace firmly the measures the NUT is lobbying for at all schools : small class sizes ; more freedom from the curriculum ; and more support from parents on discipline ( with staff on site whose job it is to work with problem families ) ?
Is it really fair to make inclusion in the mainstream such a priority that teachers and co-operative pupils have to struggle on until transgressions are of criminal proportions ?
The difficulty here is that the vast majority of parents and the vast majority of teachers want smaller class sizes for all pupils .
Sin-bin schools are seen by educationalists , rightly , as a bad idea .
But rewarding families for their lack of commitment to education with privileges that almost everyone wants is seen as being vastly problematic too ( although the Government has gone some of the way down this path with its proposals for small " studio schools " ) .
Class size is so high on the agenda of teachers at the moment that the NUT has threatened to strike if the Government does not renew its early commitment to driving class sizes down .
Both research and common sense attest that even a small reduction in class size has a positive effect on discipline and behaviour , even though it also seems incontrovertible that dramatic reductions in class sizes need to be achieved before real academic advantage is gained ( research shows that there is not big step - change in pupil achievement until classes are of 15 or smaller , as they usually are in independent schools ) .
The infrastructural problems involved in attaining such a target overnight are phenomenal , and the cost , as the Government clearly discovered early on , is prohibitive .
Yet it must surely be possible for reductions in class sizes to be achieved gradually , from the bottom up , with the schools experiencing the most severe behavioural difficulties – and presumably therefore the ones most likely to be undersubscribed – being given priority .
Many schools are de facto sin-bins anyway , not only because they are in deprived areas , but because even the more affluent parents they attract are the ones who consider education unimportant .
The Government , in the last Budget , pledged to concentrate spending on such schools .
Bringing class sizes right down in these would be an excellent way of focusing that commitment .

Americans consider happiness more important to them than money , moral goodness , and even going to Heaven .
Americans are , on average , only 69 percent happy .
The world population is , on average , less than 65 percent happy .
37 percent of the people on Forbes list of Wealthiest Americans are less happy than the average American .
At any given time , one forth of Americans are mildly depressed
14 percent of the nations on Earth are less than 50 percent happy .
Happiness Increase Experiments published in peer review journal have empirically demonstrated that individuals can be trained to be 25 percent happier through various training programs in from two to ten weeks .
All demographic variables combined , including age , sex , income , race , and education , are responsible for only 15 percent of the difference in happiness levels between individuals .
American Children feel happy 52 percent of the time , neutral 29 percent of the time , and unhappy 19 percent of the time .
Americans ' personal income has increased more than 2 1 / 2 times over the last 50 years , but their happiness level has remained the same .
It all started in 2006 , when the county asked for proposals to replace the heating systems and Honeywell was the only company to respond .
Honeywell also offered to pay for the difference if its cost - saving estimates were incorrect .

Even if the price is not better , Mr. Rhoades said , an anthracite company should get the county contract if it is close to competitive , to ensure that the jobs , taxes and heritage stay in the county .
He declined , however , to set a number on how “ close ” the anthracite bid should be .
Mr. Rhoades said it would not be the first time the county had considered local culture in making financial decisions .
He cited the recent sale of a historic building to Pennsylvania State University , rather than to the highest bidder , because the university could better preserve the building ’s history .
Nearly all of the nation ’s anthracite deposits are in eight counties in eastern Pennsylvania between the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers .
The coal is prized because it burns longer and produces less acid-rain pollutants since it has a high carbon and low sulfur content .
But what makes this brittle and lustrous rock , often known as black diamond , so hard and pure is that it is often deeper and under greater pressure than other forms of coal , which also explains why it is expensive and dangerous to extract .
The anthracite mines in this area have seen more than 30,000 deaths since 1870 , and were the site of the great anthracite strike of 1902 , which propelled the United Mine Workers of America to ascendancy and required the intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt as most of the East Coast ’s major cities were on the brink of losing heat .

We just got our most recent copy of CQ Weekly , and it has an interesting section on broadband access .
It ’s clearly written for an audience that lacks tech savvy ( section header : “ What is broadband and how many people have it ? ” ) , but it has some really interesting stats on how far America has fallen behind as an international leader on high - speed internet .

We do equally poorly in terms of broadband speed .
Here are the average broadband download speeds ( Mbps ) of 15 developed nations :
1 Japan 93.7 2 France 44.2 3 South Korea 43.3 4 Sweden 21.4 5 New Zealand 13.6 6 Italy 13.1 7 Finland 13.0 8 Portugal 13.0 9 Australia 12.1 10 Norway 11.8 11 Luxembourg 10.7 12 United Kingdom 10.6 13 Germany 9.2 14 United States 8.9 15 Canada 7.8
Clearly , Japan is killing the game and the United States has a lot of catching up to do .
The fact that American broadband is so slow is compounded by the fact that it ’s expensive .
According to CQ , the United States ranks 22nd out of 25 countries in terms of the affordability of broadband .
The average monthly price of broadband in the States is $ 53.06 .
It ’s cheaper in Turkey .
It ’s much cheaper in Japan , where a month of hi-speed runs $ 34.21 .
And it ’s cheapest in Finland , where it costs $ 31.18 .
We ’re falling behind as a country .
And because the American economy has transitioned and continues to transition from a manufacturing economy to an information economy , more and more people will be left out of America ’s next phases unless consistent and affordable hi-speed comes to rural and urban areas .
That ’s why many consider it important that we have a president that understands technology and has a strong technology platform .
Much more on that later today …

Chronicling The Controversial , Historic And Often Bizarre Events Of The Dark Times In Which We Live
The federal government 's seizure of IndyMac Bank is deepening worries among executives , regulators and consumers about the U.S. banking industry , which is in a tightening bind following a long run of prosperity .
Banks and thrifts are struggling against a rising tide of bad loans , and it is becoming increasingly clear that some lenders wo n't be able to escape .
While fewer banks are expected to fail than the 834 that went under from 1990 to 1992 , it will likely take several years for battered financial institutions to work through their bad loans and replenish their depleted capital .
Those gloomy scenarios could be avoided , however , if the U.S. economy and housing market rebound soon , which would help consumers and businesses that have fallen behind on their loan payments .
Even signs that the worst is over could bolster the confidence of healthier banks enough to spark a flurry of takeovers that would rid the industry of some of its weakest performers .
But at least for now , as the turmoil worsens , signs are emerging that consumers , who generally thought little about the safety of their deposits when times were good , are having some second thoughts .
More likely than the kind of exodus of depositors that quickly sank IndyMac is what some bankers are describing as a slow - motion " walk on the bank , " which could cripple financial institutions already weakened by credit problems .
Connecticut Man Says Cops Broke Into His Home and Ripped Out His Catheter
Friday , May 09 , 2008

HARTFORD , Conn . —
Andrew Glover , 60 , of New Britain filed a notice with the city Thursday that he intends to pursue a federal civil rights lawsuit .
He accused the officers of inflicting severe injuries as he was recovering from intestinal surgery in February .
Glover 's lawyer , Paul Spinella , said police entered Glover 's apartment Jan. 30 and Feb. 28 .
Glover was n't involved in child pornography , has not been charged and has no criminal record , Spinella said .
" The poor guy , " Spinella said .
" They ripped the catheter off his person .
They assaulted the guy .
He 's got major problems as a result of this .
He 's a mess now . "
Lt. James Wardwell , a police spokesman , said Friday that the department had not received the intent - to - sue notice and would not comment .
A message was left for the city 's corporation counsel .
Glover has two years to file a lawsuit in U.S. District Court .
Spinella said officers " tossed " Glover 's apartment during a search Jan. 30 .
In February , he said , Glover returned home from the hospital after his surgery to find officers searching his apartment again .
That 's when they assaulted Glover and left him alone in the apartment without calling for medical help , Spinella said .
The police did n't have search warrants , Spinella said .
Glover 's neighbors — Harold Spurling and Jeffrey Brisson — were charged Jan. 30 with sexual assault and other crimes .
They are accused of molesting children , including a 3 - month - old girl found in their apartment , and making movies involving child pornography .
Both men have pleaded not guilty and are being held in lieu of bail .

Carl C. Icahn , the billionaire investor and activist shareholder , has decided to move ahead with plans for a proxy fight at Yahoo and will propose a dissident slate of directors , people with knowledge of the plans said Wednesday .
Mr. Icahn , who has told associates that he has bought as many as 50 million shares of Yahoo , is leaning toward trying to oust the entire board by proposing a slate of 10 candidates , these people said .
The deadline for nominating a dissident slate is Thursday .
He is moving ahead with the proxy fight in hopes of pushing Yahoo to restart talks to sell itself to Microsoft .
Yet Microsoft has given no indication that it would be willing to restart talks .
Mr. Icahn ’s decision to try to oust the entire board  as opposed to proposing only a couple of candidates  is considered a high - risk maneuver , analysts said .
He might have a better chance of winning a campaign by proposing a smaller slate , several analysts added .
Under the proxy rules , Mr. Icahn can reduce his slate later , but had he nominated a smaller number of candidates he would not be allowed to increase it .
If you swallow this gum , how long will it really stay in your stomach ?
Steve Wisbauer / Photodisc / Getty Images
Surely you were warned , most likely by your mother :
You should n't swallow gum , because it stays in your digestive system for seven years .
But if that were true , what kind of havoc would that wreak ?
Our digestive system is built to dissolve and excrete what we put in our mouths in a matter of hours , days at most , but certainly ­not years .
The urban legend reference Web site Snopes.com put the kibosh on the rumor that gum stays in you for years , and medical science confirms the site 's conclusion .
Pediatric gastroenterologist David Milov tells the magazine Scientific American that he can say " with complete certainty " that gum does not stay in you for seven years [ source : Scientific American ] .

This is due to the effectiveness of your digestive system .
When you swallow food , it travels down your esophagus into your stomach .
Here enzymes and acids go to work on the food , beginning the process of breaking the food down .
From the stomach , the partially digested food is moved into the intestine , where -- with help from your liver and pancreas -- the food is broken down into its components .
These components are used to fuel the body .
Those elements of food that can't be used are sent to the colon , where they 'll be processed into waste .
Generally , gum is made up of four general components , and our bodies can easily break down three of these .
The gum 's flavorings , sweeteners and softeners are all no match for human digestion .
It 's the gum base that sticks around .
Gum base is made mostly of synthetic chemicals , and these chemicals give gum its chewy property .
It 's designed to resist the digestive properties of the saliva in your mouth .
But once it 's swallowed , even the gum base is subjected to the same treatment as regular food , and after it 's recognized as useless by your digestive system , it goes the same route as any waste product .
Chewing gum began as early as 7,000 years ago -- researchers have found lumps of tar with human teeth marks in them .
Modern gum got its start during the 1860s , when exiled Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ( who captured the Alamo in March 1836 ) introduced chicle to gum maker Thomas Adams , who then made it into gum .
But the origin of the gum - swallowing legend is much less clear .
Despite the evidence lent by the continued healthy existence of those who swallow gum , this rumor persists .
Perhaps that 's because , every once in a blue moon , a medical case resulting from swallowed gum turns up .
David Milov and colleagues wrote in the journal Pediatrics about a few case studies of kids who had ignored admonishments against swallowing gum -- and paid for it .
One boy suffered from two years of chronic constipation .
Years of swallowing five to seven pieces of gum each day led to a " ' taffy - like ' trail of fecal material " consisting mostly of gum , which had to be suctioned out of his rectum [ source : Milov ] .
But gum still does n't stay in your digestive system for seven years .
The boy who had the " ' taffy - like ' trail " was just 4 when he underwent the removal procedure .
It 's possible that the gum might have remained in his tract for seven years , but intervention by physicians circumvented that .
So while he will always be a walking footnote in support of the fears of mothers everywhere , the seven - year mark remains elusive .
And that 's probably a good thing .
A breakdown in London 's Oyster card network left tens of thousands of bus and train passengers needing replacement cards today .
With long queues forming at ticket offices , some passengers were allowed to travel free to minimise disruption .
About 65,000 people had their cards corrupted when they swiped during problems with the system on Saturday .
People who topped up their credit also found their cards no longer worked .
More than 30,000 of the affected Oyster cards had been replaced by lunchtime today .
Those yet to swap their card are being asked to do so as soon as possible .
A Transport for London ( TfL ) spokesman said : " The vast majority of passengers have travelled without any disruption this morning and London Underground ( LU ) staff have minimised the delay to passengers with cards that are not working .
" Less than 1 % of the six million regular Oyster card users required replacement cards after the incident on Saturday morning .
" We are replacing affected cards and there are now less than 35,000 cards that need to be replaced .
" If this has not been practical during this morning , LU staff , and London bus drivers , have allowed these passengers to travel .
" Ticket offices are well stocked and we advise those passengers who have not yet replaced their cards to go to their nearest LU ticket office throughout today . "
Some people were wrongly charged the maximum journey fare because the system failure meant they could not swipe out when they finished travelling on Saturday .
The spokesman said anyone who paid the maximum fare on Saturday will have the sum credited back on to their card next time they swipe at their regular station .
" They do n't have to do anything , " he said .
" That will automatically be credited back to their card . "
He admitted some people will get a refund even though they rightly paid the maximum fare but added that the " vast majority of people will have been caught up in this problem " .
He added that the TfL and Oyster provider , TranSys , has launched an investigation to find out what caused the problem .

In a statement from his office today , Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) announced that he has notified the Barack Obama campaign that he intends to remain in the Senate , and he does not want to be considered as a running mate for Obama .
“ Last week I communicated to Senator Obama and his presidential campaign my firm intention to remain in the United States Senate , where I believe I am best equipped to serve the people of Virginia and this country .
Under no circumstances will I be a candidate for Vice President , ” Webb said .
He said that he is convinced that his goals would be best served by staying in the Senate , “ A year and a half ago , the people of Virginia honored me with election to the U.S. Senate .
I entered elective politics because of my commitment to strengthen America ’s national security posture , to promote economic fairness , and to increase government accountability .
I have worked hard to deliver upon that commitment , and I am convinced that my efforts and talents toward those ends are best served in the Senate . ”

Webb pledged to work hard for Obama in Virginia , “ At this time I am also renewing my commitment to work hard to make sure that Senator Obama wins both Virginia and the presidency this November .
He is a man who speaks eloquently about our national goals and calls for the practical solutions that must be put into place to obtain them .
I will proudly campaign for him . ”
This is not much of a surprise really .
Webb has been saying for months that he did n’t want the job .
My guess is that he has his eye on a run at the White House of his own on down the road .
He was probably in Obama ’s top 10 , but he is n’t the most popular Democrat in Virginia , and he brings inexperience questions with him too , so he probably was not going to be selected as Obama ’s VP anyway .
I think Obama will end up selecting a more experienced Democrat to be his running mate .
Webb Statement
I just returned from a week - long trip during which I made frequent use of both free and paid Wi -Fi hotspots .
One thing I noticed in my travels was that in virtually every venue where I sought wireless access , at least one network had an SSID of " Free Public Wi- Fi " or a similar name .
I came across such networks in two airports , a convention center , a hotel lobby and a Starbucks .
I had no idea free Wi-Fi was so ubiquitous  problem is , it 's not .
On closer inspection I realized that in each case the network purporting to be offering free Wi-Fi was n't an infrastructure mode network , but rather was one running in ad - hoc mode , which meant that in all likelihood it was there to lure unsuspecting users into connecting to it for some nefarious purpose .
For the unfamiliar , ad - hoc mode is a lesser - known and relatively little - used Wi-Fi capability that enables two or more wireless clients to set up a peer network without an access point .
This differs from the far more common infrastructure mode , in which clients connect to an access point instead of directly to each other .
Ad - hoc networks are generally used for specific and often temporary purposes ( e.g. , to directly transfer a file or play a LAN - based game ) , but seldom are they used to provide Internet access to other computers .
Knowing the Difference
So how can you tell an ad - hoc network from an infrastructure one ?
Pay close attention to the icons displayed when selecting from a list of available networks .
In XP , for example , an infrastructure mode network shows an antenna icon , while the icon for an ad - hoc network is a pair of laptops .
In Vista , an infrastructure network 's icon resembles a pair of linked computers ; for an ad - hoc network , it 's three computers arranged like a triangle .
Once you know better than to connect to an ad - hoc network , you may still need to make sure your system does n't automatically do it for you .
Windows Vista will never connect to an ad - hoc network automatically ; XP might , depending on how it 's configured .
To prevent this from happening :
Click the wireless networking icon in the system tray and select View Available Wireless Networks Under Related Tasks , click Change the Order of Preferred Networks Click the Advanced button and select Access Point ( Infrastructure ) Networks Only
To make sure Windows connects only to specified networks , irrespective of type , make sure the box next to Automatically Connect to Non-preferred Networks is clear .
Lest I paint with too broad a brush , I 'm not suggesting an ad - hoc wireless network can't possibly be a legitimate hotspot or a source of Internet access under any circumstances .
Generally speaking , if you come across an ad - hoc network in a public place  especially one with an alluring name that contains the word " free "  you should definitely be wary , and preferably avoid it altogether .
Should you mistakenly connect to a questionable ad - hoc network , you 'll probably realize it soon enough when you do n't get the Internet access you were expecting .
Nevertheless , a momentary connection may be all someone needs to scan your system for personal information or infect it with some kind of malware .
And even if someone is delivering the Net over an ad - hoc network , it does n't mean the person 's intentions are honorable , since it 's a simple matter to provide Internet access by bridging an ad - hoc network with a cellular or other Wi -Fi connection .
In fact , this is even more dangerous since it gives someone the opportunity to capture all of your network traffic .
Of course , it 's important to remember that even bona - fide hotspots are public networks and using them entails risk .
Therefore , regardless of what kind of wireless network you connect to , it 's always a good idea to use a firewall that switches to a more secure mode whenever you 're on anything other than your home network .

Fancy meeting you here ...
An attractive older woman such as yourself , wearing that skirt , and walking alone at night in the gorilla part of town ?
What am I to think ?
No , no , you have n't offended me .
It 's quite alright .
Yes , I would be happy to beat you senseless and then rape you , but you need to understand that this is not how things are normally done .
It 's alright , ma'am .
You do not need to seek out such tawdry release from your unfulfilling marriage .
Here , allow me to give you my card .
That way you can call on me at any time rather than trawling these uncouth streets in search of illicit pleasures .
It 's OK , do n't be ashamed .
There is nothing to be ashamed of here , my sweet .
Before we begin , I must ask you , are you certain this is what you want ?
It 's purely a formality , I 'm sure you understand , but I prefer all of my vicious rapes to be consensual .
Also , I need you to sign this form acknowledging that I explained I am a gorilla .
This is in case you later decide you would have preferred rape from a gibbon , chimpanzee , or orangutan .
Differences ?
Oh , well the gibbon prefers to use impliments during the beating .
Improvised weapons , pots and pans , tree branches , whatever is handy .
Chimps prefer horrific biting of the genitals and face .
Some women like it rough , I understand , but I thought nearly all women enjoyed having noses .
Orangutans are very gentle during the beatings , but they , well , I do n't like to talk about it , but they tend to mess themselves during the rape portion .
No , no , I am a gorilla , ma'am .
We never mess ourselves .
This is a straightforward stove - your - head - in - and - rape - both - holes style assault .
Legally , I can't guarantee your satisfaction , but I will say : satisfaction , highly probable .
Do you have any questions ?
Absolutely not .
In over 700 rapes I have never once made a woman pregnant .
I do n't think it 's poss -
Well , yes , I assume science could do that , but I 'm no scientist .
Really ?
A scorpion and an eggplant ?
No , I eat only organic .
I just do n't trust veg that comes from a lab .
Now , if I could ask something of you , I notice you 're a smoker .
I have some mints in my satchel here .
I mean no offense , but would you mind eating one before we begin with the rape .
Alright , wonderful .
Okay , do you want the surprise package , or the ...?
Ah , excellent .
I 'll just duck into that alleyway then .
If you could maybe walk back and forth by the entrance a few times and then I 'll come charging out and we can get started .
Sound good ?
Great .
AWWWWWOOOOOOOOOO !!!!
I 'M RAPING YOU !
OOOO OOOO OOO EEEEE !!!
GET READY !
HERE COMES SOME RAPE !!!!
Well of course it 's supposed to hurt , the first part is a beating .
No , I HAVE to do this part .
I have some integrity as a rapist , if I just went around skipping the brutal beating and jumping straight to the rape you might as well call me a Regular Ape .
Look , just shut up , you signed the ... how about I knock you out for this ?
Does that work ?
Good .
Right , then ...

While the Palestinian Authority of Fatah also causes some concern  its textbooks , for example , rarely recognize the state of Israel  Yigal Carmon , who runs Memri , said Hamas and its media used “ the kind of anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish language you do n’t really hear any more from the Palestinian Authority , which has n’t talked like that in a long time . ”
Abu Saleh , who asked that his full name not be used because of his critical views , is worried about his children .
His eldest son , 13 , likes to watch Al Aksa , especially the nationalist songs and military videos .
“ I talk to them about Hamas , but to be honest , it ’s scary and you have to watch it over time , ” he said .
“ When kids are 17 or 18 , you do n’t know what happens .
They get enraged and can attach themselves to radical groups . ”
Excluding Reconciliation
The Prophet Muhammad made a temporary hudna , or truce , with the Jews about 1,400 years ago , so Hamas allows the idea .
But no one in Hamas says he would make a peace treaty with Israel or permanently give up any part of British Mandate Palestine .
“ They talk of hudna , not of peace or reconciliation with Israel , ” said Mr. Abusada , the political scientist .
“ They believe over time they will be strong enough to liberate all historic Palestine . ”
Saraa , the host of “ Tomorrow ’s Pioneers , ” is the niece of Fawzi Barhoum , a Hamas spokesman .
Some of the language used against other Arabs upsets him , Mr. Barhoum said , but he insisted that Israel was illegitimate .
“ No one can deny that all this was Palestinian land and Jews occupied the land , ” he said firmly .
“ Therefore the Hamas charter is based on what Israel has committed against our people and our understanding of Israel and its practices . ”

The charter is a deeply anti-Semitic document and cites a famous forgery , the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , as truth .
But “ our battle is not with Jews as Jews , ” he said , “ but those who came and occupied us and killed us . ”
After all , Mr. Barhoum said , “ the Jews who recognized the evil of the occupation stayed outside and refused to come to Palestine as occupiers . ”
The concept of disruptive technology was originally expounded by Harvard Business School professor , Clayton M. Christensen , in The Innovator 's Dilemma : When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail .
Christensen 's observation is that the companies which do n't take note of emergent technologies get left behind - however big they think they are .
The web began as a relatively primitive technology that had little appeal beyond its academic beginnings , and few of the sophistications of the prevailing proprietary networks of its time , but was gradually adopted by a wider audience and was given added value as a result .
The Intel chip and its associated PC architecture had humble beginnings as a platform for hobbyists but grew to be the dominant force behind desktop computing .
It is sometimes said that Linux is a disruptive technology - one that appears from nowhere , usually emerges as a cheap alternative to the dominant technology , and upsets and ultimately replaces the current way of doing things .
Classic examples of disruptive technologies are the Intel 8086 chip and the World Wide Web , both of which , like Linux and free software , were initially dismissed as commercially impractical , and both of which ultimately transformed the market place .
Disruptive technologies , by Christensen 's definition , will tend to overturn existing pricing schemes and profit margins , and will embrace a culture at odds with the culture that precedes it .
Even if the dominant vendors are ready to accept the new technologies , the vendors ' hardcore followers will be reluctant to embrace them , which presents an interesting challenge for the hardware and software companies that have been most reluctant to recognize the significance of the free software revolution ... and have the most to lose .
On the DEC
Characteristically , disruptive technologies are initially targeted at the low end of the market - the smaller customers that are considered less important by the major players - and succeed because they offer considerable price or performance advantages .
The market leaders tend to be hypnotized by their success with their current customers , and ignore the true significance of the emergent technology until it is too late .
A classic example of this phenomenon is Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) , which enjoyed massive success during the eighties as a pioneering manufacturer of mini-computers .
DEC dominated large sectors of industry with its extremely reliable VAX based systems , and apparently had large swathes of the market committed to its future .
But then , out of the blue came two unlikely competitors in the shape of Risc based Unix , which had superior networking and performance characteristics , and Intel based desktop computers , which had sprung straight from the hobbyist 's kitchen table .
DEC was squeezed from both ends of the market , failed to adjust to the new landscape , and rapidly disappeared from view , suffering the final humiliation of being subsumed by Compaq , an upstart PC manufacturer .
Even IBM nearly went under during the eighties , accruing record losses over several years , before rethinking its strategies and eventually remodelling itself as the " open standards company " .
IBM , of course , is now one of the leading providers of Linux , replacing a plethora of operating system options across its hardware range , and had donated its engineers and software to the Linux kernel foundry .
The logic , as given by an IBM vice - president back in 2003 , is as follows : " People say , why would you want to give away stuff that has been of proprietary advantage to you in the past ?
And the answer is simple .
It may not be of advantage to [ IBM ] in the future .
In fact , there may be more of an advantage in having that kind of functionality available under Linux .
Is it a charitable thing for IBM to have 250 engineers working on Linux ?
Long term , we are getting a cheaper operating system than we can by building our own .
It 's self serving .
We can't build a Linux class operating system all by ourselves with only 250 people . "
Free and open
Linux itself does not represent any great departures from previous technologies , but has led a technological revolution that is predicated on free software licensing .
The open source development model , which is facilitated by the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , represents a challenge and an opportunity to industry to rethink the way that information and technology is used and shared between individuals and organisations , and in some sectors - notably the financial services sector - the challenge appears to have been accepted .
The disruptive technology is the license and its distinctive inversion of copyright law .

Corn , wheat , sugar and a dozen other crops all got increased subsidies in the recent Farm Bill , signed with terrifying agreement .
Is there an end in sight ?
One overlooked clue while those crops are fetching sky - high prices in that other system known as the free market is data showing farms took acreage from pastureland , which livestock need to graze .
So , ranchers have been liquidating herds and giving up in the battle against soaring feed costs .
Food manufacturers have eaten many of these rising crop prices and many grocery shoppers can still dance between the raindrops of inflation 's storm at the store if they really try .
But there is no place to hide between beef and the butcher paper , so by this time next summer , with supply disappearing , get ready to pay more for that burger .
I 'll predict that when it finally hits the American grill , politicians will finally get barbequed and changes finally get chewed on .
If not , history will not look back too kindly on our decisions .
Another convenient truth about free markets , as opposed to subsidies , is that they would help the poor even more than would the rich trying to save them all the time .
Instead of donating , how about hiring ?
Poverty often shares an address with fertile pieces of land around the world — land that could be farmed if not for crushing import taxes in addition to those local subsidies , preventing sales of many crops into the United States and Europe .
Many countries would rather sell us food than be given food out of guilt .
After all , do n't most of us still believe that it is better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish ?
Your Congress overwhelmingly objects .
The Farm Bill pays fisherman not to fish .
We do pay Kentucky horse owners to race though .
We help " geographically disadvantaged farmers " in … Hawaii !
If they are avoiding those intolerable conditions by staying inside and watching TV , they might see a " Got Milk " ad — which the Farm Bill also pays for .
Meanwhile sugar farmers are glad corn is taking all the heat because they have an even sweeter deal .
The world - market sugar price is currently 12 cents a pound , but Americans pay 23 cents guaranteed to our farmers .
Not done yet , we then turn around and sell that same sugar for an 80 % loss to ethanol plants .
A trade desk like that would lose all its investors in a day , unless their contributions are mandatory , as this one 's are .
So , what if a farmer wants to opt out of his subsidy not to plant more than 34 million acres ?
What if he'd rather sell much needed supply to meet swelling demand ?
There are harsh penalties for not fulfilling a 10 – 15 year contract to do nothing !
Talk about the American dream turning into a nightmare .
I want to disclose my severe bias right here .
I owe everything to a farmer .
My father grew up on a farm that his father worked his entire life on , dirt poor in the middle of Texas .
He believed in hard work .
He taught me how to hunt , to drive a tractor , to split open a watermelon by hand , to roast marshmallows , to play baseball — all on that farm .
But before any of that , he showed me how to work from morning darkness till after sundown .
I mean work hard , relentlessly , into the punishing summers down here .
A fresh apricot cobbler from my grandma was the only subsidy he ever wanted — from his own tree in the front yard .
I never recall him asking for help , not once ; he was too busy working .
Enjoy a good BBQ on July 4th , because next year 's meat will be marinated in a distasteful concoction .
Listening to Google ’s executives on their conference call with investors Thursday afternoon , you ’d never know that the company ’s second - quarter results fell short of expectations and its shares plummeted 10 percent in after - hours trading .
Since Google has chosen , as a matter of principle , not to offer any guidance in advance about what its sales and profits will be , it avoids any embarrassing questions if it misses its own marks .
So Eric Schmidt , and other executives , blithely insisted that all was well .
Hal Varian , Google ’s chief economist , said that while the company sees a bit of softness in ads for areas like auto lenders and real estate agents , other areas that might be economically sensitive are holding up , such as ads for home appliances .
He suggested that Google is benefiting because shoppers look to the Internet for bargains .
“ We have a little bit of the Wal - Mart effect going on , ” he said .
“ As times get tough , people will watch their dollars , and in many cases , that means doing more shopping online . ”
Some of the softness in Google ’s advertising revenue , moreover , was self - inflicted .
Jonathan Rosenberg , Google ’s senior vice president for product management , said that Google had chosen to reduce its advertising coverage — the percentage of Web pages on which it displays advertising — to an all - time low .
That ’s a puzzling decision on the surface .
Virtually any other company facing slow economic times would be interested in increasing the places in which it could sell ads .
It certainly would n’t take steps to reduce them .
But Mr. Rosenberg said that Google has no plans to increase its coverage because of its efforts to improve what it calls “ ad quality ” — the idea that Google should only show ads that users actually like .
Mr. Rosenberg said that the company ’s co-founder , Larry Page , would like to see even fewer ads .
“ Larry often says we would be better off if we showed one ad — the perfect ad , ” said Mr. Rosenberg .
Mr. Page was not on the conference call to speak for himself .
But Sergey Brin , the company ’s other co-founder , wondered aloud whether Google in fact had gone too far .
“ There is some evidence we have been a little more aggressive in decreasing coverage than we should have been , ” Mr. Brin said .
He noted that Google developed technology that helped increase its revenue from advertising ( largely by finding ads that are more interesting to users ) .
Indeed , it had a rule of thumb that for every potential dollar the company could earn from an improvement in advertising revenue , it would reduce the number of pages showing ads so that Google would only earn 50 cents more in revenue .
“ Clearly that is not the ideal strategy , because we do n’t want to end up with no ads , ” Mr. Brin said .
Investors , presumably , breathed a sigh of relief hearing that .
MacBook Pro video glitches
Owners of Santa Rosa - based MacBook Pros are suffering from video failures , reports claim .
Victims say that the problem arises after waking or rebooting a Pro , at which point the computer may suddenly stop displaying video , whether on its native LCD or an attached monitor .
Debugging is said to have revealed that the issue is with misidentified graphics chipsets -- rather than acknowledging their dedicated GeForce 8600M GT cards , Pros may be treating them as integrated X3100 chipsets .
AppleCare is said to be recommending a replacement of a Pro's logic board , but those who have have gone through with the procedure note that the fix may only be temporary , as the display can quickly go blank a second time .
User - suggested fixes include firmware and PRAM / NVRAM / PMU resets , deleting Safe Sleep files , or altering memory configurations .
The issue appears to affect only those Pros sold in or around June of last year , but may ignore any variations in hardware , as well as the v1.5.1 EFI firmware update which addressed another video error .
As the person who originally made the posts , she said , “ it seemed natural to make the decision . ”
Despite its appearance , she said , Boing Boing is really a collective where various contributors act independently : “ None of us confer .
We do n’t have specific beats .
There is no process in which posts are approved . ”
But the Boing Boing readership certainly viewed it as an act taken on behalf of the Web site .
Was Boing Boing deceiving its loyal audience by silently deleting the material , even if no one noticed the absences until a year later ?
What does it even mean to deceive an audience when it comes to a catalog of one ’s personal writings ?
And does popularity convey different responsibilities to the people who produce a Web site ?
The twist , of course , is that for nearly everyone who lives with what the Internet says about them , being unpublished would seem a dream come true .
Those photographs from the frat party can be unpublished ?
Who knew ?
The essay to the Mickey Mouse Fan Club , too ?
Ms. Blue , however , is not one to be mortified by what she sees of herself online .
She cultivates an online personality on her blog , which is fairly pornographic , and she is in the process of trademarking her name .
She credits her blog with getting her a column in a well - known newspaper and giving her a vital outlet for her thoughts and feelings .
In an interview , she said that she learned of the removals only when a reader of her blog noticed that the links to Boing Boing had gone dead .
“ I went to the site and searched , and , oh , my God , they were all gone . ”
“ The idea of someone unpublishing you is horrifying , ” she said , casting the action as violating the informal “ best practices ” that have developed around blogging .
“ That is why this is a bigger issue than someone versus someone .
Really , it is between Boing Boing and the world . ”
Image Xeni Jardin , top , a blogger on the BoingBoing Web site , seems to have struck a nerve by removing her posts about Violet Blue , above .

As for the someone - versus - someone part of the story , Ms. Blue said she was once very close with Ms. Jardin but did not know what might have happened personally or professionally last year to cause such a breach .

John Yoo Testimony
Marty Lederman
Here are John Yoo 's prepared remarks for the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee this morning .
( I do n't believe David Addington is submitting a prepared statement . )
CSPAN covering it live here .
I 'm out of town and do n't have time just now to blog in detail about this statement , except for a handful of very quick reactions :
1. John claims that the 2004 Levin torture memo , which superseded his 2002 OLC opinion , concluded that all interrogation methods OLC had previously approved as legal " were still legal . "
We now know that that 's dead wrong .
As Levin testified before this same committee last week , the footnote in question , which Attorney General Gonzales insisted that OLC include , merely indicated that the writers of the 2002 memos -- i.e. , John Yoo -- would not have changed their bottom line , even if they had employed Levin 's analysis .
Levin himself , however , was uncertain about the legality of some of the CIA techniques , and was in the process of reviewing them when he was effectively removed from OLC .
2 . John is testifying that his torture memos could have had no bearing on the abuse that took place in Iraq , because " the Geneva Conventions provided the relevant rules for the war in Iraq . "
There are several problems with this statement .
Most important is that OLC itself , when John was there , had advised the Pentagon that the Fourth Geneva Convention did not protect " unlawful combatants , " which includes most if not all of the insurgents in Iraq .
( See page 4 of the April 2003 DOD Working Group Report . )
As Jack Goldsmith reports in his book , the very first thing he decided when he arrived at OLC in October 2003 was that the Fourth Geneva Convention did protect Iraqi civilians -- a decision that hocked and dismayed the White House .
It is fairly clear ( as reflected in the Working Group Report ) that until that time , the Administration , based presumably on John 's own advice , was acting on the assumption that the insurgents in Iraq were not protected by the Geneva Conventions .
This explains why , according to several reports ( most importantly those of Sy Hersh and Jane Mayer ) , the Pentagon and CIA placed Special Forces and CIA operatives in Iraq in 2001 or 2002 , whose basic instructions were that there was no law -- certainly not Geneva -- that protected detainees , and that the " gloves were off " and that they could engage in widespread , wanton abuse and cruelty .
Which they did .
( And as the Fay , Jones and Schlesinger Reports found , and many accounts attest , the conspicuous abuse by CIA and Special Forces in Iraq was an important contributing factor to the breakdown of ordinary norms among the regular military forces , as well . )
The Pentagon and CIA would not have given these forces the green light to abuse prisoners if OLC had not previously advised that neither the Geneva Conventions nor any relevant statutes stood in the way of such abuse .
Finally , John 's broad Commander - in - Chief override theory , which was a prominent part of the DOD Working Group Report , and which was briefed to General Miller on his way to " GTMOize " Iraq , obviously conveyed the message that the President could ignore any applicable statutes and treaties , even if they would otherwise apply .
John 's legal advice , then , was a fairly direct cause -- certainly a necessary cause -- of the abuse in Iraq in 2002 and 2003 .
3 . John stresses , as he has in the past , that he was without much guidance in interpreting the federal torture statute , since there had not been any prosecutions under it , or any court cases construing it .
But the virtually identical definition of " torture " is included in statutes governing removal of aliens and asylum applications , and that definition had received extensive treatment from courts under those statutes ( which were also enacted in order to implement the Convention Against Torture ) .
The INS and the State Department , therefore , had very extensive knowledge and expertise on the question .
And yet those experts were cut out of the loop -- they were not consulted on the OLC opinion .
Indeed , John 's testimony states that the NSC ordered OLC not to discuss its work with the State Department ! -- something that is in itself fairly scandalous .
4 . John states that his 2002 torture opinion was " reviewed , edited and re-written by the assistant attorney general in charge of the office at the time [ Jay Bybee ] , as is the case with all opinions that issue from OLC . "
John is correct that virtually all written OLC opinions -- certainly those of great importance or dispute -- are at the very least reviewed by the AAG .
How , then , does he explain the fact that two of the most momentous OLC opinions has ever issued -- the September 25 , 2001 Opinion on the President 's war powers and the March 14 , 2003 opinion informing DOD ( over the vociferous objections of numerous DOD lawyers ) that its interrogators had virtual carte blanche to ignore federal statutes -- were signed by John Yoo himself ( a mere deputy ) , rather than by the head of OLC ( Dan Koffsky in 2001 ; Jay Bybee in 2003 ) ?
Two events happened in the last week , which spurred me to finish this little project I ’ve had in mind for a while .
First , yet another Fert - litter was born , on March 30 in Seattle .
Only five this time , so they probably wo n’t get the endorsements an End - Times - indicating seven would receive .
In Brian W. Aldiss ' 1965 " The Saliva Tree " the horror was based in the idea of the sheer wrongness of human women having litters of babies .
Yet now it ’s become routine .
Only the escalating size of the numbers is exciting .
Meanwhile , this guy has come out and said what the smart people have already figured out ; in an interconnected biosphere with limited resources , there are too many people , and at some point we have to say , “ Give it a rest ” .
In a time when the world is warming , the ice caps are melting , and non -human species die off every day , it seems obvious that people need to put the brakes on the breeding .
People are stupid though .
Instead of realizing we ’re about to hit a wall , we ’ll ignore it by celebrating the latest triumph of science over good sense .
And we ’ll revile Cassandra .
Extra special thanks to Erin for the funky typeface , and to Phil for remembering the Saliva Tree .
Support Our Troops with Dollars , not Magnets & Slogans
The political world , especially at the right end of the spectrum , is full of " support our troops " mantras , supplemented by the millions of Americans whose cars & trucks sport magnets bearing the same slogans .
Needless to say , slogans do n't particularly help our troops , being incapable of restoring health , supplying food and shelter , or finding jobs for the vets .
And it looks like , once again , those who scream " support our troops " the loudest have missed another opportunity to render support beyond words and magnets .
In the midst of the Clinton - Obama votefest , you might not have heard about the VA controversy involving a Doctor 's e-mail suggesting that fewer vets be given the diagnosis of Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) .
This information was made public , and objections voiced , not by the Bill O'Reilly / Rush Limbaugh / Ann Coulter crowd , but by a vet working through groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , which posted the e-mail on its web site .
Here 's the March 20 , 2008 e-mail from VA Psychologist Norma Perez in full : Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans , I 'd like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out .
Consider a diagnosis of adjustment disorder R/O PTSD .
Additionally , we really do n't or have the time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD .
Also there have been some incidence [ sic ] where the veteran has a C&P , is not given the diagnosis of PTSD , then the veteran comes here and we give the diagnosis and the veteran appeals his case based on our assessment .
This is just a suggestion for the reasons listed above .
The " C&P " referenced in the e-mail is a " compensation and pension examination " at which a veteran 's claim for compensation and / or a pension is assessed .
Anyone interested in how this assessment process works for vets with possible PTSD can see The " C&P " referenced in the e-mail is a " compensation and pension examination " at which a veteran 's claim for compensation and / or a pension is assessed .
Anyone interested in how this assessment process works for vets with possible PTSD can see this 3 - part video from the VA .
Once the cat was out of the bag , there was a lot of reaction from vet groups and many angry citizens .
NPR , that supposed collection of leftists sympathizers , did a story about the e-mail on May 23 , shortly after it became public .
From NPR 's piece : More and more military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are seeking help and compensation for post - traumatic stress disorder .
That has created concern by veterans and others that the government could try to minimize the problem of PTSD to save money .
An incident at a veterans ' hospital near Fort Hood , the Army post in Texas that is one of the nation 's largest military bases , has stoked that concern .
In an e-mail , a psychologist at the Olin E. Teague Veterans ' Center in Temple , Texas , advised her staff to stop diagnosing veterans with PTSD to save money .
The e-mail became public last week .
The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs insists that 's not VA policy .
Psychologist Norma Perez was hired last summer to help coordinate a PTSD program at the center , which draws a lot of veterans .
Not long afterward , Perez announced she would disband a dozen or so PTSD therapy groups , in which about 140 veterans met monthly with a clinical counselor .
Perez wanted to replace the long - term groups with short - term plans — lasting no longer than three months — that focus on coping skills and cognitive processing therapy .
The VA uses a broad range of therapies for PTSD , including group therapy .
Some veterans in the program said Perez told them that long - term group therapy does n't work .
Some vets accused Perez of personally trying to destroy their groups .
But Kim Larsen , a former Army medic and Vietnam vet with PTSD , who attended two VA forums about the plan to disband the groups , had a different impression .
He thought Perez was simply the messenger .
Then he saw an e-mail from Perez to her staff , advising them to " refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out .... "
It was dated March 20 .
... Rep. Bob Filner , a California Democrat who heads the House Veterans Affairs Committee , said of Perez : " I can't believe that someone at that level position is doing this on her own .
Somewhere in the hierarchy people are saying , ' It 's costing us too much with these PTSD diagnoses .
Cool it . ' "
The VA has refused interview requests about the incident .
In a statement , Secretary James Peake characterized the e-mail as an isolated example : " A single staff member , out of VA 's 230,000 employees , in a single medical facility , sent a single e-mail with suggestions that are inappropriate and have been repudiated at the highest level of our health care organization . "
The VA 's inspector general 's office is headed to Temple to find out if anyone higher up is telling the VA to " cool it . "
Meanwhile , the VA has reassigned Perez from the PTSD clinic , but it wo n't say where .
Faced with the backlash , Dr. Perez " clarified " the Norma Perez , who helps coordinate a post - traumatic stress disorder clinical team in central Texas , indicated she might have been out of line to cite growing disability claims in her March 20 e-mail titled " Suggestion . "
She said her intent was simply to remind staffers that stress symptoms could also be adjustment disorder .
The less severe diagnosis could save the VA millions of dollars in disability payouts .
" In retrospect , I realize I did not adequately convey my message appropriately , but my intent was unequivocally to improve the quality of care our veterans received , " Perez said in testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday before a Senate panel .
The Senate Veterans ' Affairs Committee and the VA inspector general are investigating whether there were broader VA policy motives behind the e-mail , which was obtained and disclosed last month by two watchdog groups .
The VA has strenuously denied that cost - cutting is a factor in its treatment decisions .
...
" The e-mail , as characterized by others , does not reflect the policies or conduct of our health care system , " said Michael Kussman , VA 's undersecretary for health , in testimony prepared for the Senate hearing .
" We certainly agree that it could have been more artfully drafted . "
The same newspaper report , however , goes on to note that ( emphasis added ) : Perez also noted that awarding disability benefits is not part of her staff 's work , but she did not say why she chose to cite that as a factor in urging fewer PTSD diagnoses .
Veterans diagnosed with PTSD are eligible to receive up to $ 2,527 a month in government benefits .
A recent Rand Corp. study found about 300,000 U.S. military personnel who served in Iraq or Afghanistan are suffering from PTSD or major depression , potentially saving the government millions of dollars if lesser diagnoses are used — rightly or wrongly — in disability benefits decisions .
Keep in mind that this comes close on the heels of charges that the VA is deliberately underestimating / underreporting suicides among vets .
So , not surprisingly , today 's Senate Committee hearing was heavy on criticism of the VA in general and Perez in particular ( the hearing at which Dr. Perez testified is Faced with the backlash , Dr. Perez " clarified " the purpose of her memo in a written statement submitted to the Senate Committee on Veterans '
Affairs for a hearing held by that Committee today :

So , not surprisingly , today 's Senate Committee hearing was heavy on criticism of the VA in general and Perez in particular ( the hearing at which Dr. Perez testified is available on video here ) .
How much money is at stake in the classification war that appears to be going on at the VA ?
An AFP report today states : According to a study released in April by the RAND Corporation about 300,000 of the 1.6 million US troops who have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2002 suffer from PTSD or depression , but only around half have sought medical care for the conditions .
The study estimated the cost of treating soldiers diagnosed with PTSD or depression in the first two years following their return from Iraq or Afghanistan at up to 6.2 billion dollars .
The Pentagon last month issued data showing diagnoses of PTSD among troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan had climbed from 9,549 in 2006 to 13,951 in 2007 .
On Wednesday , the Pentagon said it is recruiting government public health workers to offset a shortage in mental health care providers for troops returning from war with mental problems .
Could the rise in PTSD diagnoses be part of the price of " the surge " in Iraq ?
That depends on the dates of service to which the study 's 2007 data correspond , but the connection is a real possibility .
Could the rise in PTSD diagnoses be part of the price of " the surge " in Iraq ?
That depends on the dates of service to which the study 's 2007 data correspond , but the connection is a real possibility .
The sad fact is that until recently , the long term consequences of military injuries were underestimated and undercompensated .
In past wars , it cost a whole lot less to really " support the troops " simply because the mortality rate was so much higher among injured soldiers , and the survivors were simply expected to bear their psychological injuries in stoic ( and unpaid ) silence .
The idea of measuring and compensating the so - called " invisible " psychological injuries had not yet really born .
In a country like America , which takes its capitalism seriously enough to equate capitalism and freedom , it 's going to be a tough sell to get the money required to really support the troops .
The system is , after all , capitalism , not humanism .
No matter what they say in public , too many on the right , and certainly too many in the business and finance sphere , view human soldiers as a renewable resource , and money as the highest good .
Maybe if we collect all the vehicle magnets and sell them we can use the proceeds to contribute to the actual well being of the troops .
And I can't help wondering where Senator McCain stands on this issue , given his recent statements in opposition to newly proposed version of the GI bill .

Irony is a difficult beast to control .
Your intention as a cartoonist may be perfectly clear to you , but how some psycho in Toadsuck , Nebraska , is going to read your cartoon is anyone 's guess , and the psycho's privilege , and you can never second guess a psycho , as was demonstrated in the Coen brothers ' film No Country for Old Men .
Psychos tend to take things very literally and often carry around captive bolts powered by large canisters of compressed air , especially in the US .
So should we tread warily , lest we are misunderstood ?
Of course we should .
Cartoonists are some of the most painstaking , careful , shy and sensitive people on earth , yet we do play with fire , toying with other people 's ( and of course our own ) most deeply held beliefs and most cherished illusions .
Is it possible to go too far ?
Of course it is ?
Should we go too far ?
Of course we should .
That 's what makes our job so interesting .
There 's no better feeling than , having taken a risk in a drawing , seeing the thing in print and knowing it works .
The converse is also true , which is why I work in a bunker on the south coast .
When I first saw a tiny thumbnail of the offending Barry Blitt New Yorker cover I thought , for a fleeting moment , that I could understand why Obama supporters would be so pissed off .
After all , here was a drawing depicting the worst possible caricature of their man : a smug Muslim and his gun-toting black - power wife who would burn the flag in the Oval Office beneath a portrait of Osama bin Laden .
But then , surely that 's the point ?
If you take it that literally you literally turn yourself into an idiot ( though not quite a psycho ) .
I did n't think it looked a particularly good drawing , but I could n't judge from a thumbnail .
Now , having seen the full image ( along with unimaginable numbers of idiots and psycho- paths worldwide ) , I can say that I rather warm to it .
I look at it , and it works , for me anyway .
I particularly like the expression on Michelle 's face .
Cartoons do n't work as shopping lists of points to be made with labels tacked on to clarify things for the culturally deprived .
Too much cartooning operates on that level , especially in the US .
Cartoons need to be disturbing , and they should also dare to ask questions .
People in the US are n't generally fools ( even though the fools have been over - represented of late , particularly in the current administration ) , though some may be a little over - literal , and these are not always the psychos .
Not so long ago I drew a cartoon of Obama as rifle - range target , and received a torrent ( OK , a very heavy trickle ) of emails , mostly from concerned liberal supporters asking me if I really wanted him dead .
I was simply pointing out that Obama definitely ticks all the boxes for the heavily armed rightwing psychopath , and of course it happened before in the US 40 years ago , so the cartoon was not really meant to amuse .
But whether a cartoon is funny or not is one judgment that is always going to remain subjective .
Ed Felten writes on Freedom - to - Tinker :
Today eight colleagues and I are releasing a significant new research
result .
We show that disk encryption , the standard approach to
protecting sensitive data on laptops , can be defeated by relatively
simple methods .
We demonstrate our methods by using them to defeat
three popular disk encryption products : BitLocker , which comes with
Windows Vista ; FileVault , which comes with MacOS X ; and dm-crypt ,
which is used with Linux .
The root of the problem lies in an unexpected property of today 's DRAM
memories .
DRAMs are the main memory chips used to store data while
the system is running .
Virtually everybody , including experts , will
tell you that DRAM contents are lost when you turn off the power .
But
this is n't so .
Our research shows that data in DRAM actually fades
out gradually over a period of seconds to minutes , enabling an
attacker to read the full contents of memory by cutting power and then
rebooting into a malicious operating system .
C++ Dependency Injection , Part Deux
Last time I talked about a concept called Dependency Injection from the Java world , and compared it to Policy Based Design from the C++ world .
The techniques that Java designers have used Dependency Injection for very easily ‘ port ’ to the Policy Based Design world – and one of these techniques , used in testing , is the idea of a mock framework .
Mock frameworks are objects that ‘ look , taste and smell ’ like normal objects , but are used for purely testing purposes only and are useful in that the user can very closely control their state .
This time I ’d like to go more into depth on a possible way to utilize Generic Dependency Injection , otherwise known as Policy Based Design , to build a mock object framework .
I hope to show you that there are a few , for lack of a better term , ‘ hacks ’ that work very well for testing .
They are hacks in that they are n’t all that pretty , however , I ’d much rather utilize them to help keep testing concerns in testing code , rather than let our design and product reflect our testing procedure .
( On that note , I recall reading a post motivated by Test Driven Development and the creation of Mock Object frameworks , and the question of how to test private state .
The answer the blogger gave was “ make everything public ” .
In a world driven by tests , encapsulation takes a back seat .
For shame , Java developers 🙂
Two important influences come from the Python world that I want to discuss .
One is “ Duck Typing ” and the other is turning a compile time bug into a runtime bug on purpose .
Duck Typing is a form of weak typing who ’s premise is “ If it quacks like a duck , it ’s a duck . ”
That is , if I ’m writing a method that requires an argument X and requires that X have a method of it ’s own , called foo , then that ’s all I need .
I do n’t need X to satisfy any type constraints , I just need to know that I can call X.foo ( ) and not crash .
This does n’t even require a check for foo , as it ’s considered bad form to call hasattr ( X , ” foo ” ) before a call to foo .
Instead , good Pythonistas call first and ask questions later – basically by wrapping anything considered risky in a try / except block , and dealing with the attribute error raised by calling a method that does n’t exist there .
Many people have noted that C++ templates are indeed very similar to Duck Typing .
Absolutely no assumptions are made on a template , so if you have an X of some templated type , and you call X.foo , then the compiler just assumes you ’ve done your due diligence and added that method in there somewhere .
Pity on the designer who has n’t , as a few pages of cryptic compiler errors are your reward .
While C++ does n’t allow this error to propagate into runtime like Python does , it does ‘ weaken ’ inheritance a bit .
In Java , we use dependency - injection with object hierarchies , so we know whatever object we create on the other side fits some interface .
C++ does not have that constraint ( feature ) .
This frees us up from some busy work of having to implement every single method on a large interface for each mock object , or enforcing some inheritance structure , which keeps tests light and easy to build .
( C++0 x will have ways to levy interfaces on templates , called Concepts .
However , these interfaces will be much more lightweight .
It will be more in the style of the user asking “ Here ’s what I require ” rather than the library telling “ Here ’s what I provide ” .
This will clear up many of the more cryptic template errors , as well as formalize STL concepts like the forward iterators , among other things , without the overhead of object hierarchies . )
In Python , there are no such things as interfaces or abstract base classes .
Instead , interfaces are more or less defined by convention – one of these conventions is the idea of an ‘ abstract method ’ who ’s sole purpose is to throw an exception if anyone calls him .
They ’ve effectively moved a compiler check into runtime , for better or worse .
In the case of our tests , it ’s for better .
The first thing we want to do is create a base mock class for every type we want to mock out .
This type will resemble a Python ‘ abstract ’ class .
It will inherit from all abstract base classes that our normal object does , and it will fulfill every abstract method – except every method will be nothing but throwing an exception .
Using this class as our ‘ canvas ’ , we can now inherit one more time from this new mock object for any particular test we want to run .
If we are testing our shape object ’s ‘ draw ’ method , and we know ( since we ’re the designers ) that shape ’s draw calls a method on a ‘ screen ’ object called ‘ getGraphics ’ , then we in turn just have to override one of our mock screen ’s methods .
The rest will still resolve to runtime exceptions .
That way , we create very light mock objects for each test – in fact , we can create an entirely new hierarchy of types for each test , filling in the methods we want information on .
For example :
namespace test1 Detail {
class ScreenTest : MockScreen {
virtual Graphics getGraphics ( ) { … }
} ;
typedef Shape< ScreenTest > TestShape ;
}
BOOST_AUTO_TEST ( test1 ) {
test1 Detail :: TestShape myShape ;
…run test …
}
I now can add whatever behavior I want inside of getGraphics .
And if my test calls any method BUT getGraphics , which is the only one I implemented for the test , I get a runtime error that will most likely be logged by my unit test library .
What kinds of things might I put inside these mock methods ?
Well lets say I am mocking a map object , like std: : map .
The object I ’m testing is supposed to receive a message , and create a new object in it ’s map with a key that ’s also contained in the message .
Lucky for me I control the object at all points !
I know exactly what message I ’m sending to the object I ’m testing , and I can set the key value to be whatever I want .
Then , only a few lines away , in my detail namespace for that test , I ’ve created a brand new class that ALSO has the key value I ’m testing hard coded .
In this case , I can override operator [ ] to make sure I ’m attempting to add the right key .
Your mock objects that you intend to plug into testing are complete throwaway objects – you will only use the type once , so there ’s really no gain in ‘ designing ’ the class well .
In other words – make everything public .
Hell , make everything public and static !
Many of my mock objects are just a single method and a few static booleans I use as flags .
You need to make most things static inside your mock objects so that you can access them from the type level .
Look at the above example , and then think about how you ’d check and make sure getGraphics was called with a certain argument .
… virtual Graphics getGraphics ( int key ) {
if ( key == 100 ) { // hard coded value
ScreenTest :: KeyTestPassed = true ;
} // rest of method
Now , at my TEST level , inside my BOOST_AUTO_TEST function , I can access the flag I just set , via the same resolution .
Test1 Detail :: ScreenTest::KeyTestPassed
For each test , we are creating a completely different type , not just a new object .
And since we know exactly how many times this type will be instantiated , we can hard code different values and checks cowboy - style .
The mock objects are completely throwaway , and are meant to simply be the quickest , dirtiest way to run our tests .
Because the quicker we can write tests , the more test we are inclined to write .
Next time I hope to go over how we can extend our simple mock objects , giving us the ability to access individual instances .
I also would like to make a few comments on applying RAII and review the template - know - how to make more advanced general use tests .
Until then !
Fourteen research teams studying the impacts of warming on the Arctic Ocean have issued independent projections of how the sea ice will behave this summer , and 11 of them foresee an ice retreat at least as extraordinary as last year ’s or even more dramatic .
The other three groups that issued a numerical estimate see the ice extent heading back toward , but not equaling , the average minimum for summers since satellites began tracking the comings and goings of Arctic sea ice in 1979 .
Five other groups chose not to issue a numerical estimate .
The ice assessments , and explanations , can be found on the Web site of the ongoing Study of Environmental Arctic Change , or SEARCH .
The initiative was begun following a workshop on Arctic ice trends in March that was triggered by the “ drastic and unexpected sea ice decline witnessed in 2007 , ” according to the report posted online .
This short animation , from NASA ’s Scientific Visualization Studio , puts 2007 in perspective :
As I wrote last fall , even several experts familiar with other recent Arctic warm periods , most notably one in the early 20th century , see no evidence that ice retreated to the extent measured in the last few years .
( That story and a sea-ice graphic are at nytimes.com / climate . )
There will be monthly updates through the summer , according to organizers of the effort .
The scientists running the project stressed that it is not a formal forecast , but instead aimed at comparing different ways of analyzing what mix of forces — from winds and currents to any long - term contribution from human - caused global warming — is at work .
“ The intent is not to issue predictions , but rather to summarize all available information from ongoing observing and modeling efforts to provide the scientific community , stakeholders , and the public the best available information on the evolution of the arctic sea ice cover , ” said the coordinators in a statement .
The project is being supported in part by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Correction to this article
VISITORS to Rongwo Monastery , a sprawling 700 - year - old complex on the edge of the Tibetan plateau , might notice little untoward .
There are no open signs of protest , of the sort that presaged vicious rioting in Tibet in March .
But in one shrine a monk chants near a portrait of the Dalai Lama , prominently displayed despite the government 's diatribes against the exiled spiritual leader .
And police cars patrol the streets nearby : nervous , say residents , that protests could erupt anew .
Security around Rongwo , as it is known to Tibetans ( its Chinese name , like that of the adjacent town , is Longwu ) , is far less visible than it was a few weeks ago when police surrounded the monastery , raided monks ' quarters and took many away to jail .
No police are to be seen inside the hillside monastery .
But a monk says some 200 of his colleagues in the 500 - strong community have been detained since Rongwo joined the wave of protests that swept the plateau .
Many are still in custody , and , says the monk , it is “ very tense ” .
Near Rongwo is a much smaller monastery , which until recently was a popular destination for lovers of Tibetan religious artefacts , production of which creates hundreds of jobs in the area .
It is now all but empty of visitors .
A monk there says two of his colleagues have been seized by security officials .
As Beijing prepares to host the Olympic games in August , the authorities are trying , unconvincingly , to reassure the world that calm has returned to Tibet and ethnic - Tibetan parts of neighbouring provinces , such as Qinghai , to which Rongwo belongs , and much of which is considered by Tibetans part of their historical territory .
On June 21st the Olympic torch was paraded through the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , without incident but under huge security .
Three days later the authorities announced that foreign tourists would be allowed back into Tibet for the first time since rioting erupted in Lhasa on March 14th .
But they were supposed to join guided tours and stick to preset routes .
On July 1st and 2nd Chinese officials held talks in Beijing with representatives of the Dalai Lama , the second such meeting since the riots .
This time the Tibetans were treated to a tour of Olympic facilities in Beijing .
But the talks got nowhere .
The Dalai Lama 's team agreed to talk again in October but said that “ in the absence of a serious and sincere commitment ” on the Chinese side , it would “ serve no purpose ” .
Despite China 's promises of greater openness for the Olympics , foreign journalists still need special permission to visit Tibet .
It is usually refused .
About 50 , none of them from The Economist , were invited to cover the torch parade in Lhasa , but were closely watched .
Your correspondent reached Rongwo without hindrance , but was stopped twice at police checkpoints while leaving .
Travellers say security is much tighter in Tibetan areas of Sichuan where several demonstrators were shot by security forces in March .
In some monasteries police have seized computers and mobile telephones from monks to suppress news of the security operation .
Chinese officials want to win favour in the West by renewing talks with the Dalai Lama 's aides .
The Dalai Lama is a moderate : many Tibetans do not share his willingness to accept Chinese sovereignty in return for genuine autonomy .
But some Chinese officials see him as the source of their Tibet problem .
The Communist Party chief in Tibet , Zhang Qingli , used the torch ceremony to assert that Tibet could “ thoroughly smash the separatist plots of the Dalai Lama clique ” .
Even the usually tongue - tied International Olympic Committee expressed regret at the remark .
Some government - controlled websites omitted it in reporting the speech .
This could reflect differences over whether to seek a compromise with the Dalai Lama or to try even harder to erase his influence .
Chinese leaders must be relieved by America 's announcement on July 3rd that George Bush will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics .
Relations with the West , though strained by recent events in Tibet , have not been critically damaged .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , had been the most outspoken of Western leaders in linking the clampdown in Tibet to a possible boycott of the games .
But this week , after meeting China 's president , Hu Jintao , at the G8 summit in Japan , he confirmed he would attend .
Popular sympathy in the West for the Dalai Lama and Tibet is outweighed by the fear of antagonising China .
The leadership in Beijing , however , must also be asking itself whether the crisis in Tibet could have been avoided .
As the dust settles , perhaps temporarily , it has become clearer that the unrest could have been far better handled .
The rioting could have been stopped well before it engulfed the city , averting the deaths of the 20 or so ethnic - Han Chinese the government says were killed in fires set by the rioters .
And had the unrest been more quickly contained , it might not have spawned sympathy protests across the plateau , even in monasteries such as Rongwo , some 1,200 km ( 750 miles ) from the Tibetan capital .
The security forces ' response was highly unusual compared with their usual tactics for dealing with protests in Tibet and elsewhere in China .
In 1993 the authorities quelled a riot in central Lhasa using tear - gas and plastic bullets .
This time they kept well away from the rioting .
Even if troops did shoot at people , it was not part of a concerted effort to stop the unrest .
Your correspondent , who happened to be the only foreign journalist in Lhasa at the time , reported in March that the rioting began to spread along the city 's main thoroughfare , Beijing Road , in the early afternoon , “ a short while ” after a clash between monks and security officials outside Ramoche temple some 200 metres up a side street .
But in fact the eruption of citywide rioting was slower than this suggested .
Witnesses speak of the unrest outside Ramoche temple starting before 11.30 am , well before your correspondent arrived at Beijing Road around 1.30 pm and saw the rioting fan out through the narrow alleys of Lhasa 's old Tibetan quarter .
Until just before then the unrest , including some stone - throwing by Tibetans at police , was confined to a small area .
Oddly , however , your correspondent was nearby in a government car at around 12.30 pm and saw no sign of beefed - up security .
Foreign tourists say three lorryloads of paramilitary troops arrived at around 1.15 pm .
They crouched behind shields at the junction of Beijing Road and the Ramoche temple side - street .
But the troops scattered within a few minutes after being bombarded with stones .
Some of them abandoned their shields .
Photographs show that several of the security personnel , although carrying shields and wearing helmets , were in civilian clothes .
They did not look ready to defend themselves against rioters , let alone to try to stop them .
Why not read the riot act ?
There are a number of possible explanations for this half - hearted response to such a big incident .
It may have been simple bungling by a security apparatus overstretched by an outbreak of large - scale protests earlier in the week outside big monasteries on the edge of the city .
Or perhaps official decision - making was paralysed by differences over what to do , and hindered by the absence of Mr Zhang , the party chief , who was in Beijing at the time .
The slow and cackhanded reaction is puzzling nonetheless .
China , after all , faces tens of thousands of protests and riots every year , most swiftly contained .
This month in Guizhou province , some 30,000 people protested in Weng 'an county at the authorities ' handling of the death of a girl they believed raped and murdered .
It turned into an ugly riot .
But those involved were soon detained .
There was also a purge of the local political leadership , blamed for losing public confidence .
The security forces and political apparatus had long been nervous in Tibet especially .
Indeed they had been gearing themselves for just such an outbreak of violence .
The government 's public claims that Tibet was stable were disingenuous , as was their dismissal of past unrest as ancient history .
A series of anti-Chinese protests from 1987 to 1989 culminated in the imposition of martial law in Lhasa for more than a year .
Since then , officials , not least the hardliner Mr Zhang , who was appointed in 2005 , have never let down their guard .
In 2006 the security forces , fearing attacks by Tibetan terrorists ( not that any are known to be active ) , staged what the government described as the biggest protection operation in the region 's history .
The occasion was the grand opening of Tibet 's first rail link with the rest of China .
Official records say this involved a series of exercises for dealing with terrorist and other “ sudden incidents ” ( ie , riots ) , heightened surveillance of monasteries and the deployment of thousands of paramilitary troops along the railway line .
In October last year police and paramilitary officers in Lhasa rehearsed rapid - response measures to cope with possible disturbances during the national - day holiday and the Communist Party 's congress in Beijing .
In 2006 officials responsible for religious and ethnic affairs in Tibet circulated a secret document predicting that the train link could create instability in urban areas .
Sure enough , ethnic - Han Chinese , many of them recent migrants hoping to profit from a train - related tourism boom , were the main targets of the violence in Lhasa .
Even if officials had ignored such warnings , the protests at Lhasa 's monasteries on March 10th and 11th were the biggest in the city since 1989 and provided ample warning of bigger trouble ahead .
And Tibetan radicals outside China — not including the Dalai Lama , who supports the Beijing games — had made no secret of their plans to use the Olympics to publicise their grievances .
On March 13th , the eve of the riots , security in central Lhasa was visibly tighter than normal in the city , which is ringed by military encampments .
That day one of the Dalai Lama 's representatives sent a letter to a senior official in Beijing , warning him that unless managed carefully the situation in Tibet might become “ difficult for all of us to handle ” .
Yet by 1.30 pm on March 14th , as the riots began to spread beyond the area near the Ramoche Temple , the security presence had all but disappeared from that part of the city .
Once the riots began to spread , officials may have worried that any effort to control them would lead to bloodshed that would damage China 's image in the build - up to the games .
But it is also possible that some officials actually wanted the violence to escalate , as a pretext to impose blanket security on the city long before the Olympics .
They might have calculated that tensions in Lhasa were likely to present a growing security headache in the run-up to the games , and that foreign scrutiny would become more intense .
By refraining from an immediate bloody crackdown they might even gain international kudos for avoiding a Tiananmen - style response .
Chinese officials may have been genuinely surprised that , in the event , Western reaction was overwhelmingly negative .
This response was fuelled by a widespread perception outside China , encouraged by reports from Tibetans in exile , that large - scale bloodshed had indeed occurred .
But it is still not known whether the security forces shot anyone at all during the unrest of March 14th and 15th in Lhasa .
Figures used by Tibetans abroad have fudged the issue .
The Dalai Lama himself says more than 200 people have been killed by Chinese security forces since March .
But he and his aides have provided scant detail .
There is little doubt that several were shot in other parts of the plateau , most notably in Sichuan , where several dozen may have been killed .
In the case of Lhasa the Tibetan government - in - exile has published a list of only 23 Tibetans killed on March 14th and 15th .
But it is unable to provide a consistent account of these incidents .
In an interview with The Economist in May , the Dalai Lama admitted he was uncertain about how the unrest developed in Lhasa and the details of any shooting by the security forces there : “ There is a lot of confusion and contradictory information . ”
No photographs have come to light from Lhasa of violence by police or troops on March 14th or 15th , nor of any resulting casualties .
Photographs of dead bodies displayed in the streets of Dharamsala , the seat in exile in northern India of the Dalai Lama , are said to be those of Tibetans shot in Sichuan .
Yet camera - equipped mobile phones are widely used in Lhasa and internet services remained uninterrupted during the rioting .
Georg Blume of Die Zeit , a German newspaper , who arrived in Lhasa on March 15th just after the riots , says he expected to hear residents describe a massacre .
But in nearly a week of interviews he was unable to confirm any reports of killings by the security forces .
The relay of the Olympic torch through Lhasa was much curtailed for security reasons — though officials claimed the truncation was somehow related to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan in May .
Officials must have been deeply relieved .
Their original plans for three days of ceremonies across Tibet would have been a security nightmare — and would have been even worse had there been no crackdown in March .
Foreign journalists and tourists as well as a sprinkling of Tibetan exiles would have poured in .
Disgruntled Tibetans would have sensed an opportunity .
Whether deliberate or incompetent , the authorities ' failure to stop the rioting at the outset has been a bigger setback for Tibet 's long - term stability and China 's foreign relations than any official is likely to have calculated on March 14th .
Chinese officials appeared to condone the xenophobic outcry triggered by Western criticism of the clampdown .
The party , after all , prides itself on its nationalist credentials .
But the outburst has also shaken party officials .
They are ever fearful that they might become the target of their own citizens ' anger .
The earthquake helped restrain the nationalist anger .
But as Sharon Stone , an American actress , found in May when she suggested that the earthquake could have been karmic retribution for the clampdown in Tibet , it is easily reawakened .
A matter of trust
The Dalai Lama expresses little optimism .
He says that because of the unrest the Chinese government might now rally round the view held by some of its officials that “ they ca n't trust any Tibetans ” .
It might , he said , step up “ demographic aggression ” by sending more ethnic - Han Chinese into the region .
The Dalai Lama talks of reports that the Chinese have fenced off land and speculates that this might be given to settlers .
He even says he had heard a report that 1 m of them might come in to Tibet once the Olympic games are over .
Such remarks suggest the enormous gulf between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government and the difficulty he and his aides face in separating truth from rumour .
Just as there is scant proof that the “ Dalai clique ” is actively engaged in fomenting unrest , as Chinese leaders claim , so there is little evidence that China is actively seeking to change the ethnic mix of Tibet .
Migrants from elsewhere in China , mainly neighbouring Sichuan , are indeed flocking to the region .
But this is part of a nationwide flow of tens of millions of job - seeking migrants into the richer cities of China that has occurred since the 1980s .
Tibet 's problem is the pace of this influx .
No official figures are published .
But it appears to have accelerated rapidly in recent years thanks to a rapid growth in tourism , which has received a big boost from the railway .
Sporadic discussions between Chinese officials and the Dalai Lama 's advisers over nearly three decades have achieved nothing .
The Dalai Lama 's representatives paid three visits to Tibet in the late 1970s and 1980 .
Chinese officials were embarrassed by emotional displays of public support for them , and curtailed subsequent visits .
In 1985 the Dalai Lama 's team visited Qinghai and in 2002 Lhasa .
Deng Xiaoping , then China 's paramount leader , met a representative of the Dalai Lama in 1979 .
But current animosities make such a high - level meeting hard to imagine today .
Chinese officials will be alarmed that unrest spread as far as Rongwo .
Qinghai , home to the biggest Tibetan population outside the “ autonomous region ” , had long been relatively peaceful and was ruled with a lighter touch than Tibet itself .
The practice is frowned upon , but some monasteries there had greater freedom to display the Dalai Lama 's portrait .
Even now , amid a plateau - wide campaign of “ patriotic education ” in monasteries during which monks in some places are being asked by officials to denounce the Dalai Lama , two portraits of him were on display at Kumbum , a monastery close to Qinghai 's capital , Xining .
Yet official tolerance of such infractions in recent years has not appeared to make Qinghai 's Tibetans any more loyal to the party than those in more tightly controlled Tibet .
Curbing official vitriol directed at the Dalai Lama would certainly please Tibetans .
But addressing their economic grievances , such as Han domination of Lhasa 's shops and taxi services , would help a lot too .
The officials who decided to stand back during Lhasa 's riots may well have gambled — correctly as it turned out — that the violence would be directed mainly at businesses run by Hans and Huis ( members of a Muslim minority ) rather than at symbols of party power .
The crackdown has been less astute .
Officials have depicted the riots as politically inspired , and have ignored the underlying ethnic and economic grievances , which are rekindling pro-independence sentiment .
Hardly any political slogans were uttered during the unrest on March 14th .
But as the riots started outside the Ramoche temple , a Tibetan writer said she heard that a citizen , startled and delighted by the authorities ' failure to intervene , shouted “ Tibet is independent ! ”
Few would dare even to whisper that openly now .
But many Tibetans still cherish the dream .
Correction : we wrongly stated that China had not allowed the Dalai Lama 's delegates to visit Tibet since 1980 .
In fact , a team visited Lhasa in 2002 .
This was corrected on July 15th 2008 .

Dynamically Composing Expression Predicates
Suppose you want to write a LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework query that implements a keyword - style search .
In other words , a query that returns rows whose description contains some or all of a given set of keywords .
We can proceed as follows :
IQueryable < Product > SearchProducts ( params string [ ] keywords ) { IQueryable < Product > query = dataContext .
Products ; foreach ( string keyword in keywords ) { string temp = keyword ; query = query .
Where ( p => p. Description .
Contains ( temp ) ) ; } return query ; }
The temporary variable in the loop is required to avoid the outer variable trap , where the same variable is captured for each iteration of the foreach loop .
So far , so good .
But this only handles the case where you want to match all of the specified keywords .
Suppose instead , we wanted products whose description contains any of the supplied keywords .
Our previous approach of chaining
Where operators is completely useless !
We could instead chain Union operators , but this would be inefficient .
The ideal approach is to dynamically construct a lambda expression tree that performs an or - based predicate .
Of all the things that will drive you to manually constructing expression trees , the need for dynamic predicates is the most common in a typical business application .
Fortunately , it ’s possible to write a set of simple and reusable extension methods that radically simplify this task .
This is the role of our PredicateBuilder class .
Using PredicateBuilder
Here 's how to solve the preceding example with PredicateBuilder :
IQueryable < Product > SearchProducts ( params string [ ] keywords ) { var predicate = PredicateBuilder .False < Product >( ) ; foreach ( string keyword in keywords ) { string temp = keyword ; predicate = predicate .
Or ( p => p. Description .
Contains ( temp ) ) ; } return dataContext .
Products .
Where ( predicate ) ; }
If querying with Entity Framework , change the last line to this :
return objectContext .
Products .
AsExpandable ( ) .
Where ( predicate ) ;
The AsExpandable method is part of LINQKit ( see below ) .
The easiest way to experiment with PredicateBuilder is with LINQPad .
LINQPad lets you instantly test LINQ queries against a database or local collection and has direct support for PredicateBuilder ( press F4 and check ' Include PredicateBuilder ' ) .
PredicateBuilder Source Code
Here 's the complete source :
using System ; using System .
Linq ; using System .
Linq .
Expressions ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; public static class PredicateBuilder { public static Expression < Func < T , bool >> True <T > ( ) { return f => true ; } public static Expression < Func < T , bool >> False < T> ( ) { return f => false ; } public static Expression < Func < T , bool >>
Or < T> ( this Expression < Func < T , bool >> expr1 , Expression < Func< T , bool >> expr2 ) { var invokedExpr = Expression .
Invoke ( expr2 , expr1.Parameters .Cast < Expression > ( ) ) ; return Expression .
Lambda < Func<T , bool >> ( Expression .
OrElse ( expr1.Body , invokedExpr ) , expr1. Parameters ) ; } public static Expression < Func < T , bool >>
And < T> ( this Expression < Func < T , bool >> expr1 , Expression < Func< T , bool >> expr2 ) { var invokedExpr = Expression .
Invoke ( expr2 , expr1.Parameters .Cast < Expression > ( ) ) ; return Expression .
Lambda < Func<T , bool >> ( Expression .
AndAlso ( expr1.Body , invokedExpr ) , expr1. Parameters ) ; } }
PredicateBuilder is also shipped as part of LINQKit , a productivity kit for LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework .
If you 're using LINQ to SQL , you can use the PredicateBuilder source code on its own .
If you 're using Entity Framework , you 'll need the complete LINQKit - for the AsExpandable functionality .
You can either reference LINQKit.dll or copy LINQKit 's source code into your application .
How it Works
The True and False methods do nothing special : they are simply convenient shortcuts for creating an Expression < Func < T , bool >> that initially evaluates to true or false .
So the following :
var predicate = PredicateBuilder .
True < Product > ( ) ;
is just a shortcut for this :
Expression < Func< Product , bool >> predicate = c => true ;
When you ’re building a predicate by repeatedly stacking and / or conditions , it ’s useful to have a starting point of either true or false ( respectively ) .
Our SearchProducts method still works if no keywords are supplied .
The interesting work takes place inside the And and Or methods .
We start by invoking the second expression with the first expression ’s parameters .
An Invoke expression calls another lambda expression using the given expressions as arguments .
We can create the conditional expression from the body of the first expression and the invoked version of the second .
The final step is to wrap this in a new lambda expression .
Entity Framework 's query processing pipeline cannot handle invocation expressions , which is why you need to call AsExpandable on the first object in the query .
By calling AsExpandable , you activate LINQKit 's expression visitor class which substitutes invocation expressions with simpler constructs that Entity Framework can understand .
More Examples
A useful pattern in writing a data access layer is to create a reusable predicate library .
Your queries , then , consist largely of select and orderby clauses , the filtering logic farmed out to your library .
Here 's a simple example :
public partial class Product { public static Expression < Func < Product , bool >> IsSelling ( ) { return p => !p. Discontinued && p.LastSale > DateTime.Now.AddDays ( - 30 ) ; } }
We can extend this by adding a method that uses PredicateBuilder :
public partial class Product { public static Expression < Func < Product , bool >>
ContainsInDescription ( params string [ ] keywords ) { var predicate = PredicateBuilder .False < Product >( ) ; foreach ( string keyword in keywords ) { string temp = keyword ; predicate = predicate .
Or ( p => p. Description .
Contains ( temp ) ) ; } return predicate ; } }
This offers an excellent balance of simplicity and reusability , as well as separating business logic from expression plumbing logic .
To retrieve all products whose description contains “ BlackBerry ” or “ iPhone ” , along with the Nokias and Ericssons that are selling , you would do this :
var newKids = Product.ContainsInDescription ( " BlackBerry " , " iPhone " ) ; var classics = Product .
ContainsInDescription ( " Nokia " , " Ericsson " ) .
And ( Product . IsSelling ( ) ) ; var query = from p in Data .
Products .
Where ( newKids .
Or ( classics ) ) select p ;
The And and Or methods in boldface resolve to extension methods in PredicateBuilder .
An expression predicate can perform the equivalent of an SQL subquery by referencing association properties .
So , if Product had a child EntitySet called Purchases , we could refine our IsSelling method to return only those products that have sold a minimum number of units as follows :
public static Expression < Func < Product , bool >>
IsSelling ( int minPurchases ) { return prod => ! prod .
Discontinued && prod .
Purchases .
Where ( purch => purch .
Date > DateTime.Now.AddDays ( -30 ) ) . Count ( ) >= minPurchases ; }
Nesting Predicates
Consider the following predicate :
p => p. Price > 100 && p. Price < 1000 && ( p.Description .
Contains ( " foo " ) || p.Description .
Contains ( " far " ) )
Let 's say we wanted to build this dynamically .
The question is , how do we deal with the parenthesis around the two expressions in the last line ?
The answer is to build the parenthesised expression first , and then consume it in the outer expression as follows :
var inner = PredicateBuilder .False < Product >( ) ; inner = inner .
Or ( p => p. Description .
Contains ( " foo " ) ) ; inner = inner .
Or ( p => p. Description .
Contains ( " far " ) ) ; var outer = PredicateBuilder .True < Product >( ) ; outer = outer .
And ( p => p. Price > 100 ) ; outer = outer .
And ( p => p. Price < 1000 ) ; outer = outer .
And ( inner ) ;
Notice that with the inner expression , we start with PredicateBuilder .
False ( because we 're using the Or operator ) .
With the outer expression , however , we start with PredicateBuilder .
True ( because we 're using the And operator ) .
Generic Predicates
Suppose every table in your database has ValidFrom and ValidTo columns as follows :
create table PriceList ( ID int not null primary key , Name nvarchar ( 50 ) not null , ValidFrom datetime , ValidTo datetime )
To retrieve rows valid as of DateTime .
Now ( the most common case ) , you 'd do this :
from p in PriceLists where ( p.ValidFrom == null || p.ValidFrom <= DateTime .Now ) && ( p.ValidTo == null || p.ValidTo >= DateTime .Now ) select p.Name
Of course , that logic in bold is likely to be duplicated across multiple queries !
No problem : let 's define a method in the PriceList class that returns a reusable expression :
public static Expression < Func< PriceList , bool >> IsCurrent ( ) { return p => ( p.ValidFrom == null || p.ValidFrom <= DateTime .Now ) && ( p.ValidTo == null || p.ValidTo >= DateTime .Now ) ; }
OK : our query is now much simpler :
var currentPriceLists = db. PriceLists .
Where ( PriceList. IsCurrent ( ) ) ;
And with PredicateBuilder 's And and Or methods , we can easily introduce other conditions :
var currentPriceLists = db. PriceLists .
Where ( PriceList . IsCurrent ( ) .
And ( p => p.Name.StartsWith ( " A " ) ) ) ;
But what about all the other tables that also have ValidFrom and ValidTo columns ?
We do n't want to repeat our IsCurrent method for every table !
Fortunately , we can generalize our IsCurrent method with generics .
The first step is to define an interface :
public interface IValidFromTo { DateTime ?
ValidFrom { get ; } DateTime ?
ValidTo { get ; } }
Now we can define a single generic IsCurrent method using that interface as a constraint :
public static Expression < Func< TEntity , bool >> IsCurrent < TEntity >( ) where TEntity : IValidFromTo { return e => ( e.ValidFrom == null || e.ValidFrom <= DateTime .Now ) && ( e.ValidTo == null || e.ValidTo >= DateTime .Now ) ; }
The final step is to implement this interface in each class that supports ValidFrom and ValidTo .
If you 're using Visual Studio or a tool like SqlMetal to generate your entity classes , do this in the non-generated half of the partial classes :

Apple , the world 's most successful brand , is being sued by a Los Angeles law firm for " deceptively " marketing the new 20 - inch iMac
Kabateck Brown Kellner says the monitor is " vastly inferior to the previous generation it replaced " , not that you would know it from Apple 's " grossly inflated " claims .
According to the law firm , Apple told consumers both the 20 - inch and 24 - inch iMacs displayed " millions of colors at all resolutions " :
Indeed , the new 24 - inch iMacs display 16,777,216 colors on 8 - bit , in - plane switching ( IPS ) screens , as did the previous generation of 20 - inch iMacs .
But the new 20 - inch iMac monitors do not even come close , displaying 98 % fewer colors ( 262,144 ) .
While Apple describes the display of both the 24 - inch and 20 - inch iMacs as though they were interchangeable , the monitors in each are of radically different technology .
The 20 - inch iMacs feature 6 - bit twisted nematic film ( TN ) LCD screens , the least expensive of its type .
The 20 - inch iMac 's TN screens have a narrower viewing angle , less color depth , less color accuracy and are more susceptible to washout across the screen .
Why does hundreds of thousands , rather than millions , of colours merit a class action ?
According to KBK , the new 20 - inch iMac , the one launched in August 2007 , is :
particularly ill - suited to editing photographs because of the display 's limited color potential and the distorting effect of the color simulation processes .
KBK has filed suit in U.S. District Court , Northern District of California in San Jose - in Apple 's home turf .
Boy are these guys tough , riding shotgun into Silicon Valley , where Apple is a religion , and Steve Jobs is God .
Now for some pleasantly cheap shots from Brian Kabateck of KBK :
Apple is squeezing more profits for itself by using cheap screens and its customers are unwittingly paying the price .
Apple is duping its customers into thinking they 're buying ' new and improved ' when in fact they 're getting stuck with ' new and inferior .
Beneath Apple 's ' good guy ' image is a corporation that takes advantage of its customers .
Our goal is to help those customers who were deceived and make sure Apple tells the truth in the future . "
All very philanthropic , especially coming from a firm that has trousered $ 750 m , some of it for clients , in plaintiff litigation . ®

I had a close friend in high school named Tony with whom I lost touch shortly after graduation .
The last time I saw him , which was over 15 years ago , he had returned to our hometown after a stint in the Marines .
I 'm not sure what just made me think of him , but it suddenly hit me that he was an important contributing factor to my growing acceptance of atheism at the time .
This one 's for you , Tony .
Tony was n't smart in the academic sense .
He never enjoyed school , and his grades were mostly Cs and Ds .
He hid a negative self - concept behind a tough - guy facade .
Tony was one of those guys who somehow managed to mention how much he could bench press into every conversation .
He wrestled for his high school , and this was a source of pride in an otherwise dysfunctional life .
His childhood was no picnic , and Tony 's parents had long ago decided to focus their love and attention on his sister .
His role in the family was to be that of a problem child , one to be fixed rather than celebrated .
That both of Tony 's parents were pastors in the most conservative evangelical church in town would explain some of the hardships he faced and would also have an influence on me .
I met Tony through a mutual friend .
My friend 's mother was an eager congregant in Tony 's parents ' church and dragged him with her a couple times each week .
Tony and my friend bonded over their mutual displeasure over their church experience .
I knew little about this church other than what I heard from them .
I remember learning that speaking in tongues was a regular feature of their services .
Anyway , my friend brought
Tony into our group , and we hit it off immediately .
I saw through his tough exterior almost immediately , and I think he was relieved to be accepted for who he really was rather than what he appeared to be .
We got in more than the usual share of trouble for teenagers at the time , united by a love of heavy metal , drugs , alcohol , fast cars , and girls .
I introduced him to Slayer , and he turned me on to Overkill and King Diamond .
We dabbled in the trappings of Satanism , not because we believed any of it but because we could relate to the rejection of Christianity it entailed .
Of my friends at the time , Tony was the most openly hostile to Christianity .
Given the experiences he'd had with it , this made sense .
He helped me realize that one did n't always need to avoid talking openly about religion .
We were there for each other when there simply was n't anyone else either of us could talk to about much of this .
I vividly recall what happened to Tony when his parents realized what he'd been up to .
Long before then , I was no longer allowed in his house when his parents were around .
That I did not attend their church and looked rather unsavory was more than enough for them to prohibit him from hanging out with me .
But now his parents found some of his metal records , and he was n't allowed to have anything other than Christian music in their home .
After they grounded him for a couple weeks and burned every record he owned in front of him , everything seemed to be resolved .
He retreated to his room in seething anger , feeling that he had little choice but to wait out the grounding before seeing his friends again .
What Tony did n't know was that his ordeal was just beginning .
Late one night after he'd been asleep for hours , Tony was suddenly awakened by dozens of hands grabbing him .
His eyes opened to reveal at least 10 faces looming over him .
He recognized them as his parents and many other adults from their church , mostly men .
They held him down on his bed as he struggled , placing as many men as it took to immobilize each arm and leg , with others pinning his shoulders .
He could not free himself - there were just too many of them .
As his heart raced with terror , the assailants began praying over him .
His parents , along with other pastors ( ever notice how the crazier churches always seem to have an army of pastors ? ) , began to perform an exorcism .
Tony was told that he was possessed by demons and that the group was going to exorcise them by any means necessary .
Prayers , threats , and physical abuse would ensue for several hours .
They continued until near dawn .
Tony was exhausted to the point where he could no longer resist .
He broke .
He told them what they wanted to hear to escape the torture .
He would later tell me that he even acted out what he thought it must look like for demons to leave one 's body .
There was nothing else he could do .
I did n't see Tony for a while .
The next time I saw him , I realized the true toll this experience had taken .
He was not himself anymore .
He was always looking over his shoulder , more uncertain of himself than ever , like a dog who had been beaten one too many times .
His facade had crumbled , and he was no longer sure who he was .
I had never seen him like this before , and I had no idea what to do .
Tony would recover , at least partially , in the months that followed .
But the story does not end well .
Shortly before his high school graduation , Tony 's parents threw him out of their home .
He was not permitted to take anything other than a small duffel bag of clothes , and he had no money .
He lived with assorted friends for a while , but that was not sustainable for more than a couple of months .
Having nowhere else to go and no prospects before him , Tony enlisted in the Marines .
I moved away not long after he enlisted , heading off to college .
I would see him one more time a year or two later while he was on leave and I was visiting family .
Sadly , the Marines had taken the vulnerable shell of a man who had enlisted and filled him with hate .
I barely recognized him .
Everything I had appreciated about him over the years had been stripped away and replaced with racism , cruelty , and hate .
HE could n't seem to complete a sentence without dropping racist or homophobic slurs .
At least now his parents were proud of him .
They were happy to have him return to their home now .
I miss you Tony .
I hope you find yourself someday and that the damage is not permanent .
You influenced me in ways I 'm only just beginning to understand , and although we traveled very different paths , mine was certainly richer for encountering you along the way .
So your good buddy The Geekologie Writer got what is known in the medical field as " f*** ed the f*** up " last night because his wife made the mistake of going out of town for the holiday weekend .
He hit wing night , drank like 300 beers , and then proceeded to sing " Ring Of Fire " at karaoke ( he has a deep , sexy voice just like Cash ) .
Good times .
His hands are still shaking .
Anyway , this is a picture of the Chinese military during a rapid deployment exercise in preparation for the upcoming Olympics .
Because , let 's face it , nothing says " I 'm going for the gold ! " like military personnel dry humping Segways .

WASHINGTON - An EPA official said yesterday there is a distinct possibility the agency will not take action to rid drinking water of a toxic rocket fuel ingredient that has contaminated public water supplies around the country .
Democratic senators called that unacceptable .
They argued that states and local communities should n't have to bear the expense of cleansing their drinking water of perchlorate , which has been found in at least 395 sites in 35 states - or the risk of not doing so .
The toxin interferes with thyroid function and poses developmental health risks , particularly to fetuses .
Benjamin Grumbles , assistant administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency , told a Senate hearing that the EPA is aware that perchlorate is widespread and poses health risks .
But he said that after years of study , the EPA has yet to determine whether regulating perchlorate in drinking water would do much good .
" Is there a meaningful opportunity to reduce risk if we issue a new national regulation on perchlorate ?
We 've been spending a lot of time on that , Madam Chairman , " Grumbles told Senator Barbara Boxer , Democrat of California , chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
" I understand your frustration in how long the process is taking , but we believe it 's important to do the work , " Grumbles said , promising a decision by the end of the year .
" EPA is trying to shunt the scientists to the back , put the [ Department of Defense ] contractors to the front , " Boxer chided .
" We want to see action by the scientists .
We want to see a standard set . "
Grumbles told Boxer it was possible that instead of a regulation , the EPA would issue a public health advisory , which would simply provide information .
After the hearing he told reporters that a decision to regulate perchlorate was also still on the table .
Most perchlorate contamination resulted from Defense Department activities .
The Pentagon could face huge cleanup costs if the EPA sets a national drinking water standard for the contaminant , and the department has tussled with the EPA over the issue , according to a report last week by congressional investigators .
Perchlorate is particularly widespread in California and the Southwest , where it's been found in groundwater and in the Colorado River , a drinking water source for 20 million people .
It 's also been found in lettuce and other foods .
The dispute over the federal government 's response has been longstanding .
The EPA in 2005 issued a safety standard for the chemical of 24.5 parts per billion that was criticized as " not protective " by EPA 's own Children 's Health Protection Advisory Committee .
The safety standard indicates what the EPA considers a safe exposure level and guides Superfund cleanups , but the agency still did n't move forward with a drinking water standard .
In absence of that , states acted on their own .
In 2007 , California adopted a drinking water standard of 6 parts per billion .
Massachusetts has set a drinking water standard of 2 parts per billion .

Taking time to invest in others requires just that : time .
You can not get very far in any relationship without putting time into it .
If you are parent , take the time to parent well .
Take time to get into the lives and hearts and minds of your kids .
Learn about the things they care about ; listen to the things they fear or excited about .
Take your kids to their favorite park or read a great book with them before bed each night .
Time is one of the best ways you can invest into children .
If you are not a parent , find ways to interact with children .
Offer to take the kids of your friends or neighbors for an evening .
Take time to play games , go for walks , eat dessert or read books with kids .
Invest yourself into the future of our country .
The second biggest type of thinking mistake is low self - esteem .
Self - esteem means you believe in yourself and believe that you have the power to learn new things and get things accomplished .
If you suffer from low self - esteem , you will not learn how to speed read because if you don`t believe in your ability to learn , you will unconsciously do everything in your power to prove to yourself , once again , what a loser you are !
Beliefs drive all your thinking , and you ’re thinking drives all your behaviors and decisions .
Some of you are probably thinking that you are parents and that is n’t that enough of a contribution to make to the next generation ?
Being a parent is one of the most obvious and perhaps best ways to invest in children , but it is not the only way .
All adults , parents or not , have the ability and the responsibility to make life better for educational psychology .
I believe we have this incredible job to do , that we have the task of spending our lives on things that make life better for others .
Yet the havoc the little ones could cause was not really the problem .
I feared they would hate me .
What was I to do with them ?
I was never good at babysitting and most people thought I was too serious and boring .
Getting along with Joel was easy .
She was sweet and gentle .
She even gave her mineral water to another girl who was thirsty .
I was so proud of her I could not bear not to show it , and it was easy to tell she was pleased .
Though she seemed to want to shy away out of embarrassment at my outright admiration , the flushing of her cheeks could not hide the fact that her eyes were dancing .
What choices will you and I make if faced with similar conditions ?
Houston made the choice to survive many times , though life handed her injustice , humiliation and prejudice .
Thus , it ’s only fitting that she closes her book with the recollection of her father ’s kind of defiant spirit .
Why did I buy those books ?
Because I , like so many people looking for a way out of financial quicksand , have often just thrown up my hands and wished someone with more brains than me would give me a plan and tell me what to do .

Stung by rising gasoline and food prices , Americans are finding creative ways to cut costs on routine items like groceries and clothing , forcing retailers , restaurants and manufacturers to decode the tastes of a suddenly thrifty public .
Spending data and interviews around the country show that middle - and working - class consumers are starting to switch from name brands to cheaper alternatives , to eat in instead of dining out and to fly at unusual hours to shave dollars off airfares .
Though seemingly small , the daily trade - offs they are making — more pasta and less red meat , more video rentals and fewer movie tickets — amount to an important shift in consumer behavior .
In Ohio , Holly Levitsky is replacing the Lucky Charms cereal in her kitchen with Millville Marshmallows and Stars , a less expensive store brand .
In New Hampshire , George Goulet is no longer booking hotel rooms at the Hilton , favoring the lower - cost Hampton Inn .
And in Michigan , Jennifer Olden is buying Gain laundry detergent instead of the full - price Tide .
Behind the belt - tightening — and brand - swapping — is the collision of several economic forces that are pinching people ’s budgets or , at least , leaving them in little mood to splurge .
The price of household necessities has surged , with milk topping $ 4 a gallon in many stores and regular gasoline closing in on $ 3.60 a gallon nationwide .
Home prices are sliding , wages are stagnant , job losses are growing and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index , a broad measure of stock performance , is down 6 percent in the last year .
So consumers are going on a recession diet .
Burt Flickinger , a longtime retail consultant , said the last time he saw such significant changes in consumer buying patterns was the late 1970s , when runaway inflation prompted Americans to “ switch from red meat to pork to poultry to pasta — then to peanut butter and jelly . ”
“ It has n’t gotten to human food mixed with pet food yet , ” he said , “ but it is certainly headed in that direction . ”
Retail sales figures and consumer surveys confirm that Americans are strategically cutting corners , whether it is at the coffee house or the airport .
( In : brewing coffee at home and flying coach .
Out : Starbucks and first class . )
In March , Americans spent less on women ’s clothing ( down 4.9 percent ) , furniture ( 3.1 percent ) , luxury goods ( 1.3 percent ) and airline tickets ( 1.1 percent ) compared with a year ago , according to MasterCard SpendingPulse , a service of the credit card company that measures spending on 300 million of its cards and estimates purchases with other cards , cash and checks .
Wal - Mart Stores reports stronger - than - usual sales of peanut butter and spaghetti , while restaurants like Domino ’s Pizza and Ruby Tuesday have suffered a falloff in orders , suggesting that many Americans are sticking to low - cost home - cooked meals .
Over the last year , purchases of brand name cookies and crackers have fallen , according to Information Resources , which tracks retail sales .
Sales of Nabisco graham crackers have dropped 7.5 percent , and Keebler Fudge Shoppe cookies have slipped by 12.3 percent .
Not even beer is immune .
Sales of inexpensive domestic beers , like Keystone Light , are up ; sales of higher - price imports , like Corona Extra , are down , the firm said .
Some are skipping drinks altogether .
The number of people ordering an alcoholic drink fell to 31 percent last month from 42 percent last summer , according to a survey of 2,500 people conducted by Technomic , a restaurant industry consulting firm .
“ People have started to shift spending as if we were in a recession , ” said Michael McNamara , vice president for research and analysis at MasterCard .
Such trade - offs were on vivid display last week in Ohio , where layoffs have been rampant .
At Save - A - Lot , a discount grocery store in Cleveland , Teresa Rutherford , 51 , chided her sister - in - law , Donna Dunaway , 44 , for picking up a package of Sara Lee honey ham ( eight ounces for $ 2.49 ) .
“ We ca n’t afford that ! ” she said .
“ Get the cheap stuff . ”
They settled on a 16 - ounce package of Deli Pleasures ham for $ 3.29 , or 34 percent less an ounce .
The women said that soaring prices for food and fuel had changed what they buy and where they buy it .
“ We used to eat out at Bob Evans or Denny ’s once a month , ” said Ms. Rutherford , who works in an auto - parts factory .
“ Now we do n’t go out at all .
We eat in all the time . ”
Ms. Dunaway , a homemaker , used to splurge on the ingredients for homemade lasagna , her husband ’s favorite , before food prices began to surge this year .
“ Now he ’s lucky to get a 99 - cent lasagna TV dinner , or maybe some Manwich out of a can , ” she said .
“ I just ca n’t afford to be buying all that good meat and cheese like I used to . ”
By no means has the economic downturn been bad for all product categories .
For instance , sales of big - ticket electronics , like $ 1,000 flat - panel televisions and $ 300 video game systems , are on the rise , according to retailers and research firms .
Falling prices for such devices and a looming government deadline to convert to digital television have helped .
So has the view , sensible or not , that the technology is a good investment .
At a Best Buy in Southfield , Mich. , James Szekely , 28 , a mechanical engineer , was shopping for a big high - definition TV that he expected would cost at least $ 2,000 , an expense he rationalized because “ at least we can watch movies at home . ”
( In a survey conducted this month by the NPD Group , a research firm , consumers suggested that they would sooner cut spending on clothing , furniture and eating out than on video games . )
At Home Depot , sinks and faucets are selling briskly .
Managers at the chain suspect that consumers , loath to spend money on a splashy kitchen renovation or new roof , are settling for a cheaper bathroom “ refresh . ”
Another top seller at home improvement stores : programmable thermostats and insulation , which can cut fuel bills .
Many retailers are struggling to adjust to the new needs .
Clothing sales have started to sink at department stores like Macy ’s , Kohl ’s and J. C. Penney .
So have furniture sales at companies like Bombay and Domain , both of which have filed for bankruptcy protection .
Consumers are spurning small indulgences .
Starbucks is warning of a drop - off in purchases , and sales have dipped at higher - end restaurant chains , including the steakhouses Ruth ’s Chris and Morton’s .
To drum up business , Domino ’s is offering a new deal : three 10 - inch pizzas for $ 4 each .
“ We are not recession - proof , ” said the chain ’s president , J. Patrick Doyle .
But chains that emphasize low prices , like TJ Maxx and Wal - Mart , are thriving .
And cut -rate supermarkets , like Save - A - Lot , are swamped .
“ People are not not spending , but they are changing how they spend , ” said Marshal Cohen , chief analyst at the NPD Group .
And they are often willing to sacrifice convenience or swallow their pride .
George Goulet , 52 , the business traveler switching from the Hilton to the Hampton Inn , now books flights that depart in the afternoon rather than the early morning .
“ It ’s a lot cheaper , ” he said .
“ I can really see the difference . ”
Mary Gregory , 55 , a telephone company operator in Cleveland , used to eat red meat at least once a week .
Now it is hardly ever on her menu .
“ I usually buy turkey instead , ” she said .
“ Any recipe that calls for meat , like chili or spaghetti , I try to substitute turkey . ”
Carl Hall , a retired construction worker in Detroit , wants to buy a fence for his backyard .
But he decided not to buy a finished product at Lowe ’s , the home improvement chain where he was shopping recently .
With money tight , “ I am looking to put it together myself , ” he said , adding that he hoped to save $ 200 .
As the compromises mount , people are even coming up with clever schemes to hide their cost - cutting .
Holly Levitsky , a 56 - year - old supermarket cashier in Cleveland , buys a brand of steak sauce called Briargate for 85 cents and surreptitiously pours it into an A1 steak sauce bottle she keeps at home .
“ My husband ca n’t even tell the difference , ” she said .

The Mathematics Of Prison
The Washington Supreme Court ruled July 17 that police cannot arrest passengers simply for being in a car that smells of marijuana .
The unanimous decision overturned a 29 - year - old precedent allowing police to search or arrest passengers if they smelled pot near a car .
The case , State v. Grande , began with a 2006 traffic stop in Skagit County .
Driver Lacee Hurley and passenger Jeremy Grande were arrested by a state trooper during a traffic stop after he smelled pot coming from their car .
The trooper searched the pair , finding a pipe and a small amount of pot on Grande .
Both were charged with drug offenses .
At a pretrial hearing , Grande 's judge ruled there was no specific probable cause for his arrest and suppressed the evidence .
But the Skagit County Superior Court overturned that ruling , citing a 1979 appellate court ruling saying the smell of pot smoke coming from a car was probable cause to arrest all the occupants .
But the state Supreme Court said federal case law since 1979 has eroded the legal footing of that decision .
Officers need additional evidence that each passenger broke the law , the court held .
" Our cases have strongly and rightfully protected our constitution 's protection of individual privacy .
The protections ... do not fade away or disappear within the confines of an automobile , " Justice Charles Johnson wrote for the court .
" We hold that the smell of marijuana in the general area where an individual is located is insufficient , without more , to support probable cause for arrest .
Where no other evidence exists linking the passenger to any criminal activity , an arrest of the passenger on the suspicion of possession of illegal substances , and any subsequent searches , is invalid and an unconstitutional invasion of that individual 's right to privacy , " the opinion concluded .
The ruling won quick praise from drug reformers and civil libertarians .
" As a general statement , it 's a step back from the direction that our government has been going as we 're veering into a sort of surveillance society , " Alison Holcomb of the American Civil Liberties Union 's Washington chapter told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
" It strikes me as refreshing that the court has reaffirmed the values that our constitution calls for . "
Seattle Hempfest organizer Vivian McPeak told the newspaper it was not uncommon for people to be arrested , jailed , stigmatized , and have their property seized simply for being in a vehicle with someone carrying or smoking pot .
" A lot of people have gone down because of these vehicle offenses , " he said .
" Being in a car used to be one of those wrong - place , wrong - time kind of situations . "
Grande 's attorney , David Zuckerman , cheered the ruling , but added it was " unfortunate " it took so long to overturn previous state case law on drug - smell arrests .
" I think it 's led to an awful lot of innocent people getting handcuffed by the side of the road just because they happened to be in a car that smells of marijuana , " Zuckerman said .
Viacom wants to know what you are watching on YouTube
July 2 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
The beginning of the end , via Wired on July 2 , 2008 :
Google will have to turn over every record of every video watched by YouTube users , including users ’ names and IP addresses , to Viacom , which is suing Google for allowing clips of its copyrighted videos to appear on YouTube , a judge ruled Wednesday .
Sure , right now they are just suing Google and Youtube , but Jammie Thomas probably has a different perspective on where this can lead .
Via Wired on June 30 , 2008 :
The Recording Industry Association of America on Monday urged a federal judge to leave intact a $ 222,000 jury verdict against Jammie Thomas , the Minnesota mother of two who has become a public symbol of the RIAA ’s litigation campaign of more than 20,000 copyright lawsuits against peer - to - peer file sharers .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has more about the Video Privacy Protection Act and the recent decision against YouTube :
In any event , the court ordered production of not just IP addresses , but also all the associated information in the Logging database .
Whatever might be said about ‘ an IP address without additional information , ’ the the AOL search history leak fiasco shows that the material viewed by a user alone can be sufficient to identify the user , even with neither a login nor an IP address .
The Court ’s erroneous ruling is a set - back to privacy rights , and will allow Viacom to see what you are watching on YouTube .
We urge Google to take all steps necessary to challenge this order and protect the rights of its users .
The twit thinks running around like the room ’s on fire is a perfectly appropriate response to this news .
update : From the BBC on July 3 , 2008 :
While the legal battle between the two firms is being contested in the US , it is thought the ruling will apply to YouTube users and their viewing habits everywhere .
…
Leading privacy expert Simon Davies told BBC
News that the privacy of millions of YouTube users was threatened .
He said : “ The chickens have come home to roost for Google .
“ Their arrogance and refusal to listen to friendly advice has resulted in the privacy of tens of millions being placed under threat . ”
Mr Davies said privacy campaigners had warned Google for years that IP addresses were personally identifiable information .
Google pledged last year to anonymise IP addresses for search information but it has said nothing about YouTube data .
update : From the Guardian on July 4 , 2008 :
The court ’s decision also means that Viacom has succeeded in getting hold of exactly the same sort information that the American government has failed to access in the past .
In 2006 , the US department of justice asked Google to reveal information on millions of web searches conducted on its website , as part of a wide - ranging investigation into illegal activity online .
Google challenged the order and successfully fought it off in court , arguing that such a move would invade users ’ privacy and expose commercially sensitive information .
In a statement yesterday , Google said it would lobby for the data it provides to be scrubbed clean of personal information .
update : From the International Herald Tribune on July 4 , 2008 :
Google and Viacom said they were hoping to come up with a way to protect the anonymity of the site ’s visitors .
Viacom also said that the information would be safeguarded by a protective order restricting access to the data to outside lawyers , who will use it solely to press Viacom ’s $ 1 billion copyright lawsuit against Google .
Still , the judge ’s order , made public late Wednesday , renewed concerns among privacy advocates that Internet companies like Google are collecting unprecedented amounts of private information that could be misused or fall unexpectedly into the hands of third parties .
“ These very large databases of transactional information become honey pots for law enforcement or for litigants , ” said Chris Hoofnagle , a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology . …
The amount of data covered by the order is staggering , as it includes every video watched on YouTube since its founding in 2005 .
In April alone , 82 million people in the United States watched 4.1 billion clips there , according to comScore , a market research firm that tracks Internet use .
Some experts say virtually every Internet user has visited YouTube .
While the current lawsuit may only be aimed at Google to show how much copyright - infringing material is on YouTube as compared to “ user generated ” content , since the information identifying users exists , it seems logical that the next series of lawsuits would be related to making Google produce those records so Viacom can then go after individual violators like the RIAA has .
Not to get paranoid or anything , but these are gigantic corporations we ’re talking about …
The twit would love to join a class action lawsuit against Google if anyone ’s got one …
Via Forbes on July 3 , 2008 :
Marc Rotenberg , director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) , is n’t satisfied by the ostensible legal walls protecting Google ’s data .
“ I do n’t think anyone ’s arguing that Viacom ’s planning to make any other use of the data [ than proving copyright infringement . ]
But that should n’t obscure the fact that Google says its data remains in its control and is n’t given to third parties , and that ’s simply not true . ” … EPIC ’s Rotenberg says the court ruling Wednesday confirms the dangers of tracking Web users ’ behavior too closely .
“ This is exactly the problem we ’ve been describing for years , ” he says .
“ Google retains too much information about users , and as a consequence , has placed privacy at risk . ”
Just tell a twit where to sign …
Thankfully , it looks like the EU has laws with some teeth , so please get on it y’all , you can do this :
The EU ’s Article 29 Data Protection Working Party concluded earlier this year that companies such as Google , Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc must cut the time they keep the data to comply with EU privacy laws .
The group had earlier told Google it may be violating EU privacy laws by preserving user data for as long as two years .
In the meantime , here ’s a suggestion about how to protect your user information :
Reacting to the case , Data Commissioner Billy Hawkes reminded web users to ensure they remove all personal information from the web , when possible .
“ As users , we must take responsibility to use the tools available to us to guard our privacy .
This includes availing of the option to delete your search history on search engines and , indeed , the history of videos viewed on websites such as YouTube , ” said Mr Hawkes .
Changing your UserID at Youtube would be another precaution , if it contains personally identifiable information :
Although the judge cited a post on the Official Google Blog , which stated that in most cases an IP address and user name are n’t enough to identify a user , that assertion is n’t entirely accurate , according to Orin Kerr , a law professor at George Washington University and an expert in digital privacy .
Many people include parts of their name , their birthday or other personal information in their user IDs on the Internet , which could be used to identify a user , he said .
Whether these kinds of steps are too little , too late remains to be seen …
The twit does have a theory , not intended as legal advice in any way , but in thinking about the concept of “ fair use , ” the exception to copyright infringement , it has always seemed that due to the limitation on the length a video can be at the site , as well as the ability to comment at YouTube , what may look on the surface as boldfaced copyright infringement may actually be protected activity , since all of the videos are subject to comment , criticism and all those lovely things that flow as an exception to the draconian copyright laws .
This would be different than p2 p file sharing that just transfers copyrighted music files , because YouTube is a forum for discussion .
and here is the twit ’s favorite cartoon mash - up about “ fair use ” and copyright law :
update : The BBC reports on July 15 , 2008 that Viacom has backed down :
“ We are pleased to report that Viacom , MTV and other litigants have backed off their original demand for all users ’ viewing histories and we will not be providing that information , ” said a statement on the YouTube blog .
The decision will be welcomed by privacy activists , many of whom expressed concern over a US judge ’s order for Google to provide the data in early July .
not that the concern goes away just because Viacom has decided to stand down for now .
After all , they still won the legal authority to obtain access to the viewing histories .
And besides , they do n’t seem to need it right now to sue Google .
They would only need it to sue individual YouTube users , so they certainly have the time to wait and see how their lawsuit with Google turns out , without having to fight over this kind of legal issue right now .
It does seem possible that if Google and Youtube win and avoid any liability for alleged copyright infringement , individual users would be the logical next target for Viacom …
There 's really not a much gentler way to phrase it :
The biggest name in breakfast foods and among the most iconic names in toys have put their ingenuity and marketing genius together to create a fruit - flavored treat -- LEGO Fun Snacks -- that is so mind - numbingly irresponsible that at first I presumed it was a joke .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
We 're talking about a children 's snack shaped like the tiny plastic building blocks that every kid fortunate enough to have toys has put in his or her mouth at one time or another -- or a hundred .
( The only thing my kids like better than LEGOS is watching videos of " Star Wars " characters made out of LEGOS . )
The Web site Penny Arcade threw the penalty flag yesterday :
I would love to know what sick ( person ) at Kellogg 's came up with this genius idea .
I just spent the first three years of my son's life trying to get him not to eat blocks , and now you 're telling him they taste like strawberries .
Thanks a lot .
Seriously , how in the hell did this ever get past their legal department ?
You can't tell me that this is n't a lawsuit just waiting to happen .
I can only assume that their next product is fruit flavored thumbtacks .
My initial thought was that it had to be some kind of hoax or Onion story , but a jump over to the Kellogg 's Web site showed that 's not the case .
The mere idea of a LEGO - shaped snack reminded me of this hilariously effective 2004 Super Bowl commercial that pilloried the tobacco industry .
When I sent the Penny Arcade link around the office this morning , other parents were quick to offer their own ideas for killer snacks : Paint Chip Flakes and Chewable Barbie Shoes being my favorites .
There 's a wide - ranging discussion of the matter over at Reddit .
And , if training children to eat plastic blocks is n't enough to rile you , there 's another major flaw with this LEGO / Kellogg 's product :
The gelatinous blocks do not stack , a design flaw highlighted in this video by a couple of foul - mouthed grownups .
While a little Googling shows that the two companies have been taking relatively mild flack about this product since at least last year , here 's a prediction : LEGO Fun Snacks wo n't be on grocery shelves for much longer .
See my previous post on Web 2.1 : How OpenID will rescue Web 2.0 where I wax lyrical on how great it will be when I can have a single ID and use it everywhere .
Well , I still think it is a good idea , and I still think it is the right approach , but I am considerably more disappointed about the level of support .
The asymmetry of the support bugs me .
It seems that there are many providers who say “ yes , our ID ’s are open IDs ” but then they do n’t accept anyone else ’s open ID .
WordPress is one of those .
My wordpress ID is an open ID , but I can not use any other .
Obviously with this kind of support , I ca n’t just have one OpenID , which is the whole point .
I recently hit a Web 2.0 service I use occasionally — I will keep them anonymous for now — and noticed a new “ Log in with Open Id ” button .
Great !
This is what I am looking for .
I have a log - in ID there , but this would be my chance to ditch it , and use my open id instead .
I click the button , and what happens is not what I expected .
I use MyOpenID.com , which asks for a confirmation , so did so , and then got another screen saying that the application was asking for some additional information .
Seems fair enough to share a little information about myself , but I was more curious about what kind of information it was using .
I clicked OK , and then I was presented with a standard “ register ” screen with a few of my details filled in .
Not sure why I needed to do this , but I will go along with it .
I do expect the application to keep a couple of details about me , so no problem .
Then it told me “ that user ID already taken ” .
Apparently , the service was not really using my open
Id as an ID at their site .
Instead , they use the openID provider just as an aid to set up a local account .
They should realize , that only the full OpenID is guaranteed to be unique .
Using a value from my provider as a local ID is not guaranteed to be unique , and therefor is not a good ID .
Conclusion :
To let people access a site with an OpenID , you have to actually use the OpenID as an ID .
There is no short cut , and ironically , there is nothing easier either .
By the way , after I wrote the Web 2.1 article , I saw a great talk by a speaker at SOA World on the subject .
I asked for the slides , but have not gotten them yet .
He pointed out some potential problems , and I hope to cover them here .. when I get those slides 🙂
Moody Gardens changes story : Snake did escape Moody Gardens officials admit snake left its tank
But they did n't evacuate the area during incident earlier this month

GALVESTON -- Managers at the Moody Gardens Rainforest acknowledged Wednesday that a venomous snake escaped from its tank near the facility 's public entrance when its whereabouts could not be accounted for earlier this month .
But managers never evacuated the rainforest or closed that portion of the facility to the public because they said they had no reason to think the snake had slithered outside its enclosure — even though they could not find the animal for nearly two days .
The 10 - inch African bush viper was later found lying on top of the tank .
It settled on a metal screen in the ceiling beside a grated light fixture above its enclosure , managers said Wednesday .
They say they still have no idea how the snake got out of the enclosure and up into the ceiling .
The revelation contradicted Moody Gardens ' previous explanations for the incident .
Spokeswoman Jerri Hamachek told the Houston Chronicle three weeks ago that the snake never ventured outside its " exhibit " and never posed any danger to the public , but said nothing about the snake going up into the ceiling .
" Snakes camouflage , and that 's what he was doing , " Hamachek told the newspaper on July 9 .
The Chronicle confronted managers and Hamachek after receiving a tip that the initial explanation was incorrect .
Hamachek said Wednesday that she was unaware at the time of the interview that the snake was found outside its enclosure in an area with no foliage where it could not camouflage itself .
She said she just wanted to assure the public the snake had been recaptured .
Moody Gardens officials did not contact the Chronicle to offer the correct version of how the snake was discovered because they did not think it was important , animal husbandry manager Greg Whittaker said .
Managers were reluctant to say Wednesday whether the snake 's jaunt outside its tank actually posed any risk to Moody Gardens ' visitors .
They insisted safety is a top priority .
" Employee safety and guest safety is the No. 1 thing to us , " said general manager John Zendt .
Staff likely faced the biggest risk when they combed through the exhibit looking for the snake , Whittaker said .
However , Moody Gardens said it will respond more aggressively if a venomous snake ever vanishes again .
" I think that stepping up our speed at which we completely tear an exhibit apart to find the animal is going to change , " Whittaker said .
" Part of that will be closing down that area to the public while we do that process . "
Moody Gardens ' officials said they initially were confident the snake had not escaped from its enclosure because they found no spaces the animal could have used as an exit .
The African bush viper , which is light green , blends in well with trees and foliage .
It frequently climbs trees and sleeps .
But finding the snake near the light fixture up in the ceiling " was a surprise , " Whittaker said .
The African bush viper 's bite is not deadly , but can be extremely painful , said one expert who has been bitten by such snakes four times .
" A bush viper would only be dangerous , I would say , to a small child .
To an adult , it would be like suffering several bee stings , " said Van Wallach , a curatorial assistant with Harvard University 's Museum of Comparative Zoology .
" They 're very painful at first -- it 's excruciating pain , " Wallach said .
" There 's a burning sensation that 's immediate . "
One such bite that Wallach suffered , which blasted him with an unusually large dose of venom , caused him to become delirious for three days .
The swelling and discoloration on his hand eventually spread to his arm , chest and stomach , lasting for about a month .
There is no anti-venom made specifically to counter the ill effects of a bush viper 's bite because the wounds are not known to be fatal , Wallach said .
Small snakes , such as the 10 - inch troublemaker that caused the recent scare , can wiggle through the tiniest holes , Wallach said .
" They do n't have any breastbones , so they can squeeze their bodies through amazing spaces , " Wallach said .
The snake that escaped at Moody Gardens has since been returned to its small tank -- which spans 18 square feet and stands 6 feet tall -- where it shares space with two other bush vipers and three Gaboon vipers .
Employees have installed additional locks and fortified the grate , Whittaker said .
The tank is near the public entrance of the rainforest .
Adults and small children frequently venture up to its window to peer inside , as was the case with several visitors Wednesday .
Moody Gardens now has 16 snakes on display to the public .
Others are held " off exhibit " away from public view for breeding purposes or other reasons , Whittaker said .

The next blow from high energy prices could come in the dead of winter .
Utilities and industry analysts estimate that it will cost families 30 % to 50 % more to heat their homes with natural gas this winter .
Families who use heating oil could face increases of between 50 % and 100 % .
That is altering the math for consumers and energy companies ...
Everyone hopes to leave a legacy .
To be remembered after our passing is the closest thing humans have to immortality , at least until cryogenics figures out how to reanimate Walt Disney 's head .
Some people try to pull off immortality with a lifetime of achievements and noble acts .
But why piss away all that energy on altruism when you can simply spout one badass quote before you take the dirt nap and live on through eternity known as a guy who needed a second casket for his balls ?

You may know the term " Hoosier " ( meaning people from Indiana ) from that Gene Hackman movie about the basketball team .
Apparently people from there are really good at teamwork and jump shots , and really bad at executing people quickly .

Now , far be it from us to glorify the defiance of a convicted serial killer , but Carl Panzram did make an interesting point about the mire of bureaucracy versus individual enterprise .
If the guy you 're executing thinks you 're taking too long , you need to rethink the process .
Or perhaps Carl was just angry as fuck and wanted to shout something before he was hanged .

Sitting Bull is of course best known for leading the Sioux tribe in their righteous whooping of General Custer 's troops at the Battle of Little Bighorn .

In 1890 the US Department of Extracting Blood From a Stone sent officials after Sitting Bull , out of fear he was going to stir up resistance among the Sioux in the area .
Faced with 43 members of the Indian Affairs police , Sitting Bull refused to leave with them .
He issued the above statement and somebody started shooting and things went downhill from there .

Bull deserves double credit in this entry because he was also responsible for Custer 's reputedly hilarious last words of " Hurrah , Boys !

The 1880s did n't exactly embrace labor unions and based on some shaky evidence , George Engel was convicted for his role in a labor riot ( resulting in the death of multiple policemen ) and sentenced to be hanged .
Upon hearing that letters were sent to the Illinois governor requesting clemency on his behalf , he wrote his own letter asserting those wishes be ignored .
It seemed a bit extreme , but when you have something this awesome to shout from the gallows you'd be loathe to dismiss it too .

According to colonial law , a person who refused to plead innocent or guilty of a crime could not be tried .
This was particularly vexing to the courts when they had people accused of witchcraft , since they were n't going to torch themselves .

Their remedy for this was " peine forte et dure " , the process where the accused was slowly compacted by rocks until a plea was entered .
" Tough love " was pretty new back then and clearly had some refining left .
Giles Corey , knowing he would n't be afforded a fair trial , challenged every plea request with the above " More weight , " as in , " add more stones . "
He did this literally down to his last breath .
No matter how enormous the rocks they stacked on Giles , it 's evident he was carrying the largest stones in the room before he even walked in .

The Norwegian press is reporting that Kaja Bordevich Ballo , aged 20 , the daughter of Norwegian MP Olav Gunnar Ballo , committed suicide two weeks ago after taking a Scientology personality test .
The family blames the Church of Scientology for her death and decided to go public with the story , after the test results and a suicide note were discovered after Ballo 's death .
On March 28 , 2008 , Ballo , a student at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis located in Nice , France , took the Scientology personality test .
A few hours later she reportedly killed herself by jumping from the window of her dormitory .
Her friends and roommates claim she was in good spirits and showed no signs of a mental break down or depression prior to taking the test .
The test was stamped and dated by the Church just hours prior to her suicide .
" I believe Kaja would have been alive today if she had not gone to the Scientologists , " says friend and fellow student Henrik Møinichen , 19 , to Dagbladet .
The information about the Scientology test has been made public through the priest 's speech at the memorial service .
I can confirm that .
Due to the recency of her death , I do n't wish to elaborate on or comment on other matters now .
— Olav Gunnar Ballo
" The information about the Scientology test has been made public through the priest 's speech at the memorial service .
I can confirm that .
Due to the recency of her death , I do n't wish to elaborate on or comment on other matters now , " said Olav in a statement to the press .
The Church , which is located only meters from Ballo 's dormitory , states that the results had shown Ballo was " depressed , irresponsible , hyper- critical and lacking in harmony . "
They also state that it is " unfair to blame Scientology " for Ballo 's death and that the test had nothing to do with it .
Ballo left behind a note telling her family she was sorry for not " being good for anything . "
The incident has generated criticism against the Church from friends , family members and politicians .
Inga Marte Thorkildsen , one of the members of Norway 's Parliament , told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet that " All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja 's choice to take her own life . "
Matthias Fosse , information chief for the Church of Scientology in Norway , rejected any links connection between Scientology and Ballo 's suicide , and denied that the personality test was " dangerous " , saying that millions of people have taken it .
The Church of Scientology also pointed out Ballo 's history of psychological issues and an eating disorder that she had experienced in her early teenage years .
The Church has since removed the test from its Norwegian website .

So with Al Gore calling for 100 % renewable energy in 10 years a lot of people might wonder where the heck we are going to get all that energy from ( if we are not using coal / oil / gas ) .
Well my friends take a gander .
What you see below is where we are going to get all that energy .
As you can see America has some amazing wind resources .
Most of the east coast , the great lakes , and the entire middle of the country are EXCELLENT wind resources .
Many places in the west and even some places in the south west are commercially feasible sources .
The upper mid-west has been called the Saudi Arabia of wind .
There is enough wind going through there on a daily basis to power much of this country ( if not all of it on some days ) .
The real problem however is not space ( anyone who has been there knows there is space ) , and it is not NIMBY land owners ( the ranchers and farmers would love to get extra revenue from their lands ) the problem is transmission .
There are few major cities in that area , and even fewer heavy duty low loss transmission lines .
To tap this excellent resource the government would have to invest in transmission lines , or make it easy for private companies to do so .
We have the technology , we have the turbines , we even have the market forces to make it happen .
What we do n’t have is a policy that encourages it .
American could certainly use the jobs however …
America also has a superb solar resource .
Almost every single square inch of this country is suitable for home scale solar .
Only the darkest parts of Alaska are unsuitable for home scale solar ( even then some solar thermal would work ) .
However if we are talking major solar projects , utility scale in the 100’s of megawatts , then we are most likely talking concentrated PV , and concentrated solar thermal .
That means the south west .
Several entire states rate as very plentiful solar areas .
Again the problem is not space , or Not In My Back Yard activists ( the desert is largely federal land , and empty ) , it is transmission , and lack of effective policy .
Again we have the technology , this would not need a large research push , we have everything we need .
We know how to build the collectors , we know how to build the transmission lines , we simply need to do it .
A policy that mandates renewable energy sources would mean that the billions of dollars we currently ship off to the middle east , and other politically unstable areas , would instead be going to create jobs here in the united states .
Geothermal is the forgotten player in the renewable energy game .
But as you can see almost every single square inch of this country is suitable for home scale geothermal heat extraction .
That means that if you wanted ( and could afford to do so ) you could almost certainly heat your home fuel free from the ground .
However if you are really interested in large scale geothermal you would head west , and some places in the upper east , and even a patch or two in Texas / Louisiana .
What is not shown on this map is that Hawaii could be the hydrogen production capital of the world if it simply used its ample geothermal energy ( cough most active volcano on earth cough ) to make hydrogen from sea water .
It could also use the geothermal energy is has under it to power itself , making it the only energy self sufficient state ( not to mention Hawaii has excellent solar and wind resources as well ) .
Geothermal may be a little lacking in technology , but with the right encouragement from the government it could become an excellent base load generator , again it would need investment in transmission .
Most people when they think of renewable energy do not think of biomass .
Biomass , to put it simply , is anything that grows that you can burn .
This includes things like left over farm waste , switch grass , wood chips from logging , sugar cane waste and things like municipal yard wastes .
It also includes things like pig shit , cow shit , and maybe even human shit .
When you get a lot of poo together you can digest it using bacteria and then burn the resulting methane gas .
Biomass is great because you can store it up and burn it when you need it .
As you can see there are plenty of places all over this nation that produce a lot of biomass , and this map does not include the potential for human / pig / cow / chicken waste gas creation .
With a little rail transport , and a couple of storage areas we would be all set .
Biomass is one of the easiest to implement technology because when it comes right down to it , its just burning stuff .
Say it ’s ten years from now and we have followed Al Gores excellent suggestion and most of our country is powered by wind and solar with geothermal base load backup in areas that can sustain it .
This works well because whenever it ’s not windy in one place it is windy some place else , and our high tech transmission system ( that we built ) can route the power around .
However what if it ’s a calm day in a lot of places , and maybe the sun is only shinning in a couple places , and we need a little boost , well thats when we fire up the quick start biomass plants and burn a couple hundred tonnes of old corn waste and pig shit gas .
Tada !
Renewable energy powered country , screw you oil barons .
But wait you say , is n’t burning stuff dirty and going to cause more global warming ?
Well lucky for us biomass is carbon neutral .
All the carbon put into the air by burning the plant waste , is the same carbon the plants sucked up , so you are just recycling the carbon already in the air .
Some people even claim that biomass , if done right , can be carbon negative , that is you suck a little carbon out of the air in each grow / harvest / burn cycle .
But this has yet to be conclusively proven ( at least in my opinion ) .
As far as air pollution goes , there are several biomass plants in Europe that are sparkling clean , and use a particulate trap to make sure the only things that enter the air meet strict regulations .
Here is a video of how some German scientists are using a similar approach to prove that wind / solar / biomass can provide all of their countries power power .
So there you have it , with a couple hundred billion dollars , the creation of a couple hundred thousand American jobs , and a little rethinking of how we run this nations energy grid we could be 100 % carbon neutral using only 4 simple technologies .
Of course this would be EVEN easier if we had mandates for more efficient electric cars , more efficient construction standards , and more efficient rules for energy use of commercial products , but hey when has America ever done thing the easy way .
Easy or hard , this solution will work .
It will work with technology we have on the shelves today .
We do not need to wait 50 years for the hydrogen economy to get here , we do n’t need to do more studies , we do n’t need to wait for anything .
What we need is strong government policies , and a large investment in American prosperity in the form of jobs and domestic spending .

SHANGHAI  China said the number of Internet users in the country reached about 253 million last month , putting it ahead of the United States as the world ’s biggest Internet market .
The estimate , based on a national phone survey and released on Thursday by the China Internet Network Information Center in Beijing , showed a powerful surge in Internet adoption in this country over the last few years , particularly among teenagers .
The number of Internet users jumped more than 50 percent , or by about 90 million people , during the last year , said the center , which operates under the government - controlled Chinese Academy of Sciences .
The new estimate represents only about 19 percent of China ’s population , underscoring the potential for growth .
By contrast , about 220 million Americans are online , or 70 percent of the population , according to the Nielsen Company .
Japan and South Korea have similarly high percentages .

MILAN ( Reuters ) - Rising land degradation reduces crop yields and may threaten food security of about a quarter of the world ' population , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) said on Wednesday .
Food security has been highlighted in recent months as soaring crop prices resulting from poor harvests , low stocks , high fuel prices and rising demand , risks causing starvation for millions of people in the developing world .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" An estimated 1.5 billion people , or a quarter of the world 's population , depend directly on land that is being degraded , " FAO said in a statement presenting a study based on data taken over a 20 - year period .
Long - term land degradation has been increasing around the world and affects more than 20 percent of all cultivated areas , 30 percent of forests and 10 percent of grasslands , FAO said
Land erosion leads to reduced productivity , migration , food insecurity , damage to basic resources and ecosystems , loss of biodiversity and also contributes to increasing emission of heat - trapping gases , the Rome - based agency said .
" The loss of biomass and soil organic matter releases carbon into the atmosphere and affects the quality of soil and its ability to hold water and nutrients , " said Parviz Koohafkan , director of FAO 's Land and Water Division .
According to the study , land degradation is being driven mainly by poor land management .

The tape of Jesse Jackson saying that Barack Obama was talking down to black people and that the good reverend wanted to cut his nuts off for it was one of the best things that could have happened to Barack Obama .
Before you can understand why this is a good thing , it is important to acknowledge a few basic fears of the Obama campaign .
First , the Obama campaign is afraid of Barack being labeled the “ black candidate . ”
In many minds , Jesse Jackson is the quintessential black candidate .
This is why Obama has been avoiding him like the plague .
If Obama becomes marginalized by race , he will lose the election .
Second , the Obama campaign is trying to avoid the liberal tag .
They have seen both the success that Bill Clinton had in the 1990s by moving to the center , and the more recent failure of Al Gore and John Kerry who were tarred with a liberal label by George W. Bush that they were never able to shake .
Jesse Jackson is true blue 1980s Democratic liberal .
The quickest way for Republicans to hang the black liberal label on Obama would be to use pictures of Obama and Jackson together in ads .
Advertisements
While Jackson also has talked about change there is quite the elite air about him .
From his big house and lavish lifestyle to using monies from his charitable foundations to pay off his mistress , Jackson has been far from the civil rights leader that he claims to be .
In fact , Jesse Jackson has turned self promotion into a lucrative profession .
Jackson ’s comment into an open mic before his appearance of Fox and Friends was , “ See , Barack been , um , talking down to black people on this faith based … I want to cut his nuts out . ”
The fact is that Jackson ’s remark about Obama was a gift from above .
The last thing Obama needs is Jesse Jackson floating around .
The Obama campaign is working hard to woo white male voters , and this is the exact group that is most turned off by Jackson .
My guess is that there is a healthy bit of jealousy and bruised ego behind Jackson ’s remarks .
Obama has accomplished something that Jackson could n’t , and he has done it while leaving Jackson out of the campaign .
As far as whether or not Obama talks down to black people , I do n’t think that is something this white guy should decide , but the Obama campaign is better off without Jesse Jackson involved .

Since the release of the App Store for the iPhone and iPod touch last week , I ’ve been busy filling my iPhone ( and emptying my pocketbook ) with any number of fun , useful , or just plain interesting applications .
As of now , my iPhone is home to no less than 40 third - party applications , and I expect that number to continue growing .
Much as the iTunes Music Store changed the music business when it launched in April of 2003 , I believe the App Store has changed the mobile software distribution business … but that ’s a discussion for another day .
In order to use the App Store , I had to upgrade my iPhone to the new 2.0 software release , a process I was n’t exactly looking forward to .
However , after taking the leap , I ’m very happy with the quality of App Store programs to date .
After only a few days , I ’m only missing a couple key programs from my iPhone ’s prior collection , and I would expect those programs to appear in the App Store soon .
Beyond the App Store , there ’s more good stuff to be found in the 2.0 version of the iPhone ’s software .
In the midst of all this glorious good news , however , there ’s this one annoying new feature in iPhone 2.0 software … and it ’s such an annoying feature that my hand trembles whenever it approaches my Mac Pro ’s iPhone docking station , to drop the iPhone in for a routine sync .
Well , OK , maybe my hand does n’t really tremble , but I do approach this routine task with a great amount of trepidation , delaying it as long as possible .
What feature could actually be so bad that I feared seeing it in action , you might ask ?
This is the cause of my syncing angst — that little progress bar — which is part of a fun game I like to call the “ iPhone Backup Lottery , ” or IBL for short .
How do you play the IBL ?
It ’s simple — just plug in your iPhone ( or iPod touch , I imagine ) , and then wait .
If you ’ve won the IBL , the backing - up progress bar will rapidly fill from left to right , followed by the start of the usual iPhone syncing process .
If , as is usually the case with lotteries , you ’ve lost the IBL , then the progress bar moves more slowly than does the release cycle for major versions of Microsoft Windows .
In my case , my current personal record as an IBL loser is 74 minutes from the time I docked the iPhone until the backup completed .
As it turns out , though , I ’m far from a record - setter .
My Macworld colleague Dan Frakes reports that he ’s had a backup take more than two hours !
On those oh - so - rare occasions when I ’ve won the IBL , it ’s taken as “ little ” as three or four minutes for the backup to complete .
Once the backup completes , the actual sync takes but a couple of minutes .
I found this new behavior so annoying , I was positive it had to be a bug — I even went so far as to restore my iPhone to factory stock and upgrade it again , just to be sure ( no luck ; I was still an unwilling participant in the IBL ) .
Just as I finished doing that , though , I found that this is n’t a bug , it ’s a feature :
If you have configured your iPhone or iPod touch to automatically sync with iTunes on a specific computer , iTunes will back up the iPhone or iPod touch after you connect it to that computer and sync with iTunes . …
iTunes only makes one backup each time you connect , even if you sync multiple times before disconnecting .
That ’s right , these constant backups are a feature , not a bug .
It ’s an intentional behavior , but apparently only for those of us who automatically sync .
Believing that I ’d found a way out of the IBL , I switched my iPhone ’s preferences to manual sync — a press of the Sync button was a small price to pay for not playing the IBL .
At first , it seemed to work fine — I connected my phone , clicked the Sync button , then watched it do just that .
Success !
But no …the IBL was merely teasing me , as a backup started immediately after the sync completed .
As usual , I lost the IBL , and freed my iPhone from its cradle roughly an hour later .
So really … what ’s going on here ?
I understand that there may be programs I installed directly on the iPhone from the App Store , and those need to be backed up .
Similarly , I may have changed data within an application , and that also needs to be backed up .
But there ’s seemingly no rhyme or reason to the backup madness .
I can connect my phone , let it run a full backup and sync , disconnect it , let it sit on the desk for three minutes , then connect it again … and get hit with another hour - long backup cycle .
On other occasions , though , it seems I can take my iPhone away , do some work with it , drop it in the cradle , and have “ only ” a 10 - minute backup cycle .
If there ’s a rationale for the length of the backup cycle , I have n’t figured it out yet .
In talking with other iPhone users , it seems all are seeing this backup process , but for some users , the time required is n’t bad at all .
Based on conversations with these users , it appears the duration of the backup is related to the number of installed programs — the more you have , the longer the backup takes .
While this makes logical sense , it does n’t explain why sometimes the process only takes a few minutes instead of an hour - plus for my 40 - application iPhone .
Even with 40 applications , though , a backup should n’t take anywhere near an hour — there ’s just not that much data in there to push around .
I know Apple wants to help keep my data safe , and I laud the company for that .
However , the current implementation of backup in iPhone 2.0 seems very broken to me .
Because the process is so tediously slow , I ’ve implemented a solution that lets me sync my iPhone more than a couple times a day — I simply press the “ x ” ( cancel ) button in the iTunes info window to cancel the backup .
Yes , this means I do n’t have a local backup , and I ’ll have to reload all my movies , songs , contacts and whatnot should I experience an iPhone disaster .
( App Store programs are tracked separately , and can be downloaded again if necessary , for free .
Any data I stored with those programs , however , would be lost . )
Even if it comes this , though , that would be a one - time process that does n’t take all that much time — especially when compared to a one - hour delay every time I sync my iPhone .
Those backup files , though , may not be of much help in case of an iPhone restore .
Thanks to some instability in the apps and iPhone 2.0 software , Dan Frakes has had to restore his iPhone 3G a few times already .
After waiting through many lengthy backup cycles , he figured he ’d at least be able to use a backup to get his phone back to its as - configured state .
Alas , that was not to be the case , as he ’s seen this dialog box every time he ’s had to restore :
Given
Dan ’s lack of success with restoring from backup , I ’m willing to live with the risk of running backup - free .
However , I ’m hoping that this backup process is patched in a future iPhone and / or Mac software update , so that I can once again have complete local backups — ones that do n’t take hours to create , and work when needed .
Charles Darwin ( 1809 - 1882 ) opened his first notebook about " the species question " in 1837 , not long after his return from the voyage of the Beagle .
By 1838 , he had developed the basic outline of his theory of natural selection to explain the evolution of species .
He spent the next 20 years developing the theory and marshalling evidence in favour of both the fact that species are related through common descent and his particular theory to explain this .
After receving word that another naturalist , Alfred Russel Wallace ( 1823-1913 ) , had independently come upon the same theory , he assembled his work for publication , first in a joint paper with Wallace presented to the Linnean Society of London in 1858 and then his " abstract " , On the Origin of Species , in 1859 .
Some authors have argued that Edward Blyth ( 1810 - 1873 ) , an acquaintance of Darwin's , developed the central idea of selection in an 1835 paper in the Magazine of Natural History .
For example , Eiseley and Grote ( 1959 ) claimed that " the leading tenets of Darwin 's work -- the struggle for existence , variation , natural selection and sexual selection are all fully expressed in Blyth 's 1835 paper " , from which they then quoted the following :
It is a general law of nature for all creatures to propagate the like of themselves : and this extends even to the most trivial minutiæ , to the slightest individual peculiarities ; and thus , among ourselves , we see a family likeness transmitted from generation to generation .
When two animals are matched together , each remarkable for a certain given peculiarity , no matter how trivial , there is also a decided tendency in nature for that peculiarity to increase ; and if the produce of these animals be set apart , and only those in which the same peculiarity is most apparent , be selected to breed from , the next generation will possess it in a still more remarkable degree ; and so on , till at length the variety I designate a breed , is formed , which may be very unlike the original type .
As Eiseley and Grote ( 1959 ) and others have noted , however , Blyth 's description applies to artificial selection , a process that had obviously been known to breeders long before .
In terms of natural selection , Blyth suggested that it would be a conservative and not a creative process , acting to restore the original features modified by artificial selection ; that is , it was not a process that caused change , but one that maintained stability within species .
Neither Darwin nor Blyth considered this to have been an early example of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection ( see Schwartz 1974 ) .
Patrick Matthew ( 1790 - 1874 ) did not feel the same way as Blyth , and was vocal in his belief that he had preceded Darwin as , according to calling cards he carried , " Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection " .
In fact , Matthew had proposed an idea similar to natural selection in his 1831 book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture ,
There is a law universal in nature , tending to render every reproductive being the best possible suited to its condition that its kind , or organized matter , is susceptible of , which appears intended to model the physical and mental or instinctive powers to their highest perfection and to continue them so .
This law sustains the lion in his strength , the hare in her swiftness , and the fox in his wiles .
As nature , in all her modifications of life , has a power of increase far beyond what is needed to supply the place of what falls by Time 's decay , those individuals who possess not the requisite strength , swiftness , hardihood , or cunning , fall prematurely without reproducing — either a prey to their natural devourers , or sinking under disease , generally induced by want of nourishment , their place being occupied by the more perfect of their own kind , who are pressing on the means of subsistence . . .
There is more beauty and unity of design in this continual balancing of life to circumstance , and greater conformity to those dispositions of nature which are manifest to us , than in total destruction and new creation . . .
[ The ] progeny of the same parents , under great differences of circumstance , might , in several generations , even become distinct species , incapable of co-reproduction .
Darwin , like most others , was not aware of Matthew 's book and he learned of it in 1860 when Matthew wrote a letter to the Gardners ' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette including excerpts from his book in response to a review of Darwin 's On the Origin of Species .
In your Number of March 3d I observe a long quotation from the Times , stating that Mr. Darwin " professes to have discovered the existence and modus operandi of the natural law of selection , " that is , " the power in nature which takes the place of man and performs a selection , sua sponte , " in organic life .
This discovery recently published as " the results of 20 years ' investigation and reflection " by Mr. Darwin turns out to be what I published very fully and brought to apply practically to forestry in my work " Naval Timber and Arboriculture , " published as far back as January 1 , 1831 , by Adam & Charles Black , Edinburgh , and Longman & Co. , London , and reviewed in numerous periodicals , so as to have full publicity in the " Metropolitan Magazine , " the " Quarterly Review , " the " Gardeners ' Magazine , " by Loudon , who spoke of it as the book , and repeatedly in the " United Service Magazine " for 1831 , &c .
The following is an extract from this volume , which clearly proves a prior claim .
In a reply in the same magazine , Darwin said ,
I freely acknowledge that Mr. Matthew has anticipated by many years the explanation which I have offered of the origin of species , under the name of natural selection .
I think that no one will feel surprised that neither I , nor apparently any other naturalist , has heard of Mr. Matthew 's views , considering how briefly they are given , and that they appeared in the Appendix to a work on Naval Timber and Arboriculture .
I can do no more than offer my apologies to Mr. Matthew for my entire ignorance of his publication .
In terms of arguments that Matthew 's contribution diminishes that of Darwin , I tend to agree with Peter Bowler , who said in his book Evolution : The History of an Idea ,
Such efforts to denigrate Darwin misunderstand the whole point of the history of science : Matthew did suggest a basic idea of selection , but he did nothing to develop it ; and he published it in the appendix to a book on the raising of trees for shipbuilding .
No one took him seriously , and he played no role in the emergence of Darwinism .
Simple priority is not enough to earn a thinker a place in the history of science : one has to develop the idea and convince others of its value to make a real contribution .
Darwin's notebooks confirm that he drew no inspiration from Matthew or any of the other alleged precursors .
In any case , neither Blyth nor Matthew was the first to propose natural selection in very basic form .
Another individual , an American physician of Scottish descent by the name of William Charles Wells ( 1757 -1817 ) , presented a paper in 1813 ( published in 1818 ) that included a process of natural selection to account for differences in skin colour among people .
Wells considered light skin to be the primitive condition , with dark skin a subsequent specialization .
Again , those who attend to the improvement of domestic animals , when they find individuals possessing , in a greater degree than common , qualities they desire , couple a male and female of these together , then take the best of their offspring as a new stock , and in this way proceed , till they approach as near the point in view , as the nature of things will permit .
But , what is here done by art , seems to be done , with equal efficacy , though more slowly , by nature , in the formation of varieties of mankind , fitted for the country which they inhabit .
Of the accidental varieties of man , which would occur amnog the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa , some one would be better fitted than the others to bear the diseases of the country .
This race would consequently multiply , while the others would decrease , not only from their inability to sustain the attacks of disease , but from their incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours .
The colour of this vigorous race I take for granted , from what has been already said , would be dark .
But the same disposition to form varieties still existing , a darker and a darker race would in the course of time occur , and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate , this would at length become the most prevalent , if not the only race , in the particular country in which it had originated .
Darwin added an acknowledgment of Wells 's work beginning with the 4th edition of the Origin in 1866 ,
In 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society ' An Account of a White Female , part of whose Skin resembles that of a Negro ; ' but his paper was not published until his famous ' Two Essays upon Dew and Single Vision ' appeared in 1818 .
In this paper he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection , and this is the first recognition which has been indicated ; but he applies it only to the races of man , and to certain characters alone .
What Darwin ( and until recently , most historians ) did not realize was that the general notion of selection had already been proposed by 1794 .
In an review in Nature in 2003 , Paul Pearson pointed out that James Hutton ( 1726-1797 ) , considered the Father of Modern Geology , postulated something similar to natural selection in An Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge .
( Pearson also noted the interesting bit of trivia that Hutton , Wells , Matthew , and Darwin all attended the University of Edinburgh ) .
As Hutton ( 1794 ) said ,
... if an organised body is not in the situation and circumstances best adapted to its sustenance and propagation , then , in conceiving an indefinite variety among the individuals of that species , we must be assured , that , on the one hand , those which depart most from the best adapted constitution , will be most liable to perish , while , on the other hand , those organised bodies , which most approach to the best constitution for the present circumstances , will be best adapted to continue , in preserving themselves and multiplying the individuals of their race .
...
Now , if those organised bodies shall thus multiply , in varying continually according to the particular circumstances in which are found the necessary conditions for their life and propagation , we might expect to see , in this world , a variety in the species of things , which we might term a race ; varieties which do not affect the species of things , but which , upon many occasions , might appear to us as being a different race of the same species , whether of plant or animal .
But , such things are every where observed ; consequently , we have reason to conclude , it is truly in this manner , that are naturally produced those various races of plants and animals , which we find naturally upon the surface of this earth .
Each of those races of things , therefore , would appear to us to be wisely calculated , by nature , for the purpose of this world .
Hutton used the examples of fast running and a strong sense of smell in dogs to illustrate the mechanism .
He did not , however , accept the notion that new species could form by this or any process .
For Hutton , this was limited to creating varieties only and not species .
It is important to note that Darwin himself recognized that others had discovered natural selection at least in basic outline before ( and after ) he had .
He did not avoid sharing credit to the extent that it was due .
In light of this history , one could argue that because natural selection as a mechanism had been proposed by several authors that it would have been discovered and recognized as important eventually , even without Darwin 's input -- and , indeed , it probably would have , as would Newton 's laws of motion , Einstein 's theory of relativity , and other fundamental principles describing the natural world .
On the other hand , the idea had been around for at least six decades before Darwin published the Origin , and it was not until someone of Darwin 's genius developed the idea that evolution assumed its position as the underlying theme of all biology .

With all the advancements in optical and laser technologies , the mice works great on most practical surfaces but as soon as you lift it off the surface it degrades to a very bulky clicking device .
If you ’ve ever leaned right back on your seat or lounged on a very soft couch and tried to use a mouse to surf the web , you ’d probably be familiar with the strain on your arms or back .
It ’s not easy or comfortable .
To help solve this problem , Craig Ranta , Steven Bathiche and Monique Chatterjee from Microsoft came up with a very cool “ wearable pointing device ” that looks somewhat like a hybrid between the gloves in Minority Report and the Nintendo Wiimote .
Their patent filed in October 2006 was just recently published .
Besides looking pretty cool , the design actually takes into account a lot of practicality which leads me to believe this is something more than a fancy research demo .
For example by wearing the device it does not prevent you from doing other tasks such as typing on a keyboard .
The cursor movements are activated by a “ switch ” ( 110 ) that can be activated by closing your hands , grasping the device like a joystick , and then turning the yaw and pitch to control the X and Y positions respectively .
There are also left ( 114 ) and right click ( 116 ) buttons which can be pressed by the thumb .
The patent actually goes into a lot of technicalities even as far as to name the specific gyroscope modules that can be used , Analog Devices ’ ADXRS150 for those of you playing at home , which leads me to guess they might have a working prototype somewhere .
Whilst this is certainly not the first wearable mouse invented , this particular implementation seems practical enough for mainstream users and not to mention Microsoft Hardware has a pretty solid history of building nice peripherals .
I wonder if they have one available for review .

REUTERS / Jason Reed
LONDON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush , scrutinized in books by former colleagues including a blistering critique by his ex-spokesman , is considering writing a memoir of his own .
Bush has been silent on former spokesman Scott McClellan ’s book , which said the White House shaded the truth and conducted a propaganda campaign to make its case to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
Asked if he planned to pen his own book after leaving office in January , Bush said it was a possibility .
“ I ’m going to think about that , yes -- writing a book , ” Bush said in an interview with Britain ’s Observer newspaper published on Sunday .
The White House and former Bush aides have dismissed McClellan ’s book and allegations and have also questioned why he did not speak up if he disagreed with policy decisions or the way events were presented .
Bush ’s predecessor Bill Clinton wrote a best - selling book after leaving office that chronicled his life as well as his eight years in the White House .
He has made more than $ 23 million from his memoir “ My Life ” .
Bush also said he never saw the award - winning network television show “ The West Wing ” about a fictitious U.S. president , preferring instead to watch sports and read books .
“ I seriously do n’t watch TV .
You know , I watch sports , but I ’d much rather read books .
And I do .
I read a lot , ” he said according to a transcript released by the White House .

I 'm thinking of using agile software development - but should I use Lean software development instead ?
This question is one I 've run into a few times recently .
It 's not a question I can answer quickly as the question is based on a false premise about the relationship between lean and agile .
So first I need to go into some history to help explain that relationship .
" Lean " fundamentally refers an approach in the manufacturing world that was originally developed by Toyota in the 1950's .
At this time Japanese industry was recovering from the ravages of the second world war .
This approach , often called the Toyota Production System is mostly credited to Taiichi Ohno , although he was influenced by various western thinkers - particularly Deming .
The Toyota Production System became well known in the rest of the world in the 1990's when westerners started writing books to explain why the Japanese were beating the US at so many industries .
The western writers called this approach Lean Manufacturing .
Although Japanese industry in general has run into stickier times since then , Toyota continues to outperform most western auto companies .
Agile software development is an umbrella term for several software development methods ( including Extreme Programming and Scrum ) that were developed in the 1990s .
These methods share a common philosophy which was described as values and principles in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development .
( My essay " The New Methodology " goes into this in more depth . )
There was a connection between lean manufacturing and agile software from the beginning in that many of the developers of the various agile methods were influenced by the ideas of lean manufacturing .
This connection was made more explicit by Mary and Tom Poppendieck .
Mary had worked in a manufacturing plant that had adopted lean manufacturing and her husband Tom is an experienced software developer .
They have written a couple of books on the application of Lean ideas in the software world .
When people talk about Lean Software they are usually referring to the ideas in these books , although others have been making similar links .
Lean manufacturing and agile software methods have a very similar philosophy .
Both place a lot of stress on adaptive planning and a people focused approach .
As a result lean 's ideas fit in very well with the agile software story .
Mary and Tom have both been very active in the agile community - indeed I 'd credit Mary with an important role in forming the Agile Alliance .
( Like me , she was a founding board member of the Agile Alliance , but she was far more effective in it than I was . )
I 've already mentioned that lean manufacturing was an influence on agilists from the beginning , and in the last few years more ideas have appeared in the agile world with a clear lean manufacturing heritage .
These range from concrete techniques like Value Stream Maps , to articulations of existing agile concepts such as the Last Responsible Moment for making design decisions .
The idea of thinking of analysis and design documentation as inventory came from the Poppendiecks .
Several agilists
I know emphasize the importance of reducing cycle time - another strongly lean - influenced idea .
My colleague Richard Durnall has a nice summary of how lean knowledge can blend in with agile thinking .
A particularly strong appeal to many people about lean ideas is that they provide a way of explaining agile software development to people - particularly senior people both within IT and senior customers .
This explanation ranges from a crude appeal to emulate Toyota to detailed discussions of how lean manufacturing 's benefits translate to the ideas in agile software development .
So as you can see , lean and agile are deeply intertwined in the software world .
You can't really talk about them being alternatives , if you are doing agile you are doing lean and vice - versa .
Agile was always meant as a very broad concept , a core set of values and principles that was shared by processes that look superficially different .
You do n't do agile or lean you do agile and lean .
The only question is how explicitly you use ideas that draw directly from lean manufacturing .
The Poppendiecks did n't introduce lean as a separate idea , nor did they introduce lean as a published process in the style of Scrum or XP .
Rather they introduced lean as a set of thinking tools that could easily blend in with any agile approach .
I think of lean as a strand of thinking within the agile community , like a pattern in a rich carpet .
There is a distinct lean software community , as in a mailing list calling itself lean and people who label themselves as lean thinkers .
But this is no different to the fact that there are also strong XP , Scrum , and other communities .
Most people in these communities consider themselves part of the broader agile movement and many people are active in more than one of these agile communities .
The whole point of coining the word ' agile ' comes from a recognition that we share a core set of values and principles and this common core means what we have in common is greater than our differences .

This morning the soon to be Democratic nominee Barack Obama picked up two more superdelelgates .
Iowa Democratic Chairman Scott Brennan and Guam Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo both endorsed him .
“ Senator Obama offers us the leadership needed to address the challenges Guam and our nation will face in the coming years , ” Bordallo said .
Bordallo focused on issues that matter to Guam , “ Senator Obama has also pledged to help improve Guam ’s economy , including through opportunities with the military build - up — an issue I have worked very hard on since taking office — and I believe he is the right candidate to help move Guam and our nation forward given the challenges we face in our world today . ”
She also stressed Obama support for the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act , “ Senator Obama is working very closely with Senator Patrick Leahy , Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary , and other Senate leaders to secure more support for H.R. 1595 , the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.
Senator Obama fully understands and supports the efforts to seek full recognition for the patriotism and suffering endured by the people of Guam during enemy occupation in World War II . ”

Meanwhile , The Quad - City Times is reporting that Scott Brennan the Iowa Democratic Party Chair will endorse Obama today .
Obama has commitments from seven of Iowa ’s eleven superdelegates .
The only uncommitted superdelegate is the state ’s heavyweight , Sen. Tom Harkin .
Obama now has 306.5 pledged superdelegates , and he is certain to get the remaining 14.5 delegates tonight that he needs to lock up the overall delegate lead .

It seems more people are getting tattoos these days to show loyalty to a particular brand or product than for traditional rebellious reasons .
We ’ve all seen our share of Nintendo , Apple or even Zune tattoos , but none of them come even close to the ink that one Spiderman fan had done .
The tattoo is designed to look like the guy ’s skin is actually being torn away to reveal the Spiderman costume underneath .
While I personally think having the Superman logo revealed on his chest would ’ve been slightly cooler , this tattoo is still an impressive piece of work .
You can check out the thread that this tattoo spawned on Emptees.com , but I have to warn you that some of the other tattoos are definitely not safe for work .

Recently , I came across a debate handbook written by Alfred C. Snider of the University of Vermont .
The complete text can be found here .
I read through it with an eye for concepts that could be applied to online debate .
One of the best takeaways was The Code of the Debater ( albeit , its somewhat cheesy ) .
I ’ve reprinted it below .
In the web 2.0 world of user - generated content , I think that guidelines like these make a whole lot of sense .
Whether you prefer to debate in the comments section of Digg , in the self subreddit or on CreateDebate , try to keep these guidelines in mind .
You will be more effective in expressing your point and your reputation will improve .
For Myself :
I will research my topic and know what I am talking about .
I will respect the subject matter of my debates .
I will choose persuasion over coercion and violence .
I will learn from victory and especially from defeat .
I will be a generous winner and a gracious loser .
I will remember and respect where I came even though I am now a citizen of the world .
I will apply my criticism of others to myself .
I will strive to see myself in others .
I will , in a debate , use the best arguments I can to support the side I am on .
I will , in life , use the best arguments I can to determine which side I am on .

我々アジャイル開発者は成功体験を語るのは好きだが、失敗についてはなかなか口を開こうとしない。Robin Dymond氏はそこに切り込み、「あるスクラムプロジェクトの失敗(リンク)
」という記事を書いた。
Robin氏は、既存の内部プロセスを置き換えるべく、様々な期待を背負っていたプロジェクトの記録を残した。
市販のソフトウェアを基盤にした実装
既存の業務プロセスについて深い経験を持つプロダクトオーナー
業務知識とアジャイル(成功) 経験を持つチームメンバー
かつてこの組織で広範囲にわたって働いたことがある経験豊富なアジャイル開発のコーチ
ビッグ3コンサルティングファームは製品に関する知識をチームメンバーに提供した
2回目のイテレーションの終わり頃から雲行きが怪しくなっていった。プロダクトオーナーは、使っている市販のツールがタスクに適しているのかどうかを疑問に感じ始めていた。(3回目のイテレーションで)業務を行っているユーザに開発中のソフトウェアを試用してもらったが、ユーザからのフィードバックは例外なく否定的なものだった。そして、プロダクトオーナーは、先見の明が無かったとしてプロジェクトを外されてしまった。Elizabeth Hendrickson氏は(リンク ) 「第3イテレーションぐらいで、全てのユーザの反応が否定的な場合、そのプロジェクトは中止するか、考え直すべきです。」と指摘している。
Robin氏の見解は、プロジェクトが開始する前に、すでにこの失敗の原因は組み込まれていたというものだ。
プロジェクトの発端 : プロジェクトの業務ケースは、IT責任者と運用責任者同士の話し合いによって決められていました。それは、現在のプロセスに固執していただけで、プロセスの改良を追求したり、プロジェクト管理をするというものでは無かったのです。
プラットフォームの決定 : カスタムメイドのアプリケーションではなく、市販のアプリケーションにインフラを移行すべきだ、という信念によってプラットフォームが決められていました。その結果、プロジェクトの開始に先立って、要件を満たしているツールを誰も試さないうちに決定してしまったのです。さらにこのアプリケーションは、開発チームが使ってみたところ、かなり機能が限定されるということが分かり、業務ユーザは使用に耐えるものではないということに気づいていました。しかし、こういったデータはIT責任者と運用責任者によって却下されてしまいました。
Allan Shalloway氏は( リンク ) 「
現実には力を貸そうと申し出てくれる顧客はいない」ということが正に起きたプロジェクトについて書いている。Allan氏と彼のチームが推していたプロジェクトは、何カ月も後になってキャンセルされた。Allan氏によると、失敗はしばしば次のような原因から起こる。
私のScrumの経験に照らし合わせると、大部分のプロジェクトは、実際にはScrumになっていないのです。どういうことかというと、我々がチームを手伝ったり訓練するためにプロジェクトに参加すると、彼らは「数ヶ月の間Scrumを実践してきました。」と言いいます。しかし、我々が実際に何をしているのかを尋ねると、Scrumとはとても呼べないのです。
後に 、Allan氏はこのところ以下のようなScrumの原則をちゃんと理解していないチームをよく見かける、と警告している。
一度に一つのプロダクトにのみ集中すること
チームがビジネス価値に集中できる状態を保つこと
強力なビジネス的サポートを得ること
チームが一丸となってストーリーを実現すること
何を以て完了とするのかチームで明確な定義を持つこと
...
最後に 、Robin氏 は( リンク )登山経験もあることから、カナダの山岳クラブが発行している「山岳事故の記録 」
について語っている。その記録には多くの登山中の事故が残っているので、他の登山家達はそこにどんな問題があったのかを調べ、自分たちならその状況からどうやって抜け出すか、どう局面を打開するかを考えることができる。彼は、我々にも同様の記録が必要なのではないか、と提案している。「何十億ドルもかかっているのにギリギリの危うい日々。他の工学分野と比較して驚くほど高い確率で失敗するプロジェクト。我々は改めて失敗を記録し、分析すべきではないでしょうか?」

Poll attacked over claim that a third of Muslim students think killing in the name of religion is justified and 40 per cent support sharia law in the UK
Almost third of Muslim students on Britain 's campuses believe killing in the name of religion can be justified , according to a controversial survey described as the most comprehensive of its kind .
The poll , conducted for Islam on Campus , a new report from the Centre for Social Cohesion think - tank , also found that 40 per cent of those interviewed supported the introduction of sharia law for British Muslims .
But the findings have been fiercely attacked by student groups which described the poll 's methodology as ' deeply flawed ' and accused the report 's authors of isolating Muslims .
The YouGov survey found that 32 per cent of Muslim students polled said killing in the name of religion was justified , compared to 2 per cent of non-Muslims .
A third of those polled said they supported a worldwide Islamic caliphate , or government , and more than half - 54 per cent - supported the idea of having their own political party at Westminster .
Just under a quarter did not believe men and women were equal in the eyes of Allah , while 25 per cent said they had little or no respect for homosexuals .
' These findings are deeply alarming , ' said Hannah Stuart , the report 's co-author .
' Students in higher education are the future leaders of their communities .
Yet significant numbers of them appear to hold beliefs which contravene liberal democratic values . '
But the claims were met with a ferocious response from the National Union of Students .
' This is just another report by a biased , right - wing think - tank whose conclusions are drawn from an extremely limited number of students , ' said Wes Streeting , president of the NUS .
' It is a wilful misrepresentation of the views of Muslim students designed to create as sensational a picture as possible .
It can serve only to generate a climate of fear on campuses . '
Ed Husain , author of The Islamist and a former member of the radical group Hizb ut - Tahrir , which has been banned from most campuses , has claimed that universities are a fertile breeding ground for extremists .
In 2005 , Professor Anthony Glees of Brunel University said that he had identified ' extremist and / or terror groups ' at 30 universities .
But his claims were largely dismissed by many academics and the NUS .
More recently , the government has published guidelines on combating Islamic extremism on university campuses .
The higher education minister , Bill Rammell , said recently : ' There is evidence of serious , but not widespread , Islamist extremist activity in higher education institutions . '
In June , the government launched a series of roadshows at British universities aimed at countering the threat of campus radicalisation .
Stuart said that the report 's findings showed there were signs of growing religious segregation on campuses .
' These results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said that there is no extremism in British universities . '
The report , based on a poll of 600 Muslims and 800 non-Muslims and which also drew on face - to - face interviews with representatives from leading student groups , also showed some members of Islamic societies held opinions that were significantly more extreme than those of non-members .
Douglas Murray , director of the Centre for Social Cohesion ( CSC ) , said the findings showed that groups such as the Federation of Student Islamic Societies , which claims to represent the 90,000 Muslim students attending Britain 's universities , could not claim to represent mainstream opinion .
' It is vital that students and government understand that groups like [ the federation ] - who represent a highly conservative interpretation of Islam - are not representative of all Muslim students , ' Murray said .
' Empowering these groups risks giving an official stamp of approval to extreme forms of Islam . '
But Streeting disagreed .
' The CSC has an unhealthy obsession with Muslims and Islam , ' he said .
' Muslim societies are the key to forging a culture of inclusivity and the way this report suggests that they are part of the problem is extremely damaging .'
The report also found that many non-Muslim students hold negative attitudes towards Islam .
Half of the non-Muslim students polled believed Islam and western democracy were incompatible .
More than three - quarters said they believed men and women were not considered equal in Islam .
Complementary remedies do n't have much rigorous scientific research behind them , and the findings from studies that do exist seem to flip - flop faster than a gymnast .

That 's why we decided to put four holistic treatments for several common women 's health problems under the microscope .
In a few months we 'll arrive at the seventh year after the events of September 11 , 2001 .
All can recall the coming together of the nation in the aftermath , and then how the coming together fell apart .

Hillary Clinton :
“ I ’ve been closing very strongly since Feb. 20 , ” she said , referring to the day after Mr. Obama won Hawaii and Wisconsin .
“ I have won more votes and won more states than Senator Obama .
All the independent analyses break in my direction .
A lot of the key states that we have to win , I win those states . ”
Obama has won 32 states ( including the Texas caucuses ) plus DC .
Clinton has won 19 ( including the Texas primary ) .
Now of course , Clinton is using a little sleight of hand to disenfranchise the states that voted before February 20 .
That 's 37 states .
Aravosis :
How do you magically choose February 20th as the day after which primaries and caucuses count , but any that happened before that date do n't count ?
How - because only after February 19 does Hillary win more states .
Now how many states do you think Hillary has thrown out of her calculations because their primaries and caucuses happened before ?
38 states .
That 's 76 % of the states not counted .
Yes , Hillary 's argument is that if you throw out the results in 38 of the 50 states , then she wins more states than Obama [...]
So , under Hillary 's absurd math you only count the last 24 % of the game , and ignore the first 76 % .
The states that Clinton no longer thinks matter :
Alabama Illinois New Jersey
Alaska Iowa New Mexico
Arizona Kansas New York
Arkansas Louisiana North Dakota
California Maine Ohio
Colorado Maryland Oklahoma
Connecticut Massachusetts South Carolina
D.C. Michigan Tennessee
Delaware Minnesota Utah
Florida Missouri Virginia
Georgia Nebraska Washington
Hawaii Nevada Wisconsin
Idaho New Hampshire

A former Gentoo developer yesterday revealed that he has been working on a new hardcore Linux distribution , dubbed Exherbo .
Bryan Østergaard said on his blog that Exherbo was at the “ experimental ” stage and for that reason is n’t openly encouraging anyone to attempt to use it .
He said work on the Linux distro has been ongoing over the past few months , and that some elements of Exherbo have been based on ideas and experiences from Østergaard ’s time at Gentoo .
Features in Exherbo include a new packaging format and several subprojects , such as a redesigned init system that he described as being “ free of all the weird , useless legacy stuff and based on user needs in the 21st century . ”
However , although the package tree has been made public , Østergaard strongly advises against anyone making serious use of the upcoming distribution while it remains in its infant stage .
He also took the opportunity to have a dig at his ex-employer , Gentoo , whose increasingly popular distribution is based on the Portage package management system .
“ Exherbo is not , at the moment , a user - targeted distribution , " he said .
" It supports packages that the people involved find interesting or useful ; it probably does not support your favourite desktop environment or applications .
“ That kind of thing will come later — there are plenty of other options for users who want a distribution that does everything badly rather than a few things well .
In other words , go and use Gentoo or Ubuntu please . ”
Other plans for Exherbo include a new packaging system that will be “ similar in idea to Gentoo ’s ebuilds but ... completely incompatible due to the many technical differences ” and improved options handling .

News in Science
Scientists to mimic earth 's spinning core
A team of scientists in the United States are hoping to create a miniature version of the earth 's core and in the process discover why its effect is waning .
Professor Dan Lathrop and his team from the non-linear dynamics laboratory at the University of Maryland have constructed a 26 - ton steel sphere that will be filled with boiling metal and spun .
In the process he hopes to create the world 's first artificial , spherical and self - sustaining magnetic field , or dynamo , which could predict fluctuations in the earth 's magnetic field .
" If you can predict a hurricane coming , you can manage the damage , " says Lathrop .
" We could have a predictive science for what happens inside the earth 's magnetic field . "
Protective barrier
Besides pointing compasses north , the earth 's magnetic field acts like a protective shield , blocking harmful particles from the sun , which fry the electronics on board orbiting satellites and mess with the electrical grids powering homes and offices on earth .
Some researchers speculate that without a magnetic field , technology on earth would have had a much more difficult time .
That shield is generated by superheated iron moving about a quarter of a centimetre each second deep in the planet 's core .
It sounds simplistic , but the movement generates a changing magnetic climate the same way the planet 's rotation creates weather .
And just like predicting the weather is an inexact science , predicting magnetic weather can be a tough job .
If researchers understood more about how the dynamo at the centre of the earth operates , they could help protect satellites and electrical grids .
They may also help explain why the strength of the earth 's magnetic field has decreased by about 10 % over the last 150 years and continues to do so .
No easy task
Recreating the dynamo that powers earth 's magnetic field , or any dynamo for that matter , has proven difficult .
Only a handful have ever been created , and only using complicated piping and settings that do n't resemble a planetary dynamo .
" It 's easy for the planet to create a dynamo because it 's so big , " says Peter Olsen , a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , who was not involved in the sphere research .
" It 's much harder in the lab . "
The Maryland experiment is much smaller than the earth 's core , so to make up for its lack of mass , Lathrop 's thick steel sphere , which is 3 metres in diameter , will have to spin much faster - at about 3.8 metres per second - and use more electrically conductive sodium instead of iron .
" He 's in the right region where [ a dynamo ] could happen , " says Olsen about Lathrop 's effort .
Highly reactive
Hopefully Lathrop and his lab will survive his creation .
Currently Lathrop is testing the spinning sphere with water , but within six months he hopes to have the sphere filled with boiling sodium .
Sodium reacts with water to create burning hydrogen gas .
" We 've already had three meetings with the local fire department , " says Lathrop , who has disabled the water sprinkler system in the room .
" We need to train everyone to just let it burn and not add water if something happens , " says Lathrop .
Much ink has been spilled lately decrying the decline in American popularity around the world under President Bush .
Polls tell us how China is now more popular in Asia than America and how few Europeans say they identify with the United States .
I am sure there is truth to these polls .
We should have done better in Iraq .
An America that presides over Abu Ghraib , torture and Guantánamo Bay deserves a thumbs - down .
But America is not and never has been just about those things , which is why I also find some of these poll results self - indulgent , knee - jerk and borderline silly .
Friday ’s vote at the U.N. on Zimbabwe reminded me why .
Maybe Asians , Europeans , Latin Americans and Africans do n’t like a world of too much American power  “ Mr. Big ” got a little too big for them .
But how would they like a world of too little American power ?
With America ’s overextended military and overextended banks , that is the world into which we may be heading .
Welcome to a world of too much Russian and Chinese power .
I am neither a Russia - basher nor a China - basher .
But there was something truly filthy about Russia ’s and China ’s vetoes of the American - led U.N. Security Council effort to impose targeted sanctions on Robert Mugabe ’s ruling clique in Zimbabwe .
The United States of America is becoming less united by the day .
A 30 - year gap now exists in the average life expectancy between Mississippi , in the Deep South , and Connecticut , in prosperous New England .
Huge disparities have also opened up in income , health and education depending on where people live in the US , according to a report published yesterday .
The American Human Development Index has applied to the US an aid agency approach to measuring well - being – more familiar to observers of the Third World – with shocking results .
The US finds itself ranked 42nd in global life expectancy and 34th in survival of infants to age .
Suicide and murder are among the top 15 causes of death and although the US is home to just 5 per cent of the global population it accounts for 24 per cent of the world 's prisoners .
Despite an almost cult - like devotion to the belief that unfettered free enterprise is the best way to lift Americans out of poverty , the report points to a rigged system that does little to lessen inequalities .

" The report shows that although America is one of the richest nations in the world , it is woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all Americans to build a better life , " the authors said .
Some of its more shocking findings reveal that , in parts of Texas , the percentage of adults who pass through high school has not improved since the 1970s .
Asian - American males have the best quality of life and black Americans the lowest , with a staggering 50 - year life expectancy gap between the two groups .
Despite the fact that the US spends roughly $ 5.2 bn ( £ 2.6 bn ) every day on health care , more per capita than any other nation in the world , Americans live shorter lives than citizens of every western European and Nordic country , bar Denmark ..
Using official government statistics , the study points out that because American schools are funded primarily from local property taxes , rich districts get the best state education .
The US has no federally mandated sick pay , paternity leave or annual paid vacation .
" Some Americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about : health , education and standard of living , " said Sarah Burd - Sharps co-author of the report .
Although the US is one of the most powerful and rich nations in the world , the study concludes it is " woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all Americans to build a better life " .
According to a United Nations human development report , the US is in 12th place in a league table of wealthy developed nations .
Britain is ranked 16th .
An extremely common practice for Rails applications is to provide keyed
access through subdomains ( i.e. http://someaccount.awesomeapp.com/).
However ,
there has never been a real unified convention for handling this functionality .
DHH ’s Account Location
works for some circumstances but is more tailored for a Basecamp domain model
( i.e. the app is on a separate domain from all other functionality , so you
can always expect a subdomain ) than the more common usage of one domain only .
SubdomainFu aims to provide a simple , generic toolset for dealing with subdomains
in Rails applications .
Rather than tie the functionality to something specific
like an account , SubdomainFu simply provides a foundation upon which any
subdomain - keyed system can easily be built .
Usage Fu
SubdomainFu works by riding on top of the URL Rewriting engine provided with
Rails .
This way you can use it anywhere you normally generate URLs : through
url_for , in named routes , and in resources - based routes .
There ’s a small
amount of configuration that is needed to get you running ( though the defaults
should work for most ) .
To set it up , you can modify any of these settings ( the defaults are shown ) :
# in environment.rb #
These are the sizes of the domain ( i.e. 0 for localhost , 1 for something .com ) # for each of your environments SubdomainFu.tld_sizes = { : development => 0 , :test => 0 , : production => 1 } #
These are the subdomains that will be equivalent to no subdomain SubdomainFu.mirrors = [ " www " ] #
This is the " preferred mirror " if you would rather show this subdomain # in the URL than no subdomain at all .
SubdomainFu.preferred_mirror = " www " 1 # in environment.rb #
These are the sizes of the domain ( i.e. 0 for localhost , 1 for something .com ) # for each of your environments SubdomainFu.tld_sizes = { : development => 0 , :test => 0 , : production => 1 } #
These are the subdomains that will be equivalent to no subdomain SubdomainFu.mirrors = [ " www " ] #
This is the " preferred mirror " if you would rather show this subdomain # in the URL than no subdomain at all .
SubdomainFu.preferred_mirror = " www "
Now when you ’re in your application , you will have access to two useful
features : a current_subdomain method and the URL Rewriting helpers .
The current_subdomain method will give you the current subdomain or
return nil if there is no subdomain or the current subdomain is a mirror :
# http://some_subdomain.myapp.com/ current_subdomain # => " some_subdomain " # http://www.myapp.com/ or http://myapp.com/ current_subdomain # => nil # http://some.subdomain.myapp.com current_subdomain # => " some.subdomain " 1 # http://some_subdomain.myapp.com/ current_subdomain # => " some_subdomain " # http://www.myapp.com/ or http://myapp.com/ current_subdomain # => nil # http://some.subdomain.myapp.com current_subdomain # => " some.subdomain "
The URL rewriting features of SubdomainFu come through a : subdomain option
passed to any URL generating method .
Here are some examples ( in these examples ,
the current page is considered to be ‘ http://intridea.com/’):
url_for ( : controller => " my_controller " , :action => " my_action " , : subdomain => " awesome " ) # =>
http://awesome.intridea.com/my_controller/my_action users_url(:subdomain => false ) # =>
http://intridea.com/users
#
The full URL will be generated if the subdomain is not the same as the # current subdomain , regardless of whether _path or _url is used .
users_path(: subdomain => " fun " ) # =>
http://fun.intridea.com/users users_path(:subdomain => false ) # =>
/users 1 url_for ( : controller =& gt ; " my_controller " , : action =& gt ; " my_action " , : subdomain =& gt ; " awesome " ) # =>
http://awesome.intridea.com/my_controller/my_action users_url(:subdomain => false ) # =>
http://intridea.com/users
#
The full URL will be generated if the subdomain is not the same as the # current subdomain , regardless of whether _path or _url is used .
users_path(: subdomain => " fun " ) # =>
http://fun.intridea.com/users users_path(:subdomain => false ) # => /users
While this is just a simple set of tools , it can allow the easy creation
of powerful subdomain - using tools .
Note that the easiest way to locally
test multiple subdomains on your app is to edit /etc / hosts and add
subdomains like so :
127.0.0.1 localhost subdomain1.localhost subdomain2.localhost www.localhost 1 127.0.0.1 localhost subdomain1 .
localhost subdomain2 .
localhost www .
localhost
Adding an entry for each subdomain you want to use locally .
Then you need
to flush your local DNS cache to make sure your changes are picked up :
sudo dscacheutil - flushcache 1 sudo dscacheutil - flushcache
Installation
SubdomainFu is available both as a traditional plugin and as a GemPlugin
for Rails 2.1 and later .
For a traditional plugin , install like so :
script / plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/subdomain-fu.git 1 script / plugin install git : //github.com/mbleigh/subdomain-fu.git
For a GemPlugin , add this dependency to your environment.rb :
config.gem ' mbleigh-subdomain-fu ' , : source => " http://gems.github.com/ " , :lib => " subdomain - fu " 1 config . gem ' mbleigh-subdomain-fu ' , : source =& gt ; " http://gems.github.com/ " , : lib =& gt ; " subdomain-fu "
Implementing A Simple Account Key System
Let ’s take this functionality and implement a simple account - key system based
off of the subdomain .
We ’ll start with some controller code ( assuming that
we have an Account model with a ‘ subdomain ’ field ) :
class ApplicationController < ActionController :: Base protected #
Will either fetch the current account or return nil if none is found def current_account @account ||= Account.find_by_subdomain(current_subdomain ) end #
Make this method visible to views as well helper_method : current_account #
This is a before_filter we 'll use in other controllers def account_required unless current_account flash [ : error ] =
" Could not find the account '#{current_subdomain} ' " redirect_to : controller => " site " , :action => " home " , : subdomain => false end end end 1 class ApplicationController & lt ; ActionController ::
Base protected #
Will either fetch the current account or return nil if none is found def current_account @account ||= Account.find_by_subdomain(current_subdomain ) end #
Make this method visible to views as well helper_method : current_account #
This is a before_filter we 'll use in other controllers def account_required unless current_account flash [ : error ] =
" Could not find the account '#{current_subdomain} ' " redirect_to : controller => " site " , :action => " home " , : subdomain => false end end end
That ’s really all we need for a basic setup , now let ’s say we have a
ProjectsController that you must specify an account to access :
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController # Redirect users away if no subdomain is specified before_filter : account_required end 1 class ProjectsController & lt ; ApplicationController # Redirect users away if no subdomain is specified before_filter : account_required end
There ’s lots more you can do with the plugin , but this is a simple use case
that everyone can relate to .
Resources and Plans
A feature that I hoped would make it to the first release of SubdomainFu
but is now a planned feature is subdomain - aware routing so that you can
add conditional subdomain routes to your routes.rb file .
Keep an eye
out for more on that in the future .
In the meantime , the project will live at its home on Acts As Community for intermittent
updates , is available on GitHub as always , and bugs / feature requests may
be passed on through the Lighthouse .

George Stephanopoulos asked House Minority Leader John Boehner about their hilariously apt choice to embrace as a party slogan a trademarked slogan for an anti-depressant .
Boehner seems to think that claiming that the GOP is the party of change will somehow resonate with voters and make them forget that the change they are seeking ( if those special elections are any indication , and I think they are ) is from the gridlock , corruption , collusion and overall incompetence of a decade - long Republican majoritym , a fact that George Stephanopoulos never sees fit to point out .
( h/t Rico in the comments )
Boehner holds up the rather sickly carrot of a Republican energy policy that he claims will lower gas prices .
A neat trick that will be , considering that Republican coddling of oil companies has resulted in the gas prices we see today with the threat of double that by the end of the summer .
But Boehner thinks we should rely on the Republicans .
Riiiiiiiggggghhhhht .
Transcripts below the fold :
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The Democrats are having some fun at your expense this week , because they look at your slogan , " Change You Deserve , " and say that 's a slogan for Effexor , an antidepressant .
Here was Congressman Steny Hoyer , your counterpart .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) REP .
STENY H. HOYER , D - MD . : " Change you deserve , " of course , is a trademark for an antidepressant .

It does have side effects .
It can make you sick .
Eighty - two percent of Americans have indicated they 're sick and tired of the policies that have been pursued by the Bush - Boehner administration .

STEPHANOPOULOS : Should n't you have seen that coming ?
BOEHNER : Listen , I could have used an antidepressant last week , I can tell you .
But that 's got nothing to do with the job that we have to do to show the American people that we can deliver a real change here in Washington .
And I think our members and our candidates are going to be prepared , this fall , to do just that .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But how do you do it , then ?
You 've got Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate .
President Bush -- you 've been opposed to him on the farm bill .
It does n't seem like the issues that you 're talking about , right now , that he 's going to have the kind of ...

BOEHNER : George , he 's not on the ballot .
BOEHNER : You want to keep looking in the past .
We need to look ahead .
John McCain ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : So President Bush is the past .
BOEHNER : ... appeals to almost all Republicans , a broad swath of independents and conservative Democrats .
John McCain at the top of the ticket will help us .
But we also have to show as Republicans in Congress that we can really deliver for the American people .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But how do you do that ?
BOEHNER : We 've got to work hard .
And when my members want to moan and groan , I understand it .
The things have n't been real happy for them , losing three special elections .
But we all have to look in the mirror .
We all have to decide , what are we going to do today , in order to show the American people that we 're serious about doing the
kinds of things that ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And what 's the number one thing you 'll do coming out of that meeting on Tuesday , to show that the Republican caucus in the House has changed ?
BOEHNER : I think what we 've got to do Tuesday and Wednesday is to deliver our energy policy .
Here 's what we would do if the American people would honor us with the majority .
We 're going to deliver a real energy policy that will reduce gas prices .

[ Xubor via Boingboing ]
Maher Arar , whose “ rendition ” to Syria is widely viewed as an egregious example of mistaken identity , has again been denied the right to appear in court , and Congressional efforts to rein in the George W. Bush administration ’s widespread use of national security as a defense appear to be foundering .
Late last month , a federal court of appeals ruled that the lawsuit brought by Arar against former Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI director Robert Mueller and other senior government officials could not be heard .
After government lawyers invoked the “ state secrets ” privilege , the court concluded that hearing Arar ’s claims would interfere with sensitive matters of foreign policy and national security .
Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian , was detained on suspicion of being a terrorist at New York ’s John F. Kennedy Airport in September 2002 while in transit to his home in Canada from a vacation in North Africa .
Based on information provided to US authorities by the Canadian government , Arar was held incommunicado for two weeks and then flown to Syria where he was imprisoned , interrogated , and tortured for close to a year .
The Bush administration labeled him a member of al - Qaeda .
When the government invokes the “ state secrets ” privilege , federal courts have routinely dismissed lawsuits because they cannot proceed with the requested evidence .
Most recently , the privilege was used to dismiss a suit over the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program and the government ’s use of detention , interrogation and “ extraordinary rendition ” .
In a rare move , a federal judge in Chicago recently disagreed with the government ’s use of the privilege in a case involving the Department of Homeland Security ’s terrorist watchlist , ruling that the plaintiff , a local businessman , could find out whether his name is on the list .
In one of the Arar case ’s more bizarre twists , the court ruled that , as a foreigner who had not been formally admitted to the US , Arar had no constitutional due process rights .
It was the US government that denied Arar admission to the country .
Both the Syrian and Canadian governments said they had found that Arar had no connection to any criminal or terrorist organization or activity .
After an intensive two - year investigation , the Canadians apologized to Arar for Canada ’s role in his rendition and awarded him a 10 - million - dollar settlement .
The US government has stopped short of an apology to Arar , but at a recent Congressional hearing , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice admitted that the US had mishandled the case .
“ We do not think that this case was handled as it should have been , ” Rice told the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
“ We do absolutely not wish to transfer anyone to any place in which they might be tortured . ”
The court also rejected Arar ’s claim that US officials are liable under the Torture Victim Protection Act , for conspiring with Syria to subject Arar to torture under color of foreign law .
The TVPA creates liability for torture inflicted under color of foreign law , and courts have held that it applies not only to the torturer , but also to those who aid or abet the torture .
Arar alleged that US officials aided and abetted in his torture at Syrian hands , but the court ruled that the federal officials could not be held responsible for their conspiracy with the Syrians because they were federal officials exercising federal authority .
Arar ’s lawyer , Professor David Cole of the Georgetown University Law Center , appearing on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , told IPS , “ The Canadians , who provided misinformation about Arar but did not acquiesce in sending him to Syria , have conducted a full investigation , written an 1,100 - page report , formally apologized , and awarded Mr. Arar 10 million dollars in damages and legal fees .
Meanwhile the United States , the far more culpable actor , maintains that it violated no rights , and that Mr. Arar has no remedy . ”
Maria LaHood , a senior CCR attorney , told IPS that her organization plans to either petition the appeals court for rehearing , or petition the Supreme Court to decide the case .
She added , “ Giving short shrift to the facts , the majority opinion grants impunity to US officials for sending Maher to Syria to be tortured and for preventing him from seeking relief in the courts .
The defendants have again blocked Maher ’s access to justice , this time with the court ’s seal of approval . ”
Meanwhile , legislation to curb the government ’s use of the state secrets privilege appears to be stalled in Congress .
In April , the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that attempts to limit the government ’s use of the state secrets privilege .
The bill was introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat , and Pennsylvania ’s Arlen Specter , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
It would create a uniform set of procedures for federal judges to employ when the government asserts the privilege .
It would require the government to produce the evidence it says is protected for review by a federal judge in a classified setting .
The government would be unable to rely on affidavits as it has in the past .
It also would prevent judges from dismissing cases based on the privilege before plaintiffs have had a chance to engage in evidentiary discovery .
“ It ’s long past time for Congress to address the state secrets privilege .
Congress needs to ensure  and the American people need to feel confident  that the courts are adjudicating the privilege properly and not just giving the executive a free pass .
No one in America should be above the law .
That ’s why this legislation is so critical , ” Sen .
Kennedy said .
But the bill lacked bipartisan support on the committee .
Only one Republican , Sen .
Specter , voted to move it to the Senate floor for a vote .
The Senate has many bills backed up in its queue and little time to even get them introduced , much less put to a vote .
Moreover , its calendar has become increasingly dominated by elections in the fall .
Nonetheless , there has been other recent action in Congress .
The Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations , Human Rights , and Oversight , held a joint oversight hearing in June on the report of the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General on Arar ’s removal .
Arar testified at the hearing  the first time he has appeared before any US governmental body .
His testimony was via video because he is still on the government ’s “ no - fly ” watchlist .
During the hearing , individual members of Congress publicly apologized to him , though the government has not .
At the hearing , DHS Inspector General Richard G. Skinner announced that his office has reopened its investigation of the government ’s treatment of Arar .
He told the hearing that he could not rule out the possibility that immigration officials violated a law that prohibits the US government from sending anyone to a country where he or she is likely to be tortured , especially since investigators were not allowed to question all participants .
Earlier , Skinner ’s testimony and a 50 - page report found that US immigration officials acted appropriately in determining that Arar could be expelled .
But he said immigration authorities concluded that sending Arar to Syria “ would more likely than not result in his torture ” and relied on “ ambiguous ” assurances from Syria that he would not be .
Skinner also questioned US officials ’ minimal efforts to notify attorneys for Arar before a late - night hearing where he could argue his fear of torture .
A spokesman for the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , who has staked his own reputation on the peace effort , described Mr. Olmert ’s resignation plans on Wednesday as an “ internal affair . ”
The spokesman , Nabil Abu Rudeineh , said , “ The Palestinian Authority deals with the prime minister of Israel , regardless if he is Olmert or somebody else . ”
Mr. Olmert said that Israel was “ closer than ever ” to reaching understandings that might serve as a basis for agreements with the Syrians and the Palestinians , adding that he would work until his last day in office to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion “ that bears hope . ”
So far , however , six months of talks with the Palestinians have not yielded any obvious results , while Syria continues to insist on talking to Israel indirectly through Turkish mediators .
Mr. Olmert ’s drive for diplomatic achievements “ might frighten some , ” said Abraham Diskin , a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
There are Israelis who do not believe in agreements , and others who support the peace effort but do not feel comfortable having their leader negotiate desperately with an eye on the clock .
“ I belong to that second category , ” Mr. Diskin said .
The future of the talks will depend largely on who emerges as Israel ’s next leader .
The leadership race in the governing Kadima Party has been set for Sept. 17 , with a runoff , if necessary , on Sept. 24 .
The main contenders are Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who leads the Israeli team in talks with the Palestinians , and Shaul Mofaz , the more hawkish transportation minister who is a former defense minister and a former army chief of staff .
In recent polls , Ms. Livni was leading , but Mr. Mofaz was closing the gap .
Mr. Olmert had left open the possibility of competing himself until Wednesday , though few expected that he would .
Although Mr. Olmert has pledged to resign after the vote , he will remain as a transitional prime minister until his successor can form a new government able to garner a majority of 61 votes in the 120 - seat Parliament .
That government would try to survive until a general election scheduled for 2010 .
A recent issue of Focus on the Family ’s Citizen
magazine highlights the anti-sex trafficking work of Linda Smith , who
says she has " spent 10 years of [ her ] life restoring little girls and
young women who have been in the commercial sex industry . "
If Smith’s
terminology , " restore , " gives you the willies considering the subject
matter — evoking not just new " virginal restoration " services being bought everywhere from Hollywood to Muslim communities in Europe ,
but also the more general sense of the word , as repairing a broken or
used object , applied to women — there ’s more to be find suspect in Focus
on the Family ’s praise for Smith , a leading figure in the Christian
right anti-trafficking establishment who embodies a lot of the tensions
in the alliance between feminists and religious right activists working on the issue .
Linda Smith ,
a two - term Congressional representative from Washington state , who
broke into the House on a grassroots , Christian , write - in campaign , had
a 100 % positive rating from the Christian Coalition
for her staunchly conservative anti-abortion politics , and was profiled
in 1995 under the title " Invasion of the Church Ladies " by Hanna Rosin
for The New Republic , as part of a class of female
representatives - Smith ’s opponents dubbed her the " Hazel Dell
Housewife " - going to war in D.C. for traditional values .
After a failed
Senate bid in 1998 , Smith retired from political life - in a way - to begin
work on an anti-sex trafficking organization she founded , Shared Hope International , and which she considers her Christian " ministry , " though she ’s cagily told supporters , " If I ever advertised as a Christian , I ca n’t do the work I do . "
Smith has n’t quite left Washington though , appearing in congressional hearings in 2002 to testify
about her newfound convictions on sex trafficking , and continuing to
lead national campaigns on the issue , along with three other groups ,
including two other religious groups , that make up the War Against Trafficking Alliance ,
an advocacy organization that provides trainings for governments and
NGOs with support from the Depts. of Justice and State .
In Smith ’s own
SHI , she works to " restore " women who have been removed from
prostitution in a series of Christian - oriented and staffed " Houses of
Hope " that combine shelter from sex traffickers and pimps and a halfway
house work model : having the women work in bakeries and other small
businesses .
In interviews with the Seattle Times
several years ago , Smith was vague about the houses ’ locations ,
occupancy rates and business opportunities , preferring to linger on
details of the financial aid she and her husband bestowed on individual
rescued - and - restored women .
Several " Houses of Hope " are now listed on
SHI ’s website .
Smith ’s focus , which is shared by a number of colleagues on the
religious right , who have made the issue a favored evangelical cause in
recent years , is criticized by groups with a broader trafficking focus , who charge that the focus on " sex slavery " erases the less sexy issue of plain labor trafficking and slavery ,
with workers forced into indentured servitude - like situations in
factories and fields , as well as by sex - worker advocacy groups who
complain that the sweeping targets of anti-sex trafficking work
includes women who choose sex work willingly and prioritizes
criminalizing all sex work - and demanding that NGOs that help sex
workers condemn those sex workers in exchange for aid money - over helping ensure better working conditions for the women who engage in it .

This much seems clear from Smith ’s testimony to Congress in 2002 , where
she argued the absolutist position that countries with legalized or
tolerated prostitution provide " cover for the traffickers , " and should
be considered part of the problem .
" I encourage the administration to
consider countries with legalized or tolerated prostitution as having
laws that are insufficient to eliminate trafficking , " she told the
congressional subcommittee , seeming to argue for an ever - murkier line
between any sex work and slavery .
In this , Smith seems to agree with
feminist anti-prostitution purists who argue that there ’s no
substantive difference between prostitution and " sex slave "
trafficking : a rare instance of orthodox feminist theory making it into
the mainstream , albeit on the shoulders of the Christian right .
It ’s a tricky divide , as Smith ’s newest campaign , an investigation on " domestic minor sex trafficking , "
aims to expand the definition of sex trafficking for good purpose :
relabeling the prostitution of U.S. children as domestic sex
trafficking so that the children will be eligible for the same
protections that foreign - born tracking victims are ( brought to social
services instead of being arrested as prostitutes ) .
It ’s an admirable
goal to enact a commonsense fix , but , as for Smith ’s broader goals , as
with other strange bedfellows coalitions , it ’s worth remembering that
Christian right muscle does n’t come without an orthodox price .
Linda Smith appears on the Christian women ’s television talk show , Everyday Woman , to offer her take on anti-trafficking work .

The new generation of web browsers — Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 and Internet Explorer 7 — provides a feature which seems to save a lot of work for web - developers in the future , namely the Full Page Zoom .
Instead of allowing users to increase and decrease the font size on a given web - site , browsers now enable users to literally scale the rendered layout including visuals and background images .
Consequently , every fixed , pixel - based layout becomes “ scalable ” ; the content area always remains within the layout box it is supposed to be in and there is no chance of producing overlapping boxes as we ’ve seen in previous generations of web - browsers .
This article is a guest post written by Dirk Jesse , the developer of YAML ( Yet Another Multicolumn Layout ) , an ( X ) HTML&CSS framework which explains his motivation for YAML in the last paragraph of the article .
This article is supposed to initiate the discussion about the need for more flexible layouts in modern web design and explain why flexible designs are still important — even despite the Full Page Zoom - functionality implemented in most modern browsers .
The new generation of web browsers — Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 and Internet Explorer 7 — provides a feature which seems to save a lot of work for web - developers in the future , namely the Full Page Zoom .
Instead of allowing users to increase and decrease the font size on a given web - site , browsers now enable users to literally scale the rendered layout including visuals and background images .
The whole design layout is scaled proportionally according to some adjusted zoom - factor , with all the elements of a page ’s layout expanding equally .
Consequently , every fixed , pixel - based layout becomes “ scalable ” ; the content area always remains within the layout box it is supposed to be in and there is no chance of producing overlapping boxes as we ’ve seen in the previous generations of web - browsers .
However , is the new zoom - technique indeed so advanced that we do n’t need flexible layouts any longer ?
Just as this question is extensively discussed in the blogosphere , it is extensively answered with “ yes ” .
And there is a good reason behind it .
The coding of a fixed layout is much easier and , when used properly , produces exactly the results a designer is willing to achieve .
With fixed layouts , designers can ensure the exact positioning of each pixel ( a dream of many graphics designers comes true ! ) and the user can adjust the size of the layout with a scaling zoom on demand .
No wonder that it ’s tempting to motivate the switch to fixed layouts .
However , as professionals , we need to consider how reasonable it is from the professional point of view .
In the following let ’s discuss why we strongly believe that this paradigm wo n’t lead web design to more user - friendly and accessible web - sites , why flexible layouts still remain important today and why they will become even more important in the future .
Where Full Page Zoom does n’t help at all
The main difference between fixed ( px - based ) and flexible ( % - based ) layouts is the simple fact that flexible layouts can better adapt to user ’s viewing preferences .
With flexible solutions , the width of the layout depends on the viewport of the browser and can perfectly fill the viewing space without any manual adjustments from the user ’s side .
Fixed layouts can’t do that .
Full page zoom , when applied to fixed layouts , enables users to manually adjust the design after it has already been rendered .
Another important aspect which is worth keeping in mind : Internet Explorer 6 , probably the nightmare of every web - developer out there , has a market share of almost 40 % — and it does n’t support zoom at all .
According to w3schools.com , the larger and wider screen resolutions ( larger than 1024 × 768 px ) will become a standard in the future .
More problematic is the overwhelming confidence of developers that the individual decision - making is better for users from the accessibility point of view .
When applied to fixed layouts the web - developer delivers a clear message :
Dear users , your browser can zoom my fixed layout - so please help yourself if you want or need to !
From designer ’s perspective with this argument it is tempting to switch to a more comfortable ( fixed ) design solution at expense of accessibility .
Why should a user adapt his viewing preferences to a web - site ?
Should n’t a web - site rather adapt itself to the viewing preferences of its users ?
If you think about it for a second , you have the same situation as in a cloth store where you are offered cloth only in some very specific size .
If the size does n’t fit to you , it ’s your problem , not store ’s owner .
And if you want to you can take a needle , some fabric and create the cloth of its own choice for free .
That is not user - friendly .
Even more crucial is the simple fact that full page zoom is n’t really feasible in practice .
Let ’s assume that the designers has a fixed layouts with the width of 960 px .
To zoom it using a 150 % scale factor and still browse the page without horizontal scroll bar , users need to have at least the screen resolution of 1440 px and a browser opened in the full - screen - mode .
Is it really a path for the Web to take in the years to come ?
As Nancib states , “ problem is that sometimes the font on a page is friggin ’ tiny without zooming it in , but zooming the page ( with the images ) does n’t just make it more readable . ”
Web developers often tend to argue that flexible layouts are too complex and with full page zoom every fixed layout is becoming scalable anyway .
That ’s right , scalable , but not flexible .
Why should a browser correct the mistakes a developer or designer has done when creating a site layout ?
Flexible layouts are hard to control ?
That ’s not true !
Whenever designers argue against flexible layouts they tend to use the following argument :
In flexible layouts the text flows in the width when expanding the browser window , making the content hard to read .
This text flow is hard to control .
Wide text flow is definitely not a nice thing to offer your visitors .
However , text flow does n’t need to flow in the width when the browser window is expanded .
To achieve attractive flexible designs one can use the properties min-width and max - width .
Of course , Internet Explorer 6 does n’t support both of them — just as it implements both hasLayout - model and the Float - model incorrectly .
However , this is not the reason to not use floats for your design layouts , right ?
To simulate max - width and min-width you can use various workarounds ( JS Expressions ) ; and to simulate min-width you can even use a pure CSS - solution .
But what happens if the user ’s browser does n’t support JavaScript ?
Well , in this case a flexible Layout without max - width does n’t necessarily destroy the layout , although the text flow may be too wide .
But this is what the Progressive Enhancement is all about , so this is not that problematic .
How to find an ideal width for a flexible layout ?
Let ’s consider how wide the layout should be for an optimal flexible layout :
Layout width : use width : auto or any %-value to make sure that the layout makes use of the available width of the browser windows automatically .
use or any %-value to make sure that the layout makes use of the available width of the browser windows automatically .
Minimal width : use some px-value ( e.g. 760 px ) .
This lower bound should be used for all pixel - based layouts , so the content remains readable when displayed in the minimal screen resolution .
use some px-value ( e.g. 760 px ) .
This lower bound should be used for all pixel - based layouts , so the content remains readable when displayed in the minimal screen resolution .
Maximal width : use an em-value ( e.g. 90em ) .
Thus the text flow does n’t grow in width in an uncontrollable fashion , but remains constant for various screen resolutions .
Side effect : the maximal width is scaled according to the font - size of the browser .
Also keep in mind that we , designers , do n’t really have the design layout ( whether fixed or flexible ) under control as the presentation of our layouts depends on the browser , font size adjustments , operating system , alternative user - stylesheets etc .
The Holy Photoshop Mockup
The most frequent argument used to motivate the fixed layout solution is the fact that customers are confident that a perfect Photoshop mockup would look best when displayed 1:1 in user ’s browser .
Indeed , it is hard to explain to the customers that flexible solution , although looking differently in different context , has some advantages .
After all , if the design does n’t look as expected on senior project manager ’s wide screen laptop , then this is not something the customer would agree on .
However , following customer ’s decisions blindly you neglect your professional responsibility to develop accessible , user - friendly websites .
It ’s your duty to complement your customer ’s wishes , compromise and seek the best possible solution for users and not for the senior manager .
A brief argument that a user - friendly solution that does n’t look best at some particular configuration would bring more satisfied customers and consequently more money in a long run usually suffices .
The end - result layout is n’t supposed to be used as a nice screenshot for one single portfolio .
It has to serve users ’ needs and enable them to get to the content of the site as quickly and as painlessly as possible .
Take your time and go through some of the layouts presented in numerous CSS - showcases .
In way too many cases the attractive pixel - based design breaks down completely when the browser window is resized or the content is scaled .
A Photoshop Mockup is n’t necessarily easy to convert into a flexible design layout .
However , it is worth consideration .
Transparency , patterns and background images can lead to impressive and flexible results .
In most cases we design websites not to present some design , but to let the design help users to achieve some objectives such as finding the information they are looking for .
Graphics - heavy flexible layouts are not easy to achieve and require planning , patience and confidence that the results are worth it .
However , these efforts improve user experience and make the design medium - independent .
Mobile Browsers –
Why flexible is better
Just one year ago my old mobile phone could access the Internet .
However , it was extremely hard to browse web pages , read them and navigate .
With the improved user interface of iPhone it has completely changed .
Mobile web browsers ( e.g. Opera Mini or Safari on the iPhone ) have dramatically improved over the last two years — at the moment , it is almost natural that they render web pages without any considerable display errors .
My iPhone has no problem showing flexible layouts in the landscape format or portrait format ; in fact , it automatically adjusts them to the best format that fills the whole iPhone window .
At the same time I often experience problems when loading fixed layouts — from time to time they need to be zoomed in to fill in the whole browser window .
What holds for mobile devices also holds for printing devices .
Ironically , nobody argues about the advantages that flexible layouts for print layouts manage to deliver .
Flexible design allows to use portrait / landscape - formats for optimal printing .
The decision for flexible layouts against fixed layouts does n’t only improve the accessibility on Desktop - PCs , but also creates robust and flexible medium - independent layouts which can be easily adapted to any output devices .
After all , with flexible rules ( relative measure units , minimal margin , and padding , alignment , etc. ) instead of fixed rules ( px ) rendering engines can better consider the properties of the used media .
The future , the unexplored land
As mentioned above , the mobile Web is becoming more and more important .
Are we now going to optimize layouts for 640×480 or 800×600 ?
The screen resolutions are increasing , the prices for high - resolution displays are decreasing .
At the same time the physical resolution of devices as well as the spatial printing resolution ( dpi ) .
Consequently , the absolute size of one pixel decreases .
No wonder that pixel - based definitions are becoming less expressive .
The gap between low - resolution displays and high - resolution displays has n’t bridged over the last ten years .
On the contrary : the gap has increased dramatically .
Websites are viewed in hundreds of possible screen resolutions while each user may have his preference for the viewport of his browser .
This consideration alone explains how important flexible design layouts are today and how important they will be in the future .
Consequently , fixed layouts wo n’t make the cut in the future as designers will need to consider more and more different devices to optimize the design for .
What we need in web design to come to grips with all this variety are dominating relative measurement units .
Flexible Layouts with YAML
YAML ( “ Yet Another Multicolumn Layout ” ) is an ( X ) HTML / CSS - framework which was developed especially to meet the requirements of flexible and user - friendly design layouts .
Since June 2007 YAML is available in English and provide an extensive documentation .
Most CSS - Frameworks like Blueprint CSS or YUI Grids offer designers a predefined system of CSS - classes to create grid - based layouts visually .
To create a layout designer needs to create a HTML - structure of the site and to assign CSS - classes to containers .
The rest is automatically taken care of .
YAML takes a different route .
The Framework supports the development of grid - based layouts as well as the development of the grid system - with the emphasis on flexible layouts .
If a designer wants to create a grid - based layout he can use the basic skeleton with three columns , header and footer .
Each element can be removed or adjusted to user ’s needs .
The actual design , the positioning of the columns , is done using CSS - definitions ( and not HTML - structure as it is done in other CSS - frameworks ) .
The benefit for designers : with YAML one has better options for defining his own system of classes , using any measurement units and getting clean code .
Based on the HTML - structure of YAML , the framework includes layout presets which already prevent IE - bugs ; thus the framework makes it easier for designers to create a layout which works in both modern and older browsers .
Layout examples provide an overview of what is possible with YAML and may deliver some ideas for your future layouts .
Apart from that , YAML offers a set of flexible grid- components which you can use to create columns within columns and thus design a more complex but flexible Grid-layouts .
YAML Example : a demonstration of YAML 's flexible grids .
Consider the example above .
BluePrint CSS has a demo- page which displays a layout created with Blueprint CSS .
And this is the result of the very same template created using the flexible grid-elements of YAML .
The scaling works even in IE 5.5 , including min-width and max - width .
Apart from layout design , YAML also delivers style sheets for print layouts , as well as components for horizontal and vertical navigation .
YAML requires some time to climb the learning curve : the tool offers a variety of functions , and user - friendly flexible layouts are not easy to build .
The concept of YAML is , however , well documented in the online - and PDF - documentation and my provide beginners and professional with an excellent introduction to the framework .
For practical purposes , you can also use YAML - Builder , a handy tool for visual development of YAML - based CSS layouts which allows you to put the containers of the design visually together via drag - n - drop .
The valid HTML - and CSS - code is generated automatically on the fly .

When a talking head , on CNBC , proclaims that Company X has announced a stock buyback , it is unfailingly hailed as good news for shareholders .
After all , in the world of high finance , cash is trash , leverage is good , and stock buybacks can boost earnings per share and the price of the stock itself .
When stock buybacks are executed judiciously , shares are purchased when management recognizes that the stock is undervalued — as it is preferable to buy while the price is low ( at least that ’s the theory ) .
All of this is done , of course , under the guise of enhancing shareholder value .
Hence , what is good for the shareholder ( i.e. , a stock buyback ) must be good for the company itself .
This is exactly what the charlatans , of Wall Street , want you to believe ; and it is a lie .
The financial distress , besieging America ’s largest financial institutions , exposes the pernicious nature of stock buybacks .
Call me old fashioned and financially conservative as I have never agreed with the idea that weakening a company ’s balance sheet is beneficial for the company and its shareholders — yet , it does benefit a very select group of shareholders and this will be covered below .
Repurchasing shares weakens a company ’s balance sheet in three key ways in that cash , working capital , and equity are diminished by the dollar amount of the shares repurchased .
When a company ’s stock - buyback program , over time , adds up to billions of dollars , the negative financial impact can be staggering .
The stock prices , of America ’s largest banks and brokerages , have been getting hammered .
Yet the declining stock prices fly in the face of the " wisdom " of buying back shares in that a scarcer number of shares should lead to higher stock prices .
The following table , comprised of seven high - profile American financial institutions , neatly exposes the falsehood that stock buybacks increase shareholder value .
`
Stock Price
Stock Repurchased
Company
5 - Year High
Present Price
From 2001 Through 2007
Citigroup
$ 55.70
$ 19.35
$ 32.2 billion
J.P. Morgan
$ 52.54
$ 40.02
$ 17.1 billion
Lehman Brothers
$ 85.80
$ 19.11
$ 14.7 billion
Merrill Lynch
$ 95.87
$ 30.91
$ 21.0 billion
Morgan Stanley
$ 73.45
$ 38.57
$ 14.9 billion
Wachovia Corporation
$ 59.85
$ 12.97
$ 15.0 billion
Washington Mutual
$ 46.35
$ 5.92
$ 12.4 billion
From fiscal - year 2001 through fiscal year - end 2007 , these seven companies have repurchased $ 127.3 billion of their common stock .
I would argue that each company ’s stock - buyback program actually intensified the downward pressure on the price of their respective common shares .
It is well known that there is a global credit crisis and that investors are nervous about which financial institutions will or will not survive through these uncertain times .
Top - notch financial strength , consequently , is viewed as a virtue .
Thus , it stands to reason that had each of the above - mentioned companies not engaged in such reckless stock buybacks , each company would possess a dramatically stronger balance sheet .
In turn , better financial strength provides a company with a greater chance of surviving difficult economic circumstances and , accordingly , would be reflected favorably in the price of its common shares .
Return , to any one of these companies , the money it squandered on stock buybacks and you ’d see a company with a higher stock price than currently bestowed by the marketplace .
Let ’s test , a little more , Wall Street ’s " logic " with respect to share repurchases .
If a stock buyback is good for a company , should n’t buybacks take place when times are tough ?
After all , during tough times , should n’t management do good things for a company ?
Moreover , if stock prices have dropped precipitously , should n’t management be repurchasing shares hand - over - fist ?
The actions , of the seven aforementioned companies , speak volumes about such questions ; and exposes stock buybacks as nothing more than a Wall Street scam .
Through the first five months of 2007 , these seven financial institutions bought back $ 14.4 billion of their common stock .
Through the first five months of 2008 , the same exact companies repurchased only $ 786 million of their shares — a reduction of nearly 95 % .
It is painfully clear that each company ’s management team has determined now is not the time to further weaken their respective balance sheets .
Corporate survival may be at stake .
After all , share repurchases would further erode the balance sheet and the share price may suffer even further .
So , when is it ever a good time to weaken a company ’s balance sheet ?
In Berkshire Hathaway ’s 2005 annual report , Warren Buffett criticized executive compensation schemes in his letter to shareholders .
In the following example , Mr. Buffett makes it quite clear that a company ’s top executives and managers can be compensated handsomely even if the company ’s performance is mediocre or poor .
At the epicenter , of such a compensation scheme , is management ’s control over whether or not to engage in stock repurchases .
Read it and weep :
Too often , executive compensation in the U.S. is ridiculously out of line with performance .
That wo n’t change , moreover , because the deck is stacked against investors when it comes to the CEO ’s pay .
The upshot is that a mediocre - or - worse CEO — aided by his handpicked VP of human relations and a consultant from the ever - accommodating firm of Ratchet , Ratchet and Bingo — all too often receives gobs of money from an ill - designed compensation arrangement .
Take , for instance , ten year , fixed - price options ( and who would n’t ? ) .
If Fred Futile , CEO of Stagnant , Inc. , receives a bundle of these — let ’s say enough to give him an option on 1 % of the company — his self - interest is clear :
He should skip dividends entirely and instead use all of the company ’s earnings to repurchase stock .
Let ’s assume that under Fred ’s leadership Stagnant lives up to its name .
In each of the ten years after the option grant , it earns $ 1 billion on $ 10 billion of net worth , which initially comes to $ 10 per share on the 100 million shares then outstanding .
Fred eschews dividends and regularly uses all earnings to repurchase shares .
If the stock constantly sells at ten times earnings per share , it will have appreciated 158 % by the end of the option period .
That ’s because repurchases would reduce the number of shares to 38.7 million by that time , and earnings per share would thereby increase to $ 25.80 .
Simply by withholding earnings from owners , Fred gets very rich , making a cool $ 158 million , despite the business itself improving not at all .
Astonishingly , Fred could have made more than $ 100 million if Stagnant ’s earnings had declined by 20 % during the ten - year period .
Indeed , stock repurchases benefit a narrow group of corporate insiders .
Not only can such insiders benefit while the company remains stagnant , they can financially benefit while simultaneously demolishing the company ’s balance sheet .
A perfect example can be found at Citigroup .
As you saw above , Citigroup was the most aggressive company when it came to repurchasing shares .
Over the past three quarters , Citigroup has suffered a cumulative net loss of $ 17.4 billion .
To be sure , these losses were " baked in the cake " ten to fourteen quarters ago when Citigroup was speculating in mortgage - backed securities , extending shaky loans , entering into risky transactions with the monoline insurers , and participating in speculative leveraged buyouts .
Credit standards were set irresponsibly low so that revenues and net earnings would go sky high .
And , in order to goose Citigroup ’s stock price and executive compensation , Citigroup engaged in nothing short of an orgiastic stock buyback program .
It worked for a while with the stock peaking at nearly $ 56 per share in December of 2007 .
Now , the chickens have come home to roost as Citigroup ’s share price has collapsed by approximately 65 % .
Since Vikram Pandit became Citigroup ’s CEO eight months ago , he has been instrumental in raising $ 40 billion in new capital for Citigroup .
As stated in this July 15 , 2008 International Herald Tribune article , Mr. Pandit " …is trying to turn around Citigroup as the banking industry struggles through one of its most challenging periods since the Depression .
His task is particularly difficult because many Citigroup bankers , paid with stock and options for years , have seen their fortunes vanish .
Morale is low . "
I have no sympathy for these demoralized Citigroup executives and managers as their " fortunes " were built upon a financially destructive stock - buyback program pyramided upon intellectually bankrupt business and credit practices .
The next time you hear a CNBC talking head gush over a company ’s stock - buyback announcement , think of Fred Futile and his self - dealing management style .
To praise the weakening of a company ’s financial condition reveals the vapid nature of financial reporting .
More importantly , the incredible amount of stock repurchased by the seven above - mentioned financial institutions exposes the intellectual and moral rot of countless business managers and their Wall Street enablers .
Not a single analyst has cried " foul " and questioned the grotesque balance sheet mismanagement of any of these financial powerhouses ( or , more accurately , former powerhouses ) .
To me , this further reinforces my core belief that Wall Street exists to redistribute wealth from the poor and the middle - class to the wealthy .
To deny this is to remain comfortable dealing with liars and thieves .

I 've been following the recent arguments over faith and beliefs , and it reminded me of a question I 've had for some time .
Is it possible to argue a point using logical and evidentiary methods with someone who has accepted the existence of ( a ) God on faith ?
I have had many arguments with folks like this in my time , usually because they 've stopped me on the street , or turned to harangue me from the front of a cab , or stood up during speeches to heckle .
There seem to be two types .
One type I can argue with ; usually they are the ones who pose a thoughtful question , or offer an argument that is enticingly difficult to break apart ( sometimes I can't , natch ) .
I have found that these folks , even though they have accepted certain large portions of their worldview on faith , are able and more importantly willing to keep their beliefs and their argument separate ( unless , of course , we 're arguing about beliefs , which I try to avoid ) .
The other type of person who I end up arguing with and trying to avoid are those who seem to feel that their beliefs constitute a part of reality that is not only firm and unshakable to them - that 's fine - but also should be visible and obvious to me .
They seem unable to make a distinction between a truth accepted on faith , and a fact that is supported by evidence and / or experiment .
I think many of the problems that arise between ' believers ' and atheists * over communication ( does that make them metaproblems ? ) spring from the presence of either the former type of person above , or their counterpart , the atheist who treats all truths based on faith as logical negatives .
I find I can't argue with either , lending more credence in my mind to the hypothesis that it's not faith but zealotry that is the problem .
: I realize that atheist is a bad term here ; it is n't the antonym I " m looking for ( ... it is n't the antonym I 'm looking for ... ) .
However , my mind is blanking here , and I need to keep writing .
(... I need to keep writing ... )
Move along .

Campaigners have long been calling for families to be given more support to help their loved ones die at home .
Now the government in England is setting out how it plans to achieve this .
But why is it so important to spend your final days in familiar surroundings ?
Mr Gleeson wanted to die at home with his family around him Ever since Paul Gleeson was diagnosed with cancer his wish was that he could die at home .
But in the final weeks of his life , his wife , Maria , thought it was not going to be possible .
The 50 - year - old , from Henley - on - Thames , says : " I really did n't think I was going to cope .
It was all getting too much .
He need round the clock help .
" He was bed - ridden and physically I was exhausted . "
Mrs Gleeson said her husband 's consultant simply assumed he would die in a hospice .
But then a family friend told her about nurses from Marie Curie Cancer Care who could provide help to people in her situation .
After contacting the charity , she was given a nurse during the night to help her care for her 51 - year - old husband in what turned out to be his final week in March following a year - long battle with colon and stomach cancer .
This should be a right , it is about dignity
Maria Gleeson
" She was wonderful .
She just tended to his needs , making him a cup of tea , providing his personal care .
" It was at a point when I was beginning to struggle .
Without that help I am not sure he would have been able to stay at home .
" But what upsets me is that you have to ask for these services .
This should be a right , it is about dignity . "
Mrs Gleeson said being at home was important for the whole family - she has three daughters aged between 10 and 16 .
With Paul being at home he was able to help them with their music practice - and concerts in which they were taking part - right up to the end .
" He heard the music , instructed their practice .
" Home was where he felt comfortable .
And it meant his children could see him for two minutes or two hours .
Whatever they wanted .
" He and they would not have had that if he had been in hospital or hospice .
We were with him right until the end and the children will always know that .
" I hope in future years when my children look back they will remember they had the last hug , last gasp with their dad .
" They will have fond memories they helped care for him .
" There is no doubt in my mind that it was the right thing to do - for him and for the family . "

Fail and You I do n’t know about you , but every time I have to program with threads and shared resources , I want to remove my face incrementally with a salad fork .
Locks , mutexes , the synchronized keyword ; all of these things can strike fear into the heart of a green developer .
Most seasoned developers just fall into a rut of depression when it ’s time for multi-threading .
Developers like me simply talk our way out of it .
It ’s easier than thinking .
That might all change soon .
It ’s very possible that Sun Microsystems has their shit together as they engineer the new Rock processor .
Due out in 2009 , it will be the first mainstream CPU to support transactional memory .
Transactional memory will not only solve all your horrid threading problems , it will also impregnate your daughter if you do n’t keep an eye on it .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you , gramps .
Homework Is Hard .
Let ’s Play Video Games
Now I do n’t know how you did it , but when I was in computer science class and the topic of threads and mutexes came up , I gave it a whole hearted fuck this and took a 45 - minute bathroom break .
In the typical American fashion , I expected somebody to bail my ass out when I had to do this in industry .
And , if Sun ’s transactional memory works , then all the suckers who stayed in class learned resource locking for nothing .
Who ’s smart now ?
What I would have learned had I been more dedicated to my education were the two fundamental facts about multi- threading with locks :
You ’re going to fuck it up .
If you think that you have n’t fucked it up , you have .
You just do n’t know it yet .
With that in mind , there are three ways to control concurrency with locks .
First , you can make fine - grained locks , which require a lot of bookkeeping and management .
Secondly , you can also make coarse - grained locks , which are easier to implement but lead to a lot of contention .
Finally , and this is perhaps the easiest solution , you can kill yourself .
Believe me , number three looks pretty tempting after trying to find a thread related Heisenbug for two weeks .
But , if transactional memory comes into the picture , concurrent programming does n’t have such a pessimistic outlook .
No longer do you have to worry about how to control atomicity , you only have to worry about where to control atomicity .
Transactional memory lets you do things like this :
atomic { MyObject obj = myHashMap.get ( key ) ; obj.setSomeValue(x ) ; myHashMap.remove(obj ) ; myList.add ( obj ) ; }
These operations are performed atomically , and you do n’t need to worry about how it happens .
Man , that beats the shit out of studying .
Who ’s up for a beer ?
We Set Up Camp at the Bottom of the Bell Curve
Transactional memory is nothing new .
Like most suspiciously ideal things , it originated in academia , where professors would explain their ideas starting with spitefully impractical phrases like “ imagine a machine with infinite memory … , ” and students like me would put on our best display of counterfeit interest .
There are two approaches to transactional memory : software and hardware .
In Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) , the system needs a thread to keep track of memory access , which , as you can imagine , usually eats up more resources than it saves .
Hardware Transactional Memory ( HTM ) handles these memory operations on a chip .
While hardware seems like the way to go , it just brings up a whole new host of problems .
HTM implementations usually require the programmer to know some really esoteric stuff about his code ( like the number of cache lines accessed by his transactions – what the shit ? ) , and you end up at the same place you started : salad fork to the face .
I do n’t want to think .
I want to get paid the most amount of money for the least amount of work .
Somebody please do the hard stuff for me .
Sun has come up with an approach that appeals to the lowest common denominator .
They call it Hybrid Transactional Memory ( HyTM ) , and it ’s essentially an STM implementation that will use HTM when it ’s available .
As HTM gets better , code that uses HyTM gets faster automatically : no changes needed .
The Rock CPU features HTM , so this is n’t just academic chest thumping .
End result to you and me is win , and copious amounts of it .
It lets us program like I did in the snippet above without giving a thought to how things get done .
Plus , it ’s a hearty fuck - you to that guy on your team who is eerily good at using threads and locks .
That reign of passive aggressive nerd dominance is over .
He ’ll have to find something else to be better - than - everyone at , and Kendo does n’t count , Poindexter .
Some Transactions Leave You With Genital Warts
Sun Microsystems is about to horsefuck the database world , and nobody sees it coming .
Imagine a SQL database that can support the absurd level of concurrency promised by HyTM .
Conveniently , Sun owns one of the most popular relational databases in the world : MySQL .
If MySQL on a single Rock based system can outperform Oracle or Microsoft spread across many systems , then DBAs worldwide would gladly tell Larry Ellison or Steve Ballmer where to shove it .
But will it actually work ?
Sun published a few papers about HyTM last year , and they were a shot across the bow to Oracle .
Sun , it seems , employs some of the same passive aggressive nerds that your organization does .
In their papers , they showed the effect that HyTM has on BerkeleyDB .
Rewritten using Sun ’s scheme , BDB ’s locking subsystem achieves several orders of magnitude more throughput as the number of threads grows linearly .
Oracle owns Sleepycat Software , the developers of BerkeleyDB .
The dicks have been thrown down , and Sun ’s is dragging in the dirt .
Of course , this is n’t all a fellatio session .
Sun has yet to pull it off .
At one point , the Rock chip was due in 2008 , but now it ’s been delayed to 2009 .
They could still scrap it and leave us with a severe case of blue balls .
HyTM could fail to live up to expectations , leaving me looking like an idiot , or worse , it would invalidate my American dream , that I can slack off with reckless disregard for myself and others and still count on somebody to save my ass . ®

How do you imagine present day Americans would have responded to the events of July 4th , 1776 , and the years immediately preceding and following , had they occurred today ?
I shall take literary license and do what most Americans have already been taught to do , namely , compress this time period into one continuous event .
Contrary to widespread opinion , the drafters of the Declaration of Independence did not — upon completing this wonderful statement on behalf of human liberty — sit down and draft the Constitution !
The latter occurred in 1787 .
The Declaration was only a statement of philosophic principles , neither establishing — nor professing to establish — a new state apparatus .
In the true Lockean spirit in which it was fashioned , it purported to bind none other than the draftsmen themselves , mutually pledging " to each other , our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor . "
What a remarkable act , and how alien to the mindset of most Americans today who , if they had a grievance would draft a constitutional amendment , or a piece of proposed legislation to be maneuvered through Congress .
The modern approach to political grievances is to grovel before state officials and beg for leniency or , perhaps , a " new deal " of the deck of cards which they imagine fate has dealt them .
But the Declaration spoke not to kings and prime ministers , but to the spirit of humanity itself , an audience no longer patronized by the practitioners of Realpolitik .
It was a challenge to state authority , not an appeal , that underlay their efforts .
The thinking of such people as Jefferson , Sam and John Adams , John Hancock , and Franklin rarely informs political discussions anymore .
These were genuine renaissance men — an architect , a publisher as well as scientist and inventor , farmers , men of commerce , writers , philosophers — whose visions far exceeded the crassness with which we are more familiar in Washington : the Johnsons , Nixons , and Bushes , along with their hirelings : the Kissingers , Albrights , McNamaras , Renos , Rumsfelds , and Ashcrofts .
We have gone from men who believed in the supremacy and inviolability of the individual , to those who believe that human beings have no intrinsic worth , save as resources to be exploited on behalf of the power interests of a corporate - state leviathan .
The voices of the drafters of the Declaration are heard on occasion , such as at the Tiananmen Square demonstration in China a few years ago .
These young students — whose symbol was not the American flag or the dollar sign , but the Statue of Liberty — were channeling the sentiments of men like Jefferson and Sam Adams .
The sight of that sole individual , Wang Wei -Lin , confronting that row of faceless , brutish tanks , spoke to the depletion of the human spirit with which most of us have accommodated ourselves in America .
He could well have been the spiritual reincarnation of Patrick Henry , defying the dehumanizing power of the state with his words " give me liberty or give me death ! "
To contrast the spirit of 1776 with modern America , let us imagine the Revolutionary War era events taking place today .
First of all , but for the Internet , most of us would probably not hear of this document .
The lickspittles in the major media would play out their assigned roles as protectors of the political establishment in much the same way that they have ignored the spreading public opposition to the " Patriot Act " that was hurried through Congress with virtually no debate .
As Nat Hentoff observed in a recent article in the Village Voice , resolutions aimed at defending the Bill of Rights against Bush Administration efforts to expand a federal police state , have been passed at town meetings and / or city council meetings in various cities in Massachusetts , as well as Ann Arbor , Denver , and Berkeley .
Have you heard any mention of this on network or cable newscasts , or read of it in any of the major newspapers or magazines ?
If news of the Declaration managed to get through the media jamming stations , I suspect that initial news reports would characterize the drafters as " terrorists " associated with the " right - wing militia group " that had gotten into a gun battle with government troops at Lexington and Concord .
Advocates of " gun-control " laws would then be paraded before the television cameras to tell us how dangerous it is for individuals to be armed , but how a well - armed state poses no conceivable threat to the public .
We might also be shown videotape of Paul Revere ’s ride , as he was pursued by government forces in an earlier " horse chase " on Massachusetts roadways .
When the content of the Declaration began to leak out , we might see White House Press Secretary , Ari Fleischer , warning " all Americans " that " they need to watch what they say , watch what they do . "
Mr. Fleischer is in error , of course : given the expanded role of federal authorities in spying upon and supervising the behavior , speech , buying habits , and communications of us all , there is no need for us to watch what we do and say : the government is already doing these things for us !
After reading the grievances spelled out in the Declaration , British Prime Minister Lord North ( ooops , that should have been Attorney General John Ashcroft ) might have inveighed against those " who scare peace - loving people with phantoms of lost liberty , " and then warn that such utterances " only aid terrorists , for they erode our national unity . "
With the word spreading that there were " extremists " afoot in the land who insisted that governments were intended to be subservient to people , rather than their masters , the news media and federal officials would likely next undertake a campaign to identify those who , in Ashcroft ’s words , " give ammunition to America ’s enemies . "
The sordid backgrounds of the drafters would be revealed : marijuana cultivation , smuggling , alcohol brewing , and tobacco farming being just some of the activities for which the drafters would have been pilloried .
When it is further shown that some of these men owned slaves , the ad hominem nature of the attack would be in high gear .
Intelligent men and women might use the words " all men are created equal " to begin questioning how " liberty " and " slavery " could possibly co-exist .
Such an approach might distill a deeper understanding of the meaning of liberty , particularly when considering ideas that went far beyond notions of " equal rights . "
But such a response would simply not do in an age that prefers to stick labels — such as " white - male racist " — on each of these men .
In such ways does attention get deflected from the content of ideas .
You can probably script out the rest of the political / media campaign for yourself .
Having declared that " all men . . . are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable Rights , " the " feminists " will attack the document for " sexism , " while the reference to a " Creator " would suffice to uphold the charge of " religious fundamentalism . "
When it is further established that these men had been influenced by the writings of Tom Paine — whose atheist sentiments would seem to negate the religious fundamentalism charge — allegations that this group was part of some kind of " cult " would also likely be made .
News reports would then begin to appear asking about possible " cult " connections between the " rebels " and David Koresh .
And since the government massacre at Waco was the alleged motive of Timothy McVeigh ’s actions in Oklahoma City , grounds for dismissing the Declaration of Independence as a " terrorist " statement would likely have become overwhelming to those " inquiring minds " who " want to know " in today ’s culture !
All media examinations of the drafters would , of course , be undertaken by so - called " news reporters . "
Government officials , retired military officers , and minds accustomed to swimming in the shallow ends of " think tanks , " would be brought in to summarize and characterize the views of the drafters .
At no time would these men , themselves , be given the opportunity to explain or defend their words or deeds , it being the role of the media " experts " to put the state ’s desired spin on such matters .
Now you have some idea as to how this document would have been greeted had it come into being some two and a quarter centuries later .
It would likely have been dismissed , by all " right - thinking " people as the irrational rantings of an " extremist right - wing fundamentalist cult of white - racist and sexist drug - dealing males who belong to paramilitary militia groups whose anti-government views u2018 aid terrorists . ’"
Public attention would then be redirected back to where it safely belongs : examining the sexual escapades of politicians , celebrity gossip , and the relative box - office earnings of various movies .
Do my speculations sound far - fetched to you ?
If so , perhaps you need to listen more closely to what government officials and the media are telling you and , more importantly , what they are not telling you .
You also need to pay closer attention to how you are being informed of events in your world .
If you have not already done so , you might want to sit down and read the " Declaration of Independence . "
As with so many other basic writings , most of us have a familiarity that has not , unfortunately , arisen from an actual reading of the works .
Ask yourself whether the human spirit that burned those liberating words into parchment — in a day when men were hanged for such anti-government sentiments — is aflame within you .
To focus on this question a bit more , ask yourself how — if at all — you intend to spend July 4th .
Will it be in celebration of your independence , or submission to a condition of dependence ?
Do you regard your interests as primary , and the state ’s as secondary , in political matters , the basic premise underlying the Declaration of Independence ?
Perhaps the following quotation can help you to answer this question :
I hold it , that a little rebellion , now and then , is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical .
These words would doubtless raise the ire of Mr. Ashcroft which , he would say , " aid terrorists " and " erode our national unity . "
One who spoke them , today , would likely be arrested , transported to an isolated military base to be held — indefinitely , incommunicado , and without benefit of a public trial — as an " enemy combatant . "
The man who spoke these words was , of course , a former American president and the draftsman of the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson !
To generations of Americans long conditioned in the collectivist premises of the Pledge of Allegiance — which speaks of " one nation , indivisible " — the idea of the moral supremacy of individuals who , no longer " consenting " to be governed , had the " right to alter or abolish " the political system they had set up , is incomprehensible .
It is not so much that most people disagree with the proposition as it is that they find it meaningless , as irrelevant to their lives as the provisions of Magna Carta !
Most Americans have contented themselves with their subservience to the state .
When I was growing up , we understood a " patriot " to be as it is described in The Oxford English Dictionary : " one whose ruling passion is the love of his country , " and " who maintains and defends his country ’s freedom or rights . "
Such a definition was even extended to one who was " a factious disturber of the government . "
Today , " patriotism " — like " liberty " — has come to mean little more , to most people , than obedience to political authority !
Bear in mind that , on July 4th , 1776 , the British were not an invading army , but the established government in America .
But such men as drafted the Declaration had a deeper love for the country that transcended any duty of obedience the state sought to impose upon them .
It was in this sense that those of my generation learned to regard Jefferson and his colleagues — not the Loyalists who supported the existing government — as patriots .
The Declaration ’s appeal to the sovereignty of each individual has become weaker over the decades , as most of us accept the propriety of others exercising authority over our lives .
We increasingly accept the proposition that we are not to be trusted with any genuine power over our lives and that , for our " own good , " the state must act on our behalf .
Even such limited power as is found in firecrackers , sparklers , and Roman candles , are deemed too " dangerous " to our well - being and so , on July 4th , we allow the government , with its fireworks displays , to celebrate our " liberty " and " independence " for us !
The liberating words of men like Thomas Jefferson are regarded as passé in modern America .
Most of us now prefer the soothing assurances of our current George III !

Mississippi , one of the nation ’s most conservative states , has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter - century .
It has voted for Republican presidential candidates in the last seven elections .
But this year , there is a real chance that the state will send a Democrat to the Senate .
That prospect is a window onto a remarkable political trend that has been eclipsed by the fireworks surrounding the 2008 presidential contest : Democrats are running strong Senate campaigns in states such as Mississippi , Alaska and North Carolina that Republicans have long taken for granted .
The outlook for the GOP is so grim that party leaders have readily conceded there is no chance they can regain control of the Senate in 2008 , even though Democrats ’ current majority is slim , 51 - 49 .

“ If you have an R in front of your name , you better run scared , ” said Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , who says the party will do well if it holds its losses to three or four seats .
The Mississippi race between Democratic former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove and Republican Sen. Roger
Wicker distills the wide range of factors that have put congressional Republicans in their weakest position since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s .
The overall political climate , shaped by the sluggish economy and President Bush ’s low approval ratings , is souring many voters on Republicans .
The party has been hobbled by a stampede of retirements by senior Republicans , including Mississippi Sen .
Trent Lott .
After Lott quit in 2007 , Wicker was appointed to replace him .
Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign has generated a big boost in Democratic voter registration , especially among African Americans , who make up more than a third of Mississippi ’s population .
Other quirks , such as ethics scandals , are putting more Republican Senate seats at risk than seemed likely a year ago .

In June 2007 , the nonpartisan Cook Political Report identified only one race for a Republican Senate seat as a real tossup .
Now it identifies seven Republican seats as at risk .
The stakes for Obama in the Senate races are high .
If he is elected president , the biggest obstacle to his goals could be in the Senate , where parliamentary rules mean that it can take 60 votes to approve legislation .
The Senate currently includes 49 Democrats and two independents who are aligned with the Democratic caucus .
“ Big changes do n’t happen without big Senate majorities , ” Obama wrote in a recent letter urging Democrats to contribute to Senate campaign coffers .
For now , most political analysts are predicting a Democratic gain of four to eight seats , which would leave the party short of the 60 - vote threshold .
But Republicans are worried , because bigger gains are not out of the question : Democratic fundraising is strong and the battlefield is heavily tilted against the GOP .

“ This is the toughest election in my 32 years in the United States Senate , ” wrote Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) , vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , in a fundraising letter .
Senate Republicans are defending 23 seats ; 12 Democratic seats are at stake .
No Democrats are retiring -- a good thing for the party , because it is usually easier to reelect an incumbent than to win an open seat .
By contrast , three senior Republicans are quitting , including two who probably would have easily won reelection .
The retirements of Sens. John W. Warner of Virginia and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico open the way for likely Democratic takeovers by former Gov. Mark Warner in Virginia and Rep. Tom Udall in New Mexico .
In Colorado , the retirement of GOP Sen .
Wayne Allard has led to a close race between two House members .
Advertisement
Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , chairman of the Democrats ’
Senate election committee , said that a year ago he expected four Democratic incumbents to have a fight on their hands .
But only one , Sen. Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana , has drawn serious opposition .
Mississippi has emerged as an unexpected battleground largely because Lott , a powerful and well - established Republican , quit the Senate to become a lobbyist .
Wicker , who had been a House member , was appointed to replace him , but he has not established himself firmly enough statewide to assure easy reelection .
Musgrove , his Democratic opponent , is a well - known former governor and is expected to benefit from the Obama campaign ’s efforts to register new voters , including African Americans .
Obama ’s nationwide registration drive also could help Kay Hagan , the North Carolina Democrat who is challenging GOP Sen .
Elizabeth Dole .
Obama inspired a big increase in black voter turnout during the state ’s primary .

Though Democrats may benefit from the turnout generated by Obama , Schumer says that the party ’s candidates in conservative states will probably keep their distance from the national ticket .
“ We have been running a campaign that is Mississippi first , ” said Adam Bozzi , Musgrove ’s communications director .
“ We have to run a campaign based on Ronnie Musgrove and Roger Wicker . ”
But in other states , Democratic Senate candidates have embraced Obama .
In Oregon , Democratic candidate Jeff Merkley ’s campaign shares office space with the Obama staff .
Obama ’s name appears with Merkley ’s on campaign fliers .
Obama is so popular in Oregon that the Republican incumbent , Sen. Gordon H. Smith , has run an ad bragging about his record of working with Obama .
Advertisement
Another improbable battleground is Alaska , which has not elected a Democratic member of Congress since 1974 , and which gave Bush 61 % of its vote in the last presidential election .
This year , GOP Sen .
Ted Stevens is facing a tough reelection fight , shadowed by ethics questions concerning his ties to an oil field services contractor .
Democrat Mark Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , is leading in some polls .
He also is expecting to benefit from a surge of Democratic activism organized by Obama , who won the state ’s caucuses by a landslide .
While the Senate races are roiling some states unexpectedly , two incumbents whom Democrats considered top targets are holding their own .
Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) is out - polling her Democratic rival , Rep. Tom Allen .
And Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn. ) , while still in a tough race , is benefiting from missteps and controversies surrounding Al Franken , the comedian running against him .

An animal expert in Italy is claiming to have found proof of the existence of unicorns after he stumbled upon a young roe deer with a single horn growing from the centre of its forehead .
The 10 - month old animal is part of a herd of deer that are otherwise equipped with two antlers at the Prato natural science centre in Tuscany .
'' It 's proof that the mythical unicorn celebrated in iconography and legends was probably not just a fantastic creature but a real animal : a deer or other species with an anomaly similar to that of our deer , '' said the centre 's director Gilberto Tozzi .
Unicorns have been a fixture in mythology and art since pre-Roman times , often said to be solitary creature unless accompanied by a maiden , with horns that can be used to cure poisonings .
Christian writers promoted unicorns as symbols of Christ .
Marco Polo claimed to have spotted a unicorn on his travels , but from his description of an " ugly " animal wallowing in mud , it is believed he had stumbled upon a rhino .
Tozzi said his " unicorn " was shy .
" Our deer may be aware that he is different as he does n't allow himself to be seem very easily , " he said .
The mother of the unusual deer was brought to the centre a few years ago after being hit and injured by a car in Italy 's Apennine mountains .

I want to talk about a novel recursion scheme that has n't received a lot of attention from the Haskell community and its even more obscure dual -- which is necessarily more obscure because I believe this is the first time anyone has talked about it .
Jiri Adámek , Stefan Milius and Jiri Velebil have done a lot of work on Elgot algebras .
Here I 'd like to translate them into Haskell , dualize them , observe that the dual can encode primitive recursion , and provide some observations .
You can kind of think an Elgot algebra as a hylomorphism that cheats .
> elgot :: Functor f => ( f b -> b ) -> ( a ->
Either b ( f a ) ) -> a -> b > elgot phi psi = h where h = ( id ||| phi . fmap h ) .
psi
If you look at the signature for a hylomorphism :
> hylo :: Functor f => ( f b -> b ) -> ( a -> f a ) -> a -> b > hylo phi psi = h where h = phi .
fmap h .
psi
Then you can see that an Elgot algebra is basically a hylomorphism that is allowed to shortcircuit the infinite tower of fmaps and return an intermediate result directly .
In some sense you can say that the coalgebra - like side of the hylomorphism is no longer oblivious to the algebra used to deconstruct the intermediate result .
We can take the Elgot algebra and dualize it to get a novel construction where the algebra - like side is no longer oblivious to the coalgebra .
This allows your algebra to cheat and just use the intermediate results constructed by the anamorphism to return an answer .
I 'll choose to call this co -( Elgot algebra ) an Elgot coalgebra in the sequel .
> coelgot :: Functor f => ( ( a , f b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> f a ) -> a -> b > coelgot phi psi = h where h = phi . ( id &&& fmap h . psi )
In a lot of ways an Elgot algebra resembles Vene and Uustalu 's apomorphism .
> apo :: Functor f => ( a -> f ( Either ( Mu f ) a ) ) -> a ->
Mu f > apo psi = h where h = InF . fmap h . ( fmap Left . outF ||| psi ) .
Right
However , we have ' unfixed ' the algebra to be used from InF to something more general and the layering of Either and f is different .
Now , a generalized apomorphism does something similar entangling two coalgebras , but the signature does n't quite match up either , since a generalized apomorphism uses an F - coalgebras and an F - ( b + _ ) - monadic coalgebra .
> g_apo :: Functor f => ( b -> f b ) -> ( a -> f ( Either b a ) ) -> a ->
Mu f > g_apo g f = h where h = InF . fmap h . ( fmap Left . g ||| f ) .
Right
Similarly a zygomorphism , or more generally a mutumorphism entangles two algebras .
An Elgot algebra occupies a somewhat rare spot in the theory of constructive algorithmics or recursion schemes in that it while it mixes an algebra with a coalgebra like a hylomorphism or metamorphisms , it entangles them in a novel way .
If we specialize the Elgot algebra by fixing its algebra to InF we get :
> elgot_apo :: Functor f => ( a ->
Either ( Mu f ) ( f a ) ) -> a ->
Mu f > elgot_apo psi = h where h = ( id | || InF . fmap h ) .
psi
We can see that the type is now closely related to that of an apomorphism with some slight changes in design decisions .
Instead of wrapping a functor around further seeds , a , or a finished structure , this specialized Elgot algebra returns the finished structure directly or an f wrapped around seeds .
The Good
So can we convert between an apomorphism and an Elgot algebra ?
For a somewhat circuitous path to that answer lets recall the definition of strength from my post a couple of weeks ago .
Flipping the arguments and direction of application for strength to simplify what is coming we get :
> strength ' :: Functor f => t -> f a -> f ( t , a ) > strength ' fa b = fmap ( ( , ) b ) fa
With that in hand we quickly find that we can rederive paramorphisms ( and hence primitive recursion ) from the novel notion of an Elgot coalgebra that we defined above by leaning on the strength of our functor .
> para :: Functor f => ( f ( Mu f , c ) -> c ) ->
Mu f -> c > para f = coelgot ( f . uncurry strength ' ) out F
This result tells us that the shiny new Elgot coalgebras we defined above are strong enough to encode primitive recursion when working in Haskell .
The Bad
This tempts us to try to derive apomorphisms from Elgot algebras using the dual case , costrength .
However , if you 'll recall from my previous post on comonadic costrength , we can't do that in general .
The result is only defined for Traversable functors ; not every functor is costrong in Haskell !
Consequently and counterintuitively , though we can define a paramorphism in terms of Elgot coalgebras , we can only define an apomorphism in terms of Elgot algebras for traversable functors .
The Ugly
Now , worse news .
Since the tower of functors we build up does n't run off to infinity we lose the ability to generalize Elgot ( co ) algebras using the same machinery we can use to generalize the various traditional recursion schemes by parameterizing it by a ( co ) monad and distributive law .
At least the straightforward translation fails .
For instance in the case of an Elgot algebra , the obvious addition would be to allow for the algebra ( f a -> a ) to be replaced with a F - W - comonadic algebra ( f ( w a ) -> a ) for some comonad w .
However , attempts to do so run afoul of the fact that the coalgebra - like structure feeds us an ' a ' not a 'w a ' .
We can of course change the signature of the coalgebra to give us the comonad , but the breakdown of modularity is unfortunate .
Similary , parameterizing the coalgebra - like structure with a monad requires the ability to distribute the monad over Either b to get to where it can apply the distributive law for the base functor f .
Interestingly the Either monad works , which gives us ways to compose Elgot ( co ) algebras , but that is a story for another day .
As usual there is a tradeoff in expressivity in one area to compensate for gains in another , but this manner of entangling provides us with a new set of possibilities to explore .
