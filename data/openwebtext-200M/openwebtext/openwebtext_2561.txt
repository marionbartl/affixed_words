Buyer Beware : Geek Squad's Half - Baked HDTV & Home Theater Hook - Up By Chris Boylan
Geek Squad Is No Candidate for " Speaker " of the House
As the editor of a home theater publication , I 'm often asked for advice from my friends , not only on what HDTV , Blu-ray player and speakers to buy , but also how to connect it all together for the best picture and sound .
A couple of years ago , this prompted me to write a three part article on " how to hook up that fancy new HDTV . "
To this day , these articles remain some of the most popular pages on the site .
But many people do n't want to become educated on the finer points of HDTV resolutions , aspect ratios and surround sound technology just to hook up a few wires .
Instead , they will call in an expert to set everything up for them .
And that 's just what my friend Diane thought she was doing by calling in the Geek Squad , the installation and services arm of Best Buy .
I asked her how she was enjoying her newly installed HDTV and HD cable set - top box and what I heard ( and later verified first - hand via a social visit ) was a tale of woe that could only be described as incompetence at its finest .
As the Geek Squad recommends , Diane called their toll - free number to schedule a visit .
After being handed off to the seventh person - and being charged for the service before being able to talk to the scheduling person , Diane asked why it was all so complicated .
She was told by the phone rep in hushed tones that she would be better off visiting a Best Buy store and scheduling everything there ( much simpler ) .
Once she did have her appointment , the first Geek to show up said he was not able to do the work as she was missing some of the required cables .
The Geek said she was welcome to purchase cables from him for $ 250 ( " all I have in the truck " ) or buy cables herself from Radio Shack ( $ 20 ) and re-schedule .
Re-schedule it was and after another frustrating series of calls , Diane had her second appointment for audio / video nirvana .
For the princely sum of $ 216.74 * , the Geek Squad " expert " who showed up to do the work left her system in a worse state of disrepair than it had been before he arrived .
Oh the cables were all neatly tucked away and she was certainly getting sound and picture from all sources , but everything was not as it should have been .
Far from it .
Here are just a few of the things that went awry with the Geek Squad 's " expert installation : "
Where 's the Dialog ?
Diane 's main complaint with the system after the Geek 's visit was that she could n't enjoy any DVD movies because the dialog seemed to be missing or so low in the mix that it was inaudible over any background music .
It turns out that the Geek had turned on the center channel output in Diane 's surround sound receiver , without any center channel speaker connected .
Setting a center channel speaker to " Off " or " None " in your receiver 's set - up menu is essential if your system does not include a center speaker .
Diane 's system consists of two front speakers ( with subs ) and two rear speakers .
You could call it a " 4.0 " surround sound ( or 4.2 if you count the subwoofers ) .
Because her two front speakers are fairly close to each other , a center channel speaker is not really necessary .
Most receivers that support Dolby Digital surround have an option for a " Phantom Center " - this routes all center channel information ( mostly dialog ) to the front left and right speaker as dual mono , creating a " phantom image " - a virtual center channel that comes from a point between the two main front speakers .
To engage this feature , all you need to do is set Center Speaker to " No " or " Off " in the receiver 's set - up menu .
If you do n't do this and you have no center channel speaker connected then all that nice juicy dialog disappears into nowhere - land .
Solution ?
I turned center channel to " OFF " in the receiver 's set - up menu .
Hey , listen - there 's a voiceover here !
Where 's the Bass ?
Diane 's front speaker system consists of a pair of small bookshelf speakers and a matched pair of passive woofers .
The Geek said " oh , you do n't need those " and plugged in only the small satellite speakers , disconnecting the subwoofers from the receiver entirely .
Diane had noticed that the sound was " a bit tinny " after he did his thing .
Hmmm , I wonder why ?
Solution ?
I plugged in the woofers .
Hey , so that 's what bass sounds like !
Where 's the Surround Sound ?
As anyone who enjoys a home theater can tell you , a properly set up surround sound system can really draw you into a movie .
With sometimes subtle , sometimes dramatic sonic cues coming from all around you , it 's easy to get lost in the on -screen action .
But to do this properly , you really need a digital connection between your source device ( DVD or Blu- ray player or HD cable box ) and your receiver .
OK some higher end players can support discrete multi-channel surround sound via multiple analog cables , but digital audio is the simplest , most fool - proof way to go .
Instead of using the fiberoptic or coax digital outputs of the DVD player to connect it to Diane 's receiver , the Geek used a plain old stereo pair of white and red analog outputs .
With this connection , the best you can get from a movie is matrixed Dolby Pro Logic " pseudo - surround " - you simply can't get real discrete multi-channel surround sound out of this connection .
Solution ?
I unplugged the stereo analog connection and plugged in the coax digital connection using a basic RCA cable .
Wow !
So that 's what they mean by SURROUND sound !
The Worst Seat in the House
A slightly more advanced part of setting up a surround sound audio system is getting the right blend or balance of sound between the channels ( front to back , left to right , etc. ) .
If you do n't do this properly then you might get not enough or too much sound from your rear channel speakers , either of which condition detracts from the overall sound .
The Geek did adjust the speaker levels when he " calibrated " the system , cranking up the rear channels as high as they could possibly go ( +10 dB ) .
The net effect was that , even after I set the center channel properly and connected the digital cable , dialog and other sounds from the front of the soundstage were completely overpowered by the rear channel sounds .
Listening to a concert or sports scene in a movie made you feel like you were in the nosebleed section of the stadium , miles away from the performer with nothing but loud crowd noise behind you .
Although not all set - up menus are as detailed as this one from the Integra DTC - 9.8 preamp / processor , virtually all surround sound - capable receivers allow you to customize and to test your speaker configuration .
To add insult to injury , the Geek had wired the rear channels backwards - left output to right speaker , right output to left .
This was immediately obvious just by running the receiver 's test tone which cycles a white noise signal through all connected speakers .
Solution ?
I corrected the left / right mix - up and turned the rear channel levels down from +10 to +1 dB in the receiver 's set - up menu .
This created a much better blend of sound around the room , and particularly from the primary viewing location on the couch .
Why Does Every TV Show Look Like " The Biggest Loser ? "
Have you ever been in a sports bar , looking up at the wall o flat screen TVs and everyone looks a little pudgy ?
Even the supermodels on those Victoria 's Secret commercials ?
This usually occurs when you take non-widescreen source material ( e.g. , standard def TV ) and stretch it out to fit the whole screen of a widescreen TV .
It can also happen when your DVD player or cable box is set to the wrong " aspect ratio " or " TV shape . "
And that 's exactly what our favorite Geek did with Diane 's system - he set the cable box to " stretch " mode and the DVD player to " 4:3 " ( non-widescreen ) .
Virtually all DVD and Blu-ray players have a set - up option for aspect ratio .
This one comes from a Samsung Blu-ray Disc player .
If a DVD player is set up for a non-widescreen TV ( 4:3 aspect ratio ) but you actually have a widescreen HDTV ( 16:9 aspect ratio ) , then the TV will automatically stretch everything out to fit the full screen width , but there will still be large black bars at the top and bottom of the screen on most movies .
Now of course , black bars are inevitable on some DVDs and Blu-ray Discs - it 's the only way to fit the whole picture of an ultra wide Cinemascope - style movie ( 2.35:1 aspect ratio ) onto an HDTV screen ( 1.78:1 ) .
But if your DVD player or other source is set incorrectly , then these black bars will be larger than they should be and everything will be stretched out .
If a DVD player is set to 4:3 aspect ratio but connected to a 16:9 HDTV , the image gets squished or stretched as you can see in the image on the right .
Solution ?
I set the cable box to " normal " screen size ( instead of " stretch " ) and set the DVD player 's output to 16:9 instead of 4:3 .
Voila - no more stretching .
But damn , that Lindsay Lohan really does need to eat a burger once in a while .
Other Missed Opportunities
I could go into detail about other opportunities missed by the Geek in his set - up - the fact that he could have set up the TV to skip unused inputs , or that he could have set the TV 's picture to " Standard " or " Cinema " mode instead of the woefully inaccurate " Game " mode , or that he could have left the receiver in its Auto Format Detect mode for best results with a variety of programming .
But frankly , if he could n't get the basics right , then how could he be expected to master the finer details ?
Lesson Learned ?
I 'd like to think that Diane 's experience with the Geek Squad was isolated and not indicative of their usual performance .
I can't imagine that the operation would be as extensive and successful as it is , inhabiting Best Buy locations all across the country , if every Geek were as unskilled ( OK , " clueless " ) as the one who made this particular service call .
Also , to be fair , the Geek Squad does state that they offer a money back guarantee if you 're unhappy with their service ( and you complain within 30 days ) .
But from Diane 's perspective she had such a bad experience with the initial calls to schedule the service and the two actual service calls that she did n't want to deal with their customer service again , or to accept yet another stranger into her home to fix something that never should have been broken in the first place .
Also , after the service call , Diane though she would just have to " live with it " and that maybe she had hit the wrong button on her remote or something .
After all , her system had been set up by a professional so who was she to second guess that expert ?
Diane did call Geek Squad customer service after my visit , but since it was more than 30 days after the service call , they refused to offer a refund .
So now she has contested the charge with American Express and it's fairly likely they will have more success in this regard than she did .
In fact , the AMEX rep told Diane that they had been getting " frequent complaints " about The Geek Squad recently and would be happy to pursue this further .
We contacted Best Buy ( owner 's of Geek Squad ) about the issue and received the following comment from a company spokesperson :
" Thank you for giving us an opportunity to look into this situation , and also for giving Best Buy the benefit of a doubt .
We 've reviewed our customer call files and see a visit to Diane 's home on September 7 of last year .
There appears to have been a hiatus between those service calls and renewed contact by Diane with our Customer Care team on March 4 ( yesterday ) .
We assumed that Diane was satisfied with her original installation , and apologize that this was n't the case .
This is a complex space where things can go wrong .
As you point out , while Diane 's situation is isolated , it stands out as a reminder to all of our installers to get it right the first time . "
That 's all well and good , but the bottom line is this : just because someone wears a white short - sleeved dress shirt with a black clip - on tie * it does n't mean he has a clue about home theater systems and HDTVs .
If you do n't like the results of your local Geek , or any other home theater or HDTV installer for that matter , then escalate the situation immediately or take it up with your credit card company and refuse to pay until everything looks and sounds the way it should .

* Editorial notes :
The $ 216.74 fee from Geek Squad included " home theater set - up " ( $ 199.99 ) plus tax .
Diane originally thought she was charged $ 325.11 as she had similar charges from Best Buy on the same week and got the two charges confused .
The fee was corrected in the article on 3/10 .
Also , as has been pointed out by several readers , the white shirt black tie uniform is normally only worn by the computer geeks ( not the home theater geeks ) .
I have no earthly idea what Diane 's installer was actually wearing at the time of the service call , nor did she take any notes on his attire , but the geek 's outfit has no bearing on performance ( unless he was clad in a way that would provide some additional entertainment value for her money , but this was apparently not the case ) .
I just stumbled across a really cool video , one made last November ( but put up this month ) by a Japanese guy that went up to his company 's rooftop to get a video of the ISS passing by .
At the same time though someone else from the building that he did n't know came out for a cigarette and was looking at the guy on the rooftop with the video camera a bit weird , so he had no choice but to tell him what he was taking a video of , and they end up talking about it a bit .
The first minute or so of the video is just him alone with some music he added later on .
Thus far only 26 people have viewed the video .
The conversation is in Japanese so I translated it and put it below .
I 'll embed the video here , but if you want to follow along with the conversation it 's probably better to open the video up in its own window so that you can follow along without having to scroll down within this post .
And the English translation :
Nov. 21 2008 ( Fri ) , somewhere in Odawara , southwest part of the sky
0:10 Venus
0:13 Jupiter
0:34 The ISS is moving slowly upward ...
0:45 Venus is separating from Jupiter to go on its journey alone ...
0:55
It gets even brighter as it moves towards the top of the sky ...
1:11 A person who has come to the roof of the building to have a smoke appears .
I 'm being looked at suspiciously so I have no choice ...
1:12 " That 's the International Space Station . "
1:15 Really ? ... Really .
1:20 Wow ...
1:24 I knew it could be seen now so I brought the camera .
1:28 No idea .
1:30 Yeah , you have to know about it to see .
1:33 You can't tell by yourself I guess .
1:35 Well , if you know the orbit ...
1:38 So it 's that thing on the lower left ?
1:40 That bright thing you can see over here right now .
1:43 The brightest one ? -
That 's right .
That one .
1:49 It 's moving pretty fast , is n't it ? - Yeah , it 's moving .
1:50 In five minutes you wo n't be able to see it anymore .
1:57 There are people inside there right now .
2:01 How far away is it from us ?
- About 400 km .
2:08 So about from Nagoya to Tokyo ?
( Door opens and coworker appears )
2:11 You 're just in time !
There it is .
2:13 It 's gotten a fair bit darker .
2:15 Where is it ? -
Um , there .
2:17 There .
It 's moving down a bit .
2:19 It 's , well , gotten pretty dark .
2:21 Quite a bit . --
Oh , that ? --
That thing moving a bit .
Yeah , yeah .
2:24 Yeah .
Oh , you can't see it anymore .
2:26 I can see it a bit . --
No , that 's a star .
2:30 What ?
It 's gone ? -- Yeah ...
2:31 No , it 's sparkling a bit .

Is it ?
2:34 Yeah , it 's kind of sparkling .
2:35 Oh , is it ?
2:38 Yeah .
Fox host : 9/11 truthers are ' mentally ill ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 5 , 2009

When the New York Times explored the political beliefs of Daniel Sunjata , an actor on the FX network 's show " Rescue Me , " it was under the banner of a " sinister theory . "
The " sinister theory " that a group of neoconservative politicians may have colluded to allow , or bring about , the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
On Thursday 's Fox and Friends , Greg Gutfield , provocative host of Fox 's late night program Red Eye , called individuals like Sunjata , who question the events of 9/11 , " mentally ill . "
" [ Sunjata ] believe that 9/11 was a preemptive strike by a neoconservative government , " said Gutfield .
" I think that means Bush .
What angers me about this is people are treating it with respect . "
The 9/11 issues are major plot lines in the first 10 episodes of Rescue Me season 5 , set to air in April .
" The New York Times ran a piece about it , " said Gutfield .
" They interviewed the producer -- the producer described the actor , the actor believes this stuff , that the actor is well - read , very passionate about it .
" They say this sort of thing about conspiratorialists all the time , but they never say these people are idiots , they 're mentally ill , they should n't be treated with respect .
" It 's an insult to people that were victims of 9/11 and their families .
It 's an insult to firefighters .
I am surprised they are doing this . "
Of course , Gutfield , as a professional media water and commentator , should n't be surprised at all .
In 2005 , the Fire Department of New York saw its Muslim Chaplain resign after espousing views similar to Sunjata's .
" I 've heard professionals say that nowhere ever in history did a steel building come down with fire alone , " said the Chaplain in an interview with Newsday .
" It takes two or three weeks to demolish a building like that , " he said .
" But it was pulled down in a couple of hours .
Was it 19 hijackers who brought it down , or was it a conspiracy ? "
And the former NYFD Chaplain is not alone in his ranks .
A group named Firefighters for 9/11 Truth has called for :
" A truly independent investigation with Subpoena and Contempt Powers to uncover the complete truth of the events related to 9/11/2001  specifically the collapse of WTC Tower 7 and the possibility of explosive demolition .
The investigation to follow the national standards so clearly outlined in the National Fire Protection Association guidelines , specifically , NFPA 921 to include thorough analysis of the steel for the presence of ' exotic accelerants . '
Congress to honor the promises made to the rescue workers of 9/11 by passing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2008 .
Prosecution of all individuals willfully involved in the planning , and execution of the murders committed on September 11 , 2001 .
Prosecution of all individuals willfully involved in the Obstruction of Justice and Destruction of Evidence surrounding the events of September 11 , 2001 . "
" ' They re not discussed a lot in the press , ' Daniel Sunjata , the actor who plays Franco Rivera on  Rescue Me , ' told reporters at a television press tour last month , " reported the Times .
" He predicted that the episode would be ' socio - politically provocative . '
" ... Mr. Sunjatas character delivers a two - minute monologue for a French journalist describing a ' neoconservative government effort ' to control the worlds oil , drastically increase military spending and ' change the definition of pre-emptive attack . '
To put it into action , he continues , ' what you need is a new Pearl Harbor .
That s what they said they needed . ' "
Furthermore , Gutfield 's assertion that the families of 9/11 victims would be offended at the questioning of the official story in popular media is particularly revisionist , if he was referring to every family .
While some family members are critical of President Obama 's decision to shut down the Guantanamo prison , widows of 9/11 victims were instrumental in forcing the formation of the 9/11 Commission , which was ultimately run by Bush transition team adviser Philip Zelikow after Bush 's first choice , Henry Kissinger , resigned under intense fire from the widows .
The 2006 film 9/11 : Press for Truth tells the tale of those widows , whose efforts to have their litany of questions answered went unheeded under the Bush administration .
" People are too scared to confront the 9/11 conspiracies , " said Gutfield .
" Cause , it 's like the crazy guy on the subway , you do n't want to make eye contact , but eventually you gotta make eye contact .
You gotta tell that guy to get lost . "
The hosts failed to note that the FX network , which is airing " Rescue Me , " is owned by News Corporation , the parent company of Fox News .

Facebook intends to capitalise on the wealth of information it has about its users by offering its 150 million - strong customer base to corporations as a market research tool .
The appearance , later this year , of corporate polls targeted at certain parts of the Facebook audience because of the information they have posted on their pages , is likely to infuriate privacy campaigners .
Last week Mark Zuckerberg , the company 's 24 - year - old founder and chief executive , showed the audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos how the social networking site could be used to poll specific groups of users .
He asked users in Palestine and then Israel about peace issues before relaying the results back to the audience within minutes .
He also polled more than 100,000 American users of the website , asking them whether they thought President Obama 's fiscal stimulus package would be enough to resurrect the economy .
Two out of five said it was not enough .
Giving consumer brands the chance to use such a wide audience to get a quick response to targeted questions would do away with , or at least reduce their reliance on , expensive and time - consuming focus groups .
Speaking to well known tech blogger Robert Scoble at the event , Zuckerberg said 2009 will be Facebook 's " intense " year as it tries to justify some of the mammoth valuations that have been placed upon it by making some serious revenues through advertising .
He was even seen sporting a tie , a sartorial extra which the Harvard drop - out has so far eschewed .
He added the company has been experimenting with analysis of user sentiment , tracking the mood of its audience through what they are doing online .
Such information is potentially very interesting to large brands , which are always seeking to measure what their customers think about their own or competitors ' products .
Facebook 's advertising technology already allows advertisers to choose which sort of customer will see their ­display adverts when they log on to the site .
Advertisers can choose from such ­categories as where the user is located and their age and gender , based upon what the user has uploaded on to Facebook – which is adding about 450,000 new users a day .
Last year , Facebook launched its Engagement Ads tool , which allows advertisers to publish a poll on people 's home pages .
They are then able to see how their friends and other Facebook users have voted .
The polls , which can include actions such as watching and rating a movie trailer , are being tested by companies including AT&T and CareerBuilder.com .
The American recruitment website tonight used its trial Facebook polls to ask people what they thought of the advert that was played during the coverage of the 43rd Super Bowl .
The first widespread use of polls is expected in the spring .
Facebook also has a tool called Facebook Lexicon , which is a bit like Google Trends , in that it allows users to track what topics are being discussed by people on Facebook .
While Google Trends uses the search terms that are entered into its site , Facebook Lexicon looks at one of the most visible parts of a user 's profile page – their wall , where people and their friends exchange public messages .
It provides a searchable database of trends over time , showing how the incidence of particular words or phrases has increased or decreased in wall posts .
Facebook Lexicon shows that the company already has a significant database of user information which it could exploit and the tools are in place to allow companies to use its information for market research purposes .
For years , so - called job search advice gurus have pointed to government jobs as sanctuaries of stability and security .
After all , they said , the government rarely shrinks and always grows .
They are less picky about performance , and you are guaranteed pay raises just for sticking around .
Well , as events are proving in California and other bankrupt states nationwide , the security of government jobs is not as sure as it used to be .
The California state government will begin laying off 20,000 government workers starting today in an effort to respond to falling tax revenues and a $ 42 - billion budget deficit .
Layoffs will include workers in health and human services , corrections , and other agencies that receive money from the state 's general fund .
So , you thought government service was bad now ?
Wait until they take 20,000 more workers off the job .
People will be camping overnight just to make sure they get their registration renewed .
That is , until they realize that car registrations have gone up to $ 250 .
This same trend is continuing in other states that have watched their breadwinner businesses fail while taking on additional debt to fund state projects .
In fact , the majority of the states in the union are bankrupt , facing a crisis similar to California's .
So , it 's time to face the facts : government jobs are not secure .
Government jobs , in the end , are paid for with taxpayer money .
When a recession hits , taxpayer money goes down .
The result : government jobs are just as vulnerable as other jobs .
It just takes a little while longer .
The lesson : its time for us to rethink all of our preconceived notions about jobs and spending and security .
One thing is for sure : this recession will change the rules for everyone involved and those who survive with their shirts will be those who learn to rely on their own merits .

The air raid on Gaza came after a Grad rocket hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon Israeli planes have bombed smuggling tunnels on Gaza 's border with Egypt , the Israeli military says .
The raid came after a rocket fired from the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon .
The attacks are the latest violations of ceasefires declared by both sides after an Israeli assault on Gaza meant to stop militant rocket fire on Israel .
Meanwhile , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised a sustained effort to create a Palestinian state .
Speaking to reporters with Middle East envoy George Mitchell , newly - returned from his first visit to the region , she promised to work towards a " negotiated agreement that would end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians " .
Telephone warning Hamas and Israel declared separate ceasefires on 18 January after Israel 's three - week attack on the Gaza Strip .
About 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in fighting as Israel tried to halt or significantly reduce militant rocket fire , and to degrade the military capability of Hamas .
Israel had warned of a harsh response to any further rocket fire from Gaza after the long - range Grad rocket hit Ashkelon on Tuesday .
It was the first attack on Israel involving a Grad rocket since the ceasefires .
Other rockets and mortars have been launched from Gaza , however , and Israel has bombed targets in the narrow coastal territory .
No casualties have been reported in either of the latest attacks .
" I suggest Hamas does n't fool around with us , " said Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak .
" The air force is operating in Gaza as we speak .
We promised calm in the south and we will keep our promise . "
Residents of Rafah , on the border with Egypt , said they received telephone calls from the Israeli military warning them to leave their homes ahead of the air raid .
The town is the location of many of the tunnels used to smuggle goods , including weapons , into the Gaza Strip .
There has been no word on which group was behind Tuesday 's rocket attack , but the Israeli prime minister 's spokesman , Mark Regev , accused Hamas of trying to undermine the ceasefire .
Ashkelon , a city of 122,000 people , is 12 km ( 7 miles ) from northern Gaza .
The city is out of range of the standard rockets and mortars fired by Palestinian militants .

Vala Tutorial
Introduction
Disclaimer : Vala is an ongoing project , and its features may change .
I will try to keep this tutorial as up to date as I can , but I 'm not perfect .
Also , I can't promise that the techniques which I suggest are necessarily the best in practice , but again I will try to keep up with that sort of thing .
What is Vala ?
Vala is a new programming language that allows modern programming techniques to be used to write applications that run on the GNOME runtime libraries , particularly GLib and GObject .
This platform has long provided a very complete programming environment , with such features as a dynamic type system and assisted memory management .
Before Vala , the only ways to program for the platform were with the machine native C API , which exposes a lot of often unwanted detail , with a high level language that has an attendant virtual machine , such as Python or the Mono C# language , or alternatively , with C++ through a wrapper library .
Vala is different from all these other techniques , as it outputs C code which can be compiled to run with no extra library support beyond the GNOME platform .
This has several consequences , but most importantly :
Programs written in Vala should have broadly similar performance to those written directly in C , whilst being easier and faster to write and maintain .
A Vala application can do nothing that a C equivalent cannot .
Whilst Vala introduces a lot of language features that are not available in C , these are all mapped to C constructs , although they are often ones that are difficult or too time consuming to write directly .
As such , whilst Vala is a modern language with all of the features you would expect , it gains its power from an existing platform , and must in some ways comply with the rules set down by it .
Who is this tutorial for ?
This tutorial will not go into depth about basic programming practices .
It will only briefly explain the principles of object - oriented programming , instead focusing on how Vala applies the concepts .
As such it will be helpful if you have experience of a variety of programming languages already , although in - depth knowledge of any particular one is not required .
Vala shares a lot of syntax with C# , but I will try to avoid describing features in terms of their similarity or differences with either C# or Java , with the aim of making the tutorial more accessible .
What will be useful is a reasonable understanding of C .
Whilst this is n't needed for understanding Vala per se , it is important to realise that Vala programs are executed as C , and will often interact with C libraries .
Knowledge of C will certainly make a deeper understanding of Vala far easier to come by .
Conventions
Code will be in monospaced text , commands will all be prefaced with a $ prompt .
Other than that , everything should be obvious .
I tend to code very explicitly , including some information that is actually implied .
I will try to explain where some things can be omitted , but that does n't mean that I encourage you do to this .
At some point I will add in references to the Vala documentation , but that is n't really possible yet .
A First Program
Sadly predictable , but still :
class Demo .
HelloWorld : GLib .
Object { public static int main ( string [ ] args ) { stdout .
printf ( " Hello , World
" ) ; return 0 ; } }
Of course , that is a Vala Hello World program .
I expect you can recognise some parts of it well enough , but just to be thorough I shall go through it step by step .
class Demo .
HelloWorld : GLib .
Object {
This line identifies the beginning of a class definition .
Classes in Vala are very similar in concept to other languages .
A class is basically a type of object , of which instances can be created , all having the same properties .
The implementation of classed types is taken care of by the gobject library , but details of this are not important for general usage .
What is important to note is that this class is specifically described as being a subclass of GLib .
Object .
This is because Vala allows other types of class , but in most cases , this is the sort that you want .
In fact , some language features of Vala are only allowed if your class is descended from GLib's Object .
Other parts of this line show namespacing and fully qualified names , although these will be explained later .
public static int main ( string [ ] args ) {
This is the start of a method definition .
A method is a function related to a type of object that can be executed on an object of that type .
The static method means that the method can be called without possessing a particular instance of the type .
The fact that this method is called main and has the signature it does means that Vala will recognise it as the entry point for the program .
The main method does n't have to be defined inside a class .
However , if it is defined inside a class it must be static .
It does n't matter if it 's public or private .
The return type may be either int or void .
With a void return type the program will implicitly terminate with exit code 0 .
The string array parameter holding the command line arguments is optional .
stdout .
printf ( " Hello , World
" ) ;
stdout is an object in the GLib namespace that Vala ensures you have access to whenever required .
This line instructs Vala to execute the method called printf of the stdout object , with the hello string as an argument .
In Vala , this is always the syntax you use to call a method on an object , or to access an object 's data .
is the escape sequence for a new line .
return 0 ;
return is to return a value to the caller and terminate the execution of the main method which also terminates the execution of the program .
The returned value of the main method is then taken as the exit code of the program .
The last lines simply end the definitions of the method and class .
Compile and Run
Assuming you have Vala installed , then all it takes to compile and execute this program is :
$ valac hello.vala $ ./hello
valac is the Vala compiler , which will compile your Vala code into a binary .
The resulting binary will have the same name as the source file and can then be directly executed on the machine .
You can probably guess the output .
Basics
Source Files and Compilation
Vala code is written in files with .vala extensions .
Vala does not enforce as much structure as a language like Java - there are no concepts of packages or class files in the same way .
Instead structure is defined by text inside each file , describing the logical location of the code with constructs such as namespaces .
When you want to compile Vala code , you give the compiler a list of the files required , and Vala will work out how they fit together .
The upshot of all this is that you can put as many classes or functions into a file as you want , even combining parts of different namespaces in together .
This is not necessarily a good idea .
There are certain conventions you probably want to follow .
A good example of how to structure a project in Vala is the Vala project itself .
All source files for the same package are supplied as command line parameters to the Vala compiler valac , along with compiler flags .
This works similarly to how Java source code is compiled .
For example :
$ valac compiler .
vala -- pkg libvala
will produce a binary with the name compiler that links with the package libvala .
In fact , this is how the valac compiler is produced !
If you want the binary to have a different name or if you have passed multiple source files to the compiler you can specify the binary name explicitly with the -o switch :
$ valac source1.vala source2.vala - o myprogram $ ./myprogram
If you give valac the - C switch , it wo n't compile your program into a binary file .
Instead it will output the intermediate C code for each of your Vala source files into a corresponding C source file , in this case source1.c and source2.c .
If you look at the content of these files you can see that programming a class in Vala is equivalent to the same task in C , but a whole lot more succinct .
You will also notice that this class is registered dynamically in the running system .
This is a good example of the power of the GNOME platform , but as I 've said before , you do not need to know much about this to use Vala .
If you want to have a C header file for your project you can use the - H switch :
$ valac hello.vala - C - H hello.h
Syntax Overview
Vala 's syntax is an amalgam heavily based on C#'s .
As a result , most of this will be familiar to programmers who know any C - like language , and in light of this I have kept things brief .
Scope is defined using braces .
An object or reference is only valid between { and } .
These are also the delimiters used to define classes , methods , code blocks etc , so they automatically have their own scope .
Vala is not strict about where variables are declared .
An identifier is defined by its type and a name , e.g. int c meaning an integer called c .
In the case of value types this also creates an object of the given type .
For reference types these just define a new reference that does n't initially point to anything .
Identifier names may be any combination of letters ( [ a - z ] , [ A - Z ] ) , underscores and digits .
However , to define or refer to an identifier with a name that either starts with a digit or is a keyword , you must prefix it with the ' @ ' character .
This character is not considered a part of the name .
For example , you can name a method foreach by writing @foreach , even though this is a reserved Vala keyword .
You can omit the ' @ ' character when it can be unambiguously interpreted as an identifier name , such as in " foo.foreach ( ) " .
Reference types are instantiated using the new operator and the name of a construction method , which is usually just the name of the type , e.g. Object o = new Object ( ) creates a new Object and makes o a reference to it .
Vala allows comments in code in different ways .
These are handled in the same way as in most other languages and so need little explanation .
Documentation comments are actually not special to Vala , but a documentation generation tool like Valadoc will recognise them .
Data Types
Broadly speaking there are two types of data in Vala : reference types and value types .
These names describe how instances of the types are passed around the system - a value type is copied whenever it is assigned to a new identifier , a reference type is not copied , instead the new identifier is simply a new reference to the same object .
A constant is defined by putting const before the type .
The naming convention for constants is ALL_UPPER_CASE .
Value Types
Vala supports a set of the simple types as most other languages do .
Byte , char , uchar ; their names are char for historical reasons .
Character , unichar ; a 32 - bit Unicode character
Integer , int , uint
Long Integer , long , ulong
Short Integer , short , ushort
Guaranteed - size Integer , int8 , int16 , int32 , int64 as well as their unsigned siblings uint8 , uint16 , uint32 , uint64 .
The numbers indicate the lengths in bits .
Float number , float , double
Boolean , bool ; possible values are true and false
Compound , struct
Enumeration , enum ; represented by integer values , not as classes like Java 's enums
Here are some examples .
unichar c = 'u ' ; float percentile = 0.75 f ; const double MU_BOHR = 927.400915E -26 ; bool the_box_has_crashed = false ; struct Vector { public double x ; public double y ; public double z ; } enum WindowType { TOPLEVEL , POPUP }
Most of these types may have different sizes on different platforms , except for the guaranteed - size integer types .
The sizeof operator returns the size that a variable of a given type occupies in bytes :
ulong nbytes = sizeof ( int32 ) ;
You can determine the minimum and maximum values of a numerical type with .MIN and .
MAX , e.g. int.MIN and int.MAX .
Strings
The data type for strings is string .
Vala strings are UTF - 8 encoded and immutable .
string text = " A string literal " ;
Vala offers a feature called verbatim strings .
These are strings in which escape sequences ( such as
) wo n't be interpreted , line breaks will be preserved and quotation marks do n't have to be masked .
They are enclosed with triple double quotation marks .
Possible indentations after a line break are part of the string as well .
string verbatim = " " " This is a so - called " verbatim string " .
Verbatim strings do n't process escape sequences , such as
, \t , \\ , etc .
They may contain quotes and may span multiple lines . " " " ;
Strings prefixed with ' @ ' are string templates .
They can evaluate embedded variables and expressions prefixed with '$ ' :
int a = 6 , b = 7 ; string s = @ " $ a * $ b = $ ( a * b ) " ;
The equality operators == and != compare the content of two strings , contrary to Java 's behaviour which in this case would check for referential equality .
You can slice a string with [ start : end ] .
Negative values represent positions relative to the end of the string :
string greeting = " hello , world " ; string s1 = greeting [ 7 : 12 ] ; string s2 = greeting [- 4 :- 2 ] ;
Note that indices in Vala start with 0 as in most other programming languages .
Starting with Vala 0.11 you can access a single byte of a string with [ index ] :
uint8 b = greeting [ 7 ] ;
However , you cannot assign a new byte value to this position , since Vala strings are immutable .
Many of the basic types have reasonable methods for parsing from and converting to strings , for example :
bool b = bool .
parse ( " false " ) ; int i = int .
parse ( " - 52 " ) ; double d = double .
parse ( " 6.67428E -11 " ) ; string s1 = true .
to_string ( ) ; string s2 = 21 . to_string ( ) ;
Two useful methods for writing and reading strings to / from the console ( and for your first explorations with Vala ) are stdout.printf ( ) and stdin.read_line ( ) :
stdout .
printf ( " Hello , world
" ) ; stdout .
printf ( " %d %g %s
" , 42 , 3.1415 , " Vala " ) ; string input = stdin .
read_line ( ) ; int number = int . parse ( stdin . read_line ( ) ) ;
You already know stdout. printf ( ) from the Hello World example .
Actually , it can take an arbitrary number of arguments of different types , whereas the first argument is a format string , following the same rules as C format strings .
If you must output an error message you can use stderr. printf ( ) instead of stdout.
printf ( ) .
In addition the in operation can be used to determine whether one string contains another , e.g .
if ( " ere " in " Able was I ere I saw Elba . " ) ...
For more information , please report to the complete overview of the string class .
A sample program demonstrating string usage is also available .
Arrays
An array is declared by giving a type name followed by [ ] and created by using the new operator e.g. int [ ] a = new int [ 10 ] to create an array of integers .
The length of such an array can be obtained by the length member variable e.g. int count = a.length .
Note that if you write Object [ ] a = new Object [ 10 ] no objects will be created , just the array to store them in .
int [ ] a = new int [ 10 ] ; int [ ] b = { 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 } ;
You can slice an array with [ start : end ] :
int [ ] c = b [ 1 : 3 ] ;
Slicing an array will result in a reference to the requested data , not a copy .
However , assigning the slice to an owned variable ( as is done above ) will result in a copy .
If you would like to avoid a copy , you must either assign the slice to an unowned array or pass it directly to an argument ( arguments are , by default , unowned ) :
unowned int [ ] c = b [ 1 : 3 ] ;
Multi-dimensional arrays are defined with [ , ] or [ , , ] etc .
int [ , ] c = new int [ 3 , 4 ] ; int [ , ] d = {{ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 } , { 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 } , { 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 }} ; d [ 2 , 3 ] = 42 ;
This sort of array is represented by a single contiguous memory block .
Jagged multi-dimensional arrays ( [ ] [ ] , also known as " stacked arrays " or " arrays of arrays " ) , where each row may have a different length , are not yet supported .
To find the length of each dimension in a multi- dimensional array , the length member becomes an array , storing the length of each respective dimension .
int [ , ] arr = new int [ 4 , 5 ] ; int r = arr .
length [ 0 ] ; int c = arr . length [ 1 ] ;
Please note that you can't get a mono - dimensional array from a multidimensional array , or even slice a multidimensional array :
int [ , ] arr = {{ 1 , 2 } , { 3 , 4 }} ; int [ ] b = arr [ 0 ] ; int [ ] c = arr [ 0 , ] ; int [ ] d = arr [ : , 0 ] ; int [ ] e = arr [ 0 : 1 , 0 ] ; int [ , ] f = arr [ 0 : 1 , 0 : 1 ] ;
You can append array elements dynamically with the += operator .
However , this works only for locally defined or private arrays .
The array is automatically reallocated if needed .
Internally this reallocation happens with sizes growing in powers of 2 for run -time efficiency reasons .
However , .length holds the actual number of elements , not the internal size .
int [ ] e = {} ; e += 12 ; e += 5 ; e += 37 ;
You can resize an array by calling resize ( ) on it .
It will keep the original content ( as much as fits ) .
int [ ] a = new int [ 5 ] ; a . resize ( 12 ) ;
You can move elements within an array by calling move ( src , dest , length ) on it .
The original positions will be filled with 0 .
uint8 [ ] chars = " hello world " . data ; chars .
move ( 6 , 0 , 5 ) ; print ( ( string ) chars ) ;
If you put the square brackets after the identifier together with an indication of size you will get a fixed - size array .
Fixed - size arrays are allocated on the stack ( if used as local variables ) or in - line allocated ( if used as fields ) and you can't reallocate them later .
int f [ 10 ] ;
Vala does not do any bounds checking for array access at runtime .
If you need more safety you should use a more sophisticated data structure like an ArrayList .
You will learn more about that later in the section about collections .
Reference Types
The reference types are all types declared as a class , regardless of whether they are descended from GLib 's Object or not .
Vala will ensure that when you pass an object by reference the system will keep track of the number of references currently alive in order to manage the memory for you .
The value of a reference that does not point anywhere is null .
More on classes and their features in the section about object oriented programming .
class Track : GLib .
Object { public double mass ; public double name { get ; set ; } private bool terminated = false ; public void terminate ( ) { terminated = true ; } }
Static Type Casting
In Vala , you can cast a variable from one type to another .
For a static type cast , a variable is casted by the desired type name with parenthesis .
A static cast does n't impose any runtime type safety checking .
It works for all Vala types .
For example ,
int i = 10 ; float j = ( float ) i ;
Vala supports another casting mechanism called dynamic cast which performs runtime type checking and is described in the section about object oriented programming .
Type Inference
Vala has a mechanism called type inference , whereby a local variable may be defined using var instead of giving a type , so long as it is unambiguous what type is meant .
The type is inferred from the right hand side of the assignment .
It helps reduce unnecessary redundancy in your code without sacrificing static typing :
var p = new Person ( ) ; var s = " hello " ; var l = new List < int >( ) ; var i = 10 ;
This only works for local variables .
Type inference is especially useful for types with generic type arguments ( more on these later ) .
Compare
MyFoo < string , MyBar < string , int >> foo = new MyFoo < string , MyBar < string , int >>( ) ;
vs .
var foo = new MyFoo < string , MyBar < string , int >>( ) ;
Defining new Type from other
Defining a new type is a matter of derive it from the one you need .
Here is an example :
public class ValueList : GLib .
List < GLib .
Value > { [ CCode ( has_construct_function = false ) ] protected ValueList ( ) ; public static GLib .
Type get_type ( ) ; }
Operators
=
assignment .
The left operand must be an identifier , and the right must result in a value or reference as appropriate .
+ , - , / , * , %
basic arithmetic , applied to left and right operands .
The + operator can also concatenate strings .
+= , -= , /= , *= , %=
arithmetic operation between left and right operands , where the left must be an identifier , to which the result is assigned .
++ , --
increment and decrement operations with implicit assignment .
These take just one argument , which must be an identifier of a simple data type .
The value will be changed and assigned back to the identifier .
These operators may be placed in either prefix or postfix positions - with the former the evaluated value of the statement will be the newly calculated value , with the latter the original value is returned .
| , ^ , & , ~ , |= , &= , ^=
bitwise operations : or , exclusive or , and , not .
The second set include assignment and are analogous to the arithmetic versions .
These can be applied to any of the simple value types .
( There is of no assignment operator associated with ~ because this is a unary operator .
The equivalent operation is just a = ~a ) .
<< , >>
bit shift operations , shifting the left operand a number of bits according the right operand .
<<= , >>=
bit shift operations , shifting the left operand a number of bits according the right operand .
The left operand must be an identifier , to which the result is assigned .
==
equality test .
Evaluates to a bool value dependent on whether the left and right operands are equal .
In the case of value types this means their values are equal , in the case of reference types that the objects are the same instance .
An exception to this rule is the string type , which is tested for equality by value .
< , > , >= , <= , !=
inequality tests .
Evaluate to a bool value dependent on whether the left and right operands are different in the manner described .
These are valid for simple value data types , and the string type .
For strings these operators compare the lexicographical order .
! , && , ||
logic operations : not , and , or .
These operations can be applied to Boolean values - the first taking just one value the others two .
? :
ternary conditional operator .
Evaluates a condition and returns either the value of the left or the right sub-expression based on whether the condition is true or false : condition ?
value if true : value if false
??
null coalescing operator : a ?? b is equivalent to a != null ?
a : b .
This operator is useful for example to provide a default value in case a reference is null :
stdout .
printf ( " Hello , %s !
" , name ?? " unknown person " ) ;
in
checks if the right operand contains the left operand .
This operator works on arrays , strings , collections or any other type that has an appropriate contains ( ) method .
For strings it performs a substring search .
Operators cannot be overloaded in Vala .
There are extra operators that are valid in the context of lambda declarations and other specific tasks - these are explained in the context they are applicable .
Control Structures
while ( a > b ) { a --; }
will decrement a repeatedly , checking before each iteration that a is greater than b .
do { a --; } while ( a > b ) ;
will decrement a repeatedly , checking after each iteration that a is greater than b .
for ( int a = 0 ; a < 10 ; a ++ ) { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; }
will initialize a to 0 , then print a repeatedly until a is no longer less than 10 , incrementing a after each iteration .
foreach ( int a in int_array ) { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; }
will print out each integer in an array , or another iterable collection .
The meaning of " iterable " will be described later .
All of the four preceding types of loop may be controlled with the keywords break and continue .
A break instruction will cause the loop to immediately terminate , while continue will jump straight to the test part of the iteration .
if ( a > 0 ) { stdout .
printf ( " a is greater than 0
" ) ; } else if ( a < 0 ) { stdout .
printf ( " a is less than 0
" ) ; } else { stdout .
printf ( " a is equal to 0
" ) ; }
executes a particular piece of code based on a set of conditions .
The first condition to match decides which code will execute , if a is greater than 0 it will not be tested whether it is less than 0 .
Any number of else if blocks is allowed , and zero or one else blocks .
switch ( a ) { case 1 : stdout .
printf ( " one
" ) ; break ; case 2 : case 3 : stdout .
printf ( " two or three
" ) ; break ; default : stdout .
printf ( " unknown
" ) ; break ; }
A switch statement runs exactly one or zero sections of code based on the value passed to it .
In Vala there is no fall through between cases , except for empty cases .
In order to ensure this , each non-empty case must end with a break , return or throw statement .
It is possible to use switch statements with strings .
A note for C programmers : conditions must always evaluate to a Boolean value .
This means that if you want to check a variable for null or 0 you must do this explicitly : if ( object != null ) { } or if ( number != 0 ) { } .
Language Elements
Methods
Functions are called methods in Vala , regardless of whether they are defined inside a class or not .
From now on we will stick to the term method .
int method_name ( int arg1 , Object arg2 ) { return 1 ; }
This code defines a method , having the name method_name , taking two arguments , one an integer and the other an Object ( the first passed by value , the second as a reference as described ) .
The method will return an integer , which in this case is 1 .
All Vala methods are C functions , and therefore take an arbitrary number of arguments and return one value ( or none if the method is declared void ) .
They may approximate more return values by placing data in locations known to the calling code .
Details of how to do this are in the " Parameter Directions " section in the advanced part of this tutorial .
The naming convention for methods in Vala is all_lower_case with underscores as word separators .
This may be a little bit unfamiliar to C# or Java programmers who are accustomed to CamelCase or mixedCamelCase method names .
But with this style you will be consistent with other Vala and C / GObject libraries .
It is not possible to have multiple methods with the same name but different signature within the same scope ( " method overloading " ) :
void draw ( string text ) { } void draw ( Shape shape ) { }
This is due to the fact that libraries produced with Vala are intended to be usable for C programmers as well .
In Vala you would do something like this instead :
void draw_text ( string text ) { } void draw_shape ( Shape shape ) { }
By choosing slightly different names you can avoid a name clash .
In languages that support method overloading it is often used for providing convenience methods with less parameters that chain up to the most general method :
void f ( int x , string s , double z ) { } void f ( int x , string s ) { f ( x , s , 0.5 ) ; } void f ( int x ) { f ( x , " hello " ) ; }
In this case you can use Vala 's default argument feature for method parameters in order to achieve a similar behaviour with just one method .
You can define default values for the last parameters of a method , so that you do n't have to pass them explicitly to a method call :
void f ( int x , string s = " hello " , double z = 0.5 ) { }
Some possible calls of this method might be :
f ( 2 ) ; f ( 2 , " hi " ) ; f ( 2 , " hi " , 0.75 ) ;
It 's even possible to define methods with real variable - length argument lists ( varargs ) like stdout.
printf ( ) , although not necessarily recommended .
You will learn how to do that later .
Vala performs a basic nullability check on the method parameters and return values .
If it is allowable for a method parameter or a return value to be null , the type symbol should be postfixed with a ?
modifier .
This extra information helps the Vala compiler to perform static checks and to add runtime assertions on the preconditions of the methods , which may help in avoiding related errors such as dereferencing a null reference .
string ?
method_name ( string ?
text , Foo ? foo , Bar bar ) { }
In this example text , foo and the return value may be null , however , bar must not be null .
Delegates
delegate void DelegateType ( int a ) ;
Delegates represent methods , allowing chunks of code to be passed around like objects .
The example above defines a new type named DelegateType which represents methods taking an int and not returning a value .
Any method that matches this signature may be assigned to a variable of this type or passed as a method argument of this type .
delegate void DelegateType ( int a ) ; void f1 ( int a ) { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; } void f2 ( DelegateType d , int a ) { d ( a ) ; } void main ( ) { f2 ( f1 , 5 ) ; }
This code will execute the method f2 , passing in a reference to method f1 and the number 5 . f2 will then execute the method f1 , passing it the number .
Delegates may also be created locally .
A member method can also be assigned to a delegate , e.g ,
class
Foo { public void f1 ( int a ) { stdout .
printf ( " a = %d
" , a ) ; } delegate void DelegateType ( int a ) ; public static int main ( string [ ] args ) { Foo foo = new Foo ( ) ; DelegateType d1 = foo .
f1 ; d1 ( 10 ) ; return 0 ; } }
Anonymous Methods / Closures
( a ) => { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; }
An anonymous method , also known as lambda expression , function literal or closure , can be defined in Vala with the => operator .
The parameter list is on the left hand side of the operator , the method body on the right hand side .
An anonymous method standing by itself like the one above does not make much sense .
It is only useful if you assign it directly to a variable of a delegate type or pass it as a method argument to another method .
Notice that neither parameter nor return types are explicitly given .
Instead the types are inferred from the signature of the delegate it is used with .
Assigning an anonymous method to a delegate variable :
delegate void PrintIntFunc ( int a ) ; void main ( ) { PrintIntFunc p1 = ( a ) => { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; } ; p1 ( 10 ) ; PrintIntFunc p2 = ( a ) => stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; p2 ( 20 ) ; }
Passing an anonymous method to another method :
delegate int Comparator ( int a , int b ) ; void my_sorting_algorithm ( int [ ] data , Comparator compare ) { } void main ( ) { int [ ] data = { 3 , 9 , 2 , 7 , 5 } ; my_sorting_algorithm ( data , ( a , b ) => { if ( a < b ) return - 1 ; if ( a > b ) return 1 ; return 0 ; } ) ; }
Anonymous methods are real closures .
This means you can access the local variables of the outer method within the lambda expression :
delegate int IntOperation ( int i ) ; IntOperation curried_add ( int a ) { return ( b ) => a + b ; } void main ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " 2 + 4 = %d
" , curried_add ( 2 ) ( 4 ) ) ; }
In this example curried_add ( see Currying ) returns a newly created method that preserves the value of a .
This returned method is directly called afterwards with 4 as argument resulting in the sum of the two numbers .
Namespaces
namespace NameSpaceName { }
Everything between the braces in this statement is in the namespace NameSpaceName and must be referenced as such .
Any code outside this namespace must either use qualified names for anything within the name of the namespace , or be in a file with an appropriate using declaration in order to import this namespace :
using NameSpaceName ;
For example , if the namespace Gtk is imported with using Gtk ; you can simply write Window instead of Gtk .
Window .
A fully qualified name would only be necessary in case of ambiguity , for example between GLib .
Object and Gtk. Object .
The namespace GLib is imported by default .
Imagine an invisible using GLib ; line at the beginning of every Vala file .
Everything that you do n't put into a separate namespace will land in the anonymous global namespace .
If you have to reference the global namespace explicitly due to ambiguity you can do that with the global : : prefix .
Namespaces can be nested , either by nesting one declaration inside another , or by giving a name of the form NameSpace1.NameSpace2 .
Several other types of definition can declare themselves to be inside a namespace by following the same naming convention , e.g. class NameSpace1.
Test { ... } .
Note that when doing this , the final namespace of the definition will be the one the declaration is nested in plus the namespaces declared in the definition .
Structs
struct StructName { public int a ; }
defines a struct type , i.e. a compound value type .
A Vala struct may have methods in a limited way and also may have private members , meaning the explicit public access modifier is required .
struct Color { public double red ; public double green ; public double blue ; }
This is how you can initialise a struct :
Color c1 = Color ( ) ; Color c2 = { 0.5 , 0.5 , 1.0 } ; Color c3 = Color ( ) { red = 0.5 , green = 0.5 , blue = 1.0 } ; var c4 = Color ( ) ; var c5 = Color ( ) { red = 0.5 , green = 0.5 , blue = 1.0 } ;
Structs are stack / inline allocated and copied on assignment .
To define an array of structs , please see the FAQ .
Classes
class ClassName : SuperClassName , InterfaceName { }
defines a class , i.e. a reference type .
In contrast to structs , instances of classes are heap allocated .
There is much more syntax related to classes , which is discussed more fully in the section about object oriented programming .
Interfaces
interface InterfaceName : SuperInterfaceName { }
defines an interface , i.e. a non instantiable type .
In order to create an instance of an interface you must first implement its abstract methods in a non-abstract class .
Vala interfaces are more powerful than Java or C# interfaces .
In fact , they can be used as mixins .
The details of interfaces are described in the section about object oriented programming .
Code Attributes
Code attributes instruct the Vala compiler details about how the code is supposed to work on the target platform .
Their syntax is [ AttributeName ] or [ AttributeName ( param1 = value1 , param2 = value2 , ... ) ] .
They are mostly used for bindings in vapi files , [ CCode ( ... ) ] being the most prominent attribute here .
Another example is the [ DBus ( ... ) ] attribute for exporting remote interfaces via D - Bus .
Object Oriented Programming
Although Vala does n't force you to work with objects , some features are not available any other way .
As such , you will certainly want to program in an object - oriented style most of the time .
As with most current languages , in order to define your own object types , you write a class definition .
A class definition states what data each object of its type has , what other object types it can hold references to , and what methods can be executed on it .
The definition can include a name of another class which the new one should be a subclass of .
An instance of a class is also an instance of all it's class 's super classes , as it inherits from them all their methods and data , although it may not be able to access all of this itself .
A class may also implement any number of interfaces , which are sets of method definitions that must be implemented by the class - an instance of a class is also an instance of each interface implemented by its class or super classes .
Classes in Vala may also have " static " members .
This modifier allows either data or methods to be defined as belonging to the class as a whole , rather than to a specific instance of it .
Such members can be accessed without possessing an instance of the class .
Basics
A simple class may be defined as follows :
public class TestClass : GLib .
Object { public int first_data = 0 ; private int second_data ; public TestClass ( ) { this .
second_data = 5 ; } public int method_1 ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " private data : %d " , this . second_data ) ; return this .
second_data ; } }
This code will define a new type ( which is registered automatically with the gobject library 's type system ) that contains three members .
There are two data members , the integers defined at the top , and one method called method_1 , which returns an integer .
The class declaration states that this class is a subclass of GLib .
Object , and therefore instances of it are also Objects , and contain all the members of that type also .
The fact that this class is descended from Object also means that there are special features of Vala that can be used to easily access some of Object 's features .
This class is described as public ( by default , classes are internal ) .
The implication of this is that it can referenced directly by code outside of this file - if you are a C programmer of glib / gobject , you will recognise this as being equivalent to defining the class interfaces in a header file that other code can include .
The members are also all described as either public or private .
The member first_data is public , so it is visible directly to any user of the class , and can be modified without the containing instance being aware of it .
The second data member is private , and so can only be referenced by code belonging to this class .
Vala supports four different access modifiers :
public
No restrictions to access private Access is limited to within the class / struct definition .
This is the default if no access modifier is specified protected Access is limited to within the class definition and any class that inherits from the class internal Access is limited exclusively to classes defined within the same package
The constructor initialises new instances of a class .
It has the same name as the class , may take zero or more arguments and is defined without return type .
The final part of this class is a method definition .
This method is to be called method_1 , and it will return an integer .
As this method is not static , it can only be executed on an instance of this class , and may therefore access members of that instance .
It can do this through the this reference , which always points to the instance the method is being called on .
Unless there is an ambiguity , the this identifier can be omitted if wished .
You can use this new class as follows :
TestClass t = new TestClass ( ) ; t . first_data = 5 ; t . method_1 ( ) ;
Construction
Vala supports two slightly different construction schemes : the Java / C# - style construction scheme which we will focus on for now , and the GObject - style construction scheme which will be described in a section at the end of the chapter .
Vala does not support constructor overloading for the same reasons that method overloading is not allowed , which means a class may not have multiple constructors with the same name .
However , this is no problem because Vala supports named constructors .
If you want to offer multiple constructors you may give them different name additions :
public class Button : Object { public Button ( ) { } public Button .
with_label ( string label ) { } public Button .
from_stock ( string stock_id ) { } }
Instantiation is analogous :
new Button ( ) ; new Button .
with_label ( " Click me " ) ; new Button .
from_stock ( Gtk .
STOCK_OK ) ;
You may chain constructors via this ( ) or this .
name_extension ( ) :
public class Point : Object { public double x ; public double y ; public Point ( double x , double y ) { this .
x = x ; this .
y = y ; } public Point .
rectangular ( double x , double y ) { this ( x , y ) ; } public Point .
polar ( double radius , double angle ) { this .
rectangular ( radius * Math .
cos ( angle ) , radius * Math . sin ( angle ) ) ; } } void main ( ) { var p1 = new Point .
rectangular ( 5.7 , 1.2 ) ; var p2 = new Point .
polar ( 5.7 , 1.2 ) ; }
Destruction
Although Vala manages the memory for you , you might need to add your own destructor if you choose to do manual memory management with pointers ( more on that later ) or if you have to release other resources .
The syntax is the same as in C# and C ++:
class Demo : Object { ~ Demo ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " in destructor " ) ; } }
Since Vala 's memory management is based on reference counting instead of tracing garbage collection , destructors are deterministic and can be used to implement the RAII pattern for resource management ( closing streams , database connections , ... ) .
Signals
Signals are a system provided by the Object class in GLib , and made easily accessible by Vala to all descendants of Object .
A signal is recognisable to C# programmers as an event , or to Java programmers as an alternative way of implementing event listeners .
In short , a signal is simply a way of executing an arbitrary number of externally identical methods ( i.e. ones with the same signature ) at approximately the same time .
The actual methods of execution are internal to gobject , and not important to Vala programs .
A signal is defined as a member of a class , and appears similar to a method with no body .
Signal handlers can then be added to the signal using the connect ( ) method .
In order to dive right in at the deep end , the following example also introduces lambda expressions , a very useful way to write signal handling code in Vala :
public class Test : GLib .
Object { public signal void sig_1 ( int a ) ; public static int main ( string [ ] args ) { Test t1 = new Test ( ) ; t1 . sig_1 .
connect ( ( t , a ) => { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , a ) ; } ) ; t1 . sig_1 ( 5 ) ; return 0 ; } }
This code introduces a new class called " Test " , using familiar syntax .
The first member of this class is a signal , called " sig_1 " , which is defined as passing an integer .
In the main method of this program , we first create a Test instance - a requirement since signals always belong to instances of classes .
Next , we assign to our instance 's " sig_1 " signal a handler , which we define inline as a lambda expression .
The definition states that the method will receive two arguments which we call " t " and " a " , but do not provide types for .
We can be this terse because Vala already knows the definition of the signal and can therefore understand what types are required .
The reason there are two parameters to the handler is that whenever a signal is emitted , the object on which it is emitted is passed as the first argument to the handler .
The second argument is that one that the signal says it will provide .
Finally , we get impatient and decide to emit a signal .
We do this by calling the signal as though it was a method of our class , and allow gobject to take care of forwarding the message to all attached handlers .
Understanding the mechanism used for this is not required to use signals from Vala .
NB : Currently the public access modifier is the only possible option - all signals can be both connected to and emitted by any piece of code .
Note : Since April 2010 signals can be annotated with any combination of flags :
[ Signal ( action = true , detailed = true , run = true , no_recurse = true , no_hooks = true ) ] public signal void sig_1 ( ) ;
Properties
It is good object oriented programming practice to hide implementation details from the users of your classes ( information hiding principle ) , so you can later change the internals without breaking the public API .
One practice is to make fields private and provide accessor methods for getting and setting their values ( getters and setters ) .
If you 're a Java programmer you will probably think of something like this :
class Person : Object { private int age = 32 ; public int get_age ( ) { return this .
age ; } public void set_age ( int age ) { this .
age = age ; } }
This works , but Vala can do better .
The problem is that these methods are cumbersome to work with .
Let 's suppose that you want to increase the age of a person by one year :
var alice = new Person ( ) ; alice .
set_age ( alice .
get_age ( ) + 1 ) ;
This is where properties come into play :
class Person : Object { private int _age = 32 ; public int age { get { return _age ; } set { _age = value ; } } }
This syntax should be familiar to C# programmers .
A property has a get and a set block for getting and setting its value .
value is a keyword that represents the new value that should be assigned to the property .
Now you can access the property as if it was a public field .
But behind the scenes the code in the get and set blocks is executed .
var alice = new Person ( ) ; alice .
age = alice .
age + 1 ; alice .
age ++;
If you only do the standard implementation as shown above then you can write the property even shorter :
class Person : Object { public int age { get ; set ; default = 32 ; } }
With properties you can change the internal working of classes without changing the public API .
For example :
static int current_year = 2525 ; class Person : Object { private int year_of_birth = 2493 ; public int age { get { return current_year - year_of_birth ; } set { year_of_birth = current_year - value ; } } }
This time the age is calculated on the fly from the year of birth .
Note that you can do more than just simple variable access or assignment within the get and set blocks .
You could do a database access , logging , cache updates , etc .
If you want to make a property read - only for the users of the class you should make the setter private :
public int age { get ; private set ; default = 32 ; }
Or , alternatively , you can leave out the set block :
class Person : Object { private int _age = 32 ; public int age { get { return _age ; } } }
Properties may not only have a name but also a short description ( called nick ) and a long description ( called blurb ) .
You can annotate these with a special attribute :
[ Description ( nick = " age in years " , blurb = " This is the person 's age in years " ) ] public int age { get ; set ; default = 32 ; }
Properties and their additional descriptions can be queried at runtime .
Some programs such as the Glade graphical user interface designer make use of this information .
In this way Glade can present human readable descriptions for properties of GTK + widgets .
Every instance of a class derived from GLib .
Object has a signal called notify .
This signal gets emitted every time a property of its object changes .
So you can connect to this signal if you 're interested in change notifications in general :
obj . notify .
connect ( ( s , p ) => { stdout .
printf ( " Property ' %s ' has changed !
" , p . name ) ; } ) ;
s is the source of the signal ( obj in this example ) , p is the property information of type ParamSpec for the changed property .
If you 're only interested in change notifications of a single property you can use this syntax :
alice . notify [ " age " ]. connect ( ( s , p ) => { stdout .
printf ( " age has changed
" ) ; } ) ;
Note that in this case you must use the string representation of the property name where underscores are replaced by dashes : my_property_name becomes " my- property - name " in this representation , which is the GObject property naming convention .
Change notifications can be disabled with a CCode attribute tag immediately before the declaration of the property :
public class MyObject : Object { [ CCode ( notify = false ) ] public int without_notification { get ; set ; } public int with_notification { get ; set ; } }
There 's another type of properties called construct properties that are described later in the section about gobject - style construction .
Note : in case your property is type of struct , to get the property value with Object. get ( ) , you have to declare your variable as example below
struct Color { public uint32 argb ; public Color ( ) { argb = 0x12345678 ; } } class Shape : GLib .
Object { public Color c { get ; set ; default = Color ( ) ; } } int main () { Color ?
c = null ; Shape s = new Shape ( ) ; s . get ( " c " , out c ) ; }
This way , c is an reference instead of an instance of Color on stack .
What you passed into s.get ( ) is " Color ** " instead of " Color * " .
Inheritance
In Vala , a class may derive from one or zero other classes .
In practice this is always likely to be one , although there is no implicit inheritance as there is in languages like Java .
When defining a class that inherits from another , you create a relationship between the classes where instances of the subclass are also instances of the superclass .
This means that operations on instances of the superclass are also applicable on instances of the subclass .
As such , wherever an instance of the superclass is required , an instance of the subclass can be substituted .
When writing the definition of a class it is possible to exercise precise control over who can access what methods and data in the object .
The following example demonstrates a range of these options :
class SuperClass : GLib .
Object { private int data ; public SuperClass ( int data ) { this .
data = data ; } protected void protected_method ( ) { } public static void public_static_method ( ) { } } class SubClass : SuperClass { public SubClass ( ) { base ( 10 ) ; } }
data is an instance data member of SuperClass .
There will be a member of this type in every instance of SuperClass , and it is declared private so will only be accessible by code that is a part of SuperClass .
protected_method is an instance method of SuperClass .
You will be able to execute this method only an instance of SuperClass or of one of its subclasses , and only from code that belongs to SuperClass or one of its subclasses - this latter rule being the result of the protected modifier .
public_static_method has two modifiers .
The static modifier means that this method may be called without owning an instance of SuperClass or of one of its subclasses .
As a result , this method will not have access to a this reference when it is executed .
The public modifier means that this method can be called from any code , no matter its relationship with SuperClass or its subclasses .
Given these definitions , an instance of SubClass will contain all three members of SuperClass , but will only be able to access the non-private members .
External code will only be able to access the public method .
With base a constructor of a subclass can chain up to a constructor of its base class .
Abstract Classes
There is another modifier for methods , called abstract .
This modifier allows you to describe a method that is not actually implemented in the class .
Instead , it must be implemented by subclasses before it can be called .
This allows you to define operations that can be called on all instances of a type , whilst ensuring that all more specific types provide their own version of the functionality .
A class containing abstract methods must be declared abstract as well .
The result of this is to prevent any instantiation of the type .
public abstract class Animal : Object { public void eat ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " * chomp chomp *
" ) ; } public abstract void say_hello ( ) ; } public class Tiger : Animal { public override void say_hello ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " * roar *
" ) ; } } public class Duck : Animal { public override void say_hello ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " * quack *
" ) ; } }
The implementation of an abstract method must be marked with override .
Properties may be abstract as well .
Virtual Methods
A virtual method allows to define default implementations to abstract classes and allows to derived classes to override its behavior , this is different than hiding methods .
public abstract class Caller : GLib .
Object { public abstract string name { get ; protected set ; } public abstract void update ( string new_name ) ; public virtual bool reset ( ) { name = " No Name " ; return true ; } } public class ContactCV : Caller { public override string name { get ; protected set ; } public override void update ( string new_name ) { name = " ContactCV - " + new_name ; } public override bool reset ( ) { name = " ContactCV - Name " ; stdout .
printf ( " CotactCV.reset ( ) implementation !
" ) ; return true ; } } public class Contact : Caller { public override string name { get ; protected set ; } public override void update ( string new_name ) { name = " Contact - " + new_name ; } public static void main ( ) { var c = new Contact ( ) ; c . update ( " John Strauss " ) ; stdout .
printf ( @ " Name : $ ( c.name )
" ) ; c . reset ( ) ; stdout .
printf ( @ " Reset Name : $ ( c.name )
" ) ; var cv = new ContactCV ( ) ; cv . update ( " Xochitl Calva " ) ; stdout .
printf ( @ " Name : $ ( cv.name )
" ) ; cv . reset ( ) ; stdout .
printf ( @ " Reset Name : $ ( cv.name )
" ) ; stdout .
printf ( " END
" ) ; } }
As you can see in the above example , Caller is an abstract class defining both an abstract property and a method , but adds a virtual method which can be overridden by derived classes .
Contact class implements abstract methods and properties of Caller , while using the default implementation for reset ( ) by avoiding to define a new one .
ContactCV class implements all abstract definitions on Caller , but overrides reset ( ) so as to define its own implementation .
Interfaces
A class in Vala may implement any number of interfaces .
Each interface is a type , much like a class , but one that can not be instantiated .
By " implementing " one or more interfaces , a class may declare that its instances are also instances of the interface , and therefore may be used in any situation where an instance of that interface is expected .
The procedure for implementing an interface is the same as for inheriting from classes with abstract methods in - if the class is to be useful it must provide implementations for all methods that are described but not yet implemented .
A simple interface definition looks like :
public interface ITest : GLib .
Object { public abstract int data_1 { get ; set ; } public abstract void method_1 ( ) ; }
This code describes an interface " I Test " which requires GLib .
Object as parent of the implementor class and contains two members .
" data_1 " is a property , as described above , except that it is declared abstract .
Vala will therefore not implement this property , but instead require that classes implementing this interface have a property called " data_1 " that has both get and set accessors - it is required that this be abstract as an interface may not have any data members .
The second member " method_1 " is a method .
Here it is declared that this method must be implemented by classes that implement this interface .
The simplest possible full implementation of this interface is :
public class Test1 : GLib .
Object , ITest { public int data_1 { get ; set ; } public void method_1 ( ) { } }
And may be used as follows :
var t = new Test1 ( ) ; t . method_1 ( ) ; ITest i = t ; i . method_1 ( ) ;
Defining Prerequisites
Interfaces in Vala may not inherit from other interfaces , but they may declare other interfaces to be prerequisites , which works in roughly the same way .
For example , it may be desirable to say that any class that implements a List interface must also implement a Collection and Traversable interfaces .
The syntax for this is exactly the same as for describing interface implementation in classes :
public interface List : Collection , Traversable { }
This definition of " List " may not be implemented in a class without " Collection " also being implemented , and so Vala enforces the following style of declaration for a class wishing to implement " List " , where all implemented interfaces must be described :
public class ListClass : GLib .
Object , Collection , List { }
Vala interfaces may also have a class as a prerequisite .
If a class name is given in the list of prerequisites , the interface may only be implemented in classes that derive from that prerequisite class .
This is often used to ensure that an instance of an interface is also a GLib .
Object subclass , and so the interface can be used , for example , as the type of a property .
The fact that interfaces can not inherit from other interfaces is mostly only a technical distinction - in practice Vala 's system works the same as other languages in this area , but with the extra feature of prerequisite classes .
Defining default implementation in methods
There 's another important difference between Vala interfaces and Java / C# interfaces : Vala interfaces may have non-abstract methods .
Vala actually allows method implementations in interfaces , then a method with a default implementation must be declared as virtual .
Due to this fact Vala interfaces can act as mixins .
This is a restricted form of multiple inheritance .
public interface Callable : GLib .
Object { public abstract bool answering { get ; protected set ; } public abstract void answer ( ) ; public virtual bool hang ( ) { answering = false ; return true ; } }
Interface Callable defines an abstract property called answering , where any class implementing this interface can monitor the state of a call , details about answer a call is a mautter of the implementator , but hang defines a default implementation to set answering to false when hanging a call .
public class Phone : GLib .
Object , Callable { public bool answering { get ; protected set ; } public void answer ( ) { } public static void main ( ) { var f = new Phone ( ) ; if ( f . hang ( ) ) stdout .
printf ( " Hand done .
" ) ; else stdout .
printf ( " Hand Error !
" ) ; stdout .
printf ( " END
" ) ; } }
When compiling and running , you will find that Phone class actually no implements Callable .hang ( ) method , but it is able to use it , then the result is a message Hang done .
public class TechPhone : GLib .
Object , Callable { public bool answering { get ; protected set ; } public void answer ( ) { } public bool hang ( ) { answering = false ; stdout .
printf ( " TechPhone.hang ( ) implementation ! " ) ; return false ; } }
In this case TechPhone is another implementation to Callable , then when hang ( ) method is called on an instance of TechPhone it will always return false and print the message TechPhone.hang ( ) implementation ! , hidding completelly Callable.hang ( ) default implementation .
Properties
An interface can define properties that must be implemented for classes .
Implementator class must define a property with the same signature and access permissions to the property 's get and set .
As any GObject property , you can define a body to property 's set and get in the implementator class , when no body is used values are set and get by default .
If given , you must define a private field to store the properties values to be used outside or inside the class .
Callable interface definition , defines an answering property .
In this case this interface defines a answering with a protected set , allowing a read only property for any object using an instance of Callable , but allows class implementors to write values to it , like Tech Phone class does when implements hang ( ) method .
Mixins and Multiple Inheritance
As described above , Vala while it is backed by C and GObject , can provide a limited multiple inheritance mechanism , by adding virtual methods to Interfaces .
Is possible to add some ways to define default method implementations in interface implementor class and allow derived classes to override that methods .
If you define a virtual method in an interface and implement it in a class , you can't override interface 's method without leaving derived classes unable to access to interface default one .
Consider following code :
public interface Callable : GLib .
Object { public abstract bool answering { get ; protected set ; } public abstract void answer ( ) ; public abstract bool hang ( ) ; public static bool default_hang ( Callable call ) { stdout .
printf ( " At Callable.hang ( )
" ) ; call .
answering = false ; return true ; } } public abstract class Caller : GLib .
Object , Callable { public bool answering { get ; protected set ; } public void answer ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " At Caller.answer ( )
" ) ; answering = true ; hang ( ) ; } public virtual bool hang ( ) { return Callable .
default_hang ( this ) ; } } public class TechPhone : Caller { public string number { get ; set ; } } public class Phone : Caller { public override bool hang ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " At Phone.hang ( )
" ) ; return false ; } public static void main ( ) { var f = ( Callable ) new Phone ( ) ; f . answer ( ) ; if ( f . hang ( ) ) stdout .
printf ( " Hand done .
" ) ; else stdout .
printf ( " Hand Error !
" ) ; var t = ( Callable ) new TechPhone ( ) ; t . answer ( ) ; if ( t . hang ( ) ) stdout .
printf ( " Tech Hand done .
" ) ; else stdout .
printf ( " Tech Hand Error !
" ) ; stdout .
printf ( " END
" ) ; } }
In this case , we have defined a Callable interface with a default implementation for abstract bool hang ( ) called default_hang , it could be a static or virtual method .
Then Caller is a base class implementing Callable for the TechPhone and Phone classes , while Caller 's hang ( ) method simple call Callable default implementation .
Tech Phone does n't do anything and just takes Caller as base class , using the default method implementations ; but Phone overrides Caller.hang ( ) and this makes to use its own implementation , allowing to always call it even if it is cast to Callable object .
Explicit method implementation
The explicit interface method implementation allows to implement two interfaces that have methods ( not properties ) with the same name .
Example :
interface Foo { public abstract int m ( ) ; } interface Bar { public abstract string m ( ) ; } class Cls : Foo , Bar { public int Foo . m () { return 10 ; } public string Bar . m ( ) { return " bar " ; } } void main ( ) { var cls = new Cls ( ) ; message ( " %d %s " , (( Foo ) cls ) . m ( ) , (( Bar ) cls ) . m ( ) ) ; }
Will output 10 bar .
Polymorphism
Polymorphism describes the way in which the same object can be used as though it were more than one distinct type of thing .
Several of the techniques already described here suggest how this is possible in Vala :
An instance of a class may be used as in instance of a superclass , or of any implemented interfaces , without any knowledge of its actual type .
A logical extension of this power is to allow a subtype to behave differently to its parent type when addressed in exactly the same way .
This is not a very easy concept to explain , so I 'll begin with an example of what will happen if you do not directly aim for this goal :
class SuperClass : GLib .
Object { public void method_1 ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " SuperClass.method_1 ( )
" ) ; } } class SubClass : SuperClass { public void method_1 ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " SubClass.method_1 ( )
" ) ; } }
These two classes both implement a method called " method_1 " , and " Sub Class " therefore contains two methods called " method_1 " , as it inherits one from " Super Class " .
Each of these may be called as the following code shows :
SubClass o1 = new SubClass ( ) ; o1 . method_1 ( ) ; SuperClass o2 = o1 ; o2 . method_1 ( ) ;
This will actually result in two different methods being called .
The second line believes " o1 " to be a " Sub Class " and will call that class 's version of the method .
The fourth line believes " o2 " to be a " Super Class " and will call that class 's version of the method .
The problem this example exposes , is that any code holding a reference to " Super Class " will call the methods actually described in that class , even in the actual object is of a subclass .
The way to change this behaviour is using virtual methods .
Consider the following rewritten version of the last example :
class SuperClass : GLib .
Object { public virtual void method_1 ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " SuperClass.method_1 ( )
" ) ; } } class SubClass : SuperClass { public override void method_1 ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " SubClass.method_1 ( )
" ) ; } }
When this code is used in the same way as before , " Sub Class " 's " method_1 " will be called twice .
This is because we have told the system that " method_1 " is a virtual method , meaning that if it is overridden in a subclass , that new version will always be executed on instances of that subclass , regardless of the knowledge of the caller .
This distinction is probably familiar to programmers of some languages , such as C++ , but it is in fact the opposite of Java style languages , in which steps must be taken to prevent a method being virtual .
You will probably now also have recognised that when method is declared as abstract it must also be virtual .
Otherwise , it would not be possible to execute that method given an apparent instance of the type it was declared in .
When implementing an abstract method in a subclass , you may therefore choose to declare the implementation as override , thus passing on the virtual nature of the method , and allowing subtypes to do the same if they desire .
It 's also possible to implement interface methods in such a way that subclasses can change the implementation .
The process in this case is for the initial implementation to declare the method implementation to be virtual , and then subclasses can override as required .
When writing a class , it is common to want to use functionality defined in a class you have inherited from .
This is complicated where the method name is used more than one in the inheritance tree for your class .
For this Vala provides the base keyword .
The most common case is where you have overridden a virtual method to provide extra functionality , but still need the parent class ' method to be called .
The following example shows this case :
public override void method_name ( ) { base .
method_name ( ) ; extra_task ( ) ; }
Vala also allows properties to be virtual :
class SuperClass : GLib .
Object { public virtual string prop_1 { get { return " SuperClass.prop_1 " ; } } } class SubClass : SuperClass { public override string prop_1 { get { return " SubClass.prop_1 " ; } }
Method Hiding
By using the new modifier you can hide an inherited method with a new method of the same name .
The new method may have a different signature .
Method hiding is not to be confused with method overriding , because method hiding does not exhibit polymorphic behaviour .
class Foo : Object { public void my_method ( ) { } } class Bar :
Foo { public new void my_method () { } }
You can still call the original method by casting to the base class or interface :
void main ( ) { var bar = new Bar ( ) ; bar . my_method ( ) ; ( bar as Foo ) . my_method ( ) ; }
Run-Time Type Information
Since Vala classes are registered at runtime and each instance carries its type information you can dynamically check the type of an object with the is operator :
bool b = object is SomeTypeName ;
You can get the type information of Object instances with the get_type ( ) method :
Type type = object .
get_type ( ) ; stdout .
printf ( " %s
" , type . name ( ) ) ;
With the typeof ( ) operator you can get the type information of a type directly .
From this type information you can later create new instances with Object.new ( ) :
Type type = typeof ( Foo ) ; Foo foo = ( Foo ) Object .
new ( type ) ;
Which constructor will be called ?
It 's the construct {} block that will be described in the section about gobject - style construction .
Dynamic Type Casting
For the dynamic cast , a variable is casted by a postfix expression as DesiredTypeName .
Vala will include a runtime type checking to ensure this casting is reasonable - if it is an illegal casting , null will be returned .
However , this requires both the source type and the target type to be referenced class types .
For example ,
Button b = widget as Button ;
If for some reason the class of the widget instance is not the Button class or one of its subclasses or does not implement the Button interface , b will be null .
This cast is equivalent to :
Button b = ( widget is Button ) ? ( Button ) widget : null ;
Generics
Vala includes a runtime generics system , by which a particular instance of a class can be restricted with a particular type or set of types chosen at construction time .
This restriction is generally used to require that data stored in the object must be of a particular type , for example in order to implement a list of objects of a certain type .
In that example , Vala would make sure that only objects of the requested type could be added to the list , and that on retrieval all objects would be cast to that type .
In Vala , generics are handled while the program is running .
When you define a class that can be restricted by a type , there still exists only one class , with each instance customised individually .
This is in contrast to C++ which creates a new class for each type restriction required - Vala 's is similar to the system used by Java .
This has various consequences , most importantly : that static members are shared by the type as a whole , regardless of the restrictions placed on each instance ; and that given a class and a subclass , a generic refined by the subclass can be used as a generic refined by the class .
The following code demonstrates how to use the generics system to define a minimal wrapper class :
public class Wrapper < G > : GLib .
Object { private G data ; public void set_data ( G data ) { this .
data = data ; } public G get_data ( ) { return this .
data ; } }
This " Wrapper " class must be restricted with a type in order to instantiate it - in this case the type will be identified as " G " , and so instances of this class will store one object of " G " type , and have methods to set or get that object .
( The reason for this specific example is to provide reason explain that currently a generic class cannot use properties of its restriction type , and so this class has simple get and set methods instead . )
In order to instantiate this class , a type must be chosen , for example the built in string type ( in Vala there is no restriction on what type may be used in a generic ) .
To create an briefly use this class :
var wrapper = new Wrapper < string >( ) ; wrapper .
set_data ( " test " ) ; var data = wrapper .
get_data ( ) ;
As you can see , when the data is retrieved from the wrapper , it is assigned to an identifier with no explicit type .
This is possible because Vala knows what sort of objects are in each wrapper instance , and therefore can do this work for you .
The fact that Vala does not create multiple classes out of your generic definition means that you can code as follows :
class TestClass : GLib .
Object { } void accept_object_wrapper ( Wrapper < Glib .
Object > w ) { } ... var test_wrapper = new Wrapper < TestClass >( ) ; accept_object_wrapper ( test_wrapper ) ; ...
Since all " Test Class " instances are also Object s , the " accept_object_wrapper " method will happily accept the object it is passed , and treat its wrapped object as though it was a GLib .
Object instance .
GObject - Style Construction
As pointed out before , Vala supports an alternative construction scheme that is slightly different to the one described before , but closer to the way GObject construction works .
Which one you prefer depends on whether you come from the GObject side or from the Java or C# side .
The gobject - style construction scheme introduces some new syntax elements : construct properties , a special Object ( ... ) call and a construct block .
Let 's take a look at how this works :
public class Person : Object { public string name { get ; construct ; } public int age { get ; construct set ; } public Person ( string name ) { Object ( name : name ) ; } public Person .
with_age ( string name , int years ) { Object ( name : name , age : years ) ; } construct { stdout .
printf ( " Welcome %s
" , this . name ) ; } }
With the gobject - style construction scheme each construction method only contains an Object ( ... ) call for setting so - called construct properties .
The Object ( ... ) call takes a variable number of named arguments in the form of property : value .
These properties must be declared as construct or set properties .
They will be set to the given values and afterwards all construct {} blocks in the hierarchy from GLib .
Object down to our class will be called .
The construct block is guaranteed to be called when an instance of this class is created , even if it is created as a subtype .
It does neither have any parameters , nor a return value .
Within this block you can call other methods and set member variables as needed .
Construct properties are defined just as get and set properties , and therefore can run arbitrary code on assignment .
If you need to do initialisation based on a single construct property , it is possible to write a custom construct block for the property , which will be executed immediately on assignment , and before any other construction code .
If a construct property is declared without set it is a so - called construct only property , which means it can only be assigned on construction , but no longer afterwards .
In the example above name is such a construct only property .
Here 's a summary of the various types of properties together with the nomenclature usually found in the documentation of gobject - based libraries :
public int a { get ; private set ; } public int b { private get ; set ; } public int c { get ; set ; } public int d { get ; set construct ; } public int e { get ; construct ; }
In some cases you may also want to perform some action - not when instances of a class is created - but when the class itself is created by the GObject runtime .
In GObject terminology we are talking about a snippet of code run inside the class_init function for the class in question .
In Java this is known as static initializer blocks .
In Vala this looks like :
static construct { ... }
Advanced Features
Assertions and Contract Programming
With assertions a programmer can check assumptions at runtime .
The syntax is assert ( condition ) .
If an assertion fails the program will terminate with an appropriate error message .
There are a few more assertion methods within the GLib standard namespace , e.g. :
assert_not_reached ( ) return_if_fail ( bool expr ) return_if_reached ( ) warn_if_fail ( bool expr ) warn_if_reached ()
You might be tempted to use assertions in order to check method arguments for null .
However , this is not necessary , since Vala does that implicitly for all parameters that are not marked with ?
as being nullable .
void method_name ( Foo foo , Bar bar ) { }
Vala supports basic contract programming features .
A method may have preconditions ( requires ) and postconditions ( ensures ) that must be fulfilled at the beginning or the end of a method respectively :
double method_name ( int x , double d ) requires ( x > 0 && x < 10 ) requires ( d >= 0.0 && d <= 1.0 ) ensures ( result >= 0.0 && result <= 10.0 ) { return d * x ; }
result is a special variable representing the return value .
Error Handling
GLib has a system for managing runtime exceptions called GError .
Vala translates this into a form familiar to modern programming languages , but its implementation means it is not quite the same as in Java or C# .
It is important to consider when to use this type of error handling - GError is very specifically designed to deal with recoverable runtime errors , i.e. factors that are not known until the program is run on a live system , and that are not fatal to the execution .
You should not use GError for problems that can be foreseen , such as reporting that an invalid value has been passed to a method .
If a method , for example , requires a number greater than 0 as a parameter , it should fail on negative values using contract programming techniques such as preconditions or assertions described in the previous section .
Vala errors are so - called checked exceptions , which means that errors must get handled at some point .
However , if you do n't catch an error the Vala compiler will only issue a warning without stopping the compilation process .
Using exceptions ( or errors in Vala terminology ) is a matter of :
1 ) Declaring that a method may raise an error :
void my_method ( ) throws IOError { }
2 ) Throwing the error when appropriate :
if ( something_went_wrong ) { throw new IOError .
FILE_NOT_FOUND ( " Requested file could not be found . " ) ; }
3 ) Catching the error from the calling code :
try { my_method ( ) ; } catch ( IOError e ) { stdout .
printf ( " Error : %s
" , e . message ) ; }
4 ) Comparing error code by " is " operator
IOChannel channel ; try { channel = new IOChannel .
file ( " /tmp/ my_lock " , " w " ) ; } catch ( FileError e ) { if ( e is FileError .
EXIST ) { throw e ; } GLib . error ( " " , e . message ) ; }
All this appears more or less as in other languages , but defining the types of errors allowed is fairly unique .
Errors have three components , known as " domain " , " code " and message .
Messages we have already seen , it is simply a piece of text provided when the error is created .
Error domains describe the type of problem , and equates to a subclass of " Exception " in Java or similar .
In the above examples we imagined an error domain called " I O Error " .
The third part , the error code is a refinement describing the exact variety of problem encountered .
Each error domain has one or more error codes - in the example there is a code called " FILE_NOT_FOUND " .
The way to define this information about error types is related to the implementation in glib .
In order for the examples here to work , a definition is needed such as :
errordomain IOError { FILE_NOT_FOUND
}
When catching an error , you give the error domain you wish to catch errors in , and if an error in that domain is thrown , the code in the handler is run with the error assigned to the supplied name .
From that error object you can extract the error code and message as needed .
If you want to catch errors from more than one domain , simply provide extra catch blocks .
There is also an optional block that can be placed after a try and any catch blocks , called finally .
This code is to be run always at the end of the section , regardless of whether an error was thrown or any catch blocks were executed , even if the error was in fact no handled and will be thrown again .
This allows , for example , any resources reserved in the try block be freed regardless of any errors raised .
A complete example of these features :
public errordomain ErrorType1 { CODE_1A } public errordomain ErrorType2 { CODE_2A , CODE_2B } public class Test : GLib .
Object { public static void thrower ( ) throws ErrorType1 , ErrorType2 { throw new ErrorType1 .
CODE_1A ( " Error " ) ; } public static void catcher ( ) throws ErrorType2 { try { thrower ( ) ; } catch ( ErrorType1 e ) { } finally { } } public static int main ( string [ ] args ) { try { catcher ( ) ; } catch ( ErrorType2 e ) { if ( e is ErrorType2 .
CODE_2B ) { } } return 0 ; } }
This example has two error domains , both of which can be thrown by the " thrower " method .
Catcher can only throw the second type of error , and so must handle the first type if " thrower " throws it .
Finally the " main " method will handle any errors from " catcher " .
Parameter Directions
A method in Vala is passed zero or more arguments .
The default behaviour when a method is called is as follows :
Any value type parameters are copied to a location local to the method as it executes .
Any reference type parameters are not copied , instead just a reference to them is passed to the method .
This behaviour can be changed with the modifiers ' ref ' and ' out ' .
' out ' from the caller side you may pass an uninitialised variable to the method and you may expect it to be initialised after the method returns ' out ' from callee side the parameter is considered uninitialised and you have to initialise it ' ref ' from caller side the variable you 're passing to the method has to be initialised and it may be changed or not by the method ' ref ' from callee side the parameter is considered initialised and you may change it or not
void method_1 ( int a , out int b , ref int c ) { ... } void method_2 ( Object o , out Object p , ref Object q ) { ... }
These methods can be called as follows :
int a = 1 ; int b ; int c = 3 ; method_1 ( a , out b , ref c ) ; Object o = new Object ( ) ; Object p ; Object q = new Object ( ) ; method_2 ( o , out p , ref q ) ;
The treatment of each variable will be :
" a " is of a value type .
The value will be copied into a new memory location local to the method , and so changes to it will not be visible to the caller .
" b " is also of a value type , but passed as an out parameter .
In this case , the value is not copied , instead a pointer to the data is passed to the method , and so any change to the method parameter will be visible to the calling code .
" c " is treated in the same way as " b " , the only change is in the signalled intent of the method .
" o " is of a reference type .
The method is passed a reference to the same object as the caller has .
The method can therefore change that object , but if it reassigns to the parameter , that change will not be visible to the caller .
" p " is of the same type , but passed as an out parameter .
This means that the method will receive a pointer to the reference to the object .
It may therefore replace the reference with a reference to another object , and when the method returns the caller will instead own a reference to that other object .
When you use this type of parameter , if you do not assign a new reference to the parameter , it will be set to null .
" q " is again of the same type .
This case is treated like " p " with the important differences that the method may choose not to change the reference , and may access the object referred to .
Vala will ensure that in this instance " q " actually refers to any object , and is not set to null .
Here is an example of how to implement method_1 ( ) :
void method_1 ( int a , out int b , ref int c ) { b = a + c ; c = 3 ; }
When setting the value to the out argument " b " , Vala will ensure that " b " is not null .
So you can safely pass null as the second argument of method_1 ( ) if you are not interested by this value .
Collections
Gee is a library of collection classes , written in Vala .
The classes should all be familiar to users of libraries such as Java 's Foundation Classes .
Gee consists of a set of interfaces and various types that implement these in different ways .
If you want to use Gee in your own application , install the library separately on your system .
Gee can be obtained from http://live.gnome.org/Projects/Libgee.
In order to use the library you must compile your programs with -- pkg gee -0.8 .
The fundamental types of collection are :
Lists : Ordered collections of items , accessible by numeric index .
Sets : Unordered collections of distinct .
Maps : Unordered collection of items , accessible by index of arbitrary type .
All the lists and sets in the library implement the Collection interface , and all maps the Map interface .
Lists also implement List and sets Set .
These common interfaces means not only that all collections of a similar type can be used interchangeably , but also that new collections can be written using the same interfaces , and therefore used with existing code .
Also common to every Collection type is the Iterable interface .
This means that any object in this category can be iterated through using a standard set of methods , or directly in Vala using the foreach syntax .
All classes and interfaces use the generics system .
This means that they must be instantiated with a particular type or set of types that they will contain .
The system will ensure that only the intended types can be put into the collections , and that when objects are retrieved they are returned as the correct type .
Full Gee API documentation , Gee Examples
Some important Gee classes are :
ArrayList<G>
Implementing : Iterable <G> , Collection <G> , List<G >
An ordered list of items of type G backed by a dynamically resizing array .
This type is very fast for accessing data , but potentially slow at inserting items anywhere other than at the end , or at inserting items when the internal array is full .
HashMap<K , V >
Implementing : Iterable < Entry<K , V >> , Map<K , V >
A 1:1 map from elements of type K to elements of type V .
The mapping is made by computing a hash value for each key - this can be customised by providing pointers to functions for hashing and testing equality of keys in specific ways .
You can optionally pass custom hash and equal functions to the constructor , for example :
var map = new Gee .
HashMap < Foo , Object >( foo_hash , foo_equal ) ;
For strings and integers the hash and equal functions are detected automatically , objects are distinguished by their references by default .
You have to provide custom hash and equal functions only if you want to override the default behaviour .
HashSet<G>
Implementing : Iterable <G> , Collection <G> , Set<G >
A set of elements of type G .
Duplicates are detected by computing a hash value for each key - this can be customised by providing pointers to functions for hashing and testing equality of keys in specific ways .
Read -Only Views
You can get a read - only view of a collection via the read_only_view property , e.g. my_map.read_only_view .
This will return a wrapper that has the same interface as its contained collection , but will not allow any form of modification , or any access to the contained collection .
Methods With Syntax Support
Vala recognizes some methods with certain names and signatures and provides syntax support for them .
For example , if a type has a contains ( ) method objects of this type can be used with the in operator .
The following table lists these special methods .
T and Tn are only type placeholders in this table and meant to be replaced with real types .
Indexers T2 get ( T1 index ) index access : obj[ index ] void set ( T1 index , T2 item ) index assignment : obj[ index ] = item Indexers with multiple indices T3 get ( T1 index1 , T2 index2 ) index access : obj[ index1 , index2 ] void set ( T1 index1 , T2 index2 , T3 item ) index assignment : obj[ index1 , index2 ] = item ( ... and so on for more indices )
Others T slice ( long start , long end ) slicing : obj[ start : end ] bool contains ( T needle ) in operator : bool b = needle in obj string to_string ( ) support within string templates : @ " $obj " Iterator iterator ( ) iterable via foreach T2 get ( T1 index )
T1 size { get ; } iterable via foreach
The Iterator type can have any name and must implement one of these two protocols :
bool next ( )
T get ( ) standard iterator protocol : iterating until . next ( ) returns false .
The current element is retrieved via .get ( ) .
T? next_value ( ) alternative iterator protocol :
If the iterator object has a .next_value ( ) function that returns a nullable type then we iterate by calling this function until it returns null .
This example implements some of these methods :
public class EvenNumbers { public int get ( int index ) { return index * 2 ; } public bool contains ( int i ) { return i % 2 == 0 ; } public string to_string ( ) { return " [ This object enumerates even numbers ] " ; } public Iterator iterator ( ) { return new Iterator ( this ) ; } public class Iterator { private int index ; private EvenNumbers even ; public Iterator ( EvenNumbers even ) { this .
even = even ; } public bool next ( ) { return true ; } public int get ( ) { this .
index ++ ; return this .
even [ this .
index - 1 ] ; } } } void main ( ) { var even = new EvenNumbers ( ) ; stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , even [ 5 ] ) ; if ( 4 in even ) { stdout .
printf ( @ " $ even
" ) ; } foreach ( int i in even ) { stdout .
printf ( " %d
" , i ) ; if ( i == 20 ) break ; } }
Multi-Threading
Threads in Vala
A program written in Vala may have more than one thread of execution , allowing it it do more than one thing at a time .
Exactly how this is managed is outside of Vala 's scope - threads may be sharing a single processor core or not , depending on the environment .
A thread in Vala is not defined at compile time , instead it is simply a portion of Vala code that is requested at runtime to be executed as a new thread .
This is done using the static methods of the Thread class in GLib , as shown in the following ( very simplified ) example :
void * thread_func ( ) { stdout .
printf ( " Thread running .
" ) ; return null ; } int main ( string [ ] args ) { if (!
Thread .
supported ( ) ) { stderr .
printf ( " Cannot run without threads .
" ) ; return 1 ; } try { Thread .
create ( thread_func , false ) ; } catch ( ThreadError e ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; }
This short program will request a new thread be created and executed .
The code to be run being that in thread_func .
Also note the test at the start of the main method - a Vala program will not be able to use threads unless compiled appropriately , so if you build this example in the usual way , it will just display an error and stop running .
Being able to check for thread support at runtime allows a program to be built to run either with or without threads if that is wanted .
In order to build with thread support , run :
$ valac -- thread threading - sample.vala
This will both include required libraries and make sure the threading system is initialised whenever possible .
The program will now run without segmentation faults , but it will still not act as expected .
Without any sort of event loop , a Vala program will terminate when its primary thread ( the one created to run " main " ) ends .
In order to control this behaviour , you can allow threads to cooperate .
This can be done powerfully using event loops and asynchronous queues , but in this introduction to threading we will just show the basic capabilities of threads .
It is possible for a thread to tell the system that it currently has no need to execute , and thereby suggest that another thread should be run instead , this is done using the static method Thread. yield ( ) .
If this statement was placed at the end of the above main method , the runtime system will pause the main thread for an instant and check if there are other threads that can be run - on finding the newly created thread in a runnable state , it will run that instead until it is finished - and the program will act is it appears it should .
However , there is no guarantee that this will happen still .
The system is able to decide when threads run , and as such might not allow the new thread to finish before the primary thread is restarted and the program ends .
In order to wait for a thread to finish entirely there is the join ( ) method .
Calling this method on a Thread object causes the calling thread to wait for the other thread to finish before proceeding .
It also allows a thread to receive the return value of another , if that is useful .
To implement joining threads :
try { unowned Thread thread =
Thread .
create ( thread_func , true ) ; thread .
join ( ) ; } catch ( ThreadError e ) { return 1 ; }
This time , when we create the thread we give true as the last argument .
This marks the thread as " joinable " .
We also remember the value returned from the creation - an unowned reference to a Thread object ( unowned references are explained later and are not vital to this section . )
With this reference it is possible to join the new thread to the primary thread .
With this version of the program it is guaranteed that the newly created thread will be allowed to fully execute before the primary thread continues and the program terminates .
All these examples have a potential problem , in that the newly created thread does n't know the context in which it should run .
In C you would supply the thread creation method with some data , in Vala instead you would normally pass an instance method to Thread.
create , instead of a static method .
Resource Control
Whenever more than one thread of execution is running simultaneously , there is a chance that data are accessed simultaneously .
This can lead to race conditions , where the outcome depends on when the system decides to switch between threads .
In order to control this situation , you can use the lock keyword to ensure that certain blocks of code will not be interrupted by other threads that need to access the same data .
The best way to show this is probably with an example :
public class Test : GLib .
Object { private int a { get ; set ; } public void action_1 ( ) { lock ( a ) { int tmp = a ; tmp ++ ; a = tmp ; } } public void action_2 ( ) { lock ( a ) { int tmp = a ; tmp --; a = tmp ; } } }
This class defines two methods , where both need to change the value of " a " .
If there were no lock statements here , it would be possible for the instructions in these methods to be interweaved , and the resulting change to " a " would be effectively random .
As there are the lock statements here , Vala will guarantee that if one thread has locked " a " , another thread that needs the same lock will have to wait its turn .
In Vala it is only possible to lock members of the object that is executing the code .
This might appear to be a major restriction , but in fact the standard use for this technique should involve classes that are individually responsible for controlling a resource , and so all locking will indeed be internal to the class .
Likewise , in above example all accesses to " a " are encapsulated in the class .
The Main Loop
GLib includes a system for running an event loop , in the classes around Main Loop .
The purpose of this system is to allow you to write a program that waits for events and responds to them , instead of having to constantly check conditions .
This is the model that GTK + uses , so that a program can wait for user interaction without having to have any currently running code .
The following program creates and starts a Main Loop , and then attaches a source of events to it .
In this case the source is a simple timer , that will execute the given method after 2000 ms .
The method will in fact just stop the main loop , which will in this case exit the program .
void main ( ) { var loop = new MainLoop ( ) ; var time = new TimeoutSource ( 2000 ) ; time .
set_callback ( ( ) => { stdout .
printf ( " Time !
" ) ; loop .
quit ( ) ; return false ; } ) ; time .
attach ( loop . get_context ( ) ) ; loop . run ( ) ; }
When using GTK + , a main loop will be created automatically , and will be started when you call the ` Gtk.main ( ) ' method .
This marks the point where the program is ready to run and start accepting events from the user or elsewhere .
The code in GTK + is equivalent to the short example above , and so you may add event sources in much the same way , although of course you need to use the GTK + methods to control the main loop .
void main ( string [ ] args ) { Gtk .
init ( ref args ) ; var time = new TimeoutSource ( 2000 ) ; time .
set_callback ( ( ) => { stdout .
printf ( " Time !
" ) ; Gtk . main_quit ( ) ; return false ; } ) ; time .
attach ( null ) ; Gtk . main ( ) ; }
A common requirement in GUI programs is to execute some code as soon as possible , but only when it will not disturb the user .
For this , you use IdleSource instances .
These send events to the programs main loop , but request they only be dealt with when there is nothing more important to do .
For more information about event loops , see the GLib and GTK + documentation .
Asynchronous Methods
Asynchronous methods are methods whose execution can be paused and resumed under the control of the programmer .
They are often used in the main thread of an application where a method needs to wait for an external slow task to complete , but must not stop other processing from happening .
( For example , one slow operation must not freeze the whole GUI ) .
When the method has to wait , it gives control of the CPU back to its caller ( i.e. it yields ) , but it arranges to be called back to resume execution when data becomes ready .
External slow tasks that async methods might wait for include : waiting for data from a remote server , or waiting for calculations in another thread to complete , or waiting for data to load from a disk drive .
Asynchronous methods are normally used with a GLib main loop running , because idle callbacks are used to handle some of the internal callbacks .
However under certain conditions async may be used without the GLib main loop , for example if the async methods always yield and Idle.add ( ) is never used .
( FIXME : Check what are the exact conditions . )
Asynchronous methods are designed for interleaving the processing of many different long - lived operations within a single thread .
They do not by themselves spread the load out over different threads .
However , an async method may be used to control a background thread and to wait for it to complete , or to queue operations for a background thread to process .
Async methods in Vala use the GIO library to handle the callbacks , so must be built with the - - pkg=gio - 2.0 option .
An asynchronous method is defined with the async keyword .
For example :
async void display_jpeg ( string fnam ) { [...] }
or :
async int fetch_webpage ( string url , out string text ) throws IOError { [...] text = result ; return status ; }
The method may take arguments and return a value like any other method .
It may use a yield statement at any time to give control of the CPU back to its caller .
An async method may be called with either of these two forms :
display_jpeg . begin ( " test.jpg " ) ; display_jpeg .
begin ( " test.jpg " , ( obj , res ) => { display_jpeg .
end ( res ) ; } ) ;
Both forms starts the async method running with the given arguments .
The second form in addition registers an AsyncReadyCallback which is executed when the method finishes .
The callback takes a source object , obj , and an instance of GAyncResult , res , as arguments .
In the callback the .end ( ) method should be called to receive the return value of the asynchronous method if it has one .
If the async method can throw an exception , the .end ( ) call is where the exception arrives and must be caught .
If the method has out arguments , then these should be omitted from the .begin ( ) call and added to the .end ( ) call instead .
For example :
fetch_webpage .
begin ( " http://www.example.com/ " , ( obj , res ) => { try { string text ; var status = fetch_webpage .
end ( res , out text ) ; } catch ( IOError e ) { } } ) ;
When an asynchronous method starts running , it takes control of the CPU until it reaches its first yield statement , at which point it returns to the caller .
When the method is resumed , it continues execution immediately after that yield statement .
There are several common ways to use yield :
This form gives up control , but arranges for the GLib main loop to resume the method when there are no more events to process :
Idle . add ( fetch_webpage .
callback ) ; yield ;
This form gives up control , and stores the callback details for some other code to use to resume the method 's execution :
SourceFunc callback = fetch_webpage .
callback ; [... store ' callback ' somewhere ...] yield ;
Some code elsewhere must now call the stored SourceFunc in order for the method to be resumed .
This could be done by scheduling the GLib main loop to run it :
Idle . add ( ( owned ) callback ) ;
or alternatively a direct call may be made if the caller is running in the main thread :
callback ( ) ;
If the direct call above is used , then the resumed asynchronous method takes control of the CPU immediately and runs until its next yield before returning to the code that executed callback ( ) .
The Idle.add ( ) method is useful if the callback must be made from a background thread , e.g. to resume the async method after completion of some background processing .
( The ( owned ) cast is necessary to avoid a warning about copying delegates . )
The third common way of using yield is when calling another asynchronous method , for example :
yield display_jpeg ( fnam ) ;
or
var status = yield fetch_webpage ( url , out text ) ;
In both cases , the calling method gives up control of the CPU and does not resume until the called method completes .
The yield statement automatically registers a callback with the called method to make sure that the caller resumes correctly .
The automatic callback also collects the return value from the called method .
When this yield statement executes , control of the CPU first passes to the called method which runs until its first yield and then drops back to the calling method , which completes the yield statement itself , and then gives back control to its own caller .
Examples
See Async Method Samples for examples of different ways that async may be used .
Weak References
Vala 's memory management is based on automatic reference counting .
Each time an object is assigned to a variable its internal reference count is increased by 1 , each time a variable referencing an object goes out of scope its internal reference count is decreased by 1 .
If the reference count reaches 0 the object will be freed .
However , it is possible to form a reference cycle with your data structures .
For example , with a tree data structure where a child node holds a reference to its parent and vice versa , or a doubly - linked list where each element holds a
Gallup says President Obama 's approval rating today is 67 % , up from 59 % on Tuesday and 63 % a week ago .
Gallup attributes the week 's improvement to Obama 's address to Congress Tuesday night and a sharp rebound among Republicans , from 27 % approval to 42 % .
The latest rating is based on polling conducted Tuesday through Thursday .
Reaction to Obama 's new budget proposal should be reflected in coming days .

A man who was criticised in the comments section of his own blog cannot sue for defamation because he did not delete the comment when he discovered it , the High Court has said .
The Court said that the man consented to the comment 's publication .
Christopher Carrie is the author of a self - published book in which he claims to have been sexually abused by the son of writer JRR Tolkien , Father John Tolkien .
John Tolkien , who was a priest , died in 2003 .
Carrie set up a blog on 5th February 2007 and published a post under a pseudonym on 6th February , promoting his website and his book , which could be downloaded from there for free .
The court heard that JRR Tolkien 's great grandson Royd Tolkien had posted a comment on the site claiming that Carrie was a fraudster who had tried to defraud the Catholic Church and the Tolkien family and had admitted to lying about sexual abuse to extract money from the church .
Carrie denied the claims via his pseudonym on the site , and sued Tolkien , claiming that the remarks were defamatory .
Carrie did not remove the remarks , though , even though the Court heard that he had seen them four - and - a - half hours after they were posted .
The remarks are still online .
Tolkien argued that this meant that Carrie consented to the publication of the comments , and the High Court agreed .
Mr Justice Eady granted summary judgment in favour of Tolkien .
" No explanation was offered for [ Carrie ] having taken no steps to delete it until his witness statement of 18 November 2008 was served , " said the ruling .
" The explanation given , however , of putting the words ' in context ' does not in any way detract from the validity of a defence of authorisation or acquiescence .
The fact remains that he could have removed it at any time over the last 22 months . "
" [ Carrie 's ] conduct is hardly compatible with the suggestion in his pleading that he has suffered ' substantial upset and distress ' or with the assertion that he has ' concerns about the welfare and safety of [ his ] family ' , " said the judgment .
" [ Carrie ] has responded to some extent to the pleading of the defence of consent , but not to any substantive effect .
For example , he relies upon the fact that he reported the posting to the local police on or about 25 February 2007 .
That may be so , but it does not meet the defence .
Nothing in the reply can serve to undermine the basic fact that he has acquiesced in the continuing publications since the original date of publication , " said Mr Justice Eady .
The Court ruled that a jury was likely to conclude that Carrie consented to the publication of the remarks after 3.41 pm on the day of publication , when he responded to them on the site .
That still left a potential defamation case to answer in relation to the four - and - a - half hours during which the remarks were live on the site before it became clear that Carrie was aware of them .
The law of defamation protects people against harm to their reputation .
An article must be read for it to harm someone 's reputation , and Mr Justice Eady said that it is not sufficient simply to assert that an article 's appearance online means that it has been read .
" There is no presumption in law to the effect that placing material on the Internet leads automatically to a substantial publication , " he said .
" There must be some evidence on which an inference can be drawn in relation to that very short period of time . "
The judge referred to the 2006 case of businessman Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi , who sued a terrorism expert over claims , published online , that Al Amoudi had links to the financing the activities of terrorist Osama Bin Laden .
The judge in that case said that Al Amoudi would have to prove that the material was accessed and downloaded in the UK in order to proceed with his case .
Mr Justice Eady came to the same conclusion .
" It will not suffice merely to plead that the posting has been accessed ' by a large but unquantifiable number of readers ' .
There must be some solid basis for the inference .
That form of pleading is no more than bare assertion , " he said .

YORK , Maine �
Max has been sticking pretty close to home since his close call in an icy ocean inlet , according to the man who pulled him from the water .
The 6 - year - old black Labrador retriever fell through the ice in Godfrey Cove in on Tuesday , Feb. 17 .
Max was in the water for more than an hour , apparently barking the entire time , said John Gundlah , who was watching the dog for its owner , Tina Buckley of Surf Sounds , off of Rocky Hill Road .
The barking helped Gundlah and police locate Max when they arrived at the scene at around 10 p.m .
� He kept barking , � said Gundlah .
� Those Labradors are pretty tough .
( Residents ) heard him barking on the hill .
They thought it was a coyote . �
Dispatcher Jon Gay said York police received a 911 call at about 8:48 p.m. on Tuesday reporting a dog barking in the area of Lock Lane .
Shortly after , more 911 calls came in about the dog possibly having gone through the ice .
Police , fire and an animal control officer went to the scene .
Police also called Gundlah , who had reported the dog missing around 3 p.m. Gundlah , who works in construction , was remodeling a bathroom at Buckley�s home when Max slipped out of the house .
Gundlah and police officers Scott Slawson and Dan Gallant arrived on Lock Lane about the same time , said Gundlah , and they could hear Max barking .
� Their light picked him up , � said Gundlah .
� He was hanging on with one paw , his face on the ice .
I think he just kind of slipped in , he couldn�t get back out . �
Max was about 15 to 20 feet from shore .
� We went out on snow mix , � said Gundlah of the weather conditions .
� One officer was next to me .
The other officer held onto his feet . �
Slawson and Gallant aided Gundlah in getting the dog safely out of the water .
The trio used a line to tie themselves together and give them some leverage to pull Max out .
� He was pretty cold , shaking , shaking , shaking , � said Gundlah .
� I carried him out about a quarter - mile to get to a car . �
Gundlah said he felt awful Max got into trouble while in his care .
Last month , Max underwent brain surgery , said Gundlah .
Max has been disoriented because of the brain surgery , said Buckley .
She was surprised Max barked because since the surgery , she said , he�s been on medication and hasn�t been barking at all .
� The dog�s gone through a lot , � she said .
� He did n�t know how to get home .
There�s a lot of woods around here . �
Buckley said she picked Max out of a litter of four at birth .
� He was my pick of the litter , � she said , �because I liked him the best .
He was all black and his mom�s a golden retriever . �
He hasn�t been doing any wandering since the incident .
� Max is doing great , � Gundlah said .
� He sticks pretty close . �

For the past several years–until the credit crisis–investors have flocked toward renewable energy .
Their hope is that solar radiation can be harnessed directly and through intermediaries such as the wind and biosphere to power the global economy into perpetuity .
This hope is understandable since renewable energy has benefits that range from the environment to geopolitics .
Nevertheless , care and scientific rigor should be used to quantify the challenge of converting society to renewable energy .
The maximum theoretical potential of advanced lithium - ion batteries that have n’t yet been demonstrated to work is still only about 6 percent of crude oil . ”
The most significant challenge to renewable energy is competition from fossil carbon – the world ’s predominant source of primary energy for the past 150 years .
Fossil carbon has dominated the energy market for many reasons – not the least of which is its intrinsic mass and volume energy densities .
Indeed , 1 kilogram of crude oil contains nearly 50 mega - joules of chemical potential energy , which is enough to lift 1 metric ton to a height of around 5,000 meters .
Furthermore , crude oil happens to be liquid at Earth ’s surface conditions , making it easy to store , transport , and convert .
The energy densities of natural gas and coal , around 55 mega - joules per kilogram and 20 - 35 mega - joules per kilogram respectively , are similar to those of crude oil .
Fossil carbon is packed with chemical energy because carbon and the hydrogen it stabilizes in a condensed form react strongly with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water .
In addition , geologic processes have concentrated large quantities of fossil carbon into relatively small geographic areas such as coal mines and oil fields .
Biofuels such as ethanol and biosynthetic diesel can have volume and mass energy densities equal to that of fossil carbon , but since they ’re regularly harvested , their areal energy densities are substantially lower .
Renewable energy–unlike fossil carbon–is harnessed dynamically from the environment .
Therefore , it wo n’t be as useful as fossil carbon until it can be stored and transported with similar ease .
Many companies and scientists are diligently trying to improve energy storage technologies , and we ’re confident that substantial progress will be made .
We can , however , use thermodynamics to calculate the upper limits of what ’s possible for a variety of technologies .
And when we do this , we find that many technologies will never compete with fossil carbon on energy density .
Let ’s start with batteries .
Today ’s lead acid batteries can store about 0.1 mega - joules per kilogram , or about 500 times less than crude oil .
Those batteries , of course , could be improved , but any battery based on the standard lead - oxide / sulfuric acid chemistry is limited by foundational thermodynamics to less than 0.7 mega - joules per kilogram .
Due to the theoretical limits of lead - acid batteries , there has been serious work on other approaches such as lithium - ion batteries , which usually involve the oxidation and reduction of carbon and a transition metal such as cobalt .
These batteries have already improved upon the energy density of lead - acid batteries by a factor of about 6 to around 0.5 mega - joules per kilogram–a great improvement .
But as currently designed , they have a theoretical energy density limit of about 2 mega - joules per kilogram .
And if research regarding the substitution of silicon for carbon in the anodes is realized in a practical way , then the theoretical limit on lithium - ion batteries might break 3 mega - joules per kilogram .
Therefore , the maximum theoretical potential of advanced lithium - ion batteries that have n’t been demonstrated to work yet is still only about 6 percent of crude oil !
But what about some ultra- advanced lithium battery that uses lighter elements than cobalt and carbon ?
Without considering the practicality of building such a battery , we can look at the periodic table and pick out the lightest elements with multiple oxidations states that do form compounds .
This thought experiment turns up compounds of hydrogen - scandium .
Assuming that we could actually make such a battery , its theoretical limit would be around 5 mega - joules per kilogram .
So the best batteries are currently getting 10 percent of a physical upper bound and 25 percent of a demonstrated bound .
And given other required materials such as electrolytes , separators , current collectors , and packaging , we ’re unlikely to improve the energy density by more than about a factor of 2 within about 20 years .
This means hydrocarbons –including both fossil carbon and biofuels–are still a factor of 10 better than the physical upper bound , and they ’re likely to be 25 times better than lithium batteries will ever be .
What about storing energy in electric fields ( i.e. , capacitors ) or magnetic fields ( i.e. , superconductors ) ?
While the best capacitors today store 20 times less energy than an equal mass of lithium - ion batteries , one company , EEstor , claims a new capacitor capable of 1 mega - joule per kilogram .
Whether or not this claim proves valid , it ’s within about a factor of 2 of the physical limit based on the bandgap of the dielectric material .
Electromagnets of high - temperature superconductors could in theory reach about 4 mega - joules per liter similar to our theoretical batteries given a reasonable density ; existing magnetic energy storage systems top out around 0.01 mega - joules per kilogram , about equal to existing capacitors .
Here again , both the realized technology and its ultimate physical potential are far behind the energy density of common hydrocarbon fuels .
That brings us to the option of storing chemical potential energy as fuel that can be oxidized by atmospheric oxygen .
We do it today , but with two differences :
We generate this fuel renewably and convert it to work more efficiently than in combustion engines , either by fuel cells or air batteries .
Zinc air batteries , which involve the oxidation of zinc metal to zinc hydroxide , could reach about 1.3 mega - joules per kilogram .
But if we take elemental zinc all the way to zinc oxide , then we can theoretically beat the best imagined batteries at about 5.3 mega - joules per kilogram .
Zinc has proved interesting enough that several writers ( not us ) have imagined a “ zinc economy . ”
To get really ambitious , we imagine storing energy as elemental aluminum or elemental lithium .
Those two highly electro - positive elements yield a theoretical energy density –when oxidized in air–of 32 and 43 mega - joules per kilogram .
At least now the theoretical limit is between 60 percent and 80 percent to that of hydrocarbons ; we just have to figure out how to extract a large fraction of the energy from that oxidation .
A more promising approach is to use fuel cells with liquid and gaseous fuels .
The two obvious choices for such fuels are hydrogen and hydrocarbons ; in terms of energy per unit mass , hydrogen beats crude oil and natural gas by a factor of almost 3 .
Alas , hydrogen is a gas at surface conditions , so its volume density is horrible unless it ’s compressed to several hundred atmospheres of pressure .
At 700 bars , for example , hydrogen has an energy - volume density of around 6 mega - joules per liter , while gasoline at 1 bar has about 34 mega - joules per liter .
Both hydrogen and hydro - carbons can be produced from renewable energy sources , though doing so economically and at a global scale remains a challenge .
There is one more energy - storage approach that theoretically beats hydrocarbons .
Energy density comparable to lithium - ion batteries has been demonstrated with flywheels , and a theoretical device composed solely of toroidal carbon nanotubes could reach 100 mega - joules per kilogram .
But the fabrication and safety challenges inherent in such a device render it unlikely that even a small fraction of this potential will ever be realized .
The bottom line is that nature has given us hydrocarbons in the form of fossil carbon and biomass , and their energy - mass and energy - volume densities are superior to the thermodynamic limits of nearly all conceivable alternatives .
Thus , it ’s quite likely that hydrocarbons of one form or another will be humanity ’s primary energy storage medium for quite a long time .

Tulsa : Second defendant gets prison in dog sex case
TULSA — A man received a five - year prison term Monday for videotaping a co-defendant — who got no prison time — as she engaged in sex acts with dogs .
Donald R. Seigfried , 56 , pleaded no contest in November to one count of committing a crime against nature .
Tulsa County District Judge William Kellough sentenced Seigfried to five years in prison and ordered him to spend three years on probation .
Co-defendant Diane Sue Whalen , 55 , received a five - year suspended sentence and no prison time in October .
She pleaded no contest in September to one felony count .
Records show Seigfried has prior felony convictions for theft and drug offenses committed more than 25 years ago .
Whalen had no prior criminal record .
Attorney Jerry Truster , representing Seigfried , said if Seigfried had not had the past convictions , he would have had a possibility of serving his entire sentence on probation .
According to Whalen ’s sentencing report , she was recorded on video engaged in sex acts with three dogs .
She said Seigfried " was involved in taping , directing and giving advice ” to her as she performed in the videos , the report states .
Seigfried had been free on bond .
He was jailed Monday .
MOSCOW -- Russia is reasserting its role in Central Asia with a Kremlin push to eject the U.S. from a vital air base and a Moscow - led pact to form an international military force to rival NATO -- two moves that potentially complicate the new U.S. war strategy in Afghanistan .
On Wednesday , Russia announced a financial rescue fund for a group of ex-Soviet allies and won their agreement to form a military rapid reaction force in the region that it said would match North Atlantic Treaty Organization standards .
That came a day ...
September 's upcoming elections looks set to see a return to the more traditional pencil and paper countrywide .
Constitutional judge Andreas Vosskuhle said that the judgment did not rule out digital voting for once and for all , but added that the equipment used four years ago did have shortcomings .
Nevertheless , Vosskuhle said there was no indication that there had been any errors .
Some two million voters in five different German states submitted their ballots electronically in 2005 .
Father and son opposed the technology
Sometimes the old solutions are the best
The use of electronic voting was challenged by a father - and - son team .
Political scientist Joachim Wiesner and son , physicist Ulrich Wiesner complained that push button voting was not transparent because the voter could not see what actually happened to his vote inside the computer and was required to place " blind faith " in the technology .
In addition , the two plaintiffs argued that the results were open to manipulation .
Germany first introduced electronic voting in European elections in 1999 and first used it in parliamentary ballots in 2002 , but 2005 saw the first large - scale deployment of the technology .
German hacker - cum - data - protection group Chaos Computer Club has been spearheading a campaign with the Dutch foundation Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet ( We do n't trust voting computers ) to stop the further spread of electronic voting because of fears about the risk of electronic errors and the potential for abuse .
In 2008 , the Dutch government decertified the use of existing paperless systems and rejected a proposal to develop a new generation of voting computers .
Words are cheap , are they falling on deaf ears ?
To half the US deficit by the end of first term ?
Is it possible ?
Anything is , but let us begin with the basics .
We are not up for re-election just yet .
Expect North America to be on collision course with its European counterpart when the financial industry gets overhauled , and we are not talking a facelift !
The possibility of being semi-nationalized will put further pressure on the greenback , increase the risk appetite of speculators , but not change the landscape whatsoever .
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The possibility of a quasi nationalization proposal for some US financials ( the same ones that were too big to fail ) has once again put the greenback under pressure , but at the same time introduced the idea that increasing oneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s risk appetite is again Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœhipÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Global equities have found a bid at their historical lows , is this sustainable ?
The investors psyche is so battered and bruised its going to take an enormous amount of momentum to change their pessimistic viewpoints .
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.63 % , GBP - 0.59 % , CHF - 0.85 % and lower against JPY +0.60 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.30 % and AUD - 0.93 % .
Despite weaker economic data this week , the loonie managed to advance against its largest trading partner south of the border as the greenback systematically lost ground against most of its major trading partners coupled with the fact that commodities remain better bid .
The economy , who relies heavily on its southern partner ( over 70 % of all goods head south ) , does not expect any pick up soon .
Some analysts are already revising their numbers and expect the economy to shrink 2 % this year as opposed to 1.5 % recommended a few months ago .
Dismal exports , jobs and manufacturing growth will only impede the economy and currency even further .
The AUD dollar like most currencies advances as investors speculated that the US will take a 40 % control of Citi bank , thus semi nationalizing the US financial system ( 0.6524 ) .
This action will only hurt the greenback temporarily .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 40.45 up +28 c ) .
The Crude bears once again took command on Friday .
They temporarily lost control late in the week but the black - stuff managed to retreat from its largest gain in 7 - weeks , as global equity indices declined on concern that the recession is deepening .
With the Dow closing at its lowest level in 12 - years , crude managed to pare 50 % of the previous dayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 14 % rally that was supported by a surprising US weekly inventory report .
Expecting stocks to rise for the 19th time in 21 - weeks the market rallied as supplies fell - 138 k barrels to +350.6 m last week vs. an anticipated increase of +3.2 m barrels .
It seemed finally that this years OPEC production cuts are making an impact .
Imports of crude declined - 859 k barrels a day to +8.79 m , the lowest level since Sept. 2008 .
But fundamental data and negative psyche can only weigh on energy prices once again as demand destruction dominates .
There will be no sustainable rally witnessed until we see global demand increase or inventory levels Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœconsistently Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ pared due to the OPEC production cuts .
Year - to - date , crude is down 20 % , for the past month speculators had bought into the theory that the substantial cuts undertaken by OPEC this year ( who represent 40 % of global supply ) will eventually curb these surplus global inventories and bolster prices .
A risk aversion strategy has investors looking a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstore of valueÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and buying the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as financials and global equities remain under pressure ( $ 980 ) .
Investors are gravitating towards precious metals as a safe heaven asset class .
The Nikkei closed 7,387 down - 28 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,087 up +73 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,936 up + 47 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 3 bp on Friday ( 2.79 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
With equity markets remaining under pressure , flight to quality is a necessity .
With another record amount of US FI product needed to be issued this week , the US would require higher yields to attract outside interest .
Expect to see traders to lean on the curve to absorb all the issues .
The US treasury plans to sell $ 40 b 2 - ys , a record $ 32 b of 5 - ys notes and a record $ 22 b of 7 - ys notes .
The total of $ 94 b exceeds the previous record of $ 78 b in a week in late Jan !

Will the public be kept in the paper ages while the EU institutions move on to a modern electronic administration ?
This is just one of the serious questions raised in the fight to maintain European citizens ' right to information .
A heavy duty to save what can still be salvaged rests upon the European Parliament which will vote on the issue on Wednesday ( 11 March ) .
European Union has had transparency legislation since 2001 , known as regulation 1049 /01 to those following the issue closely .
It is one of the most modern laws of its kind worldwide , guaranteeing European citizens and residents a good overview and option to scrutinise their administration .
Thanks to strong case - law in recent years , the way the law is put into practice is developing well .
And there is an intense interest among citizens to use it , proven , for example , by the number of cases on the matter received by the European Ombudsman .
However , a draft proposal , disguised as a reform of the law , has been put forward which seriously threatens to roll back the developing transparency .
The dangers of this proposal have not just been raised by journalists and activists but by no less than seven European ministers last week .
Access to electronically stored information
But let 's have a look at what is at stake - particularly concerning access to electronically stored information .
The current law from 2001 goes as follows :
- ‘ Document ' shall mean any content whatever its medium ( written on paper or stored in electronic form or as a sound , visual or audiovisual recording ) concerning a matter relating to the policies , activities and decisions falling within the institution 's sphere of responsibility .
Any content whatever its medium with the explicit mentioning of electronic formats must mean that the 2001 regulation included exactly that :
Any content whatever its medium .
This is an extremely modern piece of legislation for times when our administrations are rapidly moving into using modern systems .
This is , of course , natural and right , citizens and taxpayers deserve and need nothing but an efficient administration .
So , one would have thought that there is no point in changing the most modern wording on transparency worldwide .
But the draft new regulation does exactly that , suggesting narrowing down the scope of citizens access to electronically stored information .
The attempt to limit citizens access by using the modernisation of the administration as argument against the right to access is not new – neither in the European Union nor in several of its member states .
On farm subsidies , the politically sensitive issue of revealing who gets what EU farm money , the Commission argued that member state documents once sent to the EU database in Brussels could not be accessed anymore , unless they were accessible via a ' routine operation ' – a new practice , the Commission had developed .
Crucial vote
Now this practice is intended to be codified in the reform draft of the access to documents legislation .
The draft , which is being proposed for vote on Wednesday , unfortunately takes on board the Commission 's new idea of only including electronically stored content , if there are available tools to retrieve them at hand .
If this idea sees the light of day , the transparency ideal will have been given up for modern administration .
There is reason for slight optimism due to some of the adjustments , originally suggested by the Ombudsman and implemented into the report .
The council of ministers , who also has to vote on the reform , is split on the matter and the pro-transparency countries will not necessarily win .
This means the Parliament 's treatment of the issue is of even greater importance .
Its vote will be crucial in order to save transparency as we know it and to safeguard citizens access to information for the future .

What a difference five years make .
The morning after the previous European elections , the UK Independence Party ( Ukip ) was emerging as a significant force , the third - biggest British political troop in Europe .
The television chatshow host Robert Kilroy - Silk had helped propel the party to 2.7 million votes – 16 per cent of the poll .
Twelve European Parliament seats ( and the very mention of the party 's name ) provoked real fear as well as loathing among senior figures in the then - embattled Conservative Party , gripped by the prospect that Ukip could threaten their core vote .
Senior Tories shudder no longer .
As Ukip prepares last - ditch defences ahead of this June 's Euro elections , the party has been dogged by scandal and infighting .
Mr Kilroy - Silk has long departed in acrimony and the current leader , Nigel Farage , has faced bitter recriminations over the party 's direction as it enters polls that will determine whether it continues to exist as a serious political unit .

The party has garnered only between 1 and 2 per cent of voters ' support in recent polling , although the only poll of Euro election voting intentions did put its support at 7 per cent .
Its party conference in September was overshadowed by reports of plotting , intrigue and extraordinary internal feuds .
In September , The Independent revealed that the party 's press officer , Annabelle Fuller , had resigned after receiving phone threats .
Senior Tories breathed sighs of relief as they watched the events in Bournemouth unfold .
The Ukip website boasts of the party 's antics in the European Parliament last month , where MEPs sang the national anthem out of tune to disrupt their colleagues ' rendition of the EU " anthem " , Beethoven 's " Ode to Joy " .
They have blamed the part - privatisation of the Royal Mail on EU directives and linked increases in the rat population to European recycling targets .
Yesterday , the former One Man and His Dog presenter Robin Page announced his resignation from the party , claiming his former colleagues were " in the process of imploding " .
He accused Mr Farage of despotic tendencies and obtaining " almost complete centralised power of Ukip " .
( Mr Farage says constitutional changes passed earlier this year were a " tidying - up operation " and accuses Mr Page of sour grapes . )
Earlier this month , the economist Professor Tim Congdon quit to rejoin the Conservatives .
Mr Farage has also faced attacks from two senior figures expelled from the party 's national executive amid a row over reforms to its constitution , with his critics taking to the blogosphere to vent their spleens .
Meanwhile , Ukip 's membership has fallen from a peak of 26,000 to about 15,000 .
Donations last year reached £ 200,000 , sharply down on the £ 377,000 raised in 2007 , although the party says it has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds this year in preparation for the June ballots .
Ukip is defending nine of the 12 seats it won in 2004 .
Mr Kilroy - Silk quit to form his own Veritas party , Ashley Mote was expelled after being arrested for benefit fraud , while Tom Wise was suspended after being investigated by EU anti-fraud watchdogs .
Mr Farage admitted that the June elections represent a crucial test for his party .
But he insisted that Ukip could maintain or even exceed its 2004 high water mark .
He said his opponents were " middle - aged , elderly men diametrically opposed to many of the things I stand for " .
He added : " I think the party has changed .
It is much more diverse in terms of its ethnic mix .
It has been seen as a bank of angry old men from the rugby club .
That situation is very different now . "
The Ukip peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch , who caused a storm by inviting the right - wing Dutch MP Geert Wilders to the House of Lords to screen a controversial anti-Islam film , insisted that he supported Mr Farage but admitted the party faced internal challenges to his leadership .
" I think most of the real people in the party have not got time for all this internal sniping and plotting , " he said .
" They spent quite a lot of time lining me up as the next leader .
I think they are bonkers . "
Ukip will launch its
Euro election campaign next month under the slogan " Lend us your Vote " , an attempt to persuade voters to abandon their traditional loyalties for the day and make the poll a referendum on the EU .
Mr Farage takes comfort from a YouGov poll on European Parliament voting intentions for the Taxpayers '
Alliance earlier this year , which put Ukip on 7 per cent , still far below the 16 per cent high of 2004 .
But a string of national polls put Ukip support at between 1 and 2 per cent – which would be enough to make it electorally significant in a handful of areas .
Today Ukip must fight a revitalised
Tory party challenging Labour over the economy , not the demoralised opposition of five years ago .
Labour MEPs believe Ukip will retain three of their nine seats , while senior Tories have not yet written the party off , believing that concerns over immigration and arguments about British jobs could drive some voters into their arms .
Last year 's local elections showed Ukip considerably weaker than four years previously , when the poll coincided with the Euro elections : the party managed just 1.9 per cent of the poll in the London Assembly list election , compared with 8.4 per cent .
But Professor John Curtice , of Strathclyde University , believes it is too soon to write off Ukip entirely , pointing out that the jobs dispute speaks to the party 's anti-EU agenda .
" I am surprised that we are all assuming they will not do terribly well , " he said .
" The small parties are still registering in the polls .
European elections are Ukip 's forte . "
Sailing stones , fire rainbows , red tides and blue holes … were just the beginning .
Imagine sidestepping a house - sized hole in the ground as it forms around you in seconds , walking through a field of razor - sharp ice spikes taller than yourself or fleeing from a deadly vortex of smoke and flame far more dangerous than the raging fire that spawned it .
From light pillars and sun dogs to firewhirls and sinkholes , here are seven more beautiful , terrifying and awe - inspiring natural wonders of the world .
Sinkholes

Sinkholes are one of the world ’s scariest natural phenomena .
Over time , water erodes the soil under the planet ’s surface until – in some cases quite suddenly – the land above gives way and collapses into the earth .
Many sinkholes occur naturally while others are the result of human intervention .
Displacing groundwater can open cavities while broken pipes can erode otherwise stable subterranean sediments .
Urban sinkholes – up to hundreds of feet deep – have formed and consumed parts of city blocks , sidewalks and even entire buildings .
Penitentes
( Images via Webshots , Diffendal and 8020internet )
Named after peak - hooded New Mexican monks ( lower right above ) , penitentes are dazzling naturally - forming ice blades that stick up at sharp angles toward the sun .
Rarely found except at high altitudes , they can grow up taller than a human and form in vast fields .
As ice melts in particular patterns , ‘ valleys ’ formed by initial melts leave ‘ mountains ’ in their wake .
Strangely , these formations ultimately slow the melting process as the peaks cast shadows on the deeper surfaces below and allow for winds to blow over the peaks , cooling them .
Lenticular Clouds

Ever wonder the truth about UFOs ?
Avoided by traditional pilots but loved by sailplane aviators , lenticular clouds are masses of cloud with strong internal uplift that can drive a motorless flyer to high elevations .
Their shape is quite often mistaken for a mysterious flying object or the artificial cover for one .
Generally , lenticular clouds are formed as wind speeds up while moving around a large land object such as a mountain .
Light Pillars
( Images via : Apod , Kulgun , Arborsci , Wikipedia and Wikipedia )
Light pillars appear as eerily upright luminous columns in the sky , beacons cast into the air above without an apparent source .
These are visible when light reflects just right off of ice crystals from either the sun ( as in the two top images above ) or from artificial ground sources such as street or park lights .
Despite their appearance as near - solid columns of light , the effect is entirely created by our own relative viewpoint .
Sundogs
( Images via : Icecube , Reflectiveimages , Wunderground , Andrill and Freewebs )
Like light pillars , sundogs are the product of light passing through crystals .
The particular shape and orientation of the crystals can have a drastic visual impact for the viewer , producing a longer tail and changing the range of colors one sees .
The relative height of the sun in the sky shifts the distance the sundogs appear to be on either side of the sun .
Varying climactic conditions on other planets in our solar system produce halos with up to four sundogs from those planets ’ perspectives .
Sundogs have been speculated about and discussed since ancient times and written records describing the various attributes of our sun date back the Egyptians and Greeks .
Fire Whirls
( Images via : Squidoo , USAToday , Fed and Humboldt )
Fire whirls ( also known as fire devils or tornadoes ) appear in or around raging fires when the right combination of climactic conditions is present .
Fire whirls can be spawned by other natural events such as earthquakes and thunderstorms – and can be incredibly dangerous , in some cases spinning well out of the zone of a fire itself to cause devastation and death in a radius not even reached by heat or flame .
Fire whirls have been known to be nearly a mile high , have wind speeds of over 100 miles per hour and to last for 20 or more minutes .
Orange Moons
This last phenomena is something most people have seen before – beautiful orange moon hanging low in the sky .
But what causes this phenomena – and , for that matter , does the moon have a color at all ?
When the moon appears lower on the horizon , rays of light bouncing off it have to pass through a great deal more of our atmosophere which slowly strips away everything but yellows , oranges and reds .
The bottommost image above is true to the hues of the moon but has enhanced colors to more clearly show the differences in shade that illustrate the mixed topography and minerology that tell the story of the moon ’s surface .
Looking at the colors in combination with the craters one can start to trace the history of impacts and consequent material movements across the face of our mysterios moon .

An eight - year old Saudi Arabian girl who was married off by her father to a 58 - year - old man has been told she cannot divorce her husband until she reaches puberty .
Lawyer Abdu Jtili said the divorce petition was filed by the unnamed girl 's divorced mother in August after the marriage contract was signed by her father and the groom .
" The judge has dismissed the plea because she [ the mother ] does not have the right to file , and ordered that the plea should be filed by the girl herself when she reaches puberty , " lawyer Abdullah Jtili told the AFP news agency .
The case was handled by a court in Qasim province , north of the Saudi capital Riyadh .
The girl does not know she is married , said Jtili , adding that he will appeal .
In many child marriages , girls are given away to older men in return for dowries or following the custom by which a father promises his daughters and sons to marriage while still children .
But the issue is complicated by different interpretations of sharia law and a lack of legal certainty .
" There is confusion in Saudi Arabia over the fundamental question of what constitutes adulthood , " said Clarisa Bencomo of Human Rights Watch .
" There is also vast judicial discretion . "
The case appears to fit a pattern of divorced fathers using their children to take revenge against their ex-wives .
Mothers usually only have custody while the children are young .
Relatives said the marriage had not been consummated and that the girl was still living with her mother .
They said that the father had set a verbal condition by which the marriage was not to be consummated until the girl turns 18 - although it was unclear how this could be enforced .
The father agreed to marry off his daughter for a dowry of 30,000 riyals ( £ 5,400 ) as he was facing financial problems .
Bencomo dismissed the idea that the girl would be able to file for divorce once she reached puberty since there was no standard definition of this .
In addition , Saudi judges often insist that even adult women speak to them through a male guardian or lawyer .
No figures are available for the number of arranged marriages involving pre-adolescents in Saudi Arabia , where the strictly conservative Wahhabi version of Sunni Islam holds sway and polygamy is common .
But human rights groups say they are aware of many such cases .
Senior clerics , including Sheikh Abdul - Aziz Al - Sheikh , the kingdom 's grand mufti , have denounced child marriage .
But it is still prevalent in conservative areas .
The Shura council recently defined adulthood as starting at age 18 but objections prevented it from being ratified as required by the council of ministers .

One of President Obama 's campaign promises last year was that he would stop the DEA 's cruel and senseless raids on medical marijuana clinics .
But less than two weeks after he took office , such raids had already been conducted on two occasions , hitting several clinics in the Los Angeles area this month .
We are hoping this is just Bush administration holdovers at work , and an administration spokesperson yesterday had encouraging words to this effect in the media -- change is coming on this issue , the Obama administration says .
Follow the link below to our feature report to read more .
In the meanwhile , patients and the people who serve them are being subjected to continued injustice .
Please click here to e-mail President Obama and Attorney General Eric
Holder to ask them to take action now to stop the raids sooner rather than later .

A major global drugs kingpin has agreed a plea bargain in the United States after admitting conspiracy to distribute millions of dollars worth of ecstasy .
But who is this man of mystery who faces spending 10 years in jail ?
Ricardo Fanchini , pictured at a party in Moscow , faces 10 years in jail
He might not be a household name , but Ricardo Fanchini is one of the world 's most well - connected gangsters , with mobster friends as far afield as Moscow , New York , London , Antwerp , Naples , Poland and Israel .
" He was like the CEO of crime and used to organise crime summits in Austria , where people from the Camorra [ Neapolitan mafia ] , the Colombian cartels , the Russian mafia , met up and divided up the world , " said a Belgian reporter who has investigated Fanchini for years but does not wish to be identified .
Born in 1956 in the industrial city of Katowice in southern Poland to a Polish mother and an Italian father who had himself grown up in the mafia - infested city of Naples , Fanchini fled to the West in 1977 , settling first in Germany and eventually moving to the Belgian port of Antwerp .

But he was one of several gangsters who returned to the East in the early 1990s to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of communism and became known as the Polish Al Capone .
Polish journalist Jaroslaw Jakimczyk told the BBC : " He was one of the most dynamic of that group in the 1990s , and was linked with the Pruszkow Gang . "
The Pruszkow Gang dominated Polish organised crime , being responsible for the trade in drugs , stolen luxury cars from Germany and black - market vodka .
Import - export business
Although their power was broken and most are now in jail or dead , Fanchini continued to prosper , partly because of his connections to Russian mafia bosses including Semion Mogilevich , who was a guest at his wedding , and arms smuggler Viktor Bout .
He and his Russian partner , Boris " Biba " Nayfeld , set up an import - export business that traded in everything from cigarettes and chocolates to electronic goods .
He also benefited from a tax exemption , for the importation of vodka into Russia , granted by corrupt officials close to the then President Boris Yeltsin .
At the time he also bought a luxury yacht , the Kremlin Princess , and often turned up in Monte Carlo .
Mobster Semion Mogilevich was a guest at Fanchini 's first wedding But Fanchini lost powerful friends when Yeltsin left office , his company went bankrupt and he was prosecuted by the Belgian authorities for embezzlement and money laundering .
While in prison serving a four - year sentence , Fanchini was dealt a further blow when a huge consignment of drugs was seized by the Dutch police .
The 1.8 million ecstasy pills , weighing 424kg , were destined for sale to the US market , where Fanchini and Nayfeld had links with the Russian community in the Brighton Beach district of Brooklyn , New York .
Living in London
When Fanchini left prison he moved to London .
In 2006 he hired out the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Berlin for a sumptuous party and followed it up with another bash in Moscow , which was attended by hundreds of gangsters as well as celebrities and legitimate businessmen .
But Fanchini was living on borrowed time .
In England he reportedly split his time between a Mayfair townhouse and a plush mansion in a gated community in Surrey , not far from the home of Formula One driver Jensen Button .
But the US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) caught up with him and on the morning of 3 October 2007 officers from the Metropolitan Police 's Extradition and International Assistance Unit knocked on the door of his townhouse in Mount Street .
He was using the name Ricardo Rotmann , which was the surname of his third wife , Katja , a German , with whom he has a child .
Fanchini had been identified by various European law enforcement agencies as an international criminal for years
Michael Mukasey
US Attorney General
His second wife , Jolanta , is in prison in Belgium where she awaits trial over money laundering charges .
Fanchini made no attempt to fight extradition and in January last year he was handed over to US marshals at London 's Gatwick Airport .
He was due to go on trial later this year .
According to the indictment , Fanchini 's gang smuggled heroin and cocaine from Thailand to the US , via Poland and Belgium , for 17 years .
The drugs were hidden in the back of televisions and eventually found their way to Brighton Beach and Staten Island in New York .
But his attorney , Gerald Shargel , obtained a plea bargain and in November he pleaded guilty to a single charge - conspiring to distribute 424 kg of MDMA ( ecstasy ) - and he now faces 10 years in jail .
Journalist Vladimir Kozlovsky , who has covered the activities of the Russian mafia in New York for years , said : " The indictment was massive .
He was accused of a million crimes going back 20 years .
There were so many boxes of evidence that he had to have a separate cell to house it all .
" The trial was due to last at least four months so , like 90 % of cases over here , it was plea bargained and he could be out in seven years . "
Another former Fanchini associate , Viktor Bout , was arrested last year
But the DEA has also hit him hard financially .
Fanchini has agreed to forfeit $ 30 m - $ 2 m of which will have to be paid on the day of sentencing - and DEA officers have also seized more than 40 properties across the world with an estimated value of more than $ 67 m .
Nayfeld and two other co-defendants , Arthur and Nikolai Dozortsev , all pleaded guilty to laundering Fanchini 's money .
Speaking at the London School of Economics last year , the US Attorney General , Michael Mukasey , highlighted Fanchini as an example of close global co-operation in the fight against crime .
Still under investigation
He said : " Fanchini had been identified by various European law enforcement agencies as an international criminal for years .
" It took a lot of co-operation and co-ordination between the US , UK and other countries to bring about his arrest . "
Detective Inspector Paul Fuller , head of the Metropolitan Police 's Extradition Unit said : " We work tirelessly to ensure that those wanted for crimes are brought to the justice system .
It is important that Londoners know that we are arresting and extraditing foreign criminals on a daily basis . "
Dominique Reyniers , of the Belgian Justice Department , confirmed Fanchini was also the subject of a separate investigation into alleged money laundering in Antwerp .
It is thought that inquiry looked at property investments he made in the Ukrainian resort of Odessa .
Fanchini 's friends Mogilevich and Bout have both been arrested in the past year and he himself will be in his 60s by the time he comes out of jail in the US .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican on Friday rejected an apology from a bishop whose denial of the Holocaust caused international uproar between Jews and Catholics , saying it did not meet its demand for a full and public recanting .

Jewish groups praised the Vatican for its tough stand , which Vatican sources said will likely make it harder for the traditionalist bishop to be fully re-admitted into the Church and lead to greater scrutiny of the society to which he belongs .
British Bishop Richard Williamson , who was ordered to leave Argentina and is now in his homeland , on Thursday issued a statement in which he said , “ To all souls that took honest scandal from what I said , before God I apologize . ”
Chief Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said Williamson ’s statement “ does not seem to respect the conditions ” set forth by the Vatican on February 4 , when it ordered him to “ in an absolutely unequivocal and public way distance himself from his positions ” regarding the Holocaust .
On January 24 , Pope Benedict lifted the excommunications of Williamson and three other bishops to try to heal a 20 - year - old schism that began when they were thrown out of the Church for being ordained without the permission of Pope John Paul II .
Among those who condemned Williamson and the pope ’s decision were Holocaust survivors , progressive Catholics , members of the U.S. Congress , Israel ’s Chief Rabbinate , German Jewish leaders and Jewish writer and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel .
Williamson told Swedish television in an interview broadcast on January 21 , “ I believe there were no gas chambers . ”
He said no more than 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
In his statement on Thursday , Williamson said , “ I can truthfully say that I regret having made such remarks , and that if I had known beforehand the full harm and hurt to which they would give rise , especially to the Church , but also to survivors and relatives of victims of injustice under the Third Reich , I would not have made them . ”
JEWS SAY APOLOGY ‘EMPTY ’
Jewish groups praised the Vatican for not accepting Williamson ’s apology .
“ The Vatican clearly understands the critical issue here , ” said David A. Harris , executive director of the American Jewish Committee .
“ Williamson still refuses to acknowledge the Holocaust as a historical fact .
Until he explicitly says otherwise , he remains in the camp of the Holocaust deniers .
He is not fooling anyone , least of all the Vatican . ”
“ We commend the Vatican for standing firm and not permitting a person who believes that the Nazi Holocaust is a lie to have any role in the Church , ” said Rabbi Marvin Hier , founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center .
Even before the Vatican rejected Williamson ’s statement , Jewish groups branded his apology as shallow and empty .
“ As he clearly failed to retract his malicious lies , Williamson has again shown that he is a staunch anti-Semite and incorrigible Holocaust denier who doubts the genocide of six million Jewish people , ” said Charlotte Knobloch , President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany .
Williamson made his comments denying the Holocaust in Germany , where such comments are a crime .
Williamson arrived in Britain earlier this week after he was ordered to leave Argentina , where he was director of a seminary of the ultra- traditionalist Society of St. Pius X ( SSPX ) .
The controversy over Williamson ’s comments and the pope ’s decision to lift his excommunication led to the worst crisis in Catholic - Jewish relations in half a century .
On February 12 the pope , in an attempt to defuse the crisis , told Jewish leaders that “ any denial or minimization of this terrible crime is intolerable , ” especially from a clergyman .
The row over Williamson has led many to take a closer look at the SSPX , its view of Jews and its future in the Church .
The Vatican says that before the SSPX can be fully readmitted into the Church , its leaders and members must first accept the teachings of the 1962 - 1965 Second Vatican Council , which urged respect for Judaism and other religions .
A key Council document repudiated the concept of collective Jewish guilt for Christ ’s death .
Anti-Semitic attitudes still prevail in Europe : An Anti-Defamation League report published on Tuesday showed that nearly half of the Europeans surveyed believe Jews are not loyal to their country and more than one - third believe they have " too much power " in business and finance .
The study further showed that 31 % of the respondents across Europe blame Jews in the financial industry for the current global economic crisis .
Hatred ADL sees ' pandemic of anti-Semitism ' Reuters US Jewish leader Abraham Foxman says Israel 's military offensive in Gaza answered with hatred , attacks against Jews ' from Austria to Zimbabwe . '
Civilized world must stand up and say ' No ' to condemn ' this vicious , hideous violence , ' he adds ADL sees ' pandemic of anti-Semitism '
The poll was conducted between the dates December 1 and January 13 among 3,500 adults in seven European countries : Austria , France , Hungary , Poland , Germany , Spain and the United Kingdom .
Overall , 40 % of Europeans in those countries believe that Jews have too much power in the business world , with more than half of Hungarian , Spanish and Polish respondents agreeing with that statement .
The findings were similar to those of a 2007 ADL survey that found significant percentages of Europeans continue to believe in some of the most pernicious anti-Semitic stereotypes .
" This poll confirms that anti-Semitism remains alive and well in the minds of many Europeans , " said ADL Director Abraham Foxman .
" It is distressing that there seems to be no movement away from the constancy of anti-Semitic held views , with accusations about Jews of disloyalty , control and responsibility for the death of Jesus , " he added .
" In the wake of the global financial crisis , the strong belief of excessive Jewish influence on business and finance is especially worrisome , " Mr. Foxman added .
" Clearly , age old anti-Semitic stereotypes die hard , particularly on a continent which is witnessing a surge in violent attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions following the war in Gaza . "
' Jews talk about Holocaust too much '
A comparison with the 2007 survey indicates that levels of anti-Semitism have remained steady in six of the seven countries tested .
The United Kingdom was the only country in which there was a marked decline .
Meanwhile , the percentage of those believing that Jews " have too much power in the business world " increased by 7 % in Hungary , 6 % in Poland and 5 % in France .
Overall , nearly half of those surveyed in the seven countries believe that Jews are more loyal to Israel than to their own country .
A majority of respondents in Germany , Poland and Spain believe that this statement is " probably true ; " in Spain , it is 64 % .
Large portions of the European public continue to believe that Jews " talk about the Holocaust too much . "
Overall , 44 % of those surveyed believe this statement is " probably true " .
A majority of respondents in Austria , Hungary and Poland believe it to be true .

We ’ve all heard about Dwight D. Eisenhower ’s warning to us about the “ military industrial complex ” .
It ’s practically iconic .
But what I did n’t know was that same farewell speech contained a second warning , one that hints at our current situation with such figures as Dr. James Hansen .
This is from the blog “ Big Hollywood ”
It ’s worth a read .

Ike ’s Not So Famous Second Warning
by Dwight Schultz “ Big Hollywood blog ”
On Saturday January 17 , 2009 , during the Fox 4 0 ′ clock news hour , Shepard Smith recalled the anniversary of President Eisenhower ’s famous 1961 farewell address to the nation , but he only mentioned one of Ike ’s threat warnings , the one that reminded us to beware of the “ Military Industrial Complex . ”
This warning came from a military man , so it ’s been a turn of phrase that slobbers off the lips of suspicious lefty infants shortly after they ’re forced to abandon the nipple and accept Marx .
So I shouted at Shepard , “ What ’s wrong with threat number two , you big beautiful blue eyed capitalist !
What ’s wrong with Fox News and your staff ?
There are only two warnings in that speech for God ’s sake , if you ’re going to honor a historical document maybe somebody could at least read it , and maybe for once in almost fifty years remind us of Ike ’s second warning : “ … that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific - technological elite . ”
Does anything come immediately to mind when you read that ?
Ike goes on , “ … Partly because of the huge costs involved , a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity . ”
And , “ The prospect of domination of the nation ’s scholars by Federal employment , project allocations , and the power of money is ever present – and is gravely to be regarded . ”
Do you think Ike was warning us that politicians like Al Gore and Barack Obama could cuddle with the scientific technological elite alike and , oh , I do n’t know , maybe get behind Obama ’s plan to tax your breath ?
Do you think that perhaps some time in the near future you might not be considered a person but a carbon footprint … does something like that sound ridiculous ?
Have you seen how fast Obama has placed environmental academic hysterics and socialists in positions of real power ?
Steven Chu , John Holdren , Carol Browner and others are there to see to it that every exhaust in your life is a financial event favorable to the government .
So how is it that one of Ike ’s warnings became famous and the other a historical ghost note ?
Above : Watch Ike ’s farewell address in its entirety , 46 minutes
It ’s really not hard to grasp .
Our educational institutions monitor and control historical information and also educate and train the future guardians of public discourse — the indispensable journalists we read , see , and hear every day .
By definition both the media and our nation ’s scholars digest information and parcel it out in what should be an honest and thoughtful way .
They digested Ike ’s warning about the military and saw fit to warn us 10 billion times that the military is bad and needs to be feared and pushed off campus .
They digested Ike ’s warning about universities , scholars , federal money , science and policy , then gave it to Helen Thomas to scatter on some hot house tomatoes in the Nevada desert .
It does n’t get any simpler .
Think about this :
How many times have you heard that the debate over anthropogenic global warming has ended ?
When and where was this debate ?
The mere recitation of the words , “ the debate has ended ” closed the discussion without you having ever heard it because , get it !
It ’s ended !
Get It !
Neat trick !
Gore says the debate has ended ….
McCain says the debate has ended … Obama says the debate has ended … Hanson says the debate has ended , and no one in the media wants to ask , “ What debate ? ”
When ?
Where ?
Was there a scientific or political debate … or , God forbid , both , and who was for and who was against ?
Gore ’s film “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” has by now been proven to be almost a 100 % big fat lie , and yet there is no media outcry against it or price for Gore to pay because he is supporting the scientific technological elite who want to hold public policy captive to the carbon tax that Socialists and Democrats have wanted since the 1992 Rio summit .
This is a clear example of years of liberal bias in protective favor of the university media structure .
It just takes a lot of repetition and a strong ideological preference for saying : American military bad !
American university good !
CO2 bad !
Tax our breath !
Raise the tuition !
Kick the Marines off campus !
Long live man made global warming and the tax dollars we shall inherit from it .
STING shall be our band and “ Every Breath You Take ” shall be our song … revenue streams for eternity .
Repeat after me this slogan … or , if you would rather stick this on the backside of your transportation vehicle , please do and remember , paying higher taxes is patriotic , so breathe baby , breathe for your country , just do n’t breathe behind our back and not let us see you , ‘ cause we ’re talk ’n money now , baby !
The debate has ended !
… Hmmm ?
Warning number two ?
What warning ?
Oh , you mean the military thing ?
We ’ve taken care of that .
Here ’s Matt Damon ’s number , he ’ll tell you all about it .
He went to Harvard you know .
Remember , be upscale , do n’t listen to Rush Limbaugh , breathe !
And did I tell you to pay your taxes and act patriotic , especially when they ’re going up ?
Gotta run , I ’m meeting Tom Daschle , Laurie David , Tyrano - Soros and secretary Geithner for lunch .

In investigating yesterday 's blazes , Gessner 's " name came up very early , " Chitwood said .
He said she was known to hang out at a Wawa store at Burmont and Garrett Roads .
Police went there and , on video , observed her buying coffee and cigarettes and singing the song .
Enjoyable as it was , the Maoist ritual humiliation of bankers by the House of Commons Treasury committee raised more questions than it answered .
Our elected legislators may not want to ask what responsibility they themselves bear for the economic catastrophe , but we can .
And we can ask the same question about other public disasters , above all a needless and illegal war .
That 's easily and specifically answered .
There are 14 members of the Treasury committee , all but three of whom voted for the Iraq war in the crucial division of March 2003 .
All the Tories voted for the war , as did seven out of eight Labour MPs , including John McFall , who chairs the committee .
The three who voted against were the two Lib Dems - Colin Breed and Lord Thurso - and Jim Cousins , a token Labour rebel .
Token is the word : these committees are closely invigilated by the whips ' offices , with membership a reward for loyalty .
And of course the home secretary also voted for the war .
In the Observer , Catherine Bennett has just reminded any feminists who might be pleased to see a record number of women in the cabinet that every one of them supported the war , including Jacqui Smith .
She is in trouble at present , quite rightly - and there could just be a connection between her curious expenses claims and her endorsement of the war .
Whatever boasts are made about the democratisation of Iraq , the sixth anniversary of the invasion next month will be a bleak landmark in the decay of our parliamentary democracy , closely linked with the institutionalisation and professionalisation of politics over the past century .
In two years comes another anniversary - the payment of MPs , which began in 1911 ( all of £ 400 a year then ) .
Nowadays
MPs like to complain they are n't paid enough , and it has been argued that they might be better remunerated while becoming purely full - time .
And yet paying MPs has led , in a fine case of unintended consequences , to the evolution of a class of professional , albeit mediocre , politician - and we have become demonstrably much worse governed as a result .
It might seem facetious or cranky to suggest that paying MPs was a mistake , but consider this : if members of parliament were not paid , we would not have gone to war in Iraq .
Since 1911 , professionalisation has gathered pace .
A hundred years ago , MPs were n't paid ; 60 years ago they had no expenses apart from postage ; 40 years ago not one MP in 10 employed a secretary or researcher .
MPs will say that their work has become more onerous , but this is true only in terms of the pernicious " constituency business " to which they devote far too much time , while they devote far too little to what they should be doing - and while , frankly , they feather their nests .
The thick skin of bankers who pocket bonuses from the taxpayer has been matched by politicians , with their lavish expenses , John Lewis lists and infamous pensions that , unlike most people 's , are secure against the financial calamity over which parliament has presided .
Derek Conway 's illicit scam was disgusting , but what 's licit is almost worse .
Ordinary voters , Labour and Tory alike , have been repelled by Smith 's specious " second home " arrangement .
In any other business , to claim that a bedroom in your sister 's house was your principal residence would look dishonest .
Now Smith digs a deeper hole by telling us that she did n't actually claim the full second - home allowance - which turns out to mean that the £ 116,000 she received was all of £ 58 short of the maximum entitlement .
And parliament , far from doing a better job , does a worse job with every year that passes .
That means everything from hopelessly inadequate scrutiny of bad legislation to passivity in the face of a great assault on civil liberties - including the practice of torture , as the case of Binyam Mohamed reminds us - and support for a war that most Labour MPs in their hearts did n't want .
Six years ago a loyalist who disliked the approaching war wrote in these pages that , although Tony Blair might be exaggerating the case for war , that 's what governments do when wars begin .
This was revealing , because it was entirely untrue .
British governments have historically exaggerated the case for peace .
Aberdeen hated the Crimean war that began when he was prime minister ; Salisbury was n't much keener on the Boer war ; and twice in the last century we entered great wars with the deepest reluctance , on the part of the Asquith cabinet in 1914 and , more notoriously , Chamberlain 's in 1939 .
It was parliament " speaking for England " that forced Chamberlain 's hand .
What has changed over the last century is the ever - increasing strength of the executive , and the biddable servility of the Commons , a fact that can be dramatically illustrated .
Since MPs were first paid in 1911 , just two governments have fallen as a result of parliamentary votes : Ramsay MacDonald 's first Labour government in 1924 - in any case a minority administration living on suffrance - and James Callaghan 's Labour government in 1979 , which had seen its Commons majority in effect evaporate .
Now go back a hundred years in the opposite direction from 1911 , and recall that every British government between 1837 and 1874 fell following a Commons vote .
That happened again in 1886 and 1895 .
Political conditions were different , and politicians drawn from a narrow elite .
All the same , there really was a golden age of parliamentary government , when the Commons was the master of the ministry - rather than the other way round , as now .
And that was connected with the fact that for most MPs politics was not a " job " that they lived in dread of losing .
They were almost light - heartedly ready to bring down governments , and they would unquestionably never have voted for a war they did n't really believe in .
Ending the payment of MPs is perhaps too much to hope for .
As it happens , payment was one of the Chartists ' demands in the 1840s , all of which , from equal constituencies to manhood suffrage , were eventually met , with one exception - annual parliaments .
But why not ?
To elect the Commons every year would encourage a much greater turnover ; ordinary men and women would be able to sit for a term or two ; the institutionalisation of the political class would be halted .
Here 's a slogan for our age : give politics back to the people !

She also blogs at Girl , Interrupting about science , politics and other things that come to mind .
I have worked in many areas of science , from conservation field biology to condensed matter physics .
The single most common questions I have been asked across all disciplines are ‘ Why is this important ? ’ , ‘ Why should I care ? ’ or even sometimes ‘ Why do my taxes pay for this ? ’
We live in a technological age where there is often a misconception about the difference between science and technology and this is one of the sources of the question ‘ Why is this useful ?’.
Societally we , perhaps , see things as useful only if they improve our lives in the short term : a bigger faster computer , a cure to cancer , a cheaper faster way to deliver electricity .
Often what is missing in this in this picture is the science that goes on behind it .
Scientific progress is not linear and not very predictable , and is not connected with technology in a straight - forward manner .
We know so little about the natural and physical world around us and science is a way to answer these questions one tiny step at at time .
As scientists on a fundamental level , we increase , albeit very slowly , the knowledge of the world , which is , in its on right a beautiful and useful thing .
And important leaps forward that do change our lives often occur as an off - shoot of science .
All technology is based on science .
And the way that science evolves to technology is always a variegated path .
Without Thomson searching for fundamental components of atoms and discovering the electron , we would n’t have electronics .
Without Tim Berners - Lee we would n’t have the internet communication we find so useful today .
Thomson was n’t looking at making a model cell phone and Tim Berners - Lee was a CERN physicist that was only concerned with sharing data between scientists at different places around the world .
But look at the benefits .
Even if you try to do directed research to build technology , the structure of science is such that ‘ discoveries ’ come from the most unexpected places .
And this is , in part , why I am fascinated by science and why , even on the smallest level , it ’s a part of being human .
Humans have the capacity to ask WHY ?
Even the question of why is this important ?
is reflective of this and science is one way of answering the question why ?
about the physical and natural world .
And that is a an amazing , uniquely human thing .
Landmark agreement by 35 villages secures first first national conservation for PNG
Home to numerous endemic species and some of the Asia ’s last intact tropical forests , Papua New Guinea has created its first national conservation area .
Unique in structure , the park is owned by 35 surrounding indigenous villages which have agreed unanimously to prohibit hunting , logging , mining , and other development within the park .
The villages have also created a community organization that will oversee management of the park .
The 10,000 villagers found partners in Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle , Conservation International , and National Geographic .
The conservation organizations spent twelve years working with locals and the Papua New Guinea government to establish the YUS Conservation Area .
The reserve is an acronym named after three major rivers that run through it , the Yopno , Uruwa , and Som of the Huon Peninsula .

“ Creating this conservation area is a step forward for both Papua New Guinea and conservation worldwide , ” said Dr. Lisa Dabek , field conservation director at Woodland Park Zoo .
“ What we have accomplished here is more than just an act of environmental preservation – it ’s a sustainable model for community - based conservation that works . ”
Dabek first came to Papua New Guinea to study the endangered Matischie ’s tree kangaroo .
Heading up the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program ( TKCP ) out of Woodland Park Zoo , Dabek worked with locals to map the species ’ habitat .
Gaining the trust of local landowners , Dabek began to push forward with efforts to establish habitat protection for the tree kangaroo and other species .
All rural land in Papua New Guinea is owned by villages or landowners , not the government , which has made establishing national reserves impossible until now .
Dabek convinced the villages and other landowners to set aside portions of land for conservation until they had accumulated 187,800 acres of pristine forest .

In return for their generosity , TKCP is working with the villages to increase access to education and improve community health care .
TKCP will also work directly with the communities ’ management organization for the YUS Conservation Area .
Stretching from the northern coast of Papua New Guinea to the western Saruwaged Mountains , the park is slightly larger than the island - nation of Dominica and home to many more vulnerable and endangered species than Matschie ’s tree kangaroo , including the long - beaked echidna , New Guinea harpy eagle , New Guinea pademelon , the dwarf cassowary , and Salvadori ’s teal .
Two endemic species include a bird of paradise , called the Huon astrapia , and a species of honeyeater , Huon melidectes .
“ By creating the country ’s first national conservation area , the PNG government and people have established a much - needed safe zone for the irreplaceable biodiversity it contains , ” said Dabek .
“ Just as important , the protected area will contribute to long - term efforts to address the climate change threat by preserving critical forest habitat . ”
It is estimated that the protected tropical forest stores 13 million tons of carbon .

The park is an important symbol of Papua New Guinea ’s commitment to conservation , since the country ’s ecosystems have been devastated by deforestation .
In just thirty years Papua New Guinea has lost 15 percent of its forest due to logging , according to a report appearing in Biotropica .
The report , showing that Papua New Guinea was losing forest far faster than expected , astounded conservationists .
In addition , the report showed that 9 percent of forests in Papua New Guinea had been degraded in the same period .
According to the International Herald Tribue the majority of the logging out of Papua New Guinea ends up in China where it is made into flooring and furniture to feed the demand for cheap wood products in America and Europe .
The logging is mostly undertaken by Malaysian firms , some of which have been caught bribing government officials and underpaying local landowners .
Environmentalists hope that the YUS Conservation Area will begin a new pattern in Papua New Guinea — and around the world .

“ This new conservation area shows how much good can be accomplished when governments and people work together , ” said Conservation International President Russell A. Mittermeier , who visited the area last year .
“ Hopefully , other tropical forest nations will follow this example of simultaneously combating climate change and conserving the ecosystems on which people depend , and the international community will embrace a climate change treaty that compensates the carbon sequestration value of such protected forests . ”
Conservation International and TKCP plan to keep working with the government and local communities to create more conservation areas in the country .
With YUS as a model , the task may be far easier this time around .

Police arrested the former manager of Sen. John McCain ’s Pueblo presidential campaign office Wednesday on charges he sexually assaulted a 5 - year - old boy left in his care so the boy ’s mother could attend a rally for McCain ’s running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , The Denver Post ’s Howard Pankratz reported Thursday afternoon .
It ’s the second arrest on charges of sexual assault on a child by a person in position of trust in a week for Jeffrey Claude Bartleson , 52 , who has faced similar allegations at least five times since 1982 without being convicted of a crime , according to the Pueblo Chieftain ’s Nick Bonham .
Two detectives have been assigned full - time to the investigation and are looking into allegations Bartleson lured victims through church groups , his work as a sponsor at a hospital drug rehab unit , and during involvement in political work .
Bartleson listed his occupation as “ political consultant ” at the Pueblo County Jail , the Chieftain reported , but state Republican groups were quick to distance themselves from him .
Bartleson indeed ran the McCain office in Pueblo and directed the Republican nominee ’s southern Colorado campaign , the chairman of the Pueblo County Republican Party told Pankratz , but does n’t hold an official party position and had only attended a few GOP meetings .
The state Republican Party told Pankratz they had had “ no contact ” with Bartleson .
In an arrest affidavit , one alleged victim said Bartleson was “ wearing clothes the same as John McCain , ” the Chieftain reported .
After reading about Bartleson ’s arrest last week , a McCain campaign worker from Pueblo contacted police and said she believed her son had been assaulted by Bartleson in October when the boy spent the night at Bartleson ’s house .
Pankratz reports :
According to the woman , she and a co-worker were planning in October to attend a Sarah Palin rally in Colorado Springs but wanted to travel to the Springs the night before .
She told police that she mentioned the planned trip to Bartleson .
He offered to keep her 5 - year - old son overnight in Pueblo and then drive up to Colorado Springs the next day and meet them there .
She accepted Bartleson ’s offer .
The woman said that her son told her that while at Bartleson ’s home , Bartleson insisted on giving him a bath , during which he was sexually molested .
Later , said the child , Bartleson forced him into Bartleson ’s bed , where he once again was molested .
In interviews this week with investigators , the child said that when he tried to get away from Bartleson , he kept pulling him back into the bed .
He was finally able to leave when Bartleson fell asleep .
The boy told police that “ Mr. Jeff ” told him he had done the same things to five others , according to an arrest affidavit cited by Pankratz .
Court documents filed after his arrest last week describe interviews with witnesses and other possible victims , including boys Bartleson met when he worked with the chemical dependency unit at the Parkview Medical Center and as a youth counselor at King of Kings Lutheran Church .
One alleged victim told police Bartleson said “ if he tells anyone about him touching him then he will murder him . ”
Bartleson is being held in lieu of $ 300,000 bond in the Pueblo County Jail , officials said .

“ Welcome to a world without rules . ”
Whether you are an avid fan of the Batman franchise , a casual summer moviegoer , or someone curious about the performance of a young actor gone far too soon , rest assured , you will not leave the theater disappointed .
You will , however , likely leave the theater mesmerized by a film , and a performance , that will be talked about for a very long time to come .
With director Christopher Nolan once again at the helm , “ The Dark Knight ” picks up pretty much where “ Batman Begins ” left off .
However , with the story of Bruce Wayne ’s transformation into the Caped Crusader taken care of in the first film , Nolan throws us right into the action this time and does n’t let up for the film ’s two - and - a - half hour running time .
As the film opens , the criminals of Gotham City are facing an enemy as intimidating as Batman in District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) , who makes strong efforts to rid the city of the filth it has become accustomed to .
Batman has slowed down his crime fighting efforts , due in large part to copy - bats who attempt to imitate his style .
The public is in an uproar , believing these phony heroes are actually causing more harm than good .
Batman , they deduce , must be the responsible party and therefore demand him captured and “ demasked ” to put an end to the vigilante brand of crime fighting .
But one person in particular is extra keen on the idea of Batman revealing his true identity , and has made it his goal to see that it happens .
We are introduced to this man , The Joker ( Heath Ledger ) , nearly right away , as he orchestrates a multi- faceted bank heist with a chilling nonchalance .
It means very little to him to take the lives of his victims , or his henchmen for that matter , and he leaves a long trail of bodies in his wake .
As the crime bosses of Gotham feel the heat coming from three different sources — Batman , Harvey Dent , and Lt. Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) — they are forced to seek the help of The Joker , who is more than willing to take on Gotham ’s finest single - handedly .
What makes
The Joker a far more dangerous villain than any Gotham has ever seen is the way he appears to fly by the seat of his purple pants , but has strung together an ingenious , diabolical master plan that will test the resolve , and dedication , of everyone who hopes to stop him .
The Joker is n’t out to gain anything in particular , which makes him all the more terrifying .
As Batman ’s trusty butler Alfred ( Michael Caine ) warns , ' Some men just want to see the world burn . '
The content of “ The Dark Knight ” is far darker than the already bleak “ Batman Begins , ” and Christian parents should use caution in whether or not to allow children or younger , impressionable teenagers to see the film .
The violence is heavy handed , and far more ruthless than in the original .
Frankly , The Joker makes The Scarecrow from “ Batman Begins ” look like a Saturday morning amateur .
The Joker maims and kills without remorse , and one of the very first scenes features a “ disappearing pencil ” trick that is stunning in its quick brutality .
The mood is dreary , which we expect from Batman movies , but Harvey Dent explains to us “ It ’s always darkest before the dawn . ”
Well , the rising sun is still a long way off for Gotham , and caution is urged for parents wondering whether to expose their children to that darkness .
There is very little profanity in the film , much less than the first film , and practically no sexual content ( some women are seen lounging in their bathing suits on Bruce ’s boat , but the camera is on them for a minuscule amount of time ) , but the violence more than makes up for what other content is left out .
The film hits on all sorts of different spiritual topics , and I could probably write a dissertation on them all .
I wo n’t get in to everything here , for the simple fact that doing so will reveal specific plot twists and developments that I do n’t intend to spoil .
Suffice it to say , themes of sacrifice , redemption , fear , selfishness , revenge , and the basic sinfulness of man all present themselves in the film , along with a various host of other .
Characters are forced to choose who lives and dies , while others are forced to decide whether to continue fighting evil when it seems like nothing will work , or simply giving in and joining the forces of evil .
Each character has their own world cave in around them , and each must persevere , or be sucked into the maelstrom .
The performances in the film are basically great all around .
Christian Bale matures a little this time around as Batman , and his Batman is devastatingly human , with real feelings and reactions we might not be used to seeing from our “ superheroes . ”
The supporting cast of Aaron Eckhart , Michael Caine , Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox , and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes ( originally played in “ Batman Begins ” by Katie Holmes ) is uniformly good .
Eckhart was an interesting choice as Harvey Dent , and while he is fine in the role , I am not quite sure he was the best choice .
As the film winds down , his character experiences changes , both physically and psychologically ( in his case they go hand in hand ) and becomes something completely unlike Eckhart ’s nice guy persona .
Had he been given more time to develop his characters ( which , granted , was not his fault ) , my misgivings about his casting would likely have been nonexistent .
But “ The Dark Knight ” does n’t belong to Bale ’s Batman or any of the other afore - mentioned characters .
This is The Joker ’s movie , and boy does he run with it .
Of course , the hype surrounding the film has centered on the performance of Heath Ledger , who died earlier this year from an accidental prescription drug overdose .
I suppose many will be morbidly drawn in to seeing the film simply to view the role that supposedly drove Ledger into depression , but people should go just to see a performance that they wo n’t be able to shake from their minds for quite a while .
The word that kept popping in to my head to describe Ledger ’s performance as I watched the film was “ mesmerizing , ” and that does n’t even come close to doing it justice .
It is unfair to compare Ledger ’s Joker with Jack Nicholson ’s in the original Batman , because they required two totally different approaches .
Nicholson ’s was tailor - made for the campy style director Tim Burton was going for , and had Nicholson taken the approach Ledger did in this one , it simply would not have worked .
And vice versa .
But that ’s where the genius of “ The Dark Knight ” director Christopher Nolan ( who co-wrote the screenplay with brother Jonathan Nolan ) is evident .
He gave Ledger free reign to dig deep in to his character , and bring out the true essence of The Joker .
Let ’s face it , a man who basically wears a clown suit and goes around ruthlessly killing people is at the very least deranged , and at most purely demonic , but not at all campy .
Ledger toes the line between sadistic mastermind and homicidal lunatic , with a skill that gives you genuine chills .
I have n’t seen a performance like this since Anthony Hopkins made Hannibal Lecter a household name so many years ago .
Ledger uses everything at his disposal , from that creepy accent to lip - smacking facial tics , to create a character that would have lived on well after Ledger , even if he had lived a long , full life .
As I watched “ The Dark Knight , ” which is a summer movie like we have never seen before , or may ever see again , I could not shake the feeling of sadness I got watching Heath Ledger .
His death , like so many others , came far too soon , and left a void not only in Hollywood , but in a family who loved him dearly as a son and a brother .
It can be difficult to see these stars as real people , but tragedy always finds a way to bring that truth painfully home .
One of the many things I love about this Web site is that on the main page every day it gives Christians a few names to pray for every single day , that God would touch the lives of celebrities in a way only He can .
We often pray for our church , state , and national leaders , and rightfully so , but so frequently we neglect to pray for those we invite in to our homes every time we rent one of their movies , or who we visit each time we head out to the theaters .
These people influence so many others , young and old alike , and we forget to pray that God will work in their lives and use their talents for His glory .
But , as Heath Ledger sadly proved , Hollywood stars desperately need hope , the hope that can only come from a relationship with Christ .
I urge all Christians to pray for Hollywood , for each and every performer they see , and to never stop .
We may not be able to personally intervene , when a celebrity is plunging headfirst into a downward spiral that may claim their life , but we certainly know the One who can .

( CNN ) --
The Kyrgyz government is planning to close a strategically important U.S. military base that Washington uses as a route for troops and supplies heading into Afghanistan , Russian media reported Tuesday .
A U.S. troop guards the main access checkpoint to the Manas Air Base on December 18 , 2008 .
Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev said Tuesday at a news conference in Moscow that " all due procedures " were being initiated to close Manas Air Base , the Russian news agency RIA - Novosti reported .
The announcement was made after news reports of a multimillion - dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell on Tuesday called Manas " a hugely important air base . "
" It provides us with launching point to provide supplies in Afghanistan .
We very much appreciate [ Kyrgyz ] support in using that base and we hope to continue , " he said at his daily news briefing .
Gen. David Petraeus , who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia , including Afghanistan , was in Kyrgyzstan last month , partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base .
He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss " at all " the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was " no foundation " for news reports about the issue .
The mountainous former Soviet republic is Central Asia 's second poorest country .
The United States pays about $ 63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 Kyrgyz citizens there , Petraeus said .
The base has been in operation since December 2001 under U.N. mandate
The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported January 30 that Russia would offer Kyrgyzstan a $ 300 million , 40 - year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent , and write off $ 180 million of Kyrgyz debt .
Kyrgystan is also home to a Russian military base , at Kant , that officially opened in 2003 .
The United States is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban .
Petraeus described Manas as having " an important role in the deployment of these forces " and in refueling aircraft .
The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a Kyrgyz citizen was killed by a U.S. airman in December 2006 .
The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan and the dead man 's family was offered compensation .
Petraeus said in January the investigation was being reopened .
Bakiyev said in announcing the base closure Tuesday he was not satisfied with the inquiry into the accident and that his government 's " inability to provide security to its citizens " was proving a serious concern .

Nokia Gets a Cool $ 630 Million from Europe to Spend on Symbian

Nokia has just reported that it has received a $ 630 million loan from the European Investment Bank to help it develop the Symbian operating system and stay relevant in the increasingly competitive mobile operating system war .
Looks like Nokia 's move last summer to buy out the remaining shares of Symbian for $ 410 million was more prescient than many people realized .
Along with that move , Nokia also put the Symbian operating system on an open source course .
Just this week , at the Mobile World Congress in Spain , vendors lined up behind Symbian , LiMo 's Linux - based operating system , and Android .
$ 630 million is a lot of money .
Will it change Symbian 's fate , and how does it affect LiMo and Android ?
Stacey Higginbotham at GigaOm notes that a post from the European Investment Bank 's web site says the following :
" The task of the Bank is to contribute towards the integration , balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the EU Member States .
The EIB raises substantial volumes of funds on the capital markets which it lends on favourable terms to projects furthering EU policy objectives .
The EIB continuously adapts its activity to developments in EU policies . "
Stacey also associates this latest loan with Europe 's increased wariness of U.S. - based technology monopolies , which I agree with .
The European Commission has been steadily policing Microsoft on topics such as offering browser choice on new computers .
With this loan , though - - given its size -- the Android and LiMo mobile open source operating systems are likely to feel the brunt of the blow .
According to Nokia 's statement on the loan ( it quotes the amount at 500 million Euros ) , the money will be used in more than one way , but there 's no question that the open source Symbian OS will benefit big time :
" Nokia envisages that the R&D activities supported by this loan will also benefit the work of the Symbian Foundation and its development of open source software for mobile devices . "
The loan will be delivered over a five - year period , not all at once .
I 'm guessing that Google is going to have to answer this funding with some significant funding for Android development .
On the proprietary mobile operating system front , Apple has a $ 100 million fund supporting the iPhone , RIM has a $ 150 million fund behind the BlackBerry , and Microsoft , well , Microsoft is Microsoft .
Google can more than afford to financially support the growth of Android , and now the pressure is going to be on to do so .
I 'm betting that LiMo will be the odd man out here .
Money , or rather big money , is going to be an increasingly important factor as open source mobile operating systems compete fiercely in the coming years .

CERT - FI Statement on the Outpost24 TCP Issues ( CERT - FI ) 。2008.10.17 付で改訂されている。 Oct 17 .
The TCP issue reported by Outpost24 is being coordinated by CERT - FI .
We are in a process of determining the impact of the techniques and principles described by the reporters of the issue .
We are researching and handling the issue with several vendors from all potentially affected branches of network equipment and software .
Once we are fully aware of what types of network equipments and services are most possibly affected , we will make more vendor contacts .
Based on previous experience from similar coordination projects , we estimate that the full publication of the details of the issue may take until next year .
CERT - FI will publish more information on the developments of the issue coordination as the coordination progresses .
Cisco Security Response : Cisco Response to Outpost24 TCP State Table Manipulation Denial of Service Vulnerabilities ( Cisco , 2008.10.17 )
Cisco PSIRT research indicates an attacker must complete a TCP three - way handshake to a device to successfully exploit the DoS vulnerabilities .
This requirement makes spoofing the source of an attack more challenging .
The TCP vulnerabilities that Outpost24 announced are an extension of well - known weaknesses in the TCP protocol .
It is possible to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities by allowing only trusted sources to access TCP - based services .
This mitigation is particularly important for critical infrastructure devices .
PSIRT recommends the implementation of infrastructure access control lists ( IACLs ) and control plane policing ( CoPP ) to protect core network functionality .

Today ’s Business Standard has an article about Vodafone blocking our shortcode to stop people from subscribing to our ( MyToday ) opt -in SMS services .
The real unstated reason for the block is that Vodafone believes our free SMS services are competitive to their paid services ( Vodafone Alerts ) .
So , rather than let the market and consumers decide , they chose the path of blocking a service which has grown word - of - mouth to 3.8 million subscribers in India in the past two years .
[ On a side note : Since about 18 months ago , Vodafone has blocked access to our mobile portal ( http://mytoday.com) for their Vodafone Live subscribers ( which comprise the bulk of the GPRS subscriber base ) . ]
All this is despite TRAI recommending last week in their MVAS recommendations that opt - in services override NDNC , off - deck services are permitted , and operators should not block short codes or mobile portals .
The British may have left India 60 + years ago but their Colonial Cousins still seem to be hanging around the country .
What do you think about this ?
And , what are our options ?
I ’d love to hear from you .
Talking to Vodafone is nigh impossible — their pre-condition is we shut down the free SMS services .
We can go the legal route – but that will take forever .
We cannot even go to TDSAT since they only recognise disputes between telecom licence holders .
( That is why we had asked TRAI for a light VAS Licence — so dispute redressal can be done quickly by TDSAT rather than the courts . )
What ‘ Gandhigiri ’ can be done to take on this Goliath ?

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A woman who was Morgan Freeman ’s passenger in an August car crash sued the Oscar winner for negligence on Wednesday and said she wants to clear her name from claims she was his mistress .
Morgan Freeman poses at the premiere of " The Bucket List " in London January 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Anthony Harvey
Demaris Meyer , the passenger , also said that despite media reports to the contrary , she and Freeman met the night of the accident at a country club , where they dined with mutual friends , and that she was not in a romantic affair with him .
“ I have been labeled as the ‘ other woman ’ and have been accused of having caused the breakup of Mr. Freeman ’s marriage .
Nothing could be further from the truth , ” Meyer said at a news conference in Los Angeles .
She is represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred .
Meyer ’s lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi Delta Division .
The crash happened the night of August 3 , 2008 , near a home that Freeman keeps in Charleston , Mississippi , when he lost control of his Nissan Maxima and it struck a ditch and rolled over .
“ We are confident this will all be resolved , ” said Ken Sunshine , a spokesman for Freeman .
“ We have no further comment on the current litigation . ”
Meyer said she was riding with Freeman that night because they were going to his ranch , since it was closer to her work than a friend ’s home where she originally planned to stay .
She said the actor assured her she would not only have her own bedroom at the ranch , but “ her own house . ”
“ He was a perfect gentleman and I accepted his offer , ” said Meyer , who lives in Tennessee , north of Freeman ’s Mississippi home .
Meyer ’s lawsuit also accuses Freeman of drinking before taking the wheel , but Mississippi authorities have not charged him with driving under the influence .
Freeman , 71 , was hospitalized for four days after the collision , and his injuries included a broken arm and elbow .
Meyer was airlifted to a hospital and suffered numerous injuries , including a blow to the head resulting in cognitive difficulties and short - term memory loss , her lawsuit states .
She has not returned to work as an executive assistant .
Meyer ’s lawsuit accuses Freeman of negligence for failing to properly operate the car , and she is seeking unspecified damages in an amount to be proven at trial to cover medical expenses and her permanent disability , among other things .
At the time of the crash , Freeman was separated from his wife of 24 years and was in the midst of a divorce , which has not yet been finalized .
Freeman won an Oscar in 2005 for his supporting role in Clint Eastwood ’s boxing drama “ Million Dollar Baby . ”
This morning , DiS has woken up bleary - eyed to the news that music industry body , the IFPI , has released a report which claims that more than 40 billion songs were illegally downloaded in 2008 .
This huge figure equates to 95 % of all music downloads and is the same percentage of illegal downloads which were made in 2007 , despite government action and the growth of legal sales and compelling alternatives to P2P .
We knew things were bad but this is astounding .
It means that due to file - sharing via P2P , blogs , IM-ing , YouSendit / Rapidshare - ing zip files , CDR's , hard - drive swapping , etc . the record industry is only making 5 % of the money it could potentially be making .
This five percent of legitimate / legal sales equates to $ 3.7 billion ( about £ 2.4 billion , according to Google 's currency converter ) , which is all well and good but it's a pittance when you consider what the other 95 % is worth , we figure about £ 48 billion !!!
This is especially worrying when you also factor in how much the digital world has eaten away at sales of CD and vinyl over the past decade .
Digital has had as much of an impact on legitimate music sales , with people who used to buy a few albums a year now just buying a selection of single tracks they like instead of whole albums , and people streaming albums they once would have bought to have an opinion of , or bought to have in better quality than a tape - copy .
The music business like to call this ' digital cannibalism ' as an excuse to hide the fact that the major labels should have all bought an equal share in Napster all that time ago and manipulated it into the gigantic listening booth that the once - valued - at - $ 15 - billion MySpace became several years later .
These kindsa gargantuan numbers all sound as if they only affect pop culture but , please , ignore your gut instinct .
Having put the Drowned in Sound label on hiatus late last year ( although we do still plan to release Martha Wainwright 's next record but have effectively been forced to make our staff redundant , drop everyone else and give them back their copyrights ) and speaking to various labels , both major and fiercely independent ( especially those affected by the demise of distributor Pinnacle ) these findings are clearly being felt by everyone who invests in music , be it for philanthropic or greed - driven corporate reasons .
Something has to change for the good of business and more importantly the future of music .
There has been a lot of noise in the past year about the success of legal stores and we do n't wanna piss on their candle but to put some of this into context , just 1.4 billion legal single - tracks were downloaded in 2008 .
The biggest selling track of the year was L'il Wayne 's ' Lollipop ' which makes up for 9.1 million of those sales .
Coldplay were the biggest selling UK act last year with , with just 6.8 million album sales of Viva La Vida worldwide , I say ' just ' but it was one of the biggest selling albums of the year and big albums used to sell upwards of 20 million copies !
I do n't want to harp on about The Death Of The CD as , with or without record stores , it 'll surely live on as a boutique item for years to come ( just like vinyl has ) but it 's worth noting that in the US ( which has an estimated population of 303,824,640 ) album sales fell 14 % to 428.4 million units in 2008 , following a drop of 15 % in 2007 .
CD sales officially hit an all - time low in 2008 .
These figures from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries ( which ironically also is the acronym for Int Fed of Pirates Interests ) are from their annual IFPI Digital Music Report , which collates separate studies from 16 countries (- studies which have now been taking place for three years ) .
The study singled out France and Spain as being affected particularly badly by online piracy , which is intriguing following the French governments introduction of a heavy - but - fair ' three strikes ' and you 're banned from the internet policy .
So what 's the solution ?
Some argue that ISPs should continue sending angry letters to their users , warning them that they are aware of what you 're looking at but mostly that they 're peeved that you 're using too much bandwidth , having hooked you up on superfast broadband connection ( which obviously you only got to download your emails from your Nan that bit faster !...)
The result has simply been people switching ISPs .
Others are calling for a tax or levy on internet access , with Scott Cohen , from the forward - thinking digital music distributors
The Orchard calling for the music industry to rethink and to " monetize the customer , not the content " i.e. charge for access , add services to help people explore , offer better quality , save people time and provide exclusives .
Essentially this is what Nokia 's Comes With Music is - a proto-version of a kind of tax system , where you pay for one thing and get access to a whole other world of content , without necessarily feeling as if you 're paying for the music itself .
I can see the merits to both of these options but they seem a cheek spank on the ass or an unrealistic step too far into the future .
There are two key things I believe the industry / government should be doing to ensure that the creators of music ( and TV , film , games , etc ... ) get a slither of that 95 % ( £ 48 billion ) which is impossible to police .
I suggest :
Not just sending letters to offenders but , as in China ( and surprising when I was there , in Cuba too ! ) , access should be limited .
Legislation should come from governments to outlaw ISPs allowing their customers access to P2P networks ( essentially cutting off the dealers , rather than going after the users ) .
This would stop illegal activity being an option and anyone on a child - lock or office network know how easy this is to set - up .
This would mean also outlawing sites like Rapidshare and Yousendit from allowing the transfer and , p'raps more importantly , the profiteering from the exchange of MP3s and other high quality entertainment formats .
This may not be a popular idea with people who crave a limitless freedom on the web but if you consider these people make their living , in much the same way as the DVD - guy in the pub , profiting , whilst the creator of the music has to pimp t- shirts , over - priced tickets or work - a - day jobs to make music , then I hope the average music - lover would take the side of their favourite musician .
The result of this would be that those who want to profit from music develop legitimate alternatives to file - sharing , like Spotify or maybe even a £ 20 a month access to a site like Oink , which some users said they 'd pay £ 50 + a month to use .
Make all file - sharing legal but charge for the volumes of data transferred .
Essentially this would mean people who download large volumes pay more for their access , just like people who send more text messages or use more water do .
This charge already exists for website owners who pay for a volume of bandwidth their site uses and also on mobile phones as data charges , usually per megabyte .
This would be a simple tax ( and perhaps not even that expensive , considering how free you'd be to download as much as you want ) which would involve a form of monitoring the file types being transferred .
It could even be done by scrobbling software ( not unlike Last.fm , Twones and iTunes Genius playlist ) and would ensure monies go to those who deserve it .
Essentially , instead of being called a pirate for accessing sites , you 'd sign up and pay a license to be able to access what the hell you want .
This tax could also be profitable for internet service providers and would encourage creative development of platforms to share music .
Additional taxes could be applied , like VAT or as with CD mechanical royalties , to anything containing a hard disc , so , say £ 1 of every iPod sold ( which reached 173 million sales in September ) or 50 p for every Terrabyte hard drive sold ( mostly to back up music and movies , right ? ) .
This is not unlike what Universal reportedly gets for every Zune sold or the crazy money people must be making from their patents .

Newswise — Laboratory work in animals showed limited activity when statins were given to prevent breast cancer , according to a report in the February issue of Cancer Prevention Research , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research .
Statins , sold under brand names like Lipitor and Zocor , are primarily given to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease , and prominent cardiologists almost universally agree that their use has changed the landscape .
The use of these drugs in cancer prevention has been more controversial .
Results of epidemiology studies , which rely on looking backward rather than forward and thus are subject to confounding factors , have yielded mixed results when examining breast cancer .
Scientists under the auspices of the NCI , including Ronald Lubet , Ph.D. , an NCI program director , and Clinton Grubbs , Ph.D. , director of the Chemoprevention Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham conducted laboratory work in animals to determine if statins actually prevent both ER - positive and ER - negative breast cancer .
In the current study , scientists tested atorvastatin and lovastatin .
" We saw no real efficacy from either statin , " said Lubet .
" Prior studies have shown some but limited efficacy in breast cancer models when these drugs were given through a method that would be the equivalent of intravenously in humans .
However , that is not the way people take statins . "
Atorvastatin was administered at either 125 or 500 mg / kg in the diet of rats , and it did not alter the incidence of estrogen receptor - positive mammary cancers or its multiplicity .
Similarly , no effect of atorvastatin was observed in an estrogen receptor - negative model in mice .
By contrast , when these mice were given 0.4 mg of tamoxifen or 80 mg of bexarotene there was a significant reduction in the multiplicity of mammary tumors .
Combining these regimens with atorvastatin did not augment the positive effects of these other agents .
Lovastatin was given at 100 and 500 mg/kg , and it showed no significant preventive - effect similar to atorvastatin .
Lubet said the research into statin use and cancer prevention would continue .
" There is always the question of whether there will be a subset of breast cancer where this class of agents will be effective , but the answer at this point is that the present preclinical studies do not support the use of statins as general breast cancer preventive agents " said Lubet .
The mission of the American Association for Cancer Research is to prevent and cure cancer .
Founded in 1907 , AACR is the world 's oldest and largest professional organization dedicated to advancing cancer research .
The membership includes more than 28,000 basic , translational and clinical researchers ; health care professionals ; and cancer survivors and advocates in the United States and 80 other countries .
The AACR marshals the full spectrum of expertise from the cancer community to accelerate progress in the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of cancer through high - quality scientific and educational programs .
It funds innovative , meritorious research grants .
The AACR Annual Meeting attracts more than 17,000 participants who share the latest discoveries and developments in the field .
Special conferences throughout the year present novel data across a wide variety of topics in cancer research , treatment and patient care .
The AACR publishes five major peer - reviewed journals : Cancer Research ; Clinical Cancer Research ; Molecular Cancer Therapeutics ; Molecular Cancer Research ; and Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers & Prevention .
The AACR 's most recent publication and its sixth major journal , Cancer Prevention Research , is dedicated exclusively to cancer prevention , from preclinical research to clinical trials .
The AACR also publishes CR , a magazine for cancer survivors and their families , patient advocates , physicians and scientists .
CR provides a forum for sharing essential , evidence - based information and perspectives on progress in cancer research , survivorship and advocacy .
Julian Fantino 's eyes narrow in anger .
His jaw line flexes while he grinds his teeth .
Justice Leonard Montgomery has sternly cautioned the commissioner about making snarky " side comments . "
Fantino , infrequently on the receiving end of orders , is struggling to contain his irritation .
" We 're going to get through this day one way or the other , and I expect you as the commissioner to answer questions , " Montgomery warns .
Fantino bristles .
" Yes , sir . "
The seemingly routine police disciplinary hearing against Insp. Alison Jevons and Supt .
Ken MacDonald began virtually unnoticed about one year ago .
The pair is accused of bungling an internal investigation from their time in the professional standards bureau .
The case has since evolved into an embarrassing mess for Fantino .
The colourfully spoken commissioner has been dragged into the proceedings , accused of tampering with witnesses , orchestrating a " political prosecution " against the officers , and abusing his powers as head of the Ontario Provincial Police .
Fantino flatly denies the allegations , but as lawyers for both sides spar , this increasingly bizarre case has provided a rare look inside the OPP and at the country 's most famous police officer .
Throughout his four - decade career , Fantino served as chief of police in London , York and Toronto before assuming the helm of the OPP in October 2006 .
He owes his success – and several high - profile scandals – to his sharp tongue and blunt tactics .
Love him or hate him , Fantino 's old - school , tough - talking style has earned him a reputation for getting the job done .
So when trouble began to brew in the Caledon detachment , and Fantino suspected MacDonald was to blame , the commissioner acted swiftly and severely .
A rumour was circulating that MacDonald had been spreading " misinformation " to Caledon councillors about restructuring in the region .
When Fantino found out , he sent an email – dated Feb. 21 , 2007 – to several high - ranking officers , making a point to " cc " MacDonald , the disciplinary hearing heard .
" `UNAUTHORIZED SOURCES ' be on notice , " the email began , " that I consider any such activity a betrayal , that if it continues , I will stop at nothing to trace back the person (s ) responsible AND deal with he / she / them personally .
There is no place in the OPP for anyone to hide who is disloyal , disruptive , or dishonest , for what it 's worth !
J.F. "
On March 1 , the commissioner arranged a meeting with council to address concerns .
He brought along several high - ranking officers , including MacDonald 's boss , Chief Supt .
Bill Grodzinski .
After the meeting , Fantino gathered the officers in the parking lot .
" We were sort of , I would n't call it a huddle , but we were in a small semicircle , " Grodzinski testified in July .
" ( Fantino ) said to me , ` Are you going to execute the disloyal one or do you want me to ? ' "
Grodzinski paused to collect his thoughts .
He had known MacDonald personally and professionally for 20 years and believed there was no way his friend had anything to do with any " mischief - making . "
He told Fantino his feelings , the commissioner listened , then closed the subject , Grodzinski testified .
" I was wrestling with '( what ) do I do with this ? ' " Grodzinski remembered thinking .
After some soul searching , he decided to phone MacDonald and warn him .
Next , Grodzinski had to decide if he should document the incident .
" To make a decision about making notes on another police officer in any way , shape or form , is very significant , " he testified .
" For me to make notes about the commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police , I was extremely reluctant ... I have a great deal of respect for the office . "
Two weeks later , after a lengthy investigation , MacDonald and Jevons were charged with neglect of duty relating to a 2005 investigation .
For nine months , Grodzinski sat on what Fantino would refer to in his testimony as " cheat notes . "
Then around noon on Saturday , Jan. 5 , two days before the hearing began , Fantino met at a Kelsey 's restaurant with the officer assigned to investigate MacDonald and Jevons .
Supt .
Mark VanZant handed the commissioner a brown envelope containing , among other things , Grodzinski's notes on the " execution " comment .
Julian Falconer , lawyer for MacDonald and Jevons , would later say the ensuing events were prime examples of Fantino 's alleged abuse of power .
When the hearing began on Monday , Grodzinski 's notes became public .
It was clear Fantino would have to testify .
At 7 a.m. the next day , Fantino called a teleconference with his senior officers , documented by Deputy Commissioner Chris Lewis .

" Grodz . – NOW to NER , " Lewis wrote in his notebook .
Grodzinski was to be immediately transferred to Northeast Region headquarters in North Bay .
Two days later , Grodzinski was summoned to police headquarters in Orillia about a " staffing " issue .
" Deputy Lewis indicated that a decision had been made to transfer me to North Bay ... effective the following Monday , that this was not a discussion , the decision had been made , " Grodzinski testified .
Falconer has suggested Fantino 's actions are tantamount to witness tampering .
When Fantino took the stand on Oct. 17 , he defended the move .
The commissioner testified that , for one thing , the region was in desperate need of a senior officer and for another , Grodzinski's wife was from the area .
" My understanding is that we were bringing him home , " Fantino said .
Grodzinski saw it differently .
" I viewed what took place that morning as an immediate , unacceptable reprisal against me for me exercising my duty .
I viewed the transfer to North Bay as an immediate punishment , sanction , reprisal , use what word you wish . "
He implored Lewis to reconsider .
Grodzinski said his wife was sick and that they had already moved three times in as many years .
Lewis said he would relay the information , but there were no guarantees .
That evening , Fantino 's boss , then - deputy minister of community safety and correctional services Deborah Newman , called him with concerns about a possible " punishment transfer . "
At best , it was seen as poor timing .
Fantino recalled the conversation in his testimony .
" I cleared the air with her , the misinformation she was provided , that in fact , Bill Grodzinski 's transfer had been discussed , that it in absolutely no way , shape or form was it a punitive thing .
We were bringing him back home .
The fact that we were dealing with organizational change at the very same time , balanced out with his family issues , we decided in the end not to do it because of the stated reasons earlier . "
The next morning , Grodzinski got a call from a superior , inquiring whether he had contacted anyone at the ministry about the transfer .
Later that day , Grodzinski was informed he could stay in his position as commander of highway safety .
" It 's an extraordinary coincidence in timing , " Falconer challenged Fantino at the hearing .
" Life is full of coincidences , but if you look at the issues that we discussed that day , they were all major organizational issues that needed to be addressed , " Fantino rebutted .
At one point during Fantino 's testimony , it appeared the commissioner was tipped during a lunch recess about an inconsistency in his evidence on another issue .
When Fantino seemed to change his story after the break , Montgomery appeared livid , sending the commissioner out of the room and cautioning his lawyer , Brian Gover .
At the end of the day , a decision was made for the commissioner to return to finish his cross-examination on Nov. 5 .
That did n't happen .
Gover launched a motion to have Montgomery removed on account of the alleged bias of the adjudicator – who was chosen by Fantino – against the commissioner .
This will be the subject of debate when the hearing resumes on Thursday .

Providing a week 's worth of meals for three people for £ 6.66 a head is easy once you work out how , she says .
The gas and electricity payments for the week have already been made , so she knows the children will be warm .
The only thing to fear is the unexpected - a broken pushchair , a request to buy her daughter 's class photograph .
Louise , 24 , does n't smoke , drink or take drugs and she very rarely goes out with her friends .
She spends pretty much all the money she gets in benefits on her children .
She rejects the suggestion that her family might be described as poor .
" Oh no , " she says firmly .
" We get by . "
According to the official definition , Louise 's family are surviving well below the breadline , and Abigail , five , and her son Sean , three , take their place alongside the 3.9 million children in Britain classified as living in poverty .
Today marks the 10th anniversary of Tony Blair 's promise to eradicate child poverty by 2020 .
In a lecture on his vision for the welfare state , he set out " our historic aim - that ours is the first generation to end child poverty for ever " .
The government would , he promised , " break the cycle of disadvantage so that children born into poverty are not condemned to social exclusion and deprivation " .
Gordon Brown echoed the commitment , describing child poverty as " a scar on the soul of Britain " .
It was a slick soundbite of a promise , which prompted some scepticism at the time , but money has been spent and over the last 10 years there have been some modest improvements .
In 1999 Britain had a higher proportion of children in poverty than any other western European nation .
Since then , 600,000 have been lifted above the breadline ; we 're still bottom , only now we share the ignominy with Italy and Spain .
About 30 % of children remain beneath the breadline and the recession is likely to increase that number ; the government 's promise to halve the number of children in poverty by 2010 has been quietly swept under the carpet and no one expects it to be met .
You have to suspect that Blair did n't come to Hartcliffe before he launched the campaign , so complex and entrenched are the problems here .
This postwar estate on the outskirts of Bristol , just before the city snaps into countryside , has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in the country , widespread drug use and very high levels of poverty .
Since the closure at the start of last recession of the Wills cigarette factory , the largest tobacco plant in Europe , unemployment here has soared .
When Blair made his speech , Louise was already in a cycle of disadvantage , from which she is still fighting to escape .
The daughter of a teenage mother who left school without any qualifications , she was shortly to finish her education with only a handful of Es , Fs and Gs at GCSE .
Inspired by a school careers session , she had hoped , briefly , to become an archaeologist until teachers stamped on the aspiration , pointing out she did n't have a chance of getting into university .
Instead she thought she might become a nursery assistant and began training , but abandoned it when she got pregnant , aged 18 .
" You do dream about what you 're going to do , when you 're at school .
But life does n't work out like that , " she says with no bitterness .
Ten years of government pledges to tackle social exclusion in places such as Hartcliffe has , as far as Louise can see , resulted in little more than the demolition of the local parade of shops , most of them boarded - up since riots in the 1980s , and the construction in its place of a massive , cavernous Morrisons and a new Iceland .
This shopping complex looms large in Louise 's life .
On Mondays she comes here to the Post Office opposite to pick up £ 85 in income support .
On Tuesdays she comes to get another £ 51 in tax credits .
Burned by the high charges imposed on her overdraft , she no longer has a bank account and deals only in cash .
Her daily routine is punctuated by anxious furrowing in her pink wallet , and the careful updating of her weekly personal accounts in Biro on the back of an envelope : £ 5.50 for TV licence , ticked off ; £ 10 for gas meter , ticked ; £ 5 for electric , ticked ; £ 10 repayment of a loan to the council ; £ 7 repayment of overdraft charges to Lloyds TSB ; £ 5 for her mobile ; £ 5 for nappies ; all ticked off .
Shopping at Morrisons does n't take very long .
Louise has a simple formula : do n't buy anything that costs more than £ 1 .
This week , the budget bananas are finished , and the regular packet costs £ 1.29 , so she does n't buy bananas .
The cheap potatoes are also sold out , so she does n't buy potatoes .
She fills a basket with Morrisons own - brand orange juice , 56 p ; reduced - sugar jam , 95 p ; peanut butter , 78 p ; yoghurt , £ 1.00 ; bread , 99 p , granulated sugar , 93 p ; oven chips , 79 p ; two tins of eight hot dogs at 49 p each ; one bag of value apples , £ 1.00 .
Only the milk , biscuits and the cheese cost more .
She ignores the faltering monologue from her son , who has been diagnosed with learning difficulties , just audible from beneath the pram 's hood .
" Mum , I want flowers .
Please buy flowers .
I want the Bob the Builder egg .
I want High School Musical chocolates . . . "
" It would be nice , on occasion , to buy them something on a whim - treats , cakes and biscuits .
But if you do , you know you 're going to have to turn the heating off , " she says .
Her face is pallid , and she has grey patches of exhaustion beneath her eyes .
She crosses the car park to Iceland to find cheaper bananas ( brown and verging on rotten ) , pizza , cheese spread and chicken pies for £ 1 each .
" This will easily last me until next week , and there 'll be stuff left over , " she says confidently , although she concedes that things would be better still if she could spare £ 4 to make a bus trip into the city centre for the weekly Wednesday food handouts by nuns , who usually give her a couple of plastic bags of tins and pasta .
Last harvest festival her daughter 's school was collecting for the nuns , so she sent in a few tins she had been given by them , and is half - expecting to see them come back full circle and return to her cupboard .
On the walk between the shops and her two - bedroom ground - floor flat , every second person is a very young mother pushing a pram .
Louise says Hartcliffe is notorious across Bristol as a " dumping ground for single mums " .
Poverty in Britain is defined by a relative measure , rather than an absolute one ; any household with an income of less than 60 % of British median income is classified as in poverty .
At the moment , for a single - parent family with two children , the official cut - off line stands at £ 199 a week , after housing has been paid for ; for a two - parent family , it stands at £ 283.20 a week .
" Everyone is trying their best for their family .
Some mothers are growing marijuana in their flats and dealing drugs on the side .
They do it because they think it is the only way to give their children a better life , " she says , without passing judgment .
Other mothers regularly pop into Morrisons to steal stuff they can sell , to supplement their income .
" There are people in a much worse situation than me , people who are n't as organised as I am .
They get their money and they spend it willy - nilly and then their children go hungry , " she says .
When she was still battling with bank charges imposed by Lloyds every time she went overdrawn ( which was every week ) , she would do without meals herself because there was n't enough food , but life has improved now that she has switched to the Post Office , and is slowly paying off a debt of £ 600 - worth of fines and charges to Lloyds .
Louise is not inclined to blame the government for her difficulties .
She is grateful for the money she gets every week and does n't think her life would be much enhanced by increased payments .
" Money ca n't always make you happy , " she says .
" I 'm not a greedy person .
When you 've learned to survive on very little , you can't afford to be greedy . "
Instead , she has become adept at making do .
When she moved into this flat , after her children 's father left her , she had almost nothing .
Her mum bought her a secondhand sofa for £ 30 , a charity gave her a washing machine ( so old that it barely works ) .
Because there 's no dryer she has a complicated timetable by which she can ensure clean , dry school clothes for her children for the next two days , spreading out knickers , socks , T - shirts , trousers on every radiator in the flat .
Because there 's no table , the children eat on the floor and she eats on her lap .
At first sight , the flat gives an impression of profound chaos .
Clothes are piled into cardboard boxes in the corner .
Belongings are balanced on broken bits of furniture .
Saucepans are stacked high on the top of the stove .
It 's not that she 's not house - proud , but being poor gets in the way .
There are no cupboards , so everything is shoved into boxes , or spilling out into the open .
The children 's dolls lie legs poking up into the air on the floor , because buying a toy box has never been the week 's most pressing purchase .
There was no carpet in the flat , but someone has found her an old strip of blue carpet , secondhand , that does n't fit into the room , curling into rolls at the walls , and leaving a third of the cold cement floor exposed , so that when her son tumbles off the sofa , he lands on his forehead on the concrete , and a red lump swells up .
Louise gathers him up and rocks him , whispering " My boy , my boy " in his ear .
The block has all the usual accoutrements of deprivation - abandoned mattresses in the back garden , a broken chair propping open the door , kicked - in wooden fencing , layers of graffiti .
Someone keeps painting " Nigger " on the front door of the people who live in the flat opposite , but the tenants have carefully whitewashed over the graffiti , and now the pink door has two white stripes across the front .
Neat , white parking bays have been painted on the asphalt outside the three - storey , redbrick block of flats , but they are all empty because no one here can afford to drive a car .
In the park opposite , near the school for children who have been permanently excluded from their secondary schools , Louise finds herself stepping over needles as she brings her children home in the afternoon .
In the same speech , 10 years ago , Blair promised that his government would tackle the fundamental causes of child poverty - structural unemployment , poor education , poor housing , crime and a drugs culture .
None of that has been done in Hartcliffe .
As they come into the stairwell , Louise 's daughter says : " It stinks in here . "
At five , she is already angry at her situation in a way that her mother is not .
Hungry after school , she says : " I want cake . "
Louise replies in a voice weary from repetition : " We do n't have cake .
I do n't have money for cake . "
Later , she makes chips and beans and pizza for supper .
She knows that fresh food is important , but you can rely on tinned hot dogs and frozen pies not to go off , so that way nothing is wasted .
Once a month when the child benefit payment comes through , she 'll buy ingredients to make her own lasagne , or stew , from scratch .
Somehow , popular support for tackling child poverty in Britain has never been won , either by the government or by the legion of charities working in this area .
While Live Aid and the campaign to end developing - world debt got hundreds of thousands out into the streets , there has never been much public enthusiasm for pouring money into relieving poverty in our country .
People associate child poverty with distended stomachs in Africa and slum kids in India and find it difficult to engage with the home - grown equivalent , campaigners say .
Many still refuse to concede that poverty even exists here , arguing that if children are housed , fed , and have access to free healthcare , they have nothing to complain about .
Others have peculiarly outdated conceptions of British poverty , " half Dickensian , half wartime , with images of children in ill - fitting clothes , very far from the reality , " says Hilary Fisher , director of the Campaign to End Child Poverty .
Poverty for children in Britain now is more likely to mean not having a winter coat , never having enough money to go on holiday or on school trips , not having the spare pound needed to join subsidised after - school clubs , not being able to afford to go swimming .
It is n't about going hungry , but it is likely to involve eating irregularly , cheaply and badly .
The tabloid portrayal of the poor as idle scroungers has done a lot to weaken public sympathy for the cause , even though new data shows that the majority of children living in poverty have at least one parent who is working , but who is paid so little that the family remains below the breadline .
The emphasis on child poverty , rather than just poverty generally , is partly aimed at deflating this tendency to blame the poor - the argument being that you can't blame the children for their situation - but it has still failed to energise public support for the cause .
Government action has been taken in spite of this apathy , rather than in response to popular pressure .
" People find it easier to send money to buy a goat to help villagers in Africa than to help tackle poverty here , " Fisher says , highlighting a reluctance to confront the causes of poverty at home , bred partly from an unwillingness to accept that the answer may lie in the need to redistribute wealth .
" We are not suggesting that this is the poverty that you see in Mumbai .
Poverty here is not as extreme , but it is still dire , " says Martin Narey , chief executive of Barnardo's .
" We do n't have to choose between helping the developing world and sorting out our own society . "
Tim Nichols , of the Child Poverty Action Group , agrees .
" Of course children who are affected by famine and war are in the worst situation imaginable , but that does n't mean we do n't have our own problems in our own society that are morally unacceptable , " he says .
Louise is conscious that her situation is not one that usually attracts much sympathy .
She hates to be cast as " the stereotypical single mum on benefits , sitting on my bum living off other people 's taxes " .
She points out that she was in a serious relationship when she had her children .
" I was n't young and foolish .
Their father had a job , " she says .
Since he abandoned them he has paid no maintenance , and Louise is so disillusioned that she says she never wants another man in her life .
She absolutely agrees with the government philosophy that work is the best route out of poverty , but she does wonder how she is ever going to find a job .
" Of course I 'd rather be working than being on benefits .
If I were working , I would n't be living in a two - bedroom council flat , underneath someone with mental - health problems and a couple of addicts .
I 'd have carpet that fits and lino on the floor , " she says .
But she does n't expect to find work soon .
" My CV would say : left school .
Worked one month in a nursing home .
Got pregnant .
That 's not going to get me a job .
There are n't enough jobs to go around . "
In between walking her daughter to school at nine o'clock , taking her son to nursery at one , picking her daughter up at three and collecting her son at five , she is fitting in computing courses and working on her literacy at the local community centre .
" I do n't want to be Es , Fs , Gs for ever , so I 'm trying to improve , " she says , referring to her GCSE grades .
But is dubious about which jobs would fit in with her childcare commitments , and she knows that work is increasingly elusive .
Few of her neighbours are working and she has to think before she can remember which of her schoolfriends managed to get a good job .
" Two girls got a job in Savers , a cheap chemists .
I do n't know anyone else who 's working , except a boy I knew , who was n't even really a friend .
I know he's got a job at the bingo hall , cleaning , " she says .
If Louise is not given to complaining , the women who run the courses at the local community centre are very angry .
They believe that the people on this estate are beyond the reach of most government programmes , because their deprivation is so extreme and they are concerned that things are getting worse .
" We try to help young people get out of poverty in the way that the government advises - primarily through work - but it has been very hard to find these people work .
Many of them are not work - ready .
We have to teach them to read and write first , " one community support officer says , asking not to be named , afraid that her bluntness would offend the people she is helping .
" The biggest problem is breaking the cycle of lack of educational attainment that leads to poverty .
If they could read and write then we could get them into work .
As it is , there are real problems with their understanding of things and their retention .
It 's not something we can help with overnight . "
In the 60s , some of the children who went to the local schools in Hartcliffe became bankers and accountants , she says .
That does n't happen now .
" Good teachers do n't want to teach here .
But that 's not the only issue .
Because we 've had generations of poverty here , it means your parents wo n't have the skills to help you fill in a basic job application , " she says .
" Your health will suffer because you wo n't be eating sufficiently nutritious food .
People on a low income do n't buy the right food .
If you 've got a pound , you can buy three packets of biscuits or two bananas .
Which are you going to buy if you 're not eating very much ? "
Louise is already worried that her daughter , Abigail , will soon find herself in the same cycle of deprivation that Blair promised to eliminate .
" There is a stigma attached to this area .
The teachers think that the children from here are all thick and they do n't bother with them .
I 'm worried that my daughter wo n't do as well as she could .
She 's a clever little girl but all that 's offered is a basic level of learning , " she says .
She is right to be concerned .
Research suggests that by the age of 22 months , a child living beneath the poverty line begins to fall behind peers from richer families , and by the time they turn six , previously less - able children from wealthier backgrounds will be ahead .
Children living in poverty are only a third as likely to get five good GCSEs as their richer classmates , and five times less likely to go to university .
" It 's a bit of an unfair innings , " she concludes , the nearest she comes to complaining .
" We 're all entitled to a good education , but the people whose parents do n't have money , do n't get it .
You do n't get a good education , so you do n't get a job .
It 's all down to money . "
This is a background anxiety that weaves in with more pressing concerns about how much money is left on the gas meter ( she checks in the cupboard , and is reassured to see £ 3.45 flashing in red digital figures ) .
She is already worrying about how she will be able to afford new school uniform for the children in six months ' time , given that she is still paying off the loans she took out last September for this year 's batch .
She worries about whether anyone will take her concerns about her son 's development seriously .
She worries that the frozen mince she feeds her children is watery and poor quality .
By Thursday evening she 's down to £ 2.05 ( £ 3 went on a replacement birth certificate for her daughter ) and she has decided to use the emergency £ 10 she keeps in a china jar on the windowsill to take the children on a bus across Bristol to spend the weekend with her mother , Nicola .
Nicola , who is also out of work after losing her job as a cook for the Salvation Army , is happy to help .
When Louise was a child , she used to feel insulted when the school handed out food packages donated by the Lord Mayor for the city 's " underprivileged " , but she thinks her daughter has a harder life than she ever did .
She believes the government is ill informed about the depths of deprivation that still exist .
" When politicians come here , they get shown a very sanitised version of reality - the community centre is given a lick of paint , and a few local residents are carefully selected for them to meet .
They do n't see how it really is , " she says .
" They need to come and see how she 's living . "
Campaigners here insist that despite the huge scale of the challenge , reducing child poverty to match the levels in the better - performing European countries is not an unrealistic goal .
They say putting £ 4bn in the next budget towards extra means - tested benefits for the poorest would go a long way towards helping meet the 2010 deadline of halving the number of poor children .
The longer - term goal requires a mixture of investment in schools and training and measures to end social exclusion .
" Finland , Sweden and Denmark have child poverty levels of 7 % - 8 % .
There 's no reason why we can't be at that level , " says Nichols of the Child Poverty Action Group .
" The target is eminently achievable . "
Louise hopes her children will have a better quality of life than she has .
" I 'll tell my children they can do anything they like .
I want them to get jobs .
It would be nice if they did something that earned them some money , " she says .
In the meantime , she is determined to preserve an optimistic outlook .
" You can't wake up in the morning and assume it 's going to be a good day , but I am a positive person .
I think you have to take life as it comes " .

• Names have been changed .
Boudewijn Rempt has summarised results of development for the next version of Krita , the painting and image editing application for KOffice .
Krita 2.0 will contain a host of new features , some of which are unique in the free software world .
Below Piotr introduces some of the new features which will be available in this release .
Ported : Krita now runs on Mac OS X and on Windows .
Windows and Mac OS X ports are now available .
They are easy to get using the Windows installer and Mac OS X macports ( via koffice2 - devel ) .
Vector layers : Krita 1.6 made it possible to embed a KOffice KPart as a layer into an image .
This makes it possible to have a complete KSpread or KWord document as a layer .
In KOffice 2.0 , KParts have been replaced by Flake Shapes , as an end result Krita 2.0 has vector layers where you can add any combination of KOffice shapes .
Examples of KOffice shapes are vector drawings , text objects or even musical notation objects .
These shapes are then rendered at the image resolution and blended with your pixel layers .
The same technique is used for vector selections .
More brush engines : Krita is the only paint application that has pluggable brush engines .
Thanks to Lukas Tvrdy Krita has got some new engines like :
Sumi-e brush : a generic hairy brush simulation
Chalk : a very acceptable simulation of dry media
Dynadraw : Inspired by Paul Haberli's Dynadraw
Expect more interesting brush engines to appear over the next year .
Image resolution :
In 2.0 , Krita keeps track of resolution and can always display the image at the correct size on screen .
That means that if you have scanned an image at 300dpi and have a 96dpi screen , your image will at 100 % zoom be as big physically as on the paper you scanned it from .
Real colour mixing : A mixer canvas as in Corel Painter , but one where mixing the colours would give real - life results .
This feature was added by Emanuele Tamponi during Summer of Code 2007 .
This feature may by postponed to 2.1 , please test this feature if you plan to use it .
Clone layers :
A clone layer copies part of another layer and inserts it somewhere else in the layer stack .
You can then add new effect masks to the copy , for instance to create a blur effect .
This feature seems to work but extensive user testing would be appreciated .
OpenGL canvas with on - canvas preview of gradients :
If your computer supports OpenGL , you can use the OpenGL canvas .
This is faster and uses less memory than the ordinary canvas .
For introduction to other new features and answers why development of Krita 2.0 is taking so long please see this article .
Krita now needs a lot of testing to shape up 2.0 release and make it rock solid , so please give it a try and test it extensively .
Also , the Krita project is in need of people who would like to help with updating The Krita Handbook .
As you see a lot of new features are now available and the manual needs some love , this is a great opportunity for non-coders to contribute and work together to improve Krita and KOffice .
Three years of work on Krita 2.0 has resulted in much better code , extensive set of unit tests and better separation of concerns .
Furthermore a better design for many data structures and better user interface .
Krita developers hope that 2.0 release would be a great base for future development , the code is better and it is easier to get involved in coding for those who would like to improve this cross- platform painting and image editing application for KOffice .
Phorm has been marred by controversy since it emerged BT had carried out two earlier trials without customers ' consent .

Germany school shooting - 15 dead in Winnenden
Smiling , friendly and full of life - these photos reveal the full horror behind the tragic victims of teen gunman Tim Kretschmer 's school murder rampage .
The 17 - year - old Kretschmer started a killing spree at his former school in Winnenden near Stuttgart , Germany yesterday , murdering students and teachers .
The gunman appears to have specifically targeted girls and women as he went on the ran amok at Albertville school , cruelly robbing them of their lives .
Among his 15 victims were eight schoolgirls aged 14 to 17 as well as three female teachers , who were all shot in cold blood .
The teen gunman killed a further three people as he fled the scene and went on a bloody rampage before shooting himself in the head in the parking lot of a car dealership in Wendlinger during an exchange of fire with police .
More pictures have also come to light of the gunman himself .
Just how he went from an angelic - faced young boy and a keen table tennis player to a teen killer has left many baffled .
But new reports have surfaced revealing Tim Kretschmer was suffering from depression and had been seeing a psychiatrist .
Herbert Rech ( CDU ) , Interior Minister of the state of Baden - Württemberg , was visibly moved when he spoke to the press yesterday : “ The gunman killed eight schoolgirls and one boy and shot dead three female teachers in the school building .
He also injured a further seven schoolgirls .
The fact that the vast majority of female victims is notable . ”
Did Kretschmer hate girls because he was unpopular with them ?
Rech added : “ The killer shot most of his victims in the head , which shows that they were n’t random targets . ”
Shoolgirls Selina Dogan , Chantal Schill and Jana Schober ( † 14 ) were all killed in their classroom , a place they felt safe .
The young boy who died was Ibrahim Yeniay , who was of Albanian origin .
A neighbour told BILD : “ Sometimes I met Tim in the park .
He always complained about one of his teachers .
" He said that she bullied him and threatened him that if he continued as he was he would end up on the rubbish heap .
He completely hated her , as he did all women in general . ”
The injured were brought into hospitals where doctors were still working hard to save them on Wednesday evening .
At least two schoolgirls are in intensive care in the clinic in Backnang .
Dieter Schneider from the Baden - Würtemberg police said : “ The killing spree was planned .
The killer wanted to create a bloodbath . ”
Victims of the bloodbath - Eyewitness accounts 1.34 pm : 3 schoolboys : 1st boy : " We were sitting in lessons and then suddenly there was a loud bang and we thought that the school was all going to break down .
Then our teacher went out to see what was going on .
Then there was another loud bang and he locked the door . “ 2nd boy : " Some people went out of the window onto the ladder and then jumped down . " 3rd boy : " And then everyone cried : Attention , gunman running amok !
And some people above shouted " call an ambulance " 2nd boy : " It was all so horrible ! “ ( RTL Punkt12 ) 1 / 16 vorheriges Element nächstes Element

During a presentation on Saturday at the Southern California Linux Expo ( SCALE ) , Mozilla evangelist Chris Blizzard discussed some of new features that will be included in the next version of the Firefox Web browser .
He demonstrated how several emerging standards - based Web technologies can be used together to produce impressively sophisticated Web applications .
The Firefox Web browser got a massive overhaul for version 3 with a multitude of significant improvements and useful new features .
Mozilla is currently preparing to ship Firefox 3.1 , an incremental release that builds on the strengths of 3.0 and delivers valuable enhancements for Web developers .
Some of the experimental new capabilities that are going to be introduced in 3.1 could someday redefine the way that Web applications are used and designed .
Web applications are increasingly adopting JSON as a format for data interchange instead of conventional XML .
Because JSON is syntactically identical to conventional JavaScript data structures , Web developers often parse it with the eval function .
This approach is plagued with security problems and also suffers from mediocre performance .
Firefox 3.1 will include a native JSON parser that can be used by Web applications instead of eval .
Preliminary testing has indicated that the native JSON parser in Firefox delivers significant performance gains .
This feature could soon be broadly used by Web application developers because Microsoft intends to include its own fully compatible implementation in Internet Explorer 8 .
Another impressive feature that Web application developers will be able to take advantage of in Firefox 3.1 is support for worker threads , which provide support for concurrent execution in JavaScript .
Worker threads will make it possible to perform complex computations in the background , so that the browser and Web application do n't hang or become unresponsive .
The HTML 5 video element will also arrive in Firefox 3.1 .
This will allow video content to be embedded directly in Web pages , controlled with JavaScript , and manipulated through the DOM .
It 's a major step forward for rich media content on the Web .
Firefox 3.1 will ship with built - in support for the Ogg Vorbis and Theora formats — open audio and video codecs that are believed to be unencumbered by patents .
The actual codec implementations are integrated directly into the browser itself , so content in those formats will be playable without requiring any external components or plugins .
Blizzard says that Mozilla aims to encourage an explosion of creativity around video that will mirror the kind of uninhibited innovation that has flourished in the Web 's inclusive standards - base ecosystem .
Mozilla is actively contributing funding to Ogg development efforts to help accelerate the process .
He says that Theora , which is used by Wikipedia , has the potential to achieve quality comparable to MPEG4 .
High definition video , however , will require the Dirac format , which could eventually be included in future versions of Firefox when it matures .
To illuminate the possibilities that are unlocked by these new features , Blizzard showed several technical demos .
One of the demos used the HTML 5 video element to display a space shuttle launch .
As the video played , JavaScript code running on the page used the video time index to retrieve launch data from a JavaScript array and draw graphs that show the shuttle 's speed and altitude increasing during the launch .
You can check out the demo yourself , if you are running a Firefox nightly build .
The most impressive demo that he showed during his presentation used JavaScript in worker threads to programmatically detect motion in a playing video .
This one has to be seen to be believed :
The presentation also discussed several other new features , including SVG filters for HTML , cross-site XMLHttpRequest , DNS prefetching , and embedded font support .
For a complete overview of the presentation and some instructive source code examples , you can read Blizzard 's slides , which are available from his personal blog .
In the late 70s a group of lesbians in Leeds , known as revolutionary feminists ( RFs ) , made a controversial move that resonated loudly for me and many other women .
They began calling for all feminists to embrace lesbianism .
Appealing to their heterosexual sisters to get rid of men " from your beds and your heads " , they started a debate , which reached its height in 1981 with the publication of an infamous booklet , Love Your Enemy ?
The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism ( LYE ) .
In this , the RFs wrote that , " all feminists can and should be lesbians .
Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman - identified woman who does not fuck men .
It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women . "
The message of LYE immediately provoked a strong and often negative reaction .
While some radical feminists agreed with the group 's arguments , many went wild at being told they were " counter - revolutionaries " , undermining the fight for women 's liberation by sleeping with men .
The main author of LYE , Sheila Jeffreys , says that the backlash to the booklet " even among lesbians , was quite shocking .
Quite a few were angry with the group for writing it .
They felt it exposed them to hostility from outraged heterosexual feminists . "
It 's no surprise that the booklet was so controversial .
" We think serious feminists have no choice but to abandon heterosexuality , " it reads .
" Only in the system of oppression that is male supremacy does the oppressor actually invade and colonise the interior of the body of the oppressed . "
It also asserted that penetration " is more than a symbol , its function and effect is the punishment and control of women " .
Tina Crockett was one of the RFs who gathered in a holiday cottage in the Yorkshire Dales to write LYE .
She says that while the booklet 's insistence that lesbianism could be a choice was controversial , debate was equally heated around the suggestion that men were the enemy .
" We were trying to challenge the excuses used by some heterosexual feminists as to why they lived with Nigel or John , " she says .
" They said , ' Oh , but my man is OK , ' as a way of refusing to look at the fact that some men really do hate women . "
Alison Garthwaite was another of the authors , and she stands by the original argument .
" Sexuality is not determined by a gene which we are born with , " she says .
" It can change over time , and is determined by both your circumstances and the choices you make . "
Garthwaite is keen to reassure heterosexual feminists , however , that their role in feminism is not redundant or unwanted .
" Perhaps the original paper implied that heterosexual feminists were of no use , and that they need not bother .
I do n't think that . "
Both Crockett and Garthwaite can see why LYE upset people .
" The arguments in LYE were a stick of dynamite up a very cosy feminist convention , " says Crockett , " that heterosexual feminists must never be criticised for choosing men over women . "
The publication of LYE was the one of the first times that the notion of sexuality as a choice had been publicly raised in the UK women 's movement .
Many feminists considered sexuality purely a matter of personal desire , and the idea that lesbianism could be a political decision was perceived as " cold - blooded " .
" They believed that one did not choose sexual orientation or feelings , but was overcome by them , " says Jeffreys .
" One could accept them or struggle against them , but not manufacture them . "
The feminist writer Bea Campbell was one of LYE 's many detractors , arguing that it was far more important to challenge men's behaviour in heterosexual relationships than to insist that women abandon hope altogether .
" The notion of political lesbianism is crazy , " she says .
" It erased desire .
It was founded , therefore , not on love of women but fear of men . "
Another feminist critic was the academic Lynne Segal , who has written in celebration of heterosexuality .
" For me , coming into feminism at the beginning of the 70s , ' political lesbianism ' was the main position advanced by a tiny band of vanguardist women , " she says .
" Its stance was tragic , because no , all men were not the enemy . "
She adds that the media used LYE to " trash " feminism in general .
" That inevitably added to the bitterness we felt , both then , and ever since . "
For all those who bridled at its message though , there were women who took the arguments in LYE to heart .
The booklet described lesbianism in glowing terms , which was quite something back in the 70s - after all , out women still face prejudice and exclusion ( just yesterday , the Sun used the pejorative " lesbo " in a headline about Iceland 's interim PM ) .
Some women threw out boyfriends and husbands after taking note of claims such as this : " Being a heterosexual feminist is like being in the resistance in Nazi- occupied Europe where in the daytime you blow up a bridge , in the evening you rush to repair it . "
Others , such as myself , found that the arguments in LYE spoke directly to feelings that had already been developing .
Opponents of political lesbianism argue that " genuine " lesbians are motivated purely by lust towards women , rather than a decision to reject men and heterosexuality .
For me , however , my lesbianism is intrinsically bound up with my feminist politics and my campaigning against sexual violence .
When I was growing up on a council estate in Darlington , the expectation was that I would one day marry a local boy , settle down and start producing kids .
Frankly , the thought horrified me .
I was surrounded by men - my father and two brothers - and at an early age I had picked up on the stories of domestic violence , child abuse and general unhappiness that seemed to emanate from neighbouring households .
I was also struck by the drudgery on display .
While men were out drinking , embarking on fishing trips and generally enjoying their freedom , women were stuck cooking for them , cleaning for them , and running around after children .
For women , heterosexuality seemed a total con .
At 15 then , having only ever had one , non-serious , boyfriend , I came out as a lesbian .
Three years later , I moved to Leeds in search of the scary - sounding feminists I had heard about and , having joined a group that campaigned against pornography , finally met the RFs .
They engaged me in discussions about heterosexuality in the pub , and critiquing this mainstream sexual culture made sense to me - after all , the women I had met during my childhood clearly had n't benefited from it .
The RFs told me that , to them , lesbianism was a choice that women could make , and not a " condition " we are born with .
" All women can be lesbians " was the mantra .
I loved the sense that I had chosen my sexuality and rather than being ashamed or apologetic about it , as many women were , I could be proud , and see it as a privilege .
Many of those who embraced political lesbianism in the 70s and 80s still keep the faith today .
For Jeffreys , for instance , the arguments in LYE are as relevant now as they were 30 years ago .
" We made the decision to become lesbians because loving and fighting for women was the centre of our lives , and for me it still is .
It made little sense to spend our whole time working for women 's liberation and to then go home to men . "
Crockett also says she stands by the sentiments in the paper , but wishes it had not only focused on the negative aspects of heterosexuality .
" We should have said , ' Come on in , the water 's lovely , ' because actually , it is really great fun being a lesbian . "
To me , political lesbianism continues to make intrinsic sense because it reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice , and we are not destined to a particular fate because of our chromosomes .
I also suspect that it is very difficult to spend your daily life fighting against male violence , only to share a bed with a man come the evening .
Then there 's the fact that working with women towards a common goal means you develop a strong and passionate bond with them - why some feminists then block out the possibility of sexual relationships with their political sisters and instead turn to men for intimacy is beyond me .
I think it 's time for feminists to re-open the debate about heterosexuality , and to embrace the idea of political lesbianism .
We live in a culture in which rape is still an everyday reality , and yet women are blamed for it , as it is viewed as an inevitable feature of heterosexual sex .
Domestic violence is still a chronic problem for countless women in relationships with men .
Women are told we must love our oppressors , while , as feminists , we fight to end the power afforded them as a birthright .
Come on sisters , you know it makes sense .
Stop pretending you think lesbianism is an exclusive members ' club , and join the ranks .
I promise that you will not regret it .

BBC News , Rajasthan
The army is now seen as less than attractive by many potential recruits
" Your mission is to move to the area marked Charlie Papa One Six and fire on receiving the command . "
Maj Amit Sood sits on top of his Russian - designed T - 72 tank surrounded by soldiers from his unit , as he traces his finger across a map mounted in front .
" Does anyone have any doubts ? " he asks his men , all dressed in olive - green battle fatigues .
" No Sir , " they shout in unison before scrambling off to board their tanks .
Ear splitting explosions
We 're in the Rajasthan desert in western India , less than an hour 's drive from the Pakistan border , witnessing an Indian army training exercise .
What motivates recruits at India 's top military academy ?
In pictures
Minutes after the order , the tanks roar across the sandy landscape , their giant wheels churning up dust , as they zero in on their target .
A burst of ear splitting explosions follow - and then plumes of smoke to denote a perfect hit .
The " enemy " had been eliminated .
As tensions rise with Pakistan after the Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks , the movements of the Indian army have taken on a new urgency .
No one actually believes a confrontation will take place but the intent to signal a state of readiness is clear .
All this at a time when the Indian army , the world 's fourth largest , is also facing a major crisis , one that could affect its battle - readiness .
It 's facing a shortage of more than 11,000 officers - many of them from middle ranks such as Maj Sood , men who would actually lead it in battle .
That is something of major concern to the government .
On Monday , the Indian army chief , Gen Deepak Kapoor , said he felt the armed forces were no longer an attractive career option for young Indians .
Maverick Scotsman
" Post - independence , our youth would forego much higher paying job opportunities to serve in the military , " the Press Trust of India quoted him as saying .
It 's feared there may not be enough officers to lead men into battle " But some of [ that ] ethos has perhaps undergone a bit of change . "
It 's the spirit of adventure and sense of history that have drawn men like Maj Amit Sood to the army .
He serves in the Skinner 's Horse regiment , one of the oldest in the Indian army which was set up by a maverick Scotsman in 1803 .
His father also served in the same regiment and a large portrait of him adorns the regiment 's ornate mess , which also has regalia from the various campaigns the unit has fought through the years - the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and the Anglo - Afghan campaigns of the 19th Century .
But increasingly , you also find people like Maj Amar Kwatra .
A fourth - generation , highly - decorated army officer whose grandfather fought for the Royal Indian army in World War I , he has left the army to fly private jets for the rich and famous .
As he casts his eye over a gleaming Hawker 750 eight - seater aircraft in a private hanger at Delhi airport , Maj Kwatra talks about his frustration with the army .
" I was disillusioned - there were many things that bothered me .
" I mean , no one joins the army for the money but you have to draw the line somewhere .
You need a basic minimum to maintain your standard of living . "
Like many officers , Major Kwatra believes that it takes too long to make your way up the ranks and that the armed forces no longer command the respect they used to .
National pride
At the stately Ministry of Defence headquarters in Delhi , it 's something that has not gone unnoticed .
" We have taken a number of measures including improving pay and taking on board recommendations that would help improve career prospects , " says India 's Minister of State for Defence , Pallam Raju .
Many army recruits forego much higher paying job opportunities
But he acknowledges that the government can never compete with the private sector .
" The economic downturn has meant that jobs in government or the armed forces may still be attractive .
But we can not take it for granted .
Eventually when the economy improves , the private sector becomes a much more attractive option , " he says .
Many Indians joined the army after the country 's independence because of a sense of national pride but also because it offered a stable income .
The army also offered a relatively comfortable life in large cantonments with plenty of institutional support - hospitals , schools and subsidised rations .
' Straight into battle '
That 's one reason why quite a few Indians still head to the elite Indian Military Academy ( IMA ) , set up during British colonial rule along the lines of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The cadets are initiated into a tough , regimented life - that includes waking up at 0430 , military drills , commando training , 11 km ( 6.9 miles ) cross-country runs carrying a 10kg load and plenty of firing practice .
" When he is finally commissioned from here , the cadet will have the qualities of leadership and intellect imbibed in him , " says Lt Gen RS Sujlana , who heads the IMA .
" From here they 'll go straight into battle - in Jammu and Kashmir and the north - east , " he adds , referring to counter - insurgency operations almost exclusively conducted by the army .
Increasingly , and especially after the Mumbai attacks , the focus is shifting towards counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency operations , which is reflected in the cadets ' training .
In a new drill conducted at a special facility at the IMA , top recruits are trained in close - combat fighting .
Armed with Insas rifles they burst into a building .
Moving from room - to - room in semi- darkness they fire at cut - out models representing militants holding hostages .
" It is to train them for operations in built - up , urban centres , something which is increasingly relevant in the present environment , " says their instructor , Lt Col Gunpal Singh .
It 's a role that represents a new challenge for the Indian army .
The question is - can they still find the men to lead them in battle ?

Becoming a Grass Farmer
by Bruce Eckel
January 26 , 2009
Summary
Since my ( personally ) revolutionary experiences with ( 1 ) dynamic languages and ( 2 ) open spaces conferences , I have been trying to understand how these revolutions happen .
This presentation from the TED conference has given me some insights .
Advertisement
Here 's the presentation ( the part I 'm talking about starts at 10:25 if you 're impatient , but the whole talk is only 18 minutes long ) .
Note that you can also get TED talks as audio podcasts through iTunes , and I 've found almost every one of them to be mind expanding , so I 've been listening to all of them .
( Aside : I had n't heard of the conference until someone pointed out a talk , and over time I 've become a fan .
Now I 've even thought of attending the conference , to meet like - minded people .
This makes a strong argument for capturing and distributing conference talks ; I 'm pretty sure we 've been increasing the size of the Java Posse Roundup by podcasting the discussions ) .
The part of Pollan 's TED talk that haunts me is his experience working with the innovative organic farmer .
They section off part of the farm , and let cows graze on it .
They move the cows , and let it sit for 3 days , during which time the maggots in the cow poop get all big and juicy , but do n't turn into flies .
At which time they release a bunch of chickens into the section , who love maggots and go tearing through the cow poop , scattering it all over and eating the maggots before they become flies .
At the same time , they are distributing high - nitrogen chicken poop all over the section .
When this is done , the section is left for a few weeks ( while the cows and chickens are off working other sections ) , and the most amazing grass grows in that section , sending roots down into the soil .
Then animals are brought back to eat this grass , which causes the roots to die back ( to match the length of the grass above the ground ) , aerating the soil and giving the various underground microbes sustenance .
The result : tremendous output of beef , chicken and eggs , etc. per acre , while at the same time enriching the soil .
With no pesticides or fertilizers .
What fascinates me about this is that it 's the same old tools , applied differently .
The farmer jokes about " being a grass farmer , " but by seeing that everything hangs on growing the best grass that you can , I think he has cracked the code of farming .
It 's the change in perspective that makes the difference .
In the case of farming , rearranging things so that every species gets what it wants the most .
I 've been asking myself why dynamic languages and open spaces work so well , not just because I 'm amazed but more importantly because I want to understand how to discover that " essence " that allows you to turn something into the best possible thing it can be .
Indeed , if you listen to this roundup session , you 'll hear me trying to figure it out for the daily working experience of software development ( I 'd like to create a company / group / association of developers that self - organizes the way an open - spaces conference does , but I have no idea how to accomplish that ) .
This idea of " essence " is also at the core of Domain - Driven Design , where you first discover the true nature of the Domain Model , and then the rest of the design flows from that ( however , I do think that sometimes there are overarching architectural issues that can supersede aspects of the domain model .
Perhaps Eric would argue that these then become part of the domain model ) .
So in the spirit of " make it about growing the best grass you can , everything else will follow , " here 's what I think might be the essences of some revolutionary ideas :
Dynamic Languages : Creativity .
Programmers want more than anything to create .
Give them more power to create , and they will be more creative .
On the other hand , teach them that programming is all about boundaries , and they will look for boundaries .
Is it any wonder that programmers who only learn Java in college want to know what the rules are , and assume that if the language does n't tell them what to do they are free to make stuff up ?
Open Spaces : Discussion .
People go to conferences because they hope to have interesting discussions .
Make the conference all about discussion , and it will be the best experience possible .
Agile : Honest Communication .
All the biggest problems in software development start when people feel they must prevaricate .
Little fibs eventually grow into giant fables , and everyone gets drawn into the deceit .
The essence of Agile / Lean / Scrum is making sure everyone involved knows what 's what , all the time , so that people can focus on producing software instead of bigger and bigger lies .
Business : Working Together .
You can certainly argue that forming a business is all about making money ( like running a farm is about producing beef and eggs ) , but I think that maybe the " grass " of business is that we want to experience the synergy of working together .
My thoughts on this subject are still very early but if the organizing principle is " how can we optimize the experience of working together ? " then I think we 'll see some very interesting results .
What other essential concepts are out there , which -- if we can see them and reorganize around them -- can completely change the experience of a thing ?
Talk Back !

It is like a Rubik 's Doughnut .
Well , the numbrosia game has some similarity .
Rotations are not limited to 3 , you can add or remove values to a row or column and the goal is to minimize the number of moves .
But I just realized that cells are restrained to 9 position .
In the following picture you can see that letters do n't mix .
A's remain A's , B remains B's , etc .
Each letter is called an orbit .
That means that the solution is unique ( each orbit has only one of each digit .
And with a little care , you can solve each orbit individually .

When Microsoft researchers think about the consumer technologies of the future , some of the physical touchstones of today , like sticky notes and souvenirs , take on digital form .
Researchers from all over the world converged on Microsoft 's main campus yesterday to show off their latest projects in a hall set up like a school science fair .
All the programs and gadgets on display were works in progress , and only some will make it into real - world technology .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But even as the software maker tightens its belt to survive the economic downturn , it has pledged to continue spending money on research that does n't neatly translate into profits .
Researchers from Cambridge travelled to the annual meeting , dubbed TechFest , with a series of prototypes meant for the home .
One , called Family Archive , is the digital equivalent of stuffing memorabilia and photographs haphazardly into a box and tossing it in the basement .
David Kirk , one of the Cambridge researchers , plugged a thumb drive into the device , which looks like a portable kitchen cart with an embedded touch screen .
Digital pictures splashed onto the screen , and Kirk could spin and zoom by dragging his fingers across the surface - much like how Microsoft 's touch - screen Surface table is operated .
The program lets people create virtual boxes to stash photos , and eventually , videos .
It can also take a photo of an object placed on the surface and stash that , too .
Kirk said prototypes have been placed in three families ' living rooms , with surprising results , including the digital capture of at least one live kitten .
The Cambridge group also showed off a program to help archive digital ephemera , from photos to Twitter messages , along a timeline , and one that " hand - delivers " saved messages and reminders when people with linked Bluetooth phones stand in close proximity .
Researchers from the US and Asia demonstrated projects that fall into a category they call " augmented reality , " or adding a layer of digital information to the physical world .
Michael Cohen , a Redmond - based researcher , pointed a cell phone camera at a building facade .
On the phone screen , labels popped up , and Cohen described a scenario in which clicking on one would bring up the restaurant 's menu .
The underlying program matched the shapes and shades in what the camera " saw " to a stored image and its labels .
When Darren Edge , a Beijing - based researcher , turned a handheld webcam toward his own laptop , his screen switched into a mode that showed what his webcam saw - the computer , his desk - plus a chaotic layer of dozens of virtual sticky notes scattered on the screen .
The idea , he said , is to let the computer user store bits of information , photos and web bookmarks in a way that 's more like the physical world .
( He did not say whether he thought masses of sticky notes should be a computer user 's organisational paradigm . )
One of the researchers who brought Surface and its spherical cousin to TechFest was back , this time standing inside a handmade cardboard dome .
Instead of swiping his hands across a screen , he waved them above a camera - and - projector combination .
Each gesture zoomed or twirled Wilson and the reporters standing inside the dome through different types of three - dimensional data - a planetarium - style display of the universe , or a visual web - like representation of someone 's Facebook social network .
Another set of projects moved the touch - sensitive area to the back of hand - held devices , making it easier to navigate without blocking the content on small screens with big fingers .
Redmond researchers also continue to come up with ideas for tasks that should be doable from the car .
Michael Seltzer climbed into a mock - up of a driver 's seat .
An " earcon " - the audio equivalent of an icon - prompted him to listen to a computerized voice reading his text message , and he spoke back to the machine to send a quick text reply .
Other projects centred on saving power in data centres , improving web search and social networking and making better use of computers in schools in emerging markets .
Drug paraphernalia that Brian McNamee says he used to inject pitcher Roger Clemens has performance - enhancing substances on it , according to people briefed on the case , who were quoted anonymously in The New York Times on Tuesday .
McNamee has said he used syringes , vials and gauze pads to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone in 2000 and 2001 .
McNamee said he kept the items in a FedEx box in his basement .
A grand jury is investigating whether Clemens perjured himself in front of Congress when he denied using performance - enhancing substances .
Clemens said McNamee did inject him , but the substances were vitamin B - 12 and lidocaine , which is a painkiller .
" I assumed , and I am not surprised , that the tests were positive for both DNA and for performance - enhancing drugs , because that 's what Brian said all along , and there 's not much doubt that Brian 's been telling the truth , " McNamee 's lawyer , Richard Emery , told The Associated Press .
" The confirmation of that fact , once again , just seems to me to be another significant step towards jail for Clemens . "
Clemens ' attorney , Rusty Hardin , told The Times he was n't surprised at the report .
" Do you really think McNamee was going to fabricate this stuff and not make sure there were substances on there ?
The fact is Roger never used steroids or HGH , " Hardin said .
On PBS tonight , NOVA is presenting “ The Spy Factory , ” based on James Bamford ’s excellent book , The Shadow Factory .
PBS says the NOVA program :
chronicles the NSA ’s role in eavesdropping both before and after 9/11 .
Drawing on dozens of interviews with agency insiders and probing publicly available sources as well as transcripts of terrorist trials and an FBI chronology of the terrorists ’ movements , NOVA assembles a detailed picture of events leading up to the 9/11 attacks .
The program sheds light on the vital data known inside the NSA but only partly relayed to other agencies .
The trove of information the NSA had access to in advance included Osama bin Laden ’s now - disconnected direct satellite phone , which the NSA tapped starting in 1996 .
Exclusive footage shows the three - story house in Yemen that served as Al Qaeda ’s communications and logistics headquarters .
The NSA was listening in on phone communications to and from the house for years prior to the 9/11 attack .
Three times the size of the CIA and far more secret , the NSA is comprised of top linguists , mathematicians , and technologists trained to decipher all kinds of communicationsâ€ ” epitomizing the hidden world of high - tech , 21st - century surveillance .
To show how this eavesdropping operates , NOVA follows the trail of just one typical e-mail sent from Asia to the U.S.
Streaming as pulses of light into a fiber - optic cable , it travels across the Pacific Ocean , coming ashore in California , and finally reaching an AT&T facility in San Francisco , where the cable is split and the data sent to a secret NSA monitoring room on the floor below .
This enables the NSA to intercept not only most Asian e-mail messages but also the entire U.S. internal Internet traffic .
Thus , since 9/11 , the agency has turned its giant ear inward to monitor the communications of ordinary Americans , many of whom are on the government ’s secret watch list , now more than half - a- million names long .
But how effective is this monumental monitoring effort in countering security threats ?
The NSA is faced with an enormous and ever - expanding archive of phone calls and e-mail messages .
Many experts in data mining and analysis are skeptical about the value of collecting so much information without the ability to understand it , as it may lead to critical clues being lost in the static .
Among those interviewed on “ The Spy Factory ” are former NSA , CIA , and FBI analysts and officials , many speaking publicly for the first time .
Among these is Mark Rossini , the senior FBI agent in the CIA ’s Osama bin Laden tracking unit .
For the first time , Rossini tells how intelligence agency turf wars prevented him from notifying his FBI superiors that Al Qaeda terrorists were heading for the U.S. with valid visas in early 2000 .
Surprisingly , the 9/11 Commission never looked closely into the NSA ’s role in the broad intelligence breakdown behind the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks .
If they had , they would have understood the full extent to which the agency had major pieces of the puzzle but never put them together or disclosed their entire body of knowledge to the CIA and FBI .
Traditionally , the NSA did n’t share its raw data with those other agencies , an institutionalized reluctance that played a critical role in the failure to stop the 9/11 plotters .
In what Bamford calls “ one of the largest ironies in the history of American intelligence , ” he notes that weeks before the attacks , the terrorists were staying in a hotel near NSA headquarters in Maryland , almost within sight of the office of then - NSA Director Michael Hayden .
Hayden , who was later appointed director of the CIA by President Bush , was never held accountable for his agency ’s failure , and after 9/11 he spearheaded the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping activities in the name of making the nation safe from terrorists .
Addressing the question ,
Are we any safer now than we were before ? , Bamford says , “ We should have been safe the way it was .
NSA had all the information that it needed to stop the 9/11 hijackers .
It had laws that allowed it to track the hijackers . ”
Bamford adds that those same laws also protected the privacy of ordinary Americans in ways that have since vanished .
Human chain surrounds Parliament House , Canberra , February 3 , 2009 .

Green Left Weekly -- February 6 , 2009 --
We live in a peculiar , troubling time , where the world 's climate scientists are all but screaming from the rooftops for governments to listen and take urgent action to avert climate change .
Act without delay to end carbon emissions and work to draw carbon down from the atmosphere , they say , because the lives of literally billions of human beings are at risk if we fail .
But with perverse irresponsibility the governments are not listening to the scientists and the many others worried about the future .
They have ignored the arguments based on scientific fact and disregarded the moral imperative of preserving an inhabitable planet for future generations .
In a time when our government refuses to take the steps to secure the health and safety of our children and grandchildren , only one option really remains .
People need to reach out , organise and campaign for a safe climate future .
It 's because they know that the government and the market wo n't fix the climate crisis in time that more and more people are taking action themselves .
Australia 's Climate Action Summit , held in Canberra over four days from January 31 to February 3 , brought together many people from across Australia , inspired to make a difference .
More than 500 participants , representing well over 100 different Climate Action groups , peak groups and political parties , adopted of set of campaign objectives for 2009 .
The goals decided upon are , they concluded , ``in line with what science , and global justice , demands '‘.
The Climate Summit took place in a political context of the environmental movement having received an enormous slap in the face from the Australian government 's Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in December .
Australia 's emissions reduction target is a paltry 5 % by 2020 .
Rudd 's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) , meanwhile , is engineered to provide the biggest corporate polluters with free credits and even allows the most energy - intensive industries to expand future production .
Participants came together with a shared understanding that the movement needed to take a fresh , people - centred approach in light of the new government 's policies .
The growth of Climate Action groups around the country has shown the willingness of people to get involved .
Now a national network of climate change activists and groups was needed to coordinate and unite the various efforts .
Clive Hamilton , conference participant and author of Scorcher : the dirty politics of climate change commented on this solid grassroots dynamic of the climate movement , and its origins , in an article published on Crikey.com on February 4 :
The announcement of the [ CPRS ] was a king hit on the mainstream environment groups that had invested so much in working on the inside of the parliamentary process ...
Seduced into believing they can influence the Government , in truth they were crushed by the greenhouse mafia .
Fossil fuel delegations could get an hour of quality time with the minister , while environment groups felt lucky to have 15 minutes with a bored staffer .
This failure underlines the importance of the ‘ new environment movement ' , a surprisingly large network of community - based activist groups that came together in Canberra last weekend for the Climate Action Summit .
Led by a new generation of young people whose politics have not been shaped by the old movement , they represent a return to radical activism .
They are determined , angry , savvy and brave .
They believe that baby boomers are bequeathing to them a world much worse than the one the boomers inherited .
Their objective was perfectly captured in the words on a T - shirt worn by one of them : ``Unfuck the world ' ' .
Reality check
Day one of the summit began with an honest reminder of what is at stake and discussed how the task of winning a safe climate is easier to accept than to achieve .
In an opening plenary session , Hamilton explained the appalling influence of the ``greenhouse mafia ' ‘ in setting Australia 's climate policy .
The government 's CPRS was ``as if the government had announced a new tax on cigarettes , but exempted smokers from paying '‘.
`` Our only hope '‘ , Hamilton said , ``lies in a campaign of radical activism ...
Until the public demands it , far ranging actions wo n't happen . '‘
David Spratt , co-author of Climate Code Red , put forward the case for the movement to adopt a long - term target of 300 parts per million ( ppm ) of CO2 in the atmosphere and surveyed the findings of the most recent climate science .
He ridiculed the federal government 's official policy that assumes life on the planet can be preserved with 3° C of warming .
``Kevin Rudd 's target of 3° C warming is an end of the world target '‘ , Spratt pointed out .
Greenpeace climate change campaign coordinator John Hepburn also spoke on the opening panel .
He labeled the failure to tackle climate change as ``a failure of the Australian political system '‘.
Hepburn briefly outlined the scale of the changes climate campaigners need to aim for .
`` We need to shut down the coal industry as quickly as possible and move to achieve 100 % renewable energy '‘ , he said .
The final speaker , Jenny Curtis from the Balmain - Rozelle Climate Action Group , pointed out that ``despite the brilliance of what we have created , the movement so far has failed ' ' .
`` Our job is to build a new movement , a movement that leads to a whole system transformation '‘ , Curtis concluded .
Hope and determination
Over the following three days summit participants contributed to a highly productive discussion and examination of the campaign options .
In summary , the Climate Summit adopted three unifying objectives :
1 ) To prevent the Australian government 's proposed CPRS from becoming law .
2 ) To launch a campaign for 100 % renewable energy in Australia within 10 years -- drawing upon the example of Al Gore 's Repowering America campaign , which is backed by research from renewable energy experts from Stanford University among others .
3 ) To campaign for a long - term target of stabilising atmospheric CO2 at 300 p pm .
This corresponds with the most recent research conducted by the world 's leading climate scientist , James Hansen , and his team .
That the conference was able to unite on the goal of stopping the CPRS in 2009 is significant .
This was achieved despite the differences in the movement about whether some other form of emissions trading scheme could be a part of the solution .
Ultimately , participants agreed that activists can continue to discuss alternatives without preventing the unity necessary to stop the Australian Labor government 's atrocious scheme in its tracks this year .
The second objective of achieving 100 % renewable energy by 2020 was thoroughly discussed and debated at the summit .
The summit emphasised that the 100 % renewables campaign should be twinned with a clear call on the government to create green jobs and prioritise a ``just transition '‘ , which incorporates social justice for the workers and communities who currently make their living from unsustainable industries .
This overarching campaign -- or ``meta - theme ' ‘ as it was described by some summit attendees -- is intended to incorporate and unite the varied climate justice campaigns around the country , without impacting on the autonomy of any of these groups or campaigns .
Discussion and action
Alternative energy expert Mark Diesendorf , from the University of New South Wales , argued against the adoption of this particular objective .
In a plenary session on the third morning he said he strongly disagreed that 100 % renewable energy by 2020 is a realistic aim .
This goal could be achieved by 2040 at the earliest , he said .
However , the majority of the summit clearly differed with Diesendorf 's arguments .
A number of activists spoke from the floor to argue that the objective is the adequate emergency response required to confront a serious climate emergency .
Others pointed out that the available mix of renewable technology -- solar , solar thermal , wind , tidal and geothermal power -- could do the job , provided there was the political will .
That the conference also adopted the long - term target of 300 ppm of CO2 is very encouraging .
This was strengthened by an explicit call for the Australian government to adopt this goal and advocate it in international forums , in particular the Copenhagen summit in December .
Importantly , the summit also endorsed a framework of future actions .
It was made clear that these proposals were not intended to discourage Climate Action groups from determining their own campaigns and actions as well .
The future actions proposed by the summit were :
Actions outside the offcies of members of parliament or corporations to coincide with the release of the CPRS White Paper in March .
Nationally coordinated mass World Environment Day rallies on June 6 , 2009 , with the explicit purpose of publicly launching the campaign for 100 % renewable energy in 10 years .
Climate camp /s in September , inspired by the successful camp held in Newcastle in August 2008 .
Actions around the Copenhagen Summit in December .
The Climate Summit was not able to reach consensus on the kind of national climate network structure for the movement .
The summit resolved to continue the discussion and Climate Action groups will be asked to consider new proposals in the coming weeks .
The summit concluded with a protest action at Parliament House on the morning of February 3 , when 2500 people joined hands to completely encirclethe parliament with a human chain .
The symbolism of this action could hardly have been more apt .
It sent an unmistakable message from the climate justice movement to the politicians hiding inside -- we are many , you are few .

Feb. 19 , 2009  -- Former President Bill Clinton gives President Barack Obama an " A " grade for his first month in office , but tells ABC News that Obama needs to put on a more positive face when speaking to the American people about the economy and must keep pressure on Republicans who try to obstruct his plans .
" Look , the American people , I think , know the president has tried to reach out to Republicans , " Clinton told ABC News ' Chris Cuomo .
" And it takes two to tango .
I think there are some of them who really believe that just - say - no politics is good politics .
" It was -- briefly , only briefly -- in the '90s .
It is n't anymore , " he added .
" So , sooner or later , I think if he just keeps chugging along , just keeps the door open , invite 'em to every economic conference , invite 'em to every meeting , eventually , he 'll start getting some votes " in Congress .
Clinton gives former President George W. Bush a harsh review on the economy , however , blaming the Republican for the current fiscal crisis by not moving sooner to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
" I personally believe , based on my experience over the years with the economy , that if we moved aggressively on this home problem a year and a half ago , even a year ago , as much as 90 percent of the current crisis could have been avoided , " he said .
In a notable early showdown over a $ 787 billion economic stimulus proposal , only three Republicans in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives voted for the Obama - endorsed bill .
Regarding Obama 's bleak warnings that " the economy could get worse before it gets better , " and that the economic stimulus program is only the beginning of the end of the economic crisis , Clinton said , " I like the fact that he did n't come in and give us a bunch of happy talk .
I 'm glad he shot straight with us . "
But he added , " I just want the American people to know that he 's confident that we are gonna get out of this and he feels good about the long run . "
Clinton thinks Obama should talk to the public in greater depth about the economy .
" I like trying to educate the American people about the dimensions and scope of this economic crisis , " Clinton said .
" I just would like him to end by saying that he is hopeful and completely convinced we 're gonna come through this . "
He added that though the economic problems are large , he expects the stimulus money to help .
" I think you will see some good economic news from the stimulus fairly soon , " Clinton said .
" I think you 'll start to see people express gratitude for getting the unemployment benefits , the tax cuts and the food stamps .
And you 'll see the money flowing through the economy .
Then I think you 'll see every state be able to quantify how much better shape they 're in , because of the education and health money . "
Stimulus Good for Economy
Clinton , who presided over a balanced budget as president , said he views the $ 787 billion stimulus program as a " bridge over troubled water . "
He said he's not concerned with the massive amounts of spending in the legislation , because something needs to be done to revive the economy .
" I think it 's absolutely the right thing to do , " he said .
" And I 'm a fiscal conservative .
You know , I balanced the budget .
I paid $ 600 billion down on the debt to the American people .
I do n't like deficit spending .
He has no choice .
The economy is contracting .
He has to prop it up . "
Clinton Admits Mistakes
Though Clinton largely defended his own economic record , he admitted fault for lack of regulation on derivatives during his eight years as president , a problem some economists believe helped contribute to the nation 's economic woes .
" I think we should have moved a little more aggressively on these derivatives , " he said .
" Alan Greenspan and others thought we should n't regulate , did n't need to regulate derivatives , ' cause they would only be bought by very large , very wealthy , very sophisticated institutional buyers .
" The problem is [ that ] if enough of 'em are bought , they become so much a part of the economy that if they crater , they still affect everybody else , anyway , " he added .
" So , I think I should have done more on that . "
But the former president defended his record on another front :
He disputed the idea that his administration , by placing a special emphasis on the Community Reinvestment Act , pressured lenders too hard to make loans to low - income Americans trying to secure mortgages .
" What I have disputed is that the conservatives are saying that I pressured the banks too hard to make loans in the community , " Clinton said .
" The banks that took money from their depositors and turned around and loaned money to their depositors -- genuine community banks -- came through this financial crisis much better than those that were branches of big national banks [ that ] took money from their depositors and put 'em in these shaky securities investments . "
He suggested the worst damage was done during the Bush years .
" The sub - prime mortgages that caused all these problems were basically those that were gathered up in 2004 to 2007 , " Clinton said .
Obama Gets an 'A '
So , how does Clinton rate the new president 's first month on the job ?
" A , " he told Cuomo .
" They 've gotten their stimulus through in record time , and I think in pretty good shape .
Like I said , it may be a little ragged around the edges , but they 'll be able to continue .
" You hire presidents to keep big bad things from happening , " Clinton said , " or when something big and bad has happened , to fix it , and to seize big opportunities , and to push the country in the right direction , to keep working toward the more perfect union .
" And so , he comes in , " Clinton continued , " he 's got an economic crisis at home , and a crisis in America 's role in the world .
He has to pick people to deal with this .
I think he picked excellent economic and national security teams . "
The former president joked his grade may have been boosted by Obama 's pick for one of those posts -- his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
" You know , you have to discount for the fact that ...
I give him a high rate for his choice of secretary of state , " Clinton said .
" That 's an A - plus - plus . "
But the overall grade might drop to " A , " Clinton said , because he believes the Obama administration unnecessarily caved in to demands to remove a $ 7,500 credit for electric cars .
Fighting Obesity
Clinton also used the interview to talk at length about the problem of obesity , the number one public health problem for American children , and an issue he has set his sights on after using his charitable foundation to take on big issues , such as worldwide AIDS and malaria .
" We actually are at risk of having the first generation of Americans to live shorter lives than their parents , because the obesity rates are so high among our young kids , " Clinton said .
The solution to the epidimic , Clinton said , is for kids to eat better , eat less and exercise more .
He wants to take the fight to where the children are , so he said he 's negotiated agrements with the beverage and snack food industries to reduce the aggregate calories on vending machine items in schools .
" We 've been at this now for a couple of years , " he said .
" There is some evidence that all of the publicity and efforts that have been done may have caused the rate to level off .
" But that 's not good enough , " he added .
" We got to take it down .
We got to restore the health of our younger generation .
And I intend to keep working on it until either we get the results or I can't do it anymore . "

The second mark of existence is suffering .
The Sanskrit word for suffering is dukha .
This word has been translated in various ways — as pain , dissatisfaction , struggle , existential hassle and inconvenience , even as fundamental anxiety .
This wide range of definitions is actually quite accurate and helpful , because it points our attention toward the many ways in which we experience dukha .
In fact , the Buddha taught that it occurs on three distinct but interconnected levels .
So this teaching is sometimes called The Three Kinds of Suffering .
First there is basic , all - pervading suffering , which arises from our choiceless experience of impermanence .
This suffering has four aspects : birth , sickness , old age and death .
You may recall that when Siddhartha , the future Buddha , escaped his father ’s palace , he witnessed suffering for the first time : a sick man by the road , an old man walking painfully along and a corpse being carried to the cremation ground on the riverbank .
These vivid images re-appeared when he taught the first level of dukha .
Here , the most relevant definition of dukha is that of existential hassle or inconvenience .
It is the hassle inherent in how impermanence impacts each of us .
It is the basic limitation of the condition of being born into a human body .
Although it may unfold on different timetables and with different degrees of apparent grace or awkwardness , it unfolds in the same fundamental way for all of us .
And it begins at birth , which is a shift from our conventional way of viewing birth as cause for celebration .
The implication here is that birth is a cause for celebration from the point of view of the community as a whole , the family or the clan — because it expresses the sense of continuity of life .
But for each individual , birth is an expression of separation , and the beginning of a journey that must be made alone .
Indeed , the moment when a baby emerges from the warmth of the womb — after having been merged and meshed so intimately with the mother — the moment the umbilical cord is cut can be a shocking moment of confused awakening .
The cord that has connected us to a life support system that endlessly feeds and sustains us , though the process of nurturing continues if we are lucky enough to be born into a nurturing situation , still the basic separation has already occurred .
The rest of our life journey only reinforces this truth .
It is interesting to reflect that in our culture , when people are old and sick and no longer able to sustain their physical lives by themselves , their families often
decide to put them on life support , mimicking the mother ’s all - encompassing support for her child in the period before birth - with an artificial womb of metal machinery , plastic tubes and chemical fluids .
Death here refers not just to the inevitable , final physical cessation of our life , but it is also the way we experience impermanence from moment to moment .
When we really pay attention , we notice that we cannot really hold onto anything in our experience because it keeps shifting .
It is fundamentally fickle and uncertain , despite a more general background of predictability , repetition , routine and habit that characterizes the context in which our lives are lived .
This dance of birth and death on the moment - to - moment level is continuous — the reality of working with a constant sense of challenge presented by new situations , the reality of not being able to hold on to old situations .
This energy keeps us off balance .
In fact , one of the definitions of old age is that we are less and less able to maintain our balance in the midst of this fickleness and uncertainty .
The momentum of change is too confusing and threatening , and we take refuge in predictable routines , nostalgic memories or inflexible opinions .
And from this point of view , sickness occurs when the stress of riding this energy overwhelms us , and we get off the relentless merry - go - round for awhile .
And of course the truth of sickness gives us little reminders all the time — even when we catch a mild cold — that our life is not an invulnerable fortress that we can maintain indefinitely against all internal and external threats .
And the truth of old age — whether we experience it ourselves or see it in someone whom
we remember as vital and strong — is poignant and devastating .
As one elderly friend said to me quite recently , “ It ’s just one physical insult after another . ”
The second suffering is called the pain of alternation .
The Buddha taught that this suffering happens to us in three ways : first , as the pain of not getting what we want in life ; second , as the pain of losing what we have and were attached to ( also referred to as getting what we do n’t want ) ; and finally , the pain of getting what we want , and then later not wanting it anymore .
Try and think of an example of each of these , either personal or in the world around us .
Perhaps we do n’t get the position we wanted so badly — not only that , but someone we know gets it .
We lose our job and can no longer make our house payments and have to sell it ; the stock market crashes and wipes out our retirement nest - egg .
Our lover rejects us just when we thought everything was going so well .
Or we fall out of love , and telling the truth to our partner is so painful that we engage in deception , or else we are brave enough to tell the truth , and then experience the empty - heartedness of being alone again , but older ( and none the wiser for it ! ) .
Or we finally get that new house , car or outfit we ’ve been wanting , then get bored with it and begin to take it for granted .
So this is part of our psychological response to the underlying fickleness of the first level of suffering .
In the face of the unfolding of the impermanence on that direct , visceral level , we grasp at its highlights , so to speak .
We look for ways of perching comfortably and happily in the midst of this flow , and occasionally we succeed … for awhile .
But this process too is subject to impermanence ; whether because of the fickleness of external circumstances which we cannot control , or the fickleness of our longing and dissatisfaction .
I believe it was a French philosopher who said , memorably , “ Life is nothing but our constant desire to live and our constant dissatisfaction with living . ”
So this dance of desire and dissatisfaction is at the root of the pain of alternation .
Our psychology is such that we always hope that our recurrent and unceasing desire can be satisfied by some object outside of us .
But this hope for satisfaction contains the seeds of its own frustration .
This search for fulfillment in something external to us - as we ’ve discussed in previous articles - is the underlying psychology of materialism .
In clinging to life , we are grasping at what by its nature will eventually slip through our fingers or simply exhaust its ability to satisfy us .
The accumulated impact of the first two levels of suffering ultimately leads to a third , which the Buddha called the pain of pain itself .
Our struggle with the suffering of the first two levels inevitably makes the whole thing more painful still .
It is here that the sense of dukha being underlying anxiety comes into
play .
In our struggle to relate to the ongoing experience of hassle , longing and dissatisfaction , we experience a sense of disappointment and anxiety .
In the face of all the pain we have dealt with before this , we begin to panic .
We begin to feel that we are losing the game of life .
One thinks of Jean - Paul Sartre ’s “ No Exit . ”
It is a existential panic , a vague but growing realization that there seems to be no way out of this cycle and that we are running out of time .
We defend against this growing sense of disillusionment and panic by becoming careful , cynical , armored and less spontaneous .
We retreat into a posture of denial .
And this defensiveness , this gradually increasing tightness in our being and the insensitivity and numbness that accompany it , this taking our suffering and ourselves seriously — this attitude only accelerates our suffering .
It is a vicious circle .
So this is the predicament that the Buddha saw as universal for human beings .
Confronted with the truth of impermanence , we proceed through our increasingly complex and defensive strategies to manipulate , avoid , or outwit it — all of which , doomed to failure , actually intensify our experience of suffering .
The more cleverly and energetically we try to find a way out , the worse things get .
When life is seen in this way , it is stark — and at first undeniably depressing .
This teaching has given Buddhism an historical reputation among Western scholars for being gloomy .
But it is depressing only from the wishful , self - deceiving perspective of ego .
This realization can actually be an invaluable wake - up call for us .
It might prod us to have curiosity about how we came to be caught in such a seemingly airtight trap .
From the point of view of the warrior — a Buddha - in - progress , if you will — this view of life is the good news .
It is an inspiration to look further , to find out more .
This is what the Buddha did .
And we could do the same .
The First Noble Truth , that of The Truth of Suffering , was the Buddha ’s first teaching after his awakening .
It is significant to appreciate that Buddha taught about suffering in these two ways : as a mark of existence , and as a Noble Truth .
The first was clinical ; the second , inspirational .
He called it a “ noble ” truth .
He did n’t call it the first lousy truth , or trivial truth , or insulting truth , or depressing truth .
Why is this ?
Because he wanted to communicate that if we were willing to go into the suffering with enough openness , enough bravery , honesty and curiosity — then the suffering had tremendous richness , and a tremendous amount to teach us about how to live as genuine human beings .
He was saying that when we finally stop evading , ignoring , denying , sugar - coating this truth , stop entertaining ourselves continually in order to pretend it is n’t there — when we finally stop , look directly at it , take it completely to heart , and recognize that it applies not only to us but to all others who share this world with us — then the recognition of suffering could lead us to begin to actually enjoy our lives , to what the Buddha termed liberation , to a deeper compassion for our friends , those we do n’t know well and those we actively dislike .
For when we drop the defenses against the truth of impermanence and the concepts that separate us from others , from life altogether , our world opens up .
It is in the recognition of shared suffering that we might glimpse the possibility that all people are our kin , not just those near and dear to us .
So suffering becomes a gateway to a larger experience of our life .

A chemical used to protect objects from woodworm is the secret to the success of the Stradivarius violin , a scientist has claimed .
Buy a violin now
Professor Joseph Nagyvary of Texas A&M University , who has studied the famous instruments for several decades , said he believes preservative borax was used on the violins , which helped to create their unique tonal quality .
He stated that borax was also potentially used on violins made by the Guarneri family , which were produced at the same time as the Stradivarius and are held in similarly high esteem .
Guarneri and Stradivarius violins are very rare and their designs are often copied by modern instrument manufacturers .
In 2008 , Sotheby 's sold a Guarneri once owned by Henri Vieuxtemps to multi-millionaire Maxim Viktorov for what it claimed was a world record amount .
The exact price was not revealed , but Sotheby 's suggested it was a significantly larger sum than the previous record of $ 3.54 million ( £ 2.45 million ) .

From MSNBC :
A friend of Grant ’s [ the man killed by BART cops ] who was with him on the crowded Oakland train station platform at the time of the shooting said Grant pleaded with officers not to harm him .
“ Oscar yelled , ‘ You shot me !
I got a four - year - old daughter , ” ‘ said Fernando Anicete .
“ Oscar was telling us to calm down and we did .
We were n’t looking for any trouble . ”
Burris claims the shooting was intentional , and that he planned to ask Alameda County prosecutors to seek criminal charges against the officer .
Burris said Grant , of Hayward , Calif. , posed no threat to officers when a bullet entered his back and ricocheted to his lung area , killing him almost instantly .
“ The officer leaned ( in ) , was straddling over him and pointed his gun directly into the backside and shot ( Grant ) , ” said Burris , adding that Grant was handcuffed — after he was shot .
“ This was not a deadly force situation . ”

The NHS computer system has been hit by costly delays
The Conservatives are considering plans for a £ 100 m cap on government IT contracts to prevent " white elephants " such as the NHS computer system .
Instead of awarding long - term contracts to large IT companies they could open up the procurement process to smaller firms using " open source " software .
A report drawn up for Shadow Chancellor George Osborne claims potential savings could reach £ 600 m a year .
The Tories say Labour has wasted billions on " catastrophic " IT projects .
The report , by Dr Mark Thompson , of Judge Business School at Cambridge University , is being studied by the shadow chancellor as part of the Conservatives ' detailed preparations for government .
' Modernising government '
Mr Osborne said : " The Conservative Party is looking to the future .
We have led the debate on using open source software in government , and I 'm delighted that Dr Mark Thompson has come forward with these detailed recommendations .
" These proposals are n't just about saving money - they 're about modernising government , making the public sector more innovative and improving public services . "
He said he wanted to hear views from the public and the IT industry about the proposals .
The Conservatives claim the government wasted billions on failed IT projects , including the computerised patient record system for the NHS in England , the cost of which has soared from an initial estimate of £ 2bn to £ 12bn , and which has been subject to a series of delays .
The Committee on Public Accounts earlier threw fresh doubt on the 2015 deadline for the project .
The government has scaled back some IT projects in recent years .
In 2006 , it scrapped plans for a single multi-billion pound system for the national identity register , with the information to be held on three existing , separate databases instead .
But the Conservatives say millions more could be saved by moving away from the current government practice of outsourcing IT projects to a small number of large contractors .
' Level playing field '
Dr Thompson 's report calls for an " open " system of IT procurement , involving a much wider range of contractors , including innovative start - up companies .
It recommends the adoption of open data standards across government , in effect creating a common " language " for government IT systems .
This would reduce licensing costs and free government bodies from long - term monopoly supply contracts , the report says .
" This means that the UK government should never again need to sign an IT software contract worth over £ 100 m - so no more IT " white elephants , " it adds .
Dr Thompson said his report " shows how government could save hundreds of millions of pounds a year by creating a more open IT procurement process - including levelling the playing field for open source software " .
" It is n't rocket science - it 's about creating a modern and efficient procurement system .
Governments and companies around the world are making use of open source software , and we could achieve much more here in the UK , " he added .

Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings ; Evidence of Advanced Civilization in the Ice Age
by Dr. Charles Hapgood
Reviewed by Dan Glover 3/3/99
This book gives compelling evidence that there existed advanced civilizations prior to any that we are now aware of .
Scholars have long dismissed legends and myths of such civilizations as mere story - telling and embellishment by our ancestors .
Dr. Charles Hapgood studied what he considered copies of ancient maps and came to some very startling conclusions .
In 1929 , a map was found , painted on parchment , and dated in the month of Murharrem in the Muslim calendar year 919 , which is 1513 by the Christian calendar .
This map was signed with the name Piri Ibri Haji Memmed , a Turkish admiral ( " Re'is " ) and became known as the Piri Re 'is map .
The map aroused interest because it appeared to be one of the earliest maps of the Americas .
Examination showed that this map differed significantly from all other maps of America drawn in the 16th century in that it showed South America and Africa in correct relative longitudes .
This was remarkable because navigators in the 16th century had no means of finding longitude except by guesswork .
Another detail excited researchers as well .
In one of the legends inscribed on the map , Piri Re 'is stated that he based the western part of it on a map drawn by Christopher Columbus .
This was very exciting , as for several centuries geographers had been trying without success to find a " lost map of Columbus " supposed to have been drawn by him in the West Indies .
Piri Re 'is made several interesting statements about his source maps .
He used about twenty , he said , and stated that several had been drawn in the time of Alexander the Great .
Scholars who studied the map in the 1930s could prove neither statement , but it appears now that both statements were true .
After a time , scholars lost interest in the map and it was not accepted as a map by Columbus .
No more was heard of the map until 1956 , when a Turkish naval officer brought a copy of the map to the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office as a gift .
The map was referred to a cartographer on the staff , M. I. Walters .
Walters happened to show the map to a friend , Captain Arlington H. Mallery , a student of old maps and a breaker of new ground in borderline regions of archaeology .
Mallery took the map home to study , and returned with some surprising comments .
He made the statement that the map , in his opinion , showed bays and islands off the Antarctic coast of Queen Maud Land now under the ice cap .
This would imply that somebody mapped the coast before the ice cap had appeared .
This statement was too radical to be taken seriously by most professional geographers , but Walters felt Mallery might be right .
Mallery called on others to examine his findings .
These included the Rev. Daniel L. Linehan , director of the Weston Observatory of Boston College and the Rev. Francis Heyden , director of the Georgetown University Observatory .
Linehan and Mallery took part in a radio panel discussion on August 26 , 1956 , and verbatim copies of this broadcast were distributed and brought to the attention of Charles Hapgood .
He was impressed with the confidence placed in Mallery by men like Walters , Linehan and Heyden and had a strong hunch that , despite the improbability and lack of proof ( at that time ) , Mallery might well be right .
Hapgood was then teaching at Keene State College , and decided to undertake an investigation of the Piri Re 'is map as thoroughly as he could .
It had always been Hapgood 's habit to involve his students in problems on the frontiers of knowledge , for he believed that unsolved problems provided better stimulation for intelligence and imagination than did already solved problems from textbooks .
Hapgood also believed that the amateur had a much larger role in science than usually recognized , and was aware that most radical discoveries were opposed by the experts in the affected fields .
The specialist who starts out by learning what everybody else knows is not very likely to initiate anything new .
An expert knows everything important , and if the expert does n't know everything important , at least they know more than most other people , and believes that amateurs know nothing .
An unwise contempt for amateurs arises , despite the fact that it is the amateur who has made innumerable discoveries in all fields of science .
In chapter two , Hapgood writes :
When our investigation started my students and I were amateurs together .
My only advantage over them was that I had had more experience in scientific investigations ; their advantage over me was that they knew even less and therefore had no biases to overcome .
At the very beginning I had an idea - a bias , if you like - that might have doomed our voyage of discovery before it started .
If this map was a copy of some very ancient map that had somehow survived in Constantinople to fall into the hands of the Turks , as I believed , then there ought to be very little resemblance between this map and the maps that circulated in Europe in the Middle Ages .
I could not see how this map could be both an ancient map ( recopied ) and a medieval one .
Therefore , when one of my students said this map resembled the navigation charts of the Middle Ages , at first I was not much interested .
Fortunately for me , I kept my opinions to myself , and encouraged the students to begin the investigation along that line .

Figure 1 - The S. Osma Beatus Medieval World Map
Figure 2 - The Dulcert Portolano of 1339
For example , Hapgood and his students discovered that one of the leading scholars in the field did not believe the charts originated in the Middle Ages .
A. E. Nordenskiöld , who compiled an atlas of these charts ( which Hapgood and his students used ) also wrote an essay on their history , presenting several reasons for concluding they must have come from ancient times .
In the first place , he pointed out that the Dulcert Portolano and others like it were a great deal too accurate to have been drawn by medieval sailors .
Then there was the curious fact that successive charts showed no signs of development .
Those from the beginning of the 14th century were as good as those from the 16th .
It seemed as though someone early in the 14th century had found an amazingly good chart which no one was able to improve upon for two hundred years .
Furthermore , Nordenskiöld saw evidence that only one such model had been found , and that all other portolanos drawn in the following centuries were copies from that original .
Nordenskiöld was familiar with the maps of Claudius Ptolemy , which had survived from antiquity and had been reintroduced to Europe in the 15th century .
Comparing the maps , he found that the portolanos were much better than Ptolemy 's maps .
Comparing Ptolemy 's map of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea with the Dulcert Portolano below in Figure 3 , the older map 's superiority is evident .
Figure 3 - Ptolemy Map on top , Piri Re 'is on bottom
What could this mean ?
Ptolemy is the most famous geographer of the ancient world .
He worked in Alexandria in the 2nd century A.D. in the greatest library of the ancient world .
He had at his command all the accumulated geographical information of that world .
He was aquainted with mathematics and showed in his great work , the Geographia , a modern mentality .
Is it to be assumed that medieval sailors of the 14th century , without any of this knowledge , and without modern instruments except a rudimentary compass , could have produced a more scientific product ?
Nordenskiöld felt that there had been in antiquity a geographic tradition superior to the one represented by Ptolemy .
He felt that the portolano charts must have been in use then by sailors and navigators , and answered the objection that there was no mention of such maps by various classical writers by pointing out that in the Middle Ages , when the portolano charts were in use , they were never referred to by the Schoolmen , the academic scholars of that age .
Both in ancient times and medieval times , sailors and academic scholars were apparently poles apart .
Nordenskiöld was not able to offer an answer to the problem of where the portolanos came from , however .
Neither the medieval navigators nor the known Greek geographers could have drawn them .
The Arabs , famous for their scientific achievements of the Middle Ages , apparently could not have drawn them either .
Their maps are less accurate than Ptolemy's .
The evidence points to the origin of the portolanos in a culture with a higher level of technology than was obtained in medieval or ancient times .
A modern Arab geographer , Youssouf Kamal , opposed Nordenskiöld 's viewpoint violently as he wrote :
Our incurable ignorance ... as to the origin of the portolanos or navigation charts known by this name , will lead us only from twilight into darkness .
Everything that has been written on the history or the origin of these charts , and everything that will be said or written hereafter can be nothing but suppositions , arguments , hallucinations . [ 2 ]
As for the lines that we see intersecting each other , to form lozenges , or triangles , or squares : these same lines , I wish to say , dating from ancient Greek times , and going back to Timosthenes , or even earlier , were probably never drawn ... to give ... distances to the navigator .
The makers of the portolanos preserved this method , that they borrowed from the ancient Greeks or others , more probably and rather to facilitate the task of drawing a map , rather than to guide the navigator with such divisions . [ 3 ]
The problem was to find out , from the lines found on the portolanos , whether or not it might be possible to construct a grid of lines of latitude and longitude such as is found on modern maps .
In other words , the problem was to see if this portolano system could be converted to the modern map making system .
Livengood 's approach was simple .
Without realizing the importance of his choice , he put himself in the position of map maker rather than navigator .
That is , he saw the problem not as one of finding a harbor , but of actually constructing the map .
Livengood had never heard of Kamal , but he was adopting the Prince 's point of view of the purpose of the lines .
The probable procedure , Livengood speculated , was first to pick a convenient center for his map and then determine a radius long enough to cover the area being mapped .
With this center and radius , the map maker would draw a circle .
Figure 4
Then the map maker would bisect the circle again and again until he had sixteen lines from the center to the periphery at equal angles of 22½º .
These could be further bisected , resulting in thirty - two points on the periphery .
The third step would be to connect points on the perimeter to make a square , with four different square possible .
The fourth step would be to choose one of the squares , and draw lines connecting the opposite points , thus making a map grid of lines at right angles to each other .
Although scholars agreed that the portolan charts had no lines of latitude or longitude , it stood to reason that if one of the vertical lines was drawn to true north , then it would be a meridian of longitude , and any line at right angles to it would be a parallel of latitude .
Assuming a projection such as the Mercator projection , in which all meridians and parallels are straight lines crossing at right angles , then all parallel vertical lines would be meridians of longitude and all horizontal lines would be parallels of latitude .
Comparing this idea to the Piri Re 'is map , Livengood could see that the map maker had selected a center , which he had placed somewhere to the east of the torn edge of the fragment of the world map and had then drawn a circle around it .
The map maker had bisected the circle four times , drawing 16 lines from the center to the perimeter , and he had also drawn in all four possible squares for drawing different grids for different parts of the map , where it might be necessary to have different norths .
It was another student , Leo Estes , who pointed out the Piri Re 'is map had the potentiality for several different norths on the same map .
Since the earth is round , and the portolan design apparently based on a flat surface projection which would not take account of the spherical surface , the meridians would deviate further and further from true north the farther they were removed from the center of the map .
The portolan design would compensate for this .
Estes also suggested a solution to finding which square was the right square to start with .
Comparing the Piri Re 'is map with a modern map , he found a meridian on the modern map that coincided very nearly with a line on the Piri Re 'is map , about 20 º W longitude close to the African coast .
Estes suggested this line might be a prime meridian , a line drawn to true north .
All lines parallel to this would be meridians of longitude , and all lines at right angles would be parallels of latitude .
Hapgood writes :
As we identified more and more places on our grid , and averaged their errors in position , we found all over the map some common errors that indicated something was wrong with the projection .
We concluded there must still be errors either in the location of the center of the map , or in the length of the radius , or both .
...
We knew , of course , that our assumption that the map maker had precise knowledge of the size of the earth was doubtful .
It was much more than likely that he had made some sort of mistake .
We shortened the radius a few degrees , on the assumption that the map maker might have underestimated the size of the earth , as Ptolemy had .
This only increased the errors .
...
This error amounted to an error of 4½º . [ 4 ]
This was quite a startling development for Hapgood and his students , for it could only mean that the Greek geographers of Alexandria had in front of them source maps that had been drawn without the Eratosthenian error .
This suggested that the peoples who originated the maps possessed a more advanced science than that of the Greeks .
It was obvious that the original maker of the map had observed their latitudes and longitudes extremely well .
It also became apparent that those who originally copied the Piri Re 'is map had used a different length for a degree of latitude than for a degree of longitude .
In other words , the geographers who designed the square portolan grid for which Hapgood and his students discovered a trigonometric solution had apparently applied their projections to maps that had originally been drawn with another projection .
The Antarctic Maps of Oronteus Finaeus and Mercator
Part of the Piri Re 'is investigation led Hapgood to search for other portolan charts from the Middle Ages that might show Antarctica .
He arranged to spend some time at the Library of Congress in 1959 , writing ahead and requesting that all old maps of the period in question be brought out and made ready for inspection .
Somewhat to his consternation , upon arriving he discovered several hundred books of maps laid out on the conference tables in the reference room .
Slowly working through them from morning until evening , he examined each one .
One day he turned a page and his eyes fell on the southern hemisphere of a world map drawn by Oronteus Finaeus in 1531 and he knew he had found what he had been looking for .
The general shape of the continent was startlingly like the outline of the continent on modern maps .
Figure 5 - Modern Map on the Left , Oronteus Finaeus Map on the right
It was obvious to Hapgood that this was no creation of someone 's imagination .
The mountain ranges were individualized , some coastal and some not .
Rivers were flowing from them into the sea in what looked like very natural and convincing drainage patterns .
This suggested to Hapgood that the coast may have been free of ice at the time the original map was drawn , just as Captain Mallery had suggested about the Piri Re 'is map .
This was not only troubling in that the ice cap of Antarctica is supposedly millions of years old , but Antarctica itself was supposedly not discovered until the year 1818 .
These are no slight matters to be overlooked .
Another important fact from the Oronteus Finaeus map is that all the rivers on it are shown flowing from mountain ranges near the coast .
No rivers are shown in the deep interior .
This would suggest that when the source maps were made , the interior was already covered by the ice cap .
In that case , the ice cap was an advancing continental glacier that had not yet brimmed the mountain ranges to reach the sea .
Hapgood and his students concluded that the Oronteus Finaeus map was based on an authentic source map compiled from local maps before the ice cap had reached the coast of Antarctica .
A good many of the 16th century maps show a southern continent where none exist .
Gerhard Kremer , a.k.a.
Mercator , who lived in the 16th century , believed in its existence .
A comparison of all the versions suggested that there may have been one or two original prototype maps , drawn according to different projections , which were copied and recopied .
The belief in the existence of a southern continent lasted until the time of Captain Cook , who 's voyages in the south seas demonstrated the non existence of a southern continent , at least in the latitude that appears on these maps .
The Hadji Ahmed World Map of 1550
In some respects , Hapgood found the Hadji Ahmed World Map of 1550 to be most remarkable .
He found a striking difference in the drawing of the eastern and western hemispheres .
The eastern hemisphere seemed to have been based on sources available to geographers of the time , mostly Ptolemy , and are somewhat ordinary .
The map of the Mediterranean was apparently based on Ptolemy 's maps as well , as was Africa .
Neither compared favorably with the older , more accurate Piri Re 'is map .
But it is an entirely different story for the western hemisphere , and it soon became apparent that the map maker had at his disposal some most extraordinary source maps .
The shapes of North and South America have a surprisingly modern look , the west coast particularly interesting .
They seemed to be about two centuries ahead of the cartography of the time .
Furthermore , they appear to be drawn with highly sophisticated spherical projection .
The shape of what is now the United States is just about perfect .
It is very difficult to imagine how the map could have been drawn of the Pacific coast , with remarkable accuracy , in the middle of the 16th century , more than two hundred years before the solution to the problem of longitude .
Another remarkable detail of the map is the suggestion of a land bridge between Alaska and Siberia .
Mr. Derek S. Allan , a British scientist from Oxford , commented on the maps : " It would seem , perhaps , that either the sea level was lower , or that the land has sunk since the original map was drawn .
The Laptev sea area - including the New Siberian Islands ?
- appears as dry land ( this may well be correct since the sea bottom today is the most extraordinary mammoth graveyard ) and it seem that Novya Semlya was joined to the Siberian Coast .
...
One might note with astonishment that there appears to be no indication of ice cover in the area . "
A more detailed examination of the Hadji Ahmed map revealed further interesting facts .
The apparent exaggeration of the size of Antarctica could perhaps be attributed to the same error found on the Oronteus Finaeus map as mentioned above .
But even considering this , the continent on this map seemed much too large , and its shape is hardly recognizable .
To consider the cause of the extreme distortion , Hapgood and his students considered the polar regions on a Mercator map and could not help but notice how it exaggerated the northern regions .
Hapgood and his students concluded that the ancient source maps of Antarctica may have been drawn on a projection resembling the Mercator , at least in this respect of having straight meridians parallel to each other .
The Hamy - King Chart of 1502
The Hamy - King Chart of 1502 was found to be based partly on Ptolemaic and partly on Portolano traditions , with recently discovered lands added by an early explorer , thought to be Amerigo Vespucci .
The European section seemed to be based on the most accurate of the portolano charts .
This world map provides evidence of numerous and extensive geological changes since the first prototypes of its original local maps were drawn .
It was interesting to note that in placing the center of the portolano chart in the Indian Ocean , the cartographer made it possible to construct a world map embracing all of Europe , Asia , Africa and the Americas as well .
It was a much broader design than found on the Piri Re 'is map .
As already noted , the Hamy - King map was associated with the name of Vespucci .
However , Hapgood and his students became convinced that , while the compilation of the map was undoubtedly Vespucci's , the actual drawing of it could not have been Vespucci 's work .
Vespucci claimed to be able to find longitude by astronomical observation .
However , at one point he established his longitude at 150 º west of the meridian at Alexandria , which would have put him in Santa Barbara , California , much further west than he ever traveled .
This did n't say much of his method .
Examination of the Hamy - King map revealed two surprising facts .
First , the originally separate Mediterranean map had been oriented to magnetic , and not to true north .
The compiler had not understood this , and thus introduced an error into the map .
Second , it is probable that the compilation of this separate portolano with the rest of the map was made after the introduction of the compass into Europe in the 13th century , for it was only after this that a magnetic orientation was applied to the charts .
The Geography of the Map
One of the greatest puzzles of the King - Hamy map is India .
It is shown as a truncated peninsula , with a large land mass lying as an island to the south .
Hapgood and his students considered the possibility good that this was not a result of bad cartography , but rather the influence of an ancient time when the plains of India were flooded and the southern part of the peninsula , ancient Dravidia , was an island .
Because the mouths of the Ganges river , across the whole extent of India , was correctly placed , and that the map represents latitude and longitude fairly well , they proposed that Dravidia was perhaps the center of a great maritime civilization , and an advanced culture that was very old when Egypt was young .
Also , there is geological evidence for the flooding of the northern plains of India , presented by A. K. Dey of the Geological Survey of India .
In a paper entitled " The Shores of India " , he followed elevated beaches into the interior as far north as the estuaries of the Indus .
There is also literary evidence , traditions of ancient Indian literature , the Vedas , which tells of a time when Dravidia was an island .
There are additional suggestions of geological changes on the King - Hamy map .
There is a vast extension southward of the Asian land mass , which interestingly , was also postulated by Alfred R. Wallace , co-discoverer of the theory of evolution .
He studied the distribution of species in the islands of Indonesia and concluded there was much evidence for a very recent connection between Java , Sumatra , Borneo and the mainland of Australia .
He also reported native traditions that placed this connection in the very recent past , only a few thousand years ago .
Hapgood also considered it highly likely that the Mediterranean portion of the map was originally drawn before the explosion of Thera about 1400 B.C.
Finally , this portolano chart indicates many more rivers than exist today in Europe and North Africa .
This seems to concur with the change of climate which is known actually occurred in fairly recent times .
Conclusions
The conclusions Hapgood drew are history shattering in their implications .
The evidence presented by the maps he and his students studied indicate the existence of a civilization in remote times , well before the rise of any known civilization .
In geodesy , nautical science and map making , it was more advanced than any civilization before the 18th century .
In fact , it was not until the 19th century that our own civilization explored the Arctic and Antarctic , and the bottom of the Atlantic ocean .
These ancient maps indicate that the makers did all these things .
Mapping on this scale suggests both economic motivations and economic resources .
Organized government is indicated .
And certainly , the disappearance of this civilization has implications that our own civilization should consider carefully .
Hapgood writes :
1 ) The idea of the simple linear development of society from the culture of the paleolithic ( Old Stone Age ) through the successive stages of the neolithic ( New Stone Age ) , bronze , and iron ages must be given up .
Today we find primitive cultures co-existing with advanced modern society on all the continents - the Bushmen of Australia , the Bushmen of South Africa , truly primitive peoples in South America , and in New Guinea ; some tribal peoples in the United States .
We shall assume now that , some 20,000 years or more ago , while paleolithic peoples held out in Europe , more advanced cultures existed elsewhere on the earth , and that we have inherited a part of what they once possessed , passed down from people to people .
2 ) Every culture contains the seeds of its own disintegration .
At every moment forces of progress and of decay co-exist , building up and tearing down .
All too evidently the destructive forces have often gained the upper hand ; witness such known cases as the extinctions of the high cultures of ancient Crete , Troy , Babylon , Greece and Rome , to which it would be easy to add twenty others .
And , it is worth noting that Crete and Troy were long considered myths .
3 ) Every civilization seems eventually to develop a technology sufficent for its own destruction , and hitherto has made use of the same .
There is nothing magical about this .
As soon as men learn to build walls for defense , other men learned how to tear them down .
The vaster the achievements of a civilization , the farther it spreads , the greater must be the engines of destruction ; and so today , to counter the modern worldwide spread of civilization , we have atomic means to destroy all life on earth .
Simple .
Logical .
4 ) The more advanced the culture , the more easily it will be destroyed , and the less evidence will remain .
Take New York .
Suppose it was destroyed by a hydrogen bomb .
After 2000 years , how much of its life could anthropologists reconstruct ?
Even if quite a few books survived , it would be quite impossible to reconstruct the mental life of New York .
The sad story of destruction , whereby man destroys almost as much as he creates , does not start with our 20th century .
Consider the question of libraries .
The ancient worlds of Greece and Rome had many libraries .
The most famous of these was Alexandria , founded in Egypt by Alexander the Great three centuries before the Christian era .
Five hundred years later it was said to have contained about one million volumes , and into it was gathered the entire knowledge of the ancient western world .
This library , the heritage of untold ages , was burned . [ 5 ]

( CNN ) -- President Obama appeared before a national audience Monday night to make the case for his economic stimulus plan , saying this is not your " run - of - the - mill recession . "
President Obama urged Congress " to act without delay " on his economic stimulus plan .
The president stressed the urgency of passing the roughly $ 838 billion measure , which his administration and Democratic leaders say will help pull the U.S. economy out of its current skid .
" My bottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs , we are making sure that the financial system is working again , that homeowners are getting some relief , " he said in his first prime time news conference .
Obama 's remarks came the day before the Senate votes on its version of the stimulus bill .
The House passed its version of the stimulus bill nearly two weeks ago -- without a single Republican vote .
If the measure passes the Senate , the two chambers will have to reconcile the differences between the two bills .
See what 's in the bills »
Obama urged Congress " to act without delay , " saying that only the federal government can break the " vicious cycle " gripping the U.S. economy .
" It is absolutely true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth .
That is and must be the role of the private sector , " he said .
" But at this particular moment , with the private sector so weakened by this recession , the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy back to life . "
Obama said the plan was " not perfect , " but would create up to 4 million new jobs .
Watch Obama explain how the plan will create jobs »
The president said 90 percent of those jobs would be generated by the private sector , a rebuttal of some conservative critics who say the plan amounts to little more than a government jobs bill .
How did Obama do ?
Analysts weigh in »
Much of the package involves infrastructure spending , long - term energy projects and aid to cash - strapped state and local government .
The president predicted that with his plan , the country would see significant improvement starting next year .
Republicans opposed to the plan say it includes too much wasteful spending and wo n't stimulate the economy .
Obama insisted he has been consulting with GOP lawmakers on the plan .
The campaign arm of Senate Republicans wasted little time Monday night calling into question Obama 's commitment to bipartisanship .
Even before the news conference came to a close , National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brian Walsh released a statement saying , " President Obama promised change and bipartisanship in Washington , but that 's not what Americans have witnessed in the crafting of this gargantuan spending bill .
" Despite his rhetoric tonight , President Obama cannot possibly be proud of the final result -- a bloated , trillion dollar spending bill crafted in a partisan manner that represents the same wasteful Washington spending and will fall on the shoulders of future generations . "
Obama said that when it comes to fiscal responsibility , " it 's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks about this recovery package after they 've presided over a doubling of the national debt . "
Watch Obama take on his critics »
Obama also addressed a broader argument -- that the government should not be trying to fix the problem .
" You have some people , very sincere , who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace .
And , in fact , there are several who 've suggested that FDR was wrong to interfere back in the New Deal .
They 're fighting battles that I thought were resolved a pretty long time ago , " he said .
The president said most economists " almost unanimously " recognize the government needs to play a role in jump - starting the economy .
Obama said he was " absolutely confident " the country 's economic problems can be solved , " but it 's going to require us to take some significant , important steps . "
Obama pointed to Japan to back up his claim that without action , the recession could become permanent .
" We saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s , where they did not act boldly and swiftly enough and , as a consequence , they suffered what was called the lost decade , where essentially , for the entire '90s , they did not see any significant economic growth . "
The Obama administration says the plan will spur job creation and long - term growth by :
Doubling the production of alternative energy in the next three years
Modernizing federal buildings and improving the energy efficiency of 2 million American homes
Making investments to have the country 's medical records computerized within five years
Equipping schools with 21st - century classrooms
Expanding broadband access
Investing in science and new technologies
Obama road - tested his message about the plan Monday in Elkhart , Indiana .
He is planning a second campaign - style swing Tuesday , heading to Fort Myers , Florida , another city wrestling with double - digit unemployment .
Polls show the public is split over the stimulus plan .
A slight majority , 54 percent , favors the bill ; 45 percent are opposed , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday .
iReport.com : Can Obama fix the economy ?
The president wants the final bill on his desk by Presidents Day , which is next Monday .
As Obama pushes for the stimulus plan , his administration also has been planning a separate financial stability plan for the second half of the $ 700 billion financial bailout program .
" Clear oversight " will be required for the remaining funds , Obama said .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is scheduled to announce a substantial overhaul of the bailout Tuesday .
The program , launched by the Bush administration , has come under fire for its lack of transparency .
While the economy was the focus of the news conference , Obama also fielded questions on foreign policy .
On Iran , he said the United States is looking for opportunities for " face to face " dialogue after nearly three decades without diplomatic ties , but still has " deep concerns " about Tehran 's actions .

You might recall that the United Nations Statistics Division launched UNdata about one week short of a year ago , which was an improvement on the previous United Nations Commons Database .
UNdata provides a gateway into 22 United Nations databases and 66 million records .
Yeah , it ’s a lot of data , but what do we do with it ?
What does it mean ?
Progress : A Graphical Report on the State of the World is a modest attempt to make some sense of it all ; and by all , I mean a small subset .

A Note About the Data
If you want some real data to work with ( as opposed to the clean , fake kind ) , UNdata is an excellent place to find it .
It ’s sparse , scattered , and oftentimes hard to figure out what the data are about – which is what you should expect .
Although for some odd reason I was n’t expecting it to be so tricky to navigate .
In any case , you ’ll notice that some of the pages show only select numbers for certain countries .
It ’s most likely because there was n’t all that much data for that metric … or I just thought the factoid was interesting .
More likely the former though .
The further back in time you go , the more sparse the data gets .
Anyways , this was fun and I think I ’ll do it more often .
It was nice to get back to where it really all began for me .
Any suggestions for the next series of graphics ?

Robust commodity prices have certainly given the currency a temporary leg up , but after yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s price action , we probably seen their top in the short term .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all about the big dollar , for now look to buy USD $ on pull backs as Canadian fundamental data does not support a stronger loonie .
Capital markets seem to have got ahead of the curve with the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœeuphoricÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ announcements this week .
The AUD $ has pared some of its 11 - day gains ( longest winning streak in nearly 3 - years ) as investors believe the recent advance on the back of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcash for trashÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ idea may have gone too far too quickly .
Global growth is the key to this commodity high yielding asset and investors want to take a back seat to digest all announcements of late ( 0.6940 ) .
Depending on what commodities do , traders prefer to sell the AUD on upticks for now .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 53.10 down - 88 c ) .
Not a surprise that crude retreated from its 4 - month highs yesterday .
With the greenback regaining some of its lost luster , it has reduced the appeal of some commodities ( less attractive as a hedge against inflation ) .
Investors are also speculating that todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s weekly EIA report will once again reveal another increase in stock levels .
The fundamentals of supply and demand do not justify oil penetrating that psychological level of $ 60 a barrel anytime soon .
Crude price are been dictated by both the big dollar and the strong correlation with equities at present .
The depth and scope of the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcement on quantitative easing has temporarily at least instilled optimism about the outlook for the US economy .
But , yesterday was probably a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsit back and ponderÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ this weeks announcements .
We are back to moving on the USD $ , crude prices rose 10 % last week and year to date has advanced 15 % .
Global demand destruction remains a concern , there is nothing to suggest that demand has increased or will increase in the short term .
Crude prices could remain vulnerable unless the greenback continues on this path of weakness .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report was bearish for crude prices .
Inventories climbed + 1.94 m barrels to +353.3 m vs. an expected increase of + 1.5 m .
Supplies of gas and distillate fuel ( heating oil and diesel ) also increased .
Gold remains under pressure on optimism that the US government plan to rid banks of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtoxic assetsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ will revive lending and the economy ( $ 933 ) .
Once again on deeper pullbacks expect support for the metal .
The Nikkei closed 8,479 down - 9 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,203 up +16 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,928 up +17 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury backed up 4 bp yesterday ( 2.69 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session , while the long bond eased as the Fed announced its buyback starting today .
With the onslaught of new product this week ( $ 98b- 2Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s $ 40 b , 5 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s $ 34 b - Wed. and 7Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s $ 40 b - Thurs . ) , traders are happy to cheapen up the middle of the US curve to absorb new record issues .
Despite global equities aggressively advancing after GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ proposed plan to deal with toxic assets on banks balance sheets , treasuries remain better bid on pull backs .
Policy makers are determined that yields will not aggressively rise given the current economic environment .
The Fed is manipulating and flattening the curve which makes it difficult for traders to make money !

Sooner or later you , dear NoScript user , may face this puzzle : you already allowed every single script source looking " legitimate " on a certain page , but the damn thing stubbornly refuses to work as it should .
Then , in a moment of enlightenment , you dig inside your Untrusted menu , and there you find google - analytics.com .
You put it there long ago because you do n't like to be tracked , but now you cross your fingers and temporarily allow it ... et voilÃ , the page starts behaving !
Now , you may ask why the hell a web site requires Google Analytics scripts to be enabled for providing its basic features , and you might be right : no reason for that .
On the other hand , a growing number of web sites leverage Google Analytics for more than just tracking page views and navigation : they also try to collect finer grained usage data about some specific features of theirs .
Therefore they call functions or reference objects from http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js from their own " 1st party " specific scripts , e.g. when you click a certain button : if google - analytics.com is blocked by NoScript ( or by AdBlock Plus , or by your hosts file , for the matter ) , the 1st party code referencing it will obviously fail and the button will stay dead .
You can be hinted about Google Analytics being the culprit by opening Tools |Error Console and watching for errors like " urchinTracker is not defined " or " _gat is not definedâ€ .
So far , all you could do about that was allowing google - analytics.com .
But latest NoScript ( 1.8.9.7 or above ) implements a new feature , called Surrogate Scripts , which works around this problem out of the box and is customizable enough to cope with similar 3rd party script issues in the future .
How does it work ?
Very simple : whenever an external script is blocked , NoScript checks if its URL matches a certain pattern , and if it does an alternate user - provided surrogate script gets executed instead , in the context of the loading page .
There you can define surrogates for any required object or function .
There 's no UI for this feature ( yet ? ) , but its intended audience is likely geeky enough not no need one .
You can specify as many URL / surrogate mappings as you want , by creating a couple of about : config preference entries under the noscript .
surrogate root .
The built - in Google Analytics mapping can be regarded as a reference :
noscript.surrogate.ga.sources : *.google-analytics.com
: *.google-analytics.com noscript.surrogate.ga.replacement : var _ 0=function ( ) {};with( window)urchinTracker=_0,_gat={_getTracker:function ( ) {return {__noSuchMethod__:_0}}}
var _0=function ( ) {};with( window)urchinTracker=_0 ,pageTracker={_setDomainName:_0 ,_trackPageview:_0,_initData:_0},_gat={_getTracker:function() {return window.pageTracker}} *
If you want to exempt some pages from this replacement ( e.g. because they already provide a graceful fallback for missing external scripts ) , you can add an URL pattern to the noscript.surrogate.ga.exceptions preference , e.g. *.mozilla.org *.mozilla.com .
Script Surrogates can be disabled globally by setting noscript.surrogate.enabled to false .
Happy hacking :)
* Update
Jesse Andrew told me about some Google Analytics API not covered by the original surrogate , so rather than trying to find out every possible tracker method , present and future , I decided to catch them all by exploiting a nifty Mozilla JavaScript feature , i.e. __noSuchMethod__ .
Please get 1.8.9.8 ( latest development build ) if you want to this more reliable approach right now .
Update 2
Since I 've been asked by concerned non-geeks ( especially those who can't read JavaScript code ) what exactly the Google Analytics surrogate does , here 's a plain English description : the Google Analytics surrogate script does NOTHING .
Itâ€™s a dummy â€œcatch allâ€ replacement for the most common Google Analytics functions : it makes the calling pages happy , helping not to break sites , but doesnâ€™t send nor receive anything to / from Google .
Update 3
NoScript now supports a second kind of script surrogates , called " Page - level surrogates " : if the sources patterns start with the " @ " character , the replacement scripts are executed before the matched page starts to be parsed and before any other script can run .
This allows preemptive patching of the loading page , similarly to GreaseMonkey but in a more pervasive way , since GreaseMonkey 's scripts can run only when the DOM is already parsed ( i.e. after page scripts already run ) .

REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government plans to invite wealthy investors to invest in the bailout of the crippled financial system , The Washington Post reported on Friday .
The investors would be invited to buy up recently issued , highly rated securities that finance consumer lending -- without the risk of massive losses , the report said .
The idea is to entice the investors to put their huge cash piles to work to stimulate the financial system , the Post said .
The program , which could involve the government lending nearly $ 1 trillion to these investors , exceeds the size of every other federal effort to address the financial crisis so far , the newspaper said .
The initiative adopts an approach that could be the model for future federal efforts to aid the credit markets , sources familiar with government planning were quoted as saying .

The Senate overlooked Timothy Geithner 's tax mistakes and confirmed him as Treasury secretary because he was the superhero who could rescue the financial system .
Turns out Geithner is a mere mortal .
He has no magic bullets or secret decoder ring .
And that explains why the stock market fell off a cliff as Geithner delivered his " Financial Stability Plan " on Tuesday .
By day 's end , the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 381.99 points , or 4.6 percent , to 7,888.88 .
" I think the market is reacting to a growing sense that the problems are larger than the ability of our elected officials to deal with them , " says Karl Mills , president of Oakland investment firm Jurika , Mills & Keifer .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Geithner laid out several new or expanded plans for relieving banks of their toxic assets and jump - starting lending .
But all were short on specifics .
" People were expecting him to come up with something substantive .
It was more of a progress report and a statement of the obvious , " Mills says .
Geithner warned that his strategy will " require a substantial and sustained commitment of public resources " and will " involve risk and take time . "
Kudos to Geithner for his honesty , but that is not what investors wanted to hear .
" The bottom line is , there is no easy solution , " Mills says .
" It 's not like there 's a death star you can load up with bad loans , shoot into space and 30 years later it will fall back to Earth . "
Although Geithner is taking the blame for Tuesday 's market tumble , President Obama did him no favors when he warned , in his televised news conference Monday night , that failure to pass a stimulus bill " could turn a crisis into a catastrophe . "
" Those kind of comments set up ( the idea ) that this guy ( Geithner ) ought to have a good plan , " says Steve Brown , president Pacific Coast Bankers ' Bank in San Francisco .
" Geithner came in and said I have a plan , but we 're still working out the details , it 's going to take a long time and cost a lot of money .
That obviously does n't give anyone the warm and fuzzies . "
Adam Lerrick , an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University , says Geithner failed to answer five questions , at least to Wall Street 's satisfaction : " What is he trying to do ?
How is he going to do it ?
Why is it going to work ?
How much is it going to cost ?
Where is he going to get the money ? "
Lerrick notes that Geithner 's predecessor Henry Paulson did n't answer those questions , either .
Experts were especially disappointed at the lack of detail in Geithner 's plan to help banks " cleanse their balance sheets " of " legacy assets " by creating a " public - private investment fund . "
This fund would use public and private capital to buy toxic assets from banks .
Private investors would set the price paid , thereby minimizing the cost and risk to taxpayers .
The problem is , if the fund buys these assets at a price private investors are willing to pay " it will bankrupt the sellers .
If they pay more , they really jam it to the taxpayers , " says Allan Meltzer , a professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon .
The previous administration had the same problem with the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Plan .
Originally , TARP was going to buy toxic assets from banks , but finding the right price was a big problem .
If Treasury paid too much , it put taxpayers at risk .
If it paid too little , it could erode bank capital .
Eventually , that 's one reason Paulson decided to use the first part of TARP capital to buy preferred stock in banks .
That helped shore up bank capital , but the toxic assets remain in banks .
Geithner 's plan simply proves that " the problems are large , they are complicated and there is no easy answer , " Mills says . "
If there was , somebody would have come up with it . "

So much for the homeownership gains of the last 8 + years .
Gone .
This morning the Census Bureau reported the homeownership and vacancy rates for Q4 2008 .
Here are a few graphs ...
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The homeownership rate decreased slightly to 67.5 % and is now back to the levels of late 2000 .
Note : graph starts at 60 % to better show the change .
The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.9 % in Q4 2008 .
A normal rate for recent years appears to be about 1.7 % .
There is some noise in the series , quarter to quarter , so perhaps the vacancy rate has stabilized in the 2.7 % to 2.9 % range .
This leaves the homeowner vacancy rate almost 1.2 % above normal , and with approximately 75 million homeowner occupied homes ; this gives about 900 thousand excess vacant homes .
The rental vacancy rate increased slightly to 10.1 % in Q4 2008 , from 9.9 % in Q3 .
It 's hard to define a " normal " rental vacancy rate based on the historical series , but we can probably expect the rate to trend back towards 8 % .
According to the Census Bureau there are close to 40 million rental units in the U.S.
If the rental vacancy rate declined from 10.1 % to 8 % , there would be 2.1 % X 40 million units or about 820,000 units absorbed .
This would suggest there are about 820 thousand excess rental units in the U.S .
There are also approximately 150 thousand excess new homes above the normal inventory level ( for home builders ) - plus some uncounted condos .
If we add this up , 820 thousand excess rental units , 900 thousand excess vacant homes , and 150 thousand excess new home inventory , this gives about 1.87 million excess housing units in the U.S. that need to be absorbed over the next few years .
( Note : this data is noisy , so it 's hard to compare numbers quarter to quarter , but this is probably a reasonable approximation ) .
These excess units will keep pressure on housing starts and prices for some time .
I 'll have some more later today ...
Sometimes I have the odd dream that someday there will be programming language descriptivists in the same way that there are descriptive linguists -- but more so .
They 'll be the Unitarian Universalists of software development .
Anything goes .
It 's all okay .
Just get your job done and be happy .
That 's not entirely wrong .
The term " best practices " has a severe problem in that it implies that for any situation you can find a single best practice .
The best practice often depends highly on your situation , and you often lack sufficient information to choose between several equally good options .
This is why we have so many programming languages and toolkits and libraries and design possibilities .
This is why we refactor , and we iterate , and we try to learn from our experiences to continue building better software for our own purposes according to strong visions .
We do n't have to get it perfect , and there are many ways to accomplish the same thing .
We just want to get it a little bit righter every time we make a change .
It 's a false dilemma to say that all choices are equally good , however .
If there 's a secondary theme to all of my writing here , it 's that some choices are bad .
Let me give you an example of what I want to call " the polar opposite of modern Perl " .
It 's bad Perl .
You can find plenty of examples of it on the Internet , but so many of them end up in search engines and then in copied and pasted code that well meaning novices copy and paste into their own programs , because it 's just too hard to tell who 's authoritative and who 's right , and ... well , see for yourself : 2008 Winter Scripting Games Solution to Advanced Perl Event 1 : Could I Get Your Phone Number ?.
This code wo n't even compile if you use the Modern : : Perl module -- and that 's a feature of the module .
I particularly like some of the explanations of the code .
It goes wrong on the first line :
Our script for Event 1 kicks off by creating a hash table ( similar to a VBScript Dictionary object ) named % dictionary ; that 's what this line of code is for : % dictionary = ( ) ;
In reality , that line of code does nothing .
It does n't declare a variable .
It does n't assign anything to the variable .
It 's effectively a no - op .
It 's useless , vestigial code that exists because ... well , almost certainly it was copied and pasted from another program somewhere .
It 'll get copied and pasted further now , despite doing absolutely nothing , and more novice Perl programmers will get the wrong idea that this is how you work with variables in Perl because someone said so authoritatively -- never mind that the explanation is completely wrong .
( There 's a naming quibble too .
Almost no one calls hashes in Perl dictionaries .
We have a perfectly good name for them instead .
It 's " hash " .
Of course , with the hash sigil and the keyed lookup syntax used to refer to keys and values of the hash , it 's obvious it 's a hash , so this is like calling a variable " variable " in another language .
As the rest of the code uses this variable as a mapping from numbers on a telephone pad to letters , a better name would be %nums_to_letters , which at least gives some semblance of the purpose of the variable , not its internal implementation . )
I can't afford to comment on every line of code here , but a few more groaners popped out at me even as I skimmed the code :
Once we have the hash table set up we use this chunk of code to open the text file C: \Scripts \WordList.txt , read the contents into an array named @arrWordList , and then close the file : open ( WordList , " C:\\Scripts\\WordList.txt " ) ; @arrWordList = < WordList > ; close ( WordList ) ;
This is another example of code that wo n't compile when used with Modern : : Perl .
( It 's difficult to blame the author of this code for that , however .
Perl 5 arguably has the wrong default behavior ... but the lack of error checking is disturbing .
This is nothing compared to the sentence after the explanation of what this code does :
As you can see , it 's easy enough to read the contents of a text file and store those contents in an array ; however , as far as we know it 's nowhere near that easy to search an array for a specified value ( which we 'll have to do to determine whether we 've created a real word out of our phone number ) .
After demonstrating the use of a hash to look up values by key ... yeah , I can't finish this sentence either .
The example code instead joins all of the lines in the file -- one per word -- into a string and uses a regular expression to search the entire string for a word made from a phone number .
This is not an esoteric problem .
It 's a frequently asked question about Perl , present in perlfaq4 , the core Perl documentation , installed with every installation of Perl :
How can I tell whether a certain element is contained in a list or array ?
My gripe is n't that the regular expression search is inefficient ( it is , but not as bad as it could be ) , nor that the code is clunky ( it is ) , but this is a bad algorithm in any language .
A better example is trivial to write in Perl , even for someone who 's not an expert .
Jan Dubois is a Perl expert , and the expert Perl solution to 2008 Winter Scripting Games Advanced Perl Event 1 is not only shorter and more correct , it also includes error checking , compile - time checking , and other robustness features .
It 's a little bit more complex and definitely more idiomatic , but it 's correct and the explanation is also correct .
My gripe is this : someone deliberately published the novice version in 2008 .
It 's bad code .
It 'd be bad code in any language .
It 's particularly bad Perl .
Worst yet , it 's bad code explained incorrectly .
That does n't help anyone .
Are games getting cheaper ?
Research by EEDAR seems to show that , while looking at broad trends , more games priced lower than the $ 59.99 standard MSRP of " seventh generation " games are hitting store shelves .
While this trend is n't as clear cut as the graphs may make it look , it 's clear that consumers are becoming increasingly focused on the price of their entertainment .
The obvious question has to be whether or not this trend has to do with the Nintendo Wii , a system where games still cost $ 49.99 on average , if not lower .
The standard definition system is much simpler to code for , meaning the savings in development can allow publishers to release games for a lower price point and remain profitable .
It 's not that cut and dry , however .
" Something to keep in mind , however , is the adoption of the Wii by many old PS2 / GameCube / Xbox owners who prefer kid , casual or family oriented titles .
It would be unfair to exclude Wii data just because they have done a better job of capturing the attention of a large number of users that enjoy cheaper games , " the report states .
" Furthermore , the Wii has done an equally superior job of bringing new gamers into the market .
These gamers , sometimes referred to as ' nontraditional ' gamers , are likely more price sensitive and prefer less expensive games .
The median price for Wii games released in 2008 was $ 39.99 , compared to $ 49.99 in 2007 . "
Even among
Wii owners , it seems , the price for games is dropping .
Leaving out the Wii completely , one can see price becoming a factor on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 .
" As the Xbox 360 and the PS3 hardware continue to decline in price , more non-traditional , casual , family , and price sensitive gamers ( noting these demographics sometimes overlap ) will likely adopt these systems , which will increase the demand for cheaper titles , " the report says .
February and March releases show an average price of $ 53 for 360 games , much lower than the normal $ 60 per title .
The report also points out that that there is more demand for these types of less expensive games , now that the Xbox 360 has a SKU under $ 200 .
This should n't be used strictly as guidance for pricing , as premium - priced games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero continue to do well at retail , and the $ 59.99 price point does n't seem to hurt most big - name blockbuster titles , although that could change .
" Of course , the aggressive pricing of the seventh generation is a double - edged sword ; if pricing begins to correlate more strongly with value , then publishers / developers need to be careful about the games they have in development , " the report warns .
With companies like EA making a larger push into the Wii business and casual gaming remaining popular among a wide audience , publishers will continually be forced to balance price with quality .

Repairing a failed system
Viral Acharya , Matthew Richardson
How did global finance become so fragile that a collection of bad mortgages in the US could bring the entire system to its knees and the global economy along with it ?
How can this fragility be eliminated ?
This column describes the answers provided in an important new book which has been written by a team of world - class scholars from NYU ’s business school .
As cracks in the financial system began to appear in early 2007 , some of us at the NYU Stern School of Business began to vigorously debate all the issues .
Some , like our colleague , Nouriel Roubini , had been forecasting trouble for a number of years .
Living in the New York City and being at a major business school at the heart of the financial capital of the world , it was difficult not to become immersed in the events of the past two years .
When the securitisation market collapsed in the summer of 2007 , and realisations of subprime losses began to show on bank ’s balance sheets , one thing became clear for many of us – this would be a unique period in financial history .
In the Fall of 2007 , we put on monthly events related to the subprime crisis .
One such event in November 2007 drew 750 undergraduate and MBA students .
It was a presciently pessimistic discussion .
So a year later , when the financial system spiraled downward we decided , like many academics , to put pen to paper and write a series of white papers on various aspects of the crisis .
A holistic view of the financial crisis
After numerous meetings , and as the material developed , we realised that we had taken a holistic view of the financial crisis .
Common themes began to emerge .
The resulting effort led to the book , “ Restoring Financial Stability : How to Repair a Failed System ” , forthcoming this March by John Wiley & Sons .
Causes
Yes , there was a housing bubble and a crash …
There is almost universal agreement that the fundamental cause of the crisis was the combination of a credit boom and a housing bubble .
There are many statistics to back this up .
For example , in the five year period from 2002 - 2007 , the ratio of debt to national income went up 100 % from 3.75 to 4.75 to one .
It had taken the prior full decade to accomplish this feat , and fifteen years prior to that .
During this same period , house prices grew at an unprecedented rate of 11 % per year .
When the “ bubble ” burst , it necessitated a severe economic crisis to come .
The median family , whose house represented 35 % of all their wealth and who was highly levered , would not be able to continue as is .
The economy was going to feel the brunt of it .
Why did it spread beyond housing ?
It is much less clear , however , why this combination of events led to such a severe financial crisis , that is , why we had widespread failures of financial institutions and the freezing up of capital markets .
The systemic crisis that ensued reduced the supply of capital to creditworthy institutions and individuals , amplifying the effects to the real economy .
There is no shortage of proximate causes .
Mortgages granted to people with little ability to pay them back , and designed to systemically default or refinance in just a few years – depending on the path of house prices .
The securitisation process that allowed credit markets to grow so rapidly but at the cost of lenders having little “ skin - in - the ” game .
Opaque structured products that were rubber stamped AAA by the rating agencies more interested in fees than risk assessment .
But was n’t the risk transferred through credit derivatives ?
Somewhat surprisingly , this is not the ultimate reason the financial system collapsed .
If this were it , then capital markets would have absorbed the losses , and the financial system would have moved forward .
Instead , blame needs to be squarely placed at the large , complex financial institutions ( LCFIs ) -- the universal banks , investment banks , insurance companies , and ( in rare cases ) even hedge funds – that dominate the financial industry .
The biggest fault lies in the fact that the LCFIs ignored their own business model of securitisation and chose not to transfer the credit risk to other investors .
The whole purpose of securitisation is to lay risks off the economic balance - sheet of financial institutions .
But the way securitisation was achieved – especially from 2003 to the second quarter of 2007 – was more for arbitraging regulation than for sharing risks with markets .
The reason why banks face capital requirements is that they have incentives to take on excessive risks given their high leverage .
Capital requirement ensures that :
Banks find it costly to take on risks , and When they get hit by a shock , there is enough of a buffer zone to protect them .
But that 's not what happened .
Banks set up a shadow banking sector of special investment vehicles and conduits funded by asset - backed commercial paper that was guaranteed – often fully – by banks through liquidity and credit enhancements .
Designing things this way allowed banks to transform on - balance sheet loans and assets into off - balance sheet contingent liabilities , and thereby exploit loopholes in regulators " Basel " capital requirements .
Measures of risk barely moved even as their balance sheets exploded with liquidity “ puts ” ( sold to the shadow banking sector ) and AAA - asset backed tranches .
These risky assets were systemic in nature ; they were in effect equivalent to writing out - of - the - money put options on aggregate crises .
This lack of risk transfer – the leverage “ game ” that banks played – is the ultimate reason for collapse of the financial system , in our opinion .
Bankers and regulators are both to blame …
It is important to acknowledge that in the period leading up to the crisis , bankers and insurers increasingly paid themselves through short - term cash bonuses based on volume and marked - to - market profits , rather than on long - term profitability of positions created .
There was neither any discounting for liquidity risk of asset - backed securities , nor any proper assessment of true skills of large “ profit ” - centers .
All this just served to make regulatory arbitrage the primary business of the financial sector .
Thus , the current regulatory architecture cannot escape blame either .
In fact , its cracks made the system vulnerable to bankers ’ errors and short - term incentives in the first place .
In a world without regulation , creditors of financial institutions ( depositors , uninsured bondholders , etc. ) would put a stop to excesses of risk and leverage by charging higher costs of funding , but lack of proper pricing of deposit insurance and too - big - to - fail guarantees has distorted incentives in the financial system .
And , for years , regulation – capital requirement in particular – has targeted individual bank risk , when the justification for its existence resides primarily in managing systemic risk .
It is to be expected that financial institutions would maximise returns from the explicit and implicit guarantees by taking excessive aggregate risks , unless these are priced properly by regulators .
Regulatory principles
Where should the regulators start to fix the system ?
The integration of global financial markets has certainly delivered large welfare gains through improvements in static and dynamic efficiency – the allocation of real resources and the rate of economic growth .
These achievements have however come at the cost of increased systemic fragility , evidenced by the ongoing crisis .
The challenge of redesigning the regulatory overlay to make the global financial system more robust must be met without crippling its ability to innovate and spur economic growth .
Four changes seem paramount , each addressing either regulatory arbitrage or the externality imposed by actions of individual institutions on systemic stability .
We argue in the book that future regulation should :
Change the incentives of traders and large profit centers at large financial institutions with “ bonus - malus ” reserve accounts , which penalise employees whose actions trade current profit for future losses .
This would essentially bring " claw backs " into the compensation system .
UBS 's bonus scheme , granting bonuses in the form of claims on a portfolio of toxic assets , is a good example .
Prevent obvious regulatory arbitrage ( privatising , for example , the financial investments of government - sponsored enterprises ) and charge for guarantees – deposit insurance , too - big - to - fail loan guarantees and the bailout – using marking - to - market that reflects leverage and risk in a continual manner .
It will be good to know whether the financial system can even pay for the subsidies it receives .
Recognise the negative externality of LCFIs .
Then quantify the systemic risk of LCFIs and “ tax ” ( through capital requirements or deposit insurance fees ) their contributions to systemic risk rather than individual risk .
This is hard to do , but present regulations do not even claim to address the problem .
The need for such systemic risk regulation , possibly by augmenting Central Bank agendas , is only underscored by the growing size of the few remaining players in the financial arena .
Enforce greater transparency of over - the - counter derivatives positions and off - balance - sheet transactions , employing centralised clearing for standardised products and , at a minimum , centralised registries for customised ones so that counterparty risk can be assessed .
Would it inhibit financial innovation ?
Some say that this inhibits financial innovation .
We think this gets the issue wrong .
The goal is not to have the most advanced financial system , but a financial system that is reasonably advanced but robust .
That 's no different from what we seek in other areas of human activity .
We do n't use the most advanced aircraft to move millions of people around the world .
We use reasonably advanced aircrafts whose designs have proved to be reliable .
The same is the case with ethical drugs .
Although we are now in a golden age of biomedical research , our goal is to sell only products that have been tested extensively .
Concluding Remarks
There are many cracks in the financial system , some of which we now know , others no doubt we will discover down the road .
The 18 executive summaries of each chapter of our book , “ Restoring Financial Stability : How to Repair a Failed System ” , describe a relevant issue at hand and corresponding regulatory proposals .
Some of these have already been released on VoxEU.org under the Financial Rescue and Regulation debate , and others are being released .
A common theme of our proposals notes that fixing all the cracks will shore up the financial house but at great cost .
Instead , by fixing a few major ones , the foundation can be stabilised , the financial structure rebuilt , and innovation and markets can once again flourish .

Pioneer announced this week that it was halting the production of its line of Laserdisc players .
If you are shocked that the electronics giant was still making Laserdisc players , you are not alone .
CDs evolved out of the technology used to create Laserdiscs , but the latter never achieved more than a two percent market share in the United States .
If you are a child of the ' 80s , you may recall Laserdiscs as a format that sprang up to battle VHS .
From what I recall , the discs were large and about the size of a LP album and required you to get up mid-movie and flip the disc ( or change discs altogether ) .
Towards the end of the format 's life there were players that could read both sides of a disc , but only one player was ever built that could both hold two discs and read two sides .
Actual comparison of Laserdisc vs. DVD .
Thanks , Wikipedia .
Pioneer says that it kept selling the players due to the vast libraries of Laserdisc movies that Japanese customers had built up .
Obviously , the format was much more popular in the land of the rising sun than it was here in America .
Pioneer says its latest Laserdisc player models DVL - 919 , CLD - R5 , DVK - 900 , and DVL - K88 are all being closed out .
Pioneer says that the popularity of Blu-ray and DVD players has caused difficulty getting the parts needed to continue production of players for the defunct standard .
Making changes to Google 's search infrastructure is akin to " changing the tires on a car while you 're going at 60 down the freeway , " according Urs Holzle , who oversees the company 's massive data center operations .
Google updates its software and systems on an ongoing basis , usually without incident .
But not always .
On Feb. 24 a bug in the software that manages the location of Google 's data triggered an outage in Gmail , the widely - used webmail component of Google Apps .
Just a few days earlier , Google 's services remained online during a power outage at a third - party data center near Atlanta where Google hosts some of its many servers .
Google does n't discuss operations of specific data centers .
But Holzle , the company 's Senior Vice President of Operations and a Google Fellow , provided an overview of how Google has engineered its system to manage hardware failures and software bugs .
Here 's our Q- and-A :
Data Center Knowledge : Google has many data centers and distributed operations .
How do Google ’s systems detect problems in a specific data center or portion of its network ?
Urs Holzle :
We have a number of best practices that we suggest to teams for detecting outages .
One way is cross monitoring between different instances .
Similarly , black - box monitoring can determine if the site is down , while white - box monitoring can help diagnose smaller problems ( e.g. a 2 - 4 % loss over several hours ) .
Of course , it 's also important to learn from your mistakes , and after an outage we always run a full postmortem to determine if existing monitoring was able to catch it , and if not , figure out how to catch it next time .
DCK : Is there a central Google network operations center ( NOC ) that tracks events and coordinates a response ?
Urs Holzle : No , we use a distributed model with engineers in multiple time zones .
Our various infrastructure teams serve as " problem coordinators " during outages , but this is slightly different than a traditional NOC , as the point of contact may vary based on the nature of the outage .
On - call engineers are empowered to pull in additional resources as needed .
We also have numerous automated monitoring systems built by various teams for their products , that directly alerts an on - call engineer if anomalous issues are detected .
DCK : How much of Google ’s ability to " route around " problems is automated , and what are the limits of automation ?
Urs Holzle :
There are several different layers of " routing around " problems - a failing Google File System ( GFS ) chunkserver can be routed around by the GFS client automatically , whereas a datacenter power loss may require some manual intervention .
In general , we try to develop scalable solutions and build in the " route around " behavior into our software for problems with a clear solution .
When the interactions are more complex and require sequenced steps or repeated feedback loops , we often prefer to put a human hand on the wheel .
DCK : How might a facility - level data center power outage present different
challenges than more localized types of reliability problems ?
How does
Google ’s architecture address this ?
Urs Holzle : The Google within - datacenter infrastructure ( GFS , machine scheduling , etc ) is generally designed to manage machine specific outages transparently , and rack / machine group outages as long as the mortality is a fraction of the total pool of machines .
For example , GFS prefers to store replicated copies of data on machines on different racks so that the loss of a rack may create a performance degradation but wo n't lose data .
Datacenter level and multi-region unplanned outages are infrequent enough that we use manual tools to handle them .
Sometimes we need to build new tools when new classes of problems happen .
Also , teams regularly practice failing out of or routing around specific datacenters as part of scheduled maintenance .
DCK : A " Murphy " question : Given all the measures Google has taken to prevent downtime in its many services , what are some of the types of problems that have actually caused service outages ?
Urs Holzle : Configuration issues and rate of change play a pretty significant role in
many outages at Google .
We 're constantly building and re-building systems , so a trivial design decision six months or a year ago may combine with two or three new features to put unexpected load on a previously - reliable component .
Growth is also a major issue - someone once likened the process of upgrading our core websearch infrastructure to " changing the tires on a car while you 're going at 60 down the freeway . "
Very rarely , the systems designed to route outages actually cause outages themselves ; fortunately , the only recent example is the February Gmail outage ( Here 's the postmortem in PDF format ) .
DCK : How does Google respond to outages and integrate the " lessons learned " into its operations ?
Urs Holzle :
In general , teams follow a postmortem process when an outage occurs , and produce action items such as " monitor timeouts to X " or " document failover procedure and train on - call engineers " .
Engineers from affected teams are also quite happy to ask for and supplement a post - mortem as needed .
Human beings tend to be quite fallible , so if possible we like to write either a specific or a general automated monitoring rule to notice problems .
This is true of both software / configuration problems and hardware / datacenter problems .

A British tourist has been barred from a casino in New Zealand for upsetting fellow punters with her ' offensive ' breasts .
Thirty - three year old Helen Simpson from Nottingham , was wearing a low - cut black evening dress when a woman staff member at the Christchurch Casino told her to cover up or leave .
" She said I was wearing too low a top , which people found offensive , " Miss Simpson said .
" I was highly embarrassed - humiliated , absolutely humiliated .
" There were girls at the casino wearing short skirts that I think are nothing more than belts .
Scroll down for more
" I feel like I 've been discriminated against for having big breasts . "
Miss Simpson , a business manager for McDonald 's who is in her third year studying human resource management , said the matter had been handled unprofessionally .
" The most humiliating thing was that everybody knew , " she said .
" All the staff were staring and the group of guys that complained - I 'm sure it was them - were smiling . "
Miss Simpson has written to casino management saying she left feeling " humiliated , discriminated and highly embarrassed " .
She wrote : " Being well - endowed in the upper region is something I did not choose in life and something I 'm certainly not proud of .
" Have you ever been shopping for a formal cocktail dress that is accommodating to a size 14 woman with the top half demanding a size 20 ? "
Miss Simpson said it was discrimination .
" You do n't see women with too small boobs being criticised , do you ? "
Her boyfriend , Chris Olivier , 34 , said he had found New Zealanders polite , friendly people , and the incident had surprised him .
" She 'd changed quite a few times before we went out and I thought she looked really nice , " he said .
" It 's just disappointing . "
Casino chief executive Brett Anderson said he questioned Miss Simpson 's motives in contacting the media and he would respond to her personally .
" The person on duty at the time made a judgment call based on feedback , " he said .
" Perhaps it could have been handled a little bit better , but these are things I 'll discuss when I draft a letter .
It 's not so much a matter of dress code than comments were received from people .

Did Canadian Environment Minister Jim Prentice speak too presumptively on Friday when he said the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide is already proven and being applied on a commercial basis ?
[ social_buttons ]
Speaking in the context of the recently agreed upon U.S. - Canada dialogue on clean energy and the upcoming Copenhagen round of climate talks , The Canadian Press reports that Environment Minister JIm Prentice said that carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) is a critical component of the energy equation that is currently being applied commercially “ in enhanced oil recovery kinds of operations ” and will be in the future .
Prentice was referring to the Weyburn oilfied project owned and operated by EnCana which receives CO2 transported via pipeline from a lignite - fired coal - to - liquid fuel plant in North Dakota and injects it into underground reservoirs , thereby making the oil fields “ more productive . ”
Let me make what I think are two important points : First , Mr. Prentice ’s Pollyanish prediction about the present - day viability of the capture of CO2 — despite estimates that it will not be commercially viable until 2020 at the earliest and 2030 to 2050 at the latest — was not exactly ‘ telling it like it is . ’
The reality is that the long - term efficacy of the underground reservoirs at Wayburn and elsewhere are not known .
In the scientifically complex issue of CCS enough misinformation is being bandied about clean coal by the coal industry that the Minister of the Environment should have the wherewithal to not mislead on such an important issue .
The problem is that Mr. Prentice did not sufficiently distinguish between what he hopes will happen and what is happening currently .
Second , if we are going to allow carbon sequestration to be defined as a process of using gas that is produced as a byproduct of manufacturing dirty burning synfuels to squeeze out even more fossil fuels from the ground , releasing even more carbon into the atmosphere , it seems that some more thorough accounting procedures of the net “ benefits ” need to be put into place .

Sussex Spaniel Stump Wins Best in Show at Westminster ( Photos , Video )
, a ten - year - old Sussex spaniel won Best in Show at the 133rd Annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show held at Madison Square Garden in New York City .
His last win , in the sporting group , was in 2004 .
The aging canine came out of retirement to walk the green carpet of the Garden one last time after a five year hiatus that was marked by a serious medical condition that nearly took the dogs life .
His handler , Scott Sommer , determined just five days ago that Stump might enjoy one more dog show outing .
He competed in a field of seven , that included a giant schnauzer that was the nation 's top show dog , a favored Brussels griffon , a Scottish deerhound named Tiger Woods , a standard poodle with 93 best in show wins , a Scottish terrier and a puli .
Vegas odds expert John Avello , who compiled odd for the show gave the Sussex Spaniel odds of 275 - to - 1 .
Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks ?

An Israeli flag hangs from a Palestinian home in Silwan taken over by Israeli settlers .
US
Since the press conference , the number of Palestinian homes Israeli occupation forces intend to level has increased from 143 to 179 .
It seems that the number of homes and families who will be forced from their homes , and many from their villages entirely , increases every day .
Just this past week in the East Jerusalem area , 88 homes in al - Bustan , 55 homes in Shufat refugee camp , 35 Bedouin homes on the Jerusalem - Jericho Road , and 66 homes in al - Isawiyya were slated for destruction , affecting more than 2,000 Palestinians , most of whom have lived there for generations .
Ras al - Amoud , al - Abasiyya , Sheikh Jarrah and Ras Khamis appear to be next on the list of targeted areas .
The affected families see this method of adding new neighborhoods to the demolition list every day as a means of making it more difficult to challenge and protest these eviction orders .
I recently visited the al - Bustan neighborhood of Silwan , one of the many slated for demolition any day now .
The roads into the valley where al - Bustan lies were all closed to Palestinian cars with border police blocking off almost every street .
Like many neighborhoods in Jerusalem , the homes reflect a mixture of architectural styles from the Ottoman era to the present , although the Israeli government contends that these homes have been built “ illegally ” because they have not been granted permission to be built in the first place , a permission that is next to impossible for Palestinians regardless of whether they have an Israeli residency ID or citizenship .
Such is the logic of colonialism and ethnic cleansing in Palestine over the last 61 years .
And accordingly , a number of Israeli colonists have been confiscating and taking over homes and buildings to pave the way for the wholesale seizure of Palestinian neighborhoods .
It is this history of ethnic cleansing , particularly that of the catastrophe of 1948 when three - quarters of the indigenous Palestinian population were forced from their land and property , an event termed the Nakba , that fuels the solidarity work among Palestinians in Jerusalem .
Following the lead of Umm Kamel al - Kurd who put up a tent near her home in Sheikh Jarrah after she was forcibly removed from her home four months ago , other neighborhoods in Jerusalem facing a similar fate have set up such tents as spaces for organizing and encouraging others to stand in solidarity with each neighborhood .
Such tents exist now on the Mount of Olives and in Ras Khamis .
One of the organizers of the solidarity tent in al - Bustan , Ahmed Siam , told me “ We will not let history repeat itself .
We learned from history .
We will not leave our land like we did in 1948 .
If they come and kill my son , I will not leave .
This is our land .
Even if they kill me and only my blood remains , it will remain on this land .
”
The 7,000 residents of the area intend to fight for their right to stay on their land rather than see it turned into a new , illegal Israeli colony .
The Silwan community is resisting this widespread confiscation of their land — for the purposes of a tourist destination called “ the city of David ” as well as Jewish - only colonies already surrounding it — by remaining steadfast and staying on their land as member of the al - Bustan Neighborhood Committee Fakhre Abu Diab stated in a letter written to Clinton : “ If the Israeli eviction and demolition orders are implanted it will be a catastrophe for our families , children and elders who will suffer the most .
In the face of this destruction we are refusing the municipality ’s plans and we will not leave our lands and houses nor our community under any circumstances . ”
The al - Qadi family outside their home in the al - Bustan neighborhood of Silwan .
As the children suffer without their ability to go to school , so do the elderly .
Like many families in al - Bustan , the Bedran family has lived here for centuries .
Indeed , many of the houses lining the valley were built in the 1870s .
Abed and Fatima Bedran built their home in 1980 on land their family has lived on for centuries ; like most Palestinian families they built a new home to accommodate their expanding family .
Abed , who is 82 years old , suffered from a stroke and is now bedridden after hearing the news of their eviction and house demolition orders for their neighborhood .
They , too , refuse to flee their home .
These are just two of the families resisting the latest Nakba in Palestine , individuals who refuse to become Palestine ’s latest refugees .
But the latest ethnic cleansing and colonization plans are not limited to Jerusalem .
The number of homes scheduled for demolition in all of Palestine is growing every day .
While the focus is on East Jerusalem in much of the international media , this week Palestinians in villages near Nablus and Hebron have also received orders to evacuate their homes .
In al - Aqraba and Burin near Nablus , Palestinians are being forced to abandon 20 homes and barns by 26 March .
As with the homes in East Jerusalem , some of these pre-date the 1967 colonization of the West Bank .
Likewise , in al - Baqaa , near Hebron , eight homes are scheduled to be destroyed in a village whose lands have already been stolen for the purposes of illegal colonies and Jewish - only roads .
Dozens of Palestinians will become homeless once their homes are confiscated .
And in the village of Nilin near Ramallah , Israeli occupation authorities are in the process of expropriating 35.5 acres of land .
Although most of these families are separated by hundreds of checkpoints and established colonies , what the residents of these villages have in common is their steadfast determination to remain in their homes .
From Nablus to Jerusalem to Hebron to Nilin they see their most potent means of resistance as remaining in their homes , refusing to live in a constant state of catastrophe , always on the brink of becoming the next refugees .
Jawad Abu Ramoz , the son of a refugee from Hebron who fled to Silwan in 1948 , is one of the thousands of Palestinians in al - Bustan who rejects a return to the fate of their parents and grandparents , literally and metaphorically .

Robert Reich :
The Perils of Confusing American Companies With American Jobs , by Robert Reich : Do not confuse American companies with American jobs .
The new stimulus bill , for example , requires that the money be used for production in the United States .
Foreign governments , along with large U.S. multinationals concerned about possible foreign retaliation , charge this favors American - based companies .
That 's not quite true .
Foreign companies are eligible to receive stimulus money for things they make here ...
For example , Alstom , the French engineering company , is eligible to receive stimulus funds for the power turbines it produces in Tennessee ...
On the other hand , U.S. Steel may not be eligible for stimulus money for the steel slabs it casts in Ontario , Canada .
I 'm not defending the " buy American " provisions ...
I 'm just saying they 're not the same as " buy from American companies . "
And although these provisions skate close to protectionism and risk foreign retaliation , at least a case can be made that if American taxpayers are footing the bill ... , the jobs should be created , well , here in America .
The same confusion haunts the debate over the auto bailout .
Advocates of bailing out GM and Chrysler , and most likely Ford , say America ca n’t afford to lose " its " auto industry .
But ... foreign - owned automakers , already producing cars here in the United States , employ – directly or indirectly – hundreds of thousands of Americans .
...
Meanwhile , the Big Three themselves are global .
A Pontiac G8 shipped by GM from Australia has less American content than a BMW X5 assembled in the United States .
...
I ’m not arguing against an auto bailout .
But it ought to be focused on helping American auto workers rather than helping global auto companies headquartered in America .
Why pay the Big Three billions of taxpayer dollars ... when , even after being bailed out , they cut tens of thousands of American jobs , slash wages , and shrink their American operations ...?
That ’s backwards .
The auto bailout should help American autoworkers keep their jobs or get new ones that pay almost as well .
Whether it ’s stimulus or bailout , policy makers must remember that American companies are n’t the same as American workers – and our first responsibility is to the latter .

Amid an IPO drought and the economic downturn , one investor believes that the venture industry should take the amount of money it puts into startups each year and slash it by nearly half , to between $ 15 billion and $ 20 billion .
That ’s compared to the recent annual average of $ 26.51 billion invested over the last five years , or last year ’s total of $ 28.3 billion .
I wrote yesterday about the triage beginning in the venture industry , and today I chatted with Fred Wang , a general partner at Trinity Ventures , a $ 300 million fund that does some 8 - 10 deals a year .
Wang was optimistic about his firm ’s portfolio , noting just a handful of cutbacks and one company that ’s seeking a recapitalization in which Trinity wo n’t participate .
But he was less sanguine about the fate of the venture industry overall .
As far as he ’s concerned , the venture biz needs to cut back on investments .
Wang argues that there ’s still too much money backing deals .
He believes that during the last downturn , more venture firms should have failed , but because there was still so much capital invested in VCs , private equity firms and other funds , the dot - com bust was n’t able to last long enough to bring the industry back to a sustainable size .
“ There was so much low - cost capital available , that it was inevitable that the balloon would re-inflate before it deflated enough , ” says Wang .
“ This downturn could help the business get rightsized .
We ’re just waiting for the other shoe to drop after the last downturn . ”
If he ’s right — and others have made similar arguments — then startups will find less capital overall .
That ’s not to say that VCs will stop investing in companies ( they can ’t ) , but that with fewer VCs and less money , it ’ll be hard to get a deal done .
The fourth quarter of last year averages out close to Wang ’s ideal size for the industry , which means that the last few months may presage the capital - raising future ahead .

February 2 , 2009  --
Despite a near collapse that required $ 45 billion in federal taxpayer bailout funds , Bank of America sponsored a five day carnival - like affair just outside the Super Bowl stadium this past week as President Obama decried wasteful spending on Wall St .
The event – known as the NFL Experience – was 850,000 square feet of sports games and interactive entertainment attractions for football fans and was blanketed in Bank of America logos and marketing calls to sign up for football - themed banking products .
The bank staunchly defended its sponsorship , saying it was a " business proposition " and part of its " growth strategy . "
Critics blasted the spending as a serious abuse of taxpayer money .
" The prominent sponsorship of the Super Bowl says to the American people we 'll take your money and then we 're going to go waste it , " Tom Schatz , president of Citizens Against Government Waste , a watchdog group , told ABC News .
Leading Congressional critic , Congressman Elijah Cummings , ( D - MD ) , said , " They should know better , but obviously they do n't . "
According to the Bank of America , the official bank of the NFL , its NFL partnerships and product tie -tins " generate significant revenue streams . "
The bank said it was legally required to fulfill its contract to be an NFL sponsor and that its NFL product sales had already increased since the Experience began Jan. 24 .
The bank refused to tell ABC News how much it is spending as an NFL corporate sponsor , but insiders have put the figure at close to $ 10 million .
The NFL Experience was on top of that and was inked last summer , according to the bank .
The NFL said it was a " multi- million dollar " event and that it was also spending money to put on the event .
A Super Bowl insider said the tents alone cost over $ 800,000 .
Tickets were available for purchase for between $ 12.50 and $ 18.50 , with proceeds from ticket sales going to local youth initiatives .
It was the 18th year for the " interactive fan festival " and the first that Bank of America has sponsored it .
Bailout Dollars Should n't Go to Super Bowl Sponsorship , Critic Says
Schatz said that deal or no deal , the event sponsorship should have been abdicated once the bank took billions in bailout funds .
" The Super Bowl is a big deal , but it 's a bigger deal that Bank of America is being bailed out by the America taxpayers , " Schatz said .
" This is an exceptional year and it's a time to say we 're not going to do business as usual .
We 're going to say no , we 're going to show some restraint , and we 're going to cut back on something that really is n't absolutely necessary . "
GM , another NFL corporate sponsor and bailout recipient , said it scaled back this year and did n't send any executives to the big game or schedule dealer meetings around it .
A GM spokesperson said that while the company was still providing a fleet of courtesy vehicles to the NFL for VIPs , only 200 were sent this year , down from 400 in 2008 .
Another Bailed Out Wall St. Firm Gathers in Palm Beach
Earlier last week , Morgan Stanley , the bank that laid off 5,000 employees last year and took $ 10 billion in taxpayer bailout money , held a three - day conference for clients at the Breakers , a five - star oceanfront resort in Palm Beach , FL .
Morgan Stanley would not say what the elegant gathering cost , but said it is an annual tradition and that its clients paid their own travel costs and got a discounted room rate of $ 400 a night .
Congressman Cummings said that does n't justify hosting such a lavish event when people on Main St. are struggling to make ends meet .
" For most people on my block , that would be half of a mortgage payment , a monthly mortgage payment , " he said .

Flash back to the early 90's when Remy P. was working as a system administrator for a major oil and gas company .
Getting his hands dirty on a mix of Windows , VaxVMS , Alpha , and Solaris servers , Cisco routers , and even an old Xenix box that everybody prays never crashes , things were never dull , and today was certainly no exception .
Scratching his head the whole way down the freight elevator , Remy and two strapping lads from building services were to fetch the old , retired Data General server that once ran the old legacy accounting database before being replaced by a Dec Alpha and Oracle database from the server graveyard in one of the dimly lit storage rooms .
Once in place and he would then play Doctor Frankenstein with it so that it may fulfill one request - print out all of the financial records that could be restored from tape backup for none other than the almighty Internal Revenue Service .
The missive to retrieve the server and bring it back to life came during a high - tensioned conference call earlier in the day with corporate headquarters .
As the VP nervously detailed the request , Remy imagined a room of IRS agents wearing dark sunglasses and dark suits , scowling with arms folded making sure every word came out just so .
Someone suggested copying the old server 's backup tapes and sending them to the IRS .
" No can do " , was the reply , " We only want hard copies of all of the financial data .
There 's no way that we can trust that some cosmic ray wo n't ruin the data in transit and screw us more than we already are . "
Now , one might think that Remy 's bewilderment regarding the request was because he was bring back to life an ancient server that had cost a pile of cash and a ton of man hours to replace .
No , in fact he saw this task as an interesting challenge .
Instead , Remy 's confusion stemmed from the fact that he , his office , and the server all resided in the UK .
Safety First !
( Especially for Interns )
After getting the monolith back in operating condition , Remy consulted with the accounting department who showed what to print - all told , they were going to need to print off and ship out complete financial records going back 6 years .
A quick calculation estimated that this would take months on a single top - end laser printer .
In an effort to be done by the end of the decade , the plan was set up a surplus Sun box that was lying around and station it in an ad - hoc " print room " with 10 HP Laser printers , extra paper trays and LOTS of paper at the ready .
After a test print run showed that they were primed and ready to provide all the information a shadowy government agency across the ocean could ever want , one thing was remaining .
Somebody had to babysit the printers .
The good news was that help was at hand - it was the beginning of summer and one of the managers was able to negotiate his 17 year old daughter a summer internship ... who had previous experience working as a babysitter .
Admittedly , it was stereotypical intern drudge work , but she did a good job getting started in her windowless office with workstation , 10 printers and paper .
This lasted a day before Health and Safety arrived .
The HSE is a diabolical organization who occasionally inspect companies and insist on draconian safety procedures .
After failing an audit for the new printer room ( lack of ventilation , the toner dust is carcinogenic etc. ) , they gave a list of ( mandatory ) recommendations , most notably to the dress code while working in the print room .
This meant the manager 's daughter had to wear a combination of the company dress code plus 1 full face gas mask with chemical and dust filters , and 1 pair of rubber gloves until the printing had been completed for 8 hours a day .
Surprisingly , she did n't complain very much and it was slightly amusing , albeit somewhat creepy , when she would neglect to remove the mask between trips to the canteen and restroom .
Finally Finished !
Right ?
After three full months as an office hazmat worker and sucking air through a gas mask , the intern happily stacked the last ream of paper on the now gigantic pile of paper and resigned immediately thereafter .
Just as Remy was considering posting a " Mission Accomplished " banner , one of the guys from building services strolled by and noticed their impressive feat ... and launched into a frenzy .
As it turned out , the collection of output was so massive and concentrated that it had caused the floor underneath it to buckle .
In a panic , everyone on the floor rushed to transfer what must have been several tons of paper to the basement so as to avoid a disaster .
It was right after that the news came in - corporate management had jumped the gun - the IRS was n't interested in the financial information that had been printed as the business in the UK was not under their jurisdiction .
This delightful turn in events left Remy and his crew two dilemmas to clean up .
The first , and easiest , was what to do with all that ( now useless ) paper .
The corporate office gladly approved the funding to rent the services of a mobile paper shredder ... for a week .
The second dilemma was more of a curiosity - now that the old financial database was back online , the financial department wanted it left up and running just in case , you know , someone needed a financial report from 5 or 6 years ago .
According to new IRS data , during the first six years of the Bush presidency , the 400 richest Americans saw their average income double .
At the same time , the average tax rate that they paid fell by a third , to 17.2 % , the lowest rate since the IRS started tracking this data .
Yes , that ’s right , if you are a normal middle - class employee who works for a living , you almost certainly paid a larger share of your income in taxes than the 400 richest Americans .
And I ’d bet you did n’t see your income double during the Bush presidency .
Now , did n’t Reaganomics claim that by cutting taxes for the rich , everyone would benefit ?
Considering the current ( and worsening ) state of the economy , is n’t it amazing that Republicans in Congress are opposing Obama ’s stimulus package because they want even more tax cuts ?
Tax rates for the rich are already at their lowest point on record , but that does n’t seem to be enough for some people .
UPDATE : Robert Reich ( Clinton ’s Secretary of Labor ) points out that up until 1976 , the richest 1 percent of the country took home around 9 percent of the total national income , but by 2006 they were pocketing more than 20 percent .
Interestingly , and not coincidentally , the last time the top 1 percent took home more than 20 percent of the nation ’s income was 1928 ( the Great Depression started in 1929 ) .
UPDATE 2 : I ’m trying to track down a better source for this , but if true , this really makes me shake my head in disbelief .
The Latin American Herald Tribune reports that General Motors is going to invest $ 1 billion of the bailout money they received from the US government ( to save US jobs ) , in … Brazil .
If these screenshots are to be believed , then an ironic hacker has successfully installed Windows 3.1 onto a Nokia N95 handset .
Marchin- PRV used DOSBox to emulate the x86 - class processor on the Symbian handset in order to install Microsoft 's 1992 OS .
Totally useless , yes ... and totally badazz .3.1 too old - school for you ?
How about a little emulated Windows 95 action ?

India ’s stealth lobbying against Holbrooke ’s brief
When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — flanked by President Obama — introduced Richard Holbrooke as the formidable new U.S. envoy to South Asia at a State Department ceremony on Thursday , India was noticeably absent from his title .
Holbrooke , the veteran negotiator of the Dayton accords and sharp - elbowed foreign policy hand who has long advised Clinton , was officially named “ special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan ” in what was meant to be one of the signature foreign policy acts of Obama ’s first week in office .
But the omission of India from his title , and from Clinton ’s official remarks introducing the new diplomatic push in the region was no accident — not to mention a sharp departure from Obama ’s own previously stated approach of engaging India , as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan , in a regional dialogue .
Multiple sources told The Cable that India vigorously — and successfully — lobbied the Obama transition team to make sure that neither India nor Kashmir was included in Holbrooke ’s official brief .
“ When the Indian government learned Holbrooke was going to do [ Pakistan ] - India , they swung into action and lobbied to have India excluded from his purview , ” relayed one source .
“ And they succeeded .
Holbrooke ’s account officially does not include India . ”
To many Washington South Asia experts , the decision to not include India or Kashmir in the official Terms of Reference of Holbrooke ’s mandate was not just appropriate , but absolutely necessary .
Given India ’s fierce , decades - long resistance to any internationalization of the Kashmir dispute , to have done so would have been a non-starter for India , and guaranteed failure before the envoy mission had begun , several suggested .
“ Leaving India out of the title actually opens up [ Holbrooke ’s ] freedom to talk to them , ” argued Philip Zelikow , a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who served until December as a consultant for a lobbying firm , BGR , retained by the Indian Government .
But to others — including Obama himself , who proposed a special envoy to deal with Kashmir during the campaign — the region ’s security challenges cannot be solved without including India .
Obama told Time ‘s Joe Klein , that working with Pakistan and India to try to resolve their Kashmir conflict would be a critical task for his administration ’s efforts to try to counter growing instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ Kashmir in particular is an interesting situation where that is obviously a potential tar pit diplomatically , ” Obama told Klein .
“ But , for us to devote serious diplomatic resources to get a special envoy in there , to figure out a plausible approach , and essentially make the argument to the Indians , you guys are on the brink of being an economic superpower , why do you want to keep on messing with this ?
…
I think there is a moment where potentially we could get their attention .
It wo n’t be easy , but it ’s important . ”
Obama also suggested in the interview that he had discussed the special envoy idea with former President Bill Clinton .
Whatever the case , the evidence that India was able to successfully lobby the Obama transition in the weeks before it took office to ensure Holbrooke ’s mission left them and Kashmir out is testament to both the sensitivity of the issue to India as well as the prowess and sophistication of its Washington political and lobbying operation .
“ The Indians freaked out at talk of Bill Clinton being an envoy to Kashmir , ” said Daniel Markey , a South Asia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ The reason they were so worried is they do n’t want their activities in Kashmir to be equated with what Pakistan is doing in Afghanistan . ”
“ They [ India ] are the big fish [ in the region ] , ” Markey added .
“ They do n’t want to be grouped with the ‘ problem children ’ in the region , on Kashmir , on nuclear issues .
They have a fairly effective lobbying machine .
They have taken a lot of notes on the Israel model , and they have gotten better .
But you do n’t want to overstate it .
Some of the lobbying effort is obvious , done through companies , but a lot of it is direct government to government contact , people talking to each other .
The Indian government and those around the Indian government made clear through a variety of channels because of the Clinton rumors and they came out to quickly shoot that down . ”
Once Holbrooke ’s name was floated , the Indian lobbying campaign became even more intense .
“ The Indians do not like Holbrooke because he has been very good on Pakistan … and has a very good feel for the place ” said one former U.S. official on condition of anonymity .
“ The Indians have this town down . ”
Initially , when Obama ’s plans for a corps of special envoys became public after the election , The Cable was told , the idea was for a senior diplomat to tackle the Kashmir dispute as part of the South Asia envoy portfolio and whose mandate would include India .
But soon after the election and Holbrooke ’s name began to appear , the Indians approached key transition officials to make clear that while they could not affect what the new administration did with respect to envoys , that they would expect no mediation on the Kashmir issue .
“ I have suggested to others , though not directly to Dick [ Holbrooke ] , that his title should not / not include India , precisely so that he would be freer to work with them , ” Zelikow said .
“ If you understand Indian politics , this paradox makes sense . ”
“ I did nothing for the [ Government of India ] on this , ” Zelikow added .
The Indian government “ talked directly to folks on the [ Obama ] transition team and I heard about it from my Indian friends .
I think Holbrooke needs to talk to the Indians .
But they are trying , understandably , to break out of being in a hyphenated relationship with America ( i.e. , comprehended on a mental map called India - Pakistan ) . ”
Other sources said India ’s hired lobbyists were deployed to shape the contours of the U.S. diplomatic mission .
According to lobbying records filed with the Department of Justice , since 2005 , the government of India has paid BGR about $ 2.5 million .
BGR officials who currently work on the Indian account , who according to lobbying records include former Sen. Chuck Hagel aide Andrew Parasiliti , former U.S. State Department counterproliferation official Stephen Rademaker , former Bush I and Reagan era White House aide and BGR partner Ed Rogers , and former House Foreign Affairs committee staffer Walker Roberts , did not respond to messages left Friday by Foreign Policy .
Former U.S. ambassador to India Robert Blackwill , who previously served as a lobbyist for India , left BGR in 2008 for the Rand Corporation .
In addition , the Indian embassy in Washington has paid lobbying firm Patton Boggs $ 291,665 under a six - month contract that took effect Aug. 18 , according to lobbying records .
“ BGR has been a registered lobbyist for the Indian government since 2005 , ” noted one Senate staffer on condition of anonymity .
“ The Indian government retained BGR for the primary purpose of pushing through the Congress the civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and India – hence the strategic hires of Bob Blackwill , the former U.S. Ambassador to India , and Walker Roberts , a senior staffer on the House Foreign Affairs Committee responsible for vetting past such agreements .
BGR continues to actively lobby on behalf of the Indian government – their lobbyists sought to influence a recent Senate resolution on the Mumbai attacks .
So I would be very surprised if BGR were NOT involved here . ”
( For its part , Pakistan has spent about $ 1,175,000 , on lobbying during the past year , including on trade issues .
That includes Dewey and LeBoeuf ’s work for the Ministry of Commerce , and Locke Lord ’s work for the Embassy of Pakistan and the Pakistan International Airlines Corp , according to lobbying records . )
It ’s not clear to experts and officials interviewed exactly who in the Obama transition team was contacted as part of the Indian lobbying effort .
The White House did not respond to queries .
Asked about the decision to exclude India from the special envoy ’s official mandate , former NSC and CIA official Bruce Riedel , who served as the senior lead of the team advising the Obama campaign on South Asian issues , said by e-mail , “ When Senator Clinton originally proposed the envoy idea in her campaign it was only for Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
He did n’t respond to a further query questioning why Clinton ’s campaign comments on the issue mattered as much as Obama ’s , since , obviously , it was Obama who won the presidency and ultimately appointed her to carry out his foreign policy as the Obama administration ’s top diplomat .
UPDATE : An administration official responded that the transition met with no foreign governments and no representatives of foreign governments , pursuant to a policy laid out by the then President - Elect .
He further said that it was never the intent for the South Asian envoy portfolio to include an Indian role .
UPDATE II : See related follow - up piece , “ India ’s special envoy anxiety , ” here .

This is an excellent editing job splicing into a Klein speech several " responses " by Milton from old interviews .
As much as I enjoy the way in which this makes Klein look like the simpleton she is , the real joy is seeing Friedman at his most powerful and articulate and radical , especially in the segment with Phil Donahue .

Patrick McGoohan , one of genre television 's most innovative voices , just died at age 80 .
A rebel who refused to stick to tried - and - true formulas , his show The Prisoner gave rise to dramas like Lost and BSG .

Here 's a pretty great interview with McGoohan from 1977 .
Asked why he decided to help create The Prisoner , he explains it was all due to " boredom " with television and with society .
He pitched the show to financier Lew Grade on a Saturday morning , and had the budget to start making the show the following Monday .
McGoohan thought his concept would only sustain seven scripts , but Grade insisted on a full season of 26 .
In the end , they managed to eke out 17 .

The Prisoner , the story of a spy who decides to resign , and then finds himself kidnapped and trapped in an idyllic village where everyone is a number and the village leaders are trying to break him .
McGoohan explained :
It was a place that is trying to destroy the individual by every means possible ; trying to break his spirit , so that he accepts that he is No. 6 and will live there happily as No. 6 for ever after .
And this is the one rebel that they can't break .

Over the show 's run , it becomes more and more surreal and disturbing , culminating in a final episode whose significance people are still debating .
( You can watch all of the show 's episodes on the AMC website , courtesy of the people who are remaking the show . )

And here 's McGoohan on the danger of aiming your entertainment at a particular audience or genre :
You see , one of the t'ings that is frustrating about making a piece of entertainment is trying to make it appeal to everybody .
I think this is fatal .
I do n't think you can do that .
It 's done a great deal , you know .
We have our horror movies and we have our science - fiction things .
The best works are those that say ... somebody says , " We want to do something this way , " and do it , not because they 're aiming at a particular audience .
They 're doing it because it's a story they think is important , and is a statement that they want to make .
And they do it and then whoever want to watch it , that 's their privilege .
I mean , the painting in an art gallery , you know , you have a choice whether you go and look at this one or that one or the other one .
You have a choice not even to go in .

McGoohan famously turned down the roles of James Bond and Simon Templair ( in The Saint . )
Instead of being content to embody the " secret agent " archetype , he chose to reinvent it .
We 're all a lot richer as a result .

Description
Sun Tzu’s
Art of War has been vastly influential in the east since China ’s Warring States Period ( 403 BC – 221 BC ) .
And though its first translation into a European language was only in 1782 , the book ’s significance was quickly recognized ; and even such towering figures of Western history as Napoleon and General Douglas MacArthur have claimed it as a source of inspiration .
Pax Librorum now brings readers this restored and highly accessible unannotated edition of Lionel Giles ’ definitive translation of this enduring masterpiece .
U.S. President Barack Obama 's climate change plan is , by his country 's standards , a dreamy wish list .
His cap - and - trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would be tougher than any tried or contemplated elsewhere .
But Obama , despite sky - high popularity and the Democrats ' strong grip on the Congress , is n't likely to get what he 's seeking .
Which would be good news for our federal government – no need to distinguish any longer between Conservatives and Liberals on this issue – and some of our industries .
Not so good , though , for anyone concerned about climate change .
Even Obama 's plan would n't come close to the emission cuts scientists say are essential by 2020 .
And what 's likely to emerge from the American policy brawl is far less .
Here 's what we 're dealing with :
In cap - and - trade systems , governments limit total greenhouse emissions and require that refineries , power plants and other emitters obtain permits for every tonne they spew .
The cap and , therefore , the number of permits , are gradually reduced .
In theory , the shrinking supply raises the value of permits , so sources choose to cut emissions instead .
Europe launched cap and trade four years ago .
Each source included was assigned a quota , based on its emissions at the time , and given enough permits to cover it .
From then on , those that got below their quota could sell excess permits to those who went above .
The venture covered only major emitters , too many permits were issued , some companies made windfall profits before the price of permits plummeted , and emissions rose .
Our government wants to emulate Europe , except that its system would likely be even weaker .
Obama 's plan would cover more sources of pollution and offer no freebies .
From Day
One , each emitter would have to buy , in an auction , permits for every tonne .
This system is extremely efficient from an economist 's point of view , says Lisa DeMarco , an expert in emissions trading law at the firm MacLeod Dixon .
But it would spell trouble for Canada , a major reason Environment Minister Jim Prentice was in Washington this week .
U.S. industries fear it would favour competitors from countries without strong cap - and - trade systems .
The likely solution : The U.S. would impose " border adjustments " on goods from countries with weak plans , based on the amount of greenhouse emissions they 're responsible for .
Given Canada 's poor performance and plans so far , these " adjustments " would apply to our exports , thus our angst over violations of free - trade agreements .
But most observers say there 's no chance anything close to a 100 - per-cent auction system will get through the U.S. Congress .
It 's expensive : Obama 's budget estimates an annual cost of $ 80 billion starting in 2012 .
With industry leaders squawking , and critics projecting an initial gasoline price hike of 45 cents a litre , and 160 - per-cent increases in electricity bills by 2020 , it 's also political quicksand .
DeMarco and others suggest , and Prentice likely was assured , the outcome will resemble the plan recommended last fall by negotiators for the seven states and four provinces , including Ontario , that make up the Western Climate Initiative .
" They 've done the heavy lifting , " DeMarco says .
It , too , would begin in 2012 but at first cover less of the economy and , the crucial feature , give away most permits .
While it would soon be expanded , the proportion of permits to be auctioned would rise to only 25 per cent by 2020 .
The cap and its rate of decline remain to be set .

Such a scheme would do little to slow climate change .
We might do better if Ottawa led an effort for something more effective .
So far , though , it 's waiting to follow , and all indications are that the weaker the American plan , the happier our government will be

REPUBLICANS ’ MADDENING JUDICIAL GAMES ….
In Bill Clinton ’s second term , Senate Republicans did everything they could to slow the Democratic president ’s drive to fill judicial vacancies .
By 2001 , those same Senate Republicans changed their own rules to make it easier for George W. Bush to stack the federal courts .
By 2003 , a group of senators led by Orrin Hatch had completely re-written the rules on senatorial objections to would - be judges .
Left without the traditional tools , Senate Democrats started filibustering the most extreme right - wing nominees .
This , Republicans said , was literally unconstitutional and an affront that tore at the fabric of our system of government .
“ Advice and consent , ” the GOP said , meant giving every judicial nominee an up - or - down vote .
Anything else , they said , would be an outrageous insult to our democracy .
According to reports in Roll Call , Politico , and The Hill , Senate Republicans have miraculously changed their minds again .
President Barack Obama should fill vacant spots on the federal bench with former President Bush ’s judicial nominees to help avoid another huge fight over the judiciary , all 41 Senate Republicans said Monday .
In a letter to the White House , the Republican senators said Obama would “ change the tone in Washington ” if he were to renominate Bush nominees like Peter Keisler , Glen Conrad and Paul Diamond .
And they requested that Obama respect the Senate ’s constitutional role in reviewing judicial nominees by seeking their consultation about potential nominees from their respective states .
“ Regretfully , if we are not consulted on , and approve of , a nominee from our states , the Republican Conference will be unable to support moving forward on that nominee , ” the letter warns .
“ And we will act to preserve this principle and the rights of our colleagues if it is not . ”
In other words , Republicans are threatening a filibuster of judges if they ’re not happy .
Even by the standards of the congressional GOP , this is truly ridiculous .
The same people who said judicial filibusters were literally illegal are threatening to launch judicial filibusters .
What ’s more , they also want to see the failed former president ’s unsuccessful judicial nominees put on the federal bench for life — just a gesture of goodwill .
All that talk about up - or - down votes has gone completely out the window .
The passionate arguments about an elected president being able to stack the courts with like - minded judges , enjoying lifetime appointments , are but a memory .
Why , it ’s almost as if the Republicans ’ deeply held principles vary depending on the president ’s political party .
That could n’t be , could it ?
My friend Kyle , who had a terrific piece on this , points to Orrin Hatch ’s vision for how the process is supposed to work , at least when Bush is president :
“ It seems to me that the only way to make sense of the advice and consent role that our Constitution ’s framers envisioned for the Senate is to begin with the assumption that the President ’s constitutional power to nominate should be given a fair amount of deference , and that we should defeat nominees only where problems of character or inability to follow the law are evident .
“ In other words , the question of ideology in judicial confirmations is answered by the American people and the Constitution when the President is constitutionally elected .
As Alexander Hamilton recorded for us , the Senate ’s task of advice and consent is to advise and to query on the judiciousness and character of nominees , not to challenge , by our naked power , the people ’s will in electing who shall nominate .
“ To do otherwise , it seems to me , is to risk making the federal courts an extension of this political body .
This would threaten one of the cornerstones of this country ’s unique success — an independent judiciary . ”
This was the dominant position of every Republican in Congress for the last eight years , as well as the vision embraced by the entire conservative movement .
And yet , there was every single member of the Senate Republican caucus yesterday — including Hatch — making the opposite argument to Obama .
Their shamelessness knows no bounds .
Italdesign Giugiaro is a familiar name to gearheads the world over , and its designs for everything from Hyundai to Ferrari are well known .
Frazer - Nash , on the other hand , is generally considered the answer to a trivia question , but it was once a respected sports car company .
All of those names came together at the Geneva Motor Show to bring us the Namir concept , which combines Prius - beating fuel economy with Ferrari - like speed to produce what the companies say is the quickest , greenest hybrid on the planet .
Namir is Arabian for tiger , by the way .
Given the specs on this ride , that name sure fits .
That ’s right , this angular , scissor - doored sports car concept is a hybrid .
The drivetrain was designed by Frazer - Nash , which Archie Frazer - Nash founded in England in 1923 .
Once a sports car maker , the company is now in the business of designing , building and marketing hybrid systems .
The Namir combines an 814 cc endothermic rotary engine with four electric motors in a system that those involved in project claim delivers 91 mpg and CO2 emissions of 60 g / km .
The Toyota Prius emits 104 g/ km .
Those are impressive numbers , but the number that really wows us is the claimed top speed of 187 mph and a zero - to - 60 time of 3.5 seconds .
In theory , anyway , given that it 's a concept .
But the Namir is more than a design exercise .
It 's a fully developed prototype .
Giugiaro ’s engineering division handled the chassis , body , and mechanical layout while the Italdesign Giugiaro Style Center penned the exterior and interior .
Frazer - Nash oversaw the electrical and electronic elements , and the whole thing was built by Italdesign Giugiaro plant .
Who knows if this will ever see production .
But Italdesign Giugiaro and Frazer - Nash are outside design and consulting firms , so they will work for companies like General Motors , Chrysler or anyone else in desperate need of a high - performance fuel efficient car to boost their sex appeal and CAFE numbers .
Just sayin ' ...

Reality TV Stars and … Internships for Social Justice ?
No matter what you think of reality TV and the Real World : Brooklyn series , you have to admit it ’s kind of cool that three members of the cast were volunteer interns at the LGBT Community Center during the show .
For Katelynn ’s internship , she created a new section of the Center ’s website called the Gender Identity Project where you can learn more about transgender identities and find related services and events in NYC .
JD ’s internship involved a voter registration initiative called Promote the Vote .
And Sarah ’s internship was focused on running a weekly art class about self - image .
All eight of the Real World housemates also participated in last year ’s Braking the Cycle , which is a bike ride to fund HIV / AIDS work , and the Center ’s largest annual fundraiser .
( Registration is now open for this year ’s ride , which will span 275 miles , from Boston to New York ! )
Although the filming of the show ended in 2008 , some of the cast members still make appearances at the Center ’s various fundraisers and events .
In 1985 , with the Darfur region of Sudan deep in drought , a doctoral candidate named Alex de Waal met with a bedridden and nearly blind Arab sheikh named Hilal Abdalla .
The elderly nomad and his tribesmen had pitched their camp across an unforgiving wasteland of rock and sand .
Broad black tents rose like sails against the rough horizon .
Thorn trees broke ground at lonesome intervals , sparse grazing for the tribe ’s camels .
The student was long - limbed and gangly , bent forward with the eagerness of youth .
The sheikh — tall , stately , stooped by age — asked him in .
" His tent was hung with the paraphernalia of a lifetime ’s nomadism — water jars , saddles , spears , swords , leather bags , and an old rifle " , De Waal recalled years later .
" He invited me to sit opposite him on a fine Persian rug , summoned his retainer to serve sweet tea on a silver platter , and told me the world was coming to an end . "
They dined on goat and rice and ate with their hands .
De Waal was studying indigenous reactions to the dryness that gripped the region .
The elderly nomad described things he had never seen before .
Sand blew over fertile lands .
The rare rain washed away alluvial soil .
Farmers who had once hosted his tribe and his camels were now blocking their migration ; the land could no longer support both herders and planters .
Many of the sheikh ’s tribesmen had lost their stock and scratched at millet farming , relegated to sandy soil between plots of fertile land .
With his stick , the nomad sketched a grid in the sand , a chessboard de Waal understood to be the " moral geography " of the region .
The farmers tended to their crops in the black squares , and the sheikh ’s people stuck to the white , cutting without conflict like chessboard bishops through the fields .
The drought had changed all that .
The God - given order was broken , the sheikh said , and he feared the future .
" The way the world was set up since time immemorial was being disturbed " , recalled de Waal , now a program director at the Social Science Research Council .
" And it was bewildering , depressing , and the consequences were terrible . "
Nearly 20 years later , when a new scourge swept across Darfur , de Waal would remember the meeting .
Janjaweed fighters in military uniforms , mounted on camels and horses , laid waste to the region .
In a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting the region ’s blacks , the armed militiamen raped women , burned houses , and tortured and killed men of fighting age .
Through whole swathes of Darfur , they left only smoke curling into the sky .
At their head was a six - foot - four Arab with an athletic build and a commanding presence .
In a conflict the United States would call genocide , he topped the State Department ’s list of suspected war criminals .
De Waal recognised him .
His name was Musa Hilal , and he was the sheikh ’s son .
On the path from worried elder to militant son lie the roots of a conflict that has forced two million mostly black Africans from their homes and killed between 200,000 and 450,000 people .
The fighting in Darfur is usually described as racially motivated , pitting mounted Arabs against black rebels and civilians .
But the distinction between " Arab " and " black African " in Darfur is defined more by lifestyle than by any physical difference : Arabs are generally herders , Africans typically farmers .
The two groups are not racially distinct .
Both are predominantly Muslim .
The fault lines have their origins in another distinction , between settled farmers and nomadic herders fighting over failing lands .
The aggression of the warlord Musa Hilal — forged in a time of desertification , drought , and famine — can be traced to the fears of his father and to how climate change shattered a way of life .
Until the rains began to fail , the sheikh ’s people had lived amicably with the settled farmers .
The nomads were welcome passers - through , grazing their camels on the rocky hillsides that separated the fertile plots .
The farmers would share their wells , and the herders would feed their stock on the leavings from the harvest .
But with the drought , the nomads ranged farther for their food , and the farmers began to fence off their land — even fallow land — for fear it would be ruined by passing herds .
Sometimes they ’d burn the grass upon which the animals fed .
A few tribes drifted elsewhere or took up farming , but the camel - herding Arabs stuck to their fraying livelihoods — nomadic herding was central to their cultural identity .
The name Darfur means " Land of the Fur " , called so for the largest single tribe of farmers in the region .
But the vast region holds the homelands — the dars — of many tribes .
In the late 1980s , landless and increasingly desperate Arabs banded together to wrest their own dar from the black farmers , publishing in 1987 a manifesto of racial superiority .
It began with complaints of underrepresentation in the government and concluded with a threat to take matters into their own hands :
" We fear that if this neglect of the participation of the Arab race continues , things will break loose from the hands of the wise men to those of the ignorant , leading to matters of grave consequences . "
Clashes had broken out between the Fur and camel - herding Arabs , and in the two years before an uneasy peace was signed in 1989 , 3000 people , mostly Fur , were killed , and hundreds of villages and nomadic camps were burnt .
More fighting in the 1990s entrenched the divisions between Arabs and non-Arabs , pitting the pastoralists against the Fur , Zaghawa , and Massaleit , the three tribes that would later form the bulk of the rebellion against the central government .
In these disputes , Khartoum often supported the Arabs politically .
Sometimes — in an attempt to create a bulwark against revolutionaries from southern Sudan — the government provided arms .
When a rebellion began in Darfur in 2003 , it was at first a reaction against Khartoum ’s neglect and political marginalisation of the region .
But while the rebels initially sought a pan-ethnic front against a distant , uncaring regime , the schism between those who opposed the government and those who supported it soon broke largely on ethnic lines .
The camel - herding Arabs became Khartoum ’s staunchest stalwarts .
Nomadic Arab militia launched a brutal campaign to push the black farmers from Darfur .
They wore military uniforms , sometimes drove military vehicles , and coordinated their attacks with Sudanese aerial bombing .
Even so , the conflict was rooted more in land envy than in ethnic hatred .
" Some of the Arab pastoral tribes , particularly the camel herders , did not have their own dar , so were always at the mercy of other tribes for land " , said David Mozersky , the International Crisis Group ’s project director for the Horn of Africa .
" This was fine for hundreds of years , since the system provided land for these groups as they moved . "
" But as desertification worsened and as fertile land decreased , some of these pastoralists sought to have their own land , which was n’t really an option in Darfur .
This was one of the main factors that Khartoum used to manipulate and mobilise these Arab tribes to join the Janjaweed and fight on their side .
Interestingly , most of the Arab tribes who have their own land rights did not join the government ’s fight . "

Republican politicians have reportedly called for a sweeping new federal law requiring all Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) and operators of millions of WiFi access points -- including hotels , local coffee shops , and home users -- to keep records about users for two years to aid police investigations .
The legislation would impose unprecedented data retention requirements on a broad swath of Internet access providers .
Two bills ( S. 436 in the Senate and H.R. 1076 in the House of Representatives ) have been introduced so far .
Each bill is titled " Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today 's Youth Act , " or the Internet Safety Act. ( Source : cnet.com )
Each bill says a provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service shall retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user .
The Internet Safety Act would apply not just to AT&T , Comcast , Verizon and all other Internet Service Providers , but also to the tens of millions of homes with WiFi access points or wired routers using the standard method of dynamically assigning temporary addresses .
( DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol . )
Everyone would have to keep such information if the bill became law .
Millions of WiFi Users Affected
The legal definition of electronic communication service is " any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications , " but the U.S. Justice Department has taken the position that any service that provides others with means of communicating electronically qualifies .
That means that not only public WiFi access points be included .
The law would apply to individuals , small businesses , large corporations , libraries , schools , universities , government agencies and Voice over IP ( VoIP ) services , too .
If the Internet Safety Act became law , all those entities would have to keep logs for at least two years .
In their current forms , the bills lack information about fines and the enforcement of the retention of data .
Privacy advocates and civil rights watchdogs say the measure threatens people 's privacy and creates potential security risks including identity theft and other fraud .

JAKARTA , March 3 ( Reuters ) - Four Indonesians died from bird flu in February , bringing the country 's total death toll from the disease to 119 , officials at the national bird flu commission said on Tuesday .
" There were four cases and all four died in February , " said Bayu Krisnamurthi , head of the national bird flu commission .
Indonesian newspaper Republika also reported on Tuesday that two more deaths from the disease occurred at the weekend near the capital Jakarta -- a 5 - year - old girl from Depok , and an 8 - year - old boy from Bekasi .
The national commission said that samples were being tested in Jakarta to verify the cause of death in both cases .
Indonesia , which has stopped publishing updates of bird flu deaths immediately after they occur , has the highest toll from the disease of any nation .
Experts fear that the virus might mutate into a form easily passed from human to human , sparking a pandemic which could kill millions .

Sales are a little thin for mint and other Girl Scout cookies so far this year .
National numbers are not yet in , but regional Girl Scout councils nationwide are seeing the impact of the down economy , as well as bad winter weather , in declines as large as 19 % in pre-order sales , which took place January through early February .
Pre-order sales — mostly door - to - door and workplace — make up around 70 % of cookie sales , council leaders say .
Councils are hopeful they will make up for the drop - off with sales at shopping center booths through early spring , says Michelle Tompkins , spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of the USA .
Among the councils reporting declines :
• Eastern South Carolina Council , near Charleston , shows pre-sales down 19 % from 868,386 boxes in 2008 to about 700,000 boxes so far this year , says product sales manager Keisha Frost .
• Northeast Ohio Council , near Cleveland , reports pre-sales down about 16 % , from 2.5 million to 2.1 million boxes , says Marianne Love , director of business services .
• Nation 's Capital Council , in Northern Virginia , Washington and parts of Maryland , sees 5 % fewer pre-sales , down to 3.7 million boxes , says public relations and marketing director Nancy Wood .
• Frontier Council in Las Vegas sales are down 1.3 % from 612,792 to 604,524 boxes , says development director Emily Smith .
About two - thirds of the 133 Girl Scout councils nationwide sell cookies from January through March , Tompkins says .
The rest sell in the fall .
Most proceeds , she says , go to troops and councils to pay for trips , community projects and scholarships .
Love said some leaders are reporting longtime customers purchasing in smaller quantities .
" If a customer was purchasing six to eight boxes , now they 're purchasing three to four , " she says .
Sales are n't down everywhere .
Natalie Martin , director for marketing and communication at the Northeast Texas Council , near Dallas , says that council has seen a 2 % increase in pre-sales this year .
For the first time in 10 years , headquarters reduced each box size by about one ounce this year because of increased ingredient and transportation costs , says Denise Pesich , vice president of communications for Girl Scouts of the USA .
The $ 3.50 average cost per box has been the same for the past five years , Tompkins says .
Tompkins adds the Girl Scouts have n't dealt with salmonella - contaminated peanut products because neither of their baking companies , Little Brownie Bakers and ABC Interbake , buys from the peanut plants involved .
Pesich is optimistic booth sales will be strong .
" We 're hopeful right now .
The country , when in situations like this , goes back to what 's nostalgic and gives them pleasure , " Pesich says .

To a gambler 's brain , a near miss provides almost the same high as a win , according to a new study that helps explain the allure of slot machines and the difficulty that some gamblers have in walking away .
“ The near - miss is quite a paradoxical event , ” [ researcher Luke ] Clark says .
Gamblers who almost win put “ their head down in their hands — they ca n’t believe it .
And then the next thing they do is place another bet ” [ Science News ] .
In the small study , published in Neuron [ subscription required ] , researchers had 15 volunteers play a slot machine while their brain activity was recorded with fMRI scans .
When the researchers compared the scans , they found that near misses drew more blood to reward regions such as the insula and the ventral striatum than full misses did [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
These areas are also activated by rewards like chocolate and cocaine ; when the near misses partially activated the so - called reward pathway , it released pleasant doses of the brain chemical dopamine .
Researchers say it makes sense for the brain to respond to almost hitting a target .
For some tasks , such as learning to kick a soccer ball into a goal or firing an arrow at a target , near - misses are informative .
“ You ’re acquiring the skill , and the brain should pay attention to near - misses , ” Clark says .
But in gambling , almost winning has no effect on the next pull of the lever or roll of the dice .
“ Games of chance tell you nothing about future success , ” he says [ Science News ] .
Gambling has essentially hijacked the natural reward system , Clark says , and he adds that it 's not only gambling addicts who have to worry about being tricked by their own brains .
" Importantly , our volunteers in this study were not regular or problem gamblers , and so these findings suggest that the brain may naturally respond to near misses in this way " [ Telegraph ] .
Slot machine makers capitalize on the near - miss effect .
Researchers have found that they program their games to tease players with near misses about 30 % of the time -- a number previous studies have found optimal for getting gamblers to keep coming back [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
The researchers also found that when they gave the test subjects a sense of control over the game 's outcome by letting them choose when to stop the first reel of the slot machine , the effect of near misses was heightened .
That 's another stratagem that Vegas got wise to some time ago .

Gaming Industry Looks to Science to Beat Class Action Image : Neuron
We 'll admit we never fully got the morality of The Pirate Bay 's founding ethos , but we were always grateful that abandoned chunks of culture like The Star Wars Holiday Special found a home there , and the site 's popularly with otherwise law - abiding consumers is a vivid reminder of how thoroughly Hollywood botched the internet age .
With Sweden 's Pirate Party enjoying enough youth support to make it a political contender , we were interested to see where this movement would go .
But with the first show trial of the movement over , The Pirate Bay is revealed as an empty vessel – a rudderless ghost ship navigating without a guiding principle ; existing for no other reason than because it can .
For years , the three men behind The Pirate Bay have defended internet piracy with a jaunty swagger that made them appear untouchable , thumbing their nose at corporate lawyers while captaining the most notorious file sharing site on the internet .
" We see it as our duty to spread culture and media , " co-founder Peter Sunde told us in 2006 .
" Technology is just a means to doing that . "
When Swedish authorities raided The Pirate Bay and its servers in 2006 – paving the way for ongoing criminal trial that ended Tuesday – the pirates were unbowed , quickly resurrecting the site and setting their reverse- DNS to read : " hey.mpaa.and.apb.bite.my.shiny.metal.ass.thepiratebay.org . "
" Even though no one spreads more culture than we do , it is the film and music - mob that are trying to close us down , " co-founder Fredrik Neij said , in a speech outside Swedish Parliament after the raid .
" This time we 're firing with the big cannons and saying , ' In your face , Hollywood ! ' "
But all that swagger evaporated like salt water on a beached schooner once The Pirate Bay landed on the witness stand in Stockholm , Sweden , where the three admitted founders – and a fourth man accused of financing them – face up to two years in prison each on allegations of facilitating copyright infringement .
The trial wrapped up Tuesday , and a verdict is expected in April .
In the courtroom , the defendants quickly abandoned their revolutionary , free - culture ideals in favor of the simpler philosophy embraced by criminal defendants since time immemorial : I 'm Not Responsible .
Defendant Peter Sunde ,
The Pirate Bay 's most public face , testified that he was " only " a spokesman who never actively participated in running the site .
The prosecution produced evidence to the contrary , but nothing so damning in our eyes as Sunde 's self - portrait as a stuffed - shirt spouting defiant talking points that he did n't believe .
For his part , Neij cast himself as a harried system administrator , concerned only with the technical challenge of keeping an enormously popular site running smoothly .
And when Gottfrid Svartholm Warg was confronted with his once - endearing habit of publicly ridiculing copyright owners foolish enough to send a takedown notice to Pirate Bay , you could hear the back - pedaling from across the Atlantic .
" They still do n't understand that they have to write to the persons who share the material , not us , " he said .
It was a theme that echoed through the defense :
Do n't prosecute us , prosecute our 22 million users .
They 're the crooks !
As for Neij 's electrifying 2006 speech ?
He explained in court that he just read a piece of paper thrust in front of him by the Pirate Bureau , the Swedish open - culture activist party who help start The Pirate Bay five years ago .
He did n't mean it .
Change.gov against Obama
One of the safer predictions I ’ve made in recent years is “ this ” : http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=can_partisanship_save_citizenship ( in _ The American Prospect_ ) :
[ O] nline activists are unlikely to follow Obama if he moves toward a post - ideological politics of citizenship and may even use Obama ’s own machine to organize against him ( as they did within MyBarackObama.com when Obama announced his support for controversial wiretapping legislation ) .
By rebuilding the Democratic Party around a model that is friendlier to decentralized online participation , Obama is … making it easier for Democratic activists to organize in protest against overly “ moderate ” decisions
But I did n’t expect it to start happening _quite_ so soon .
“ Ari Melber ” : http://www.thenation.com/blogs/state_of_change/395205/torture_prosecutor_tops_70_000_questions_for_obama_on_change_gov?rel=hp_blogs_box in _ The Nation ._
A whopping 70,000 questions poured into Change.gov over the past week , in response to the Obama transition team ’s call for citizen queries to the President - Elect .
After votes from about 100,000 people , the top ranked question asks Obama whether he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture and illegal surveillance by the U.S. government .
I ’ve been working with activist Bob Fertik to organize support for the question , and several progressive bloggers urged readers and Obama supporters to vote for it last week .
See also ( via Ari ) “ the NYT ” : http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/advocates-of-a-special-prosecutor-for-bush-seek-an-answer-from-obama/
the number one submission on the popular “ Open for Questions ” portion of the site might seem more than a little impolitic to the current , and soon to be former , occupant of the White House . …
Though the Obama team has promised to answer some of the top questions as early as this week , they have not said whether they will respond to Mr. Fertik ’s , which has received more than 22,000 votes since the second round of the question - and - answer feature began on Dec. 30 .
This goes to the heart of the contradictions that the Obama people successfully managed to straddle during the campaign , but are ( I think ) going to have increasing difficulty in dealing with going forward .
The Obama people combined very tight top - down message control and campaign coordination with a fair degree of openness at the bottom to independent initiatives by volunteers .
As long as everyone agreed on the same underlying goal ( beating the Republicans ) , this worked .
But as that overwhelming imperative recedes , people are going to start pursuing their own objectives – and the ‘ open ’ architecture that the Obama people have constructed provides them with plenty of opportunities to do this .
And this is a pretty significant problem for an administration that is likely to be obsessed with discipline and message control .
People calling for investigations by an independent prosecutor into torture ca n’t be dismissed as trolls or cranks .
They are articulating a set of values which is likely held by a substantial majority of Democrats and Obama supporters .
But it ’s politically inconvenient , for a variety of reasons , for the Obama people to acknowledge this , much less to do anything about it .
Under normal politics , they might be able to sweep this under the rug – after all Obama and his team are supposed to be the public face of the Democratic party .
But the creation of an open architecture , where others can bring inconvenient issues up – and very likely keep on bringing them up – makes it substantially more difficult for them to maintain control of the conversation .
There ’s been a lot of talk about how the new architecture of MyBarackObama.com , Change.gov etc are going to enhance the agenda setting power of the president .
This will likely happen in some instances , but in others , as here , the volunteer movement going to be more of a bully than a bully pulpit , setting the agenda rather than serving as a glorified force - multiplier for things that the president would like to see happen .
Being a cynic , I suspect that the Obama people are going to discount and try to distance themselves from the bits of the architecture that they can’t control , but if I ’m right , they may have some difficulty in so doing as these forums take on a life of their own .
An article on anarchism and unions , written in an attempt to build support for the Anarchist Workers Network ( AWN ) .
The AWN aimed to create a libertarian presence in the trade unions , but after a period of interest it disappeared .
An article written to learn some lessons from the AWN is attached at the end .
There is power in a union !
The current period is marked by an increase in workers ' anger and action .
Trade unions have started to reassert themselves .
Strikes , while increasing , are nowhere near the levels of 20 and 30 years ago .
However , it is still early days .
What happens next depends on what direction trade union militants decide to take .
Currently , the various parties of the left , led by the SWP in England / Wales and the SSP in Scotland , are trying to get the more militant unions to break their financial links to New Labour .
Anarchists cannot help but agree .
Why fund your oppressors ?
Yet while agreeing on this , we radically object to the suggestion that unions should tie themselves to a new , " more leftwing , " party .
To do so will simply repeat the mistakes of the last 100 years when the union bureaucracies created the Labour party .
Instead anarchists argue that the unions should be independent from all political parties .
They should use their members contributions not to fund a new set of would - be politicians but rather to campaign for their members ' interests directly .
We suggest far more than just this .
Anarchists argue that the labour movement is currently deeply flawed and that is the source of many of our current problems .
Moreover , we have a practical alternative which would make politicians irrelevant .
However , give how distorted the anarchist position on unions are , it is necessary to first recap the general anarchist position on the workers ' movement .
Anarchism and trade unionism
For anarchists , there is power in a union .
Anarchists have long seen the importance of workers organising themselves .
As Max Stirner pointed out the " labourers have the most enormous power in their hands , and , if they once become thoroughly conscious of it and used it , nothing could withstand them ; they would only have to stop labour , regard the product of labour as theirs , and enjoy it .
This is the sense of the labour disturbances which show themselves here and there . "
The question is how best to organise and use it .
For Bakunin , like all revolutionary anarchists , there is , " between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie , an irreconcilable antagonism which results inevitably from their respective stations in life . "
He stressed " war between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is unavoidable " and would only end with the " abolition of the bourgeoisie as a distinct class . "
Collective struggle is the key .
Strikes , for example , are " the beginnings of the social war of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie . . .
Strikes are a valuable instrument from two points of view .
Firstly , they electrify the masses . . . awaken in them the feeling of the deep antagonism which exists between their interests and those of the bourgeoisie . . . secondly they help immensely to provoke and establish between the workers of all trades , localities and countries the consciousness and very fact of solidarity : a twofold action . . . which tends to constitute directly the new world of the proletariat , opposing it almost in an absolute way to the bourgeois world . "
They train workers for the social revolution as they " create , organise , and form a workers ' army , an army which is bound to break down the power of the bourgeoisie and the State , and lay the ground for a new world . "
The working class had " but a single path , that of emancipation through practical action which meant " workers ' solidarity in their struggle against the bosses " by " trades - unions , organisation , and the federation of resistance funds . "
Kropotkin built upon Bakunin 's arguments and , like him , based his politics on collective working class struggle and organisation .
For Kropotkin " the syndicalist and trade union movements , which permit the workingmen to realise their solidarity and to feel the community of their interests better than any election , prepare the way for these [ anarchist ] conceptions . "
His support for anarchist participation in the labour movement was strong , considering it a key method of preparing for a revolution and spreading anarchist ideas amongst the working classes .
As he put it : " The syndicat is absolutely necessary .
It is the sole force of the workers which continues the direct struggle against capital without turning to parliamentarism . "
This , for Kropotkin , was part of a general revolutionary strategy .
In order " to make the revolution , the mass of workers will have to organise themselves .
Resistance and the strike are excellent means of organisation for doing this . "
He argued that it was " a question of organising societies of resistance for all trades in each town , of creating resistance funds against the exploiters , of giving more solidarity to the workers ' organisations of each town and of putting them in contact with those of other towns , of federating them . . . Workers ' solidarity must no longer be an empty word by practised each day between all trades and all nations . "
The current unions
Anarchists have little time for the way the current trades unions are organised and act .
They are bureaucratic and top - down .
Berkman just pointed out the obvious , when he wrote that the " rank and file have little say .
They have delegated their power to leaders , and these have become the boss .
. .
Once you do that , the power you have delegated will be used against you and your interests every time . "
The unions are hopelessly sectionalist .
While we have one boss , we are divided into many different unions .
The members of one union often cross the picket lines of their fellow workers simply because they go on strike at different times .
They do the bosses job for us by dividing our forces .
Assuming , of course , the union bureaucracy actually decides to support effective action rather than giving up at the first hurdle .
So , for anarchists , the unions waste the only real power we , as workers , have -- our economic power , our ability to use direct action to defend and further our interests where we work and are exploited .
For these reasons we argue for a different form of workplace organisation , one run by and for its members .
Workers Self - organisation
The key issue for anarchists is one of power : who has it .
Are the rank and file in charge of their own struggles or is power concentrated in a few hands at the top ?
Anarchists want workplace organisations which are run directly by their members .
This anarchist opposition to union bureaucracy dates back over a century .
As does how anarchists think trade unionists should combat it .
Talking about the Geneva unions , Bakunin noted that the construction workers ' section " simply left all decision - making to their committees . . .
In this manner power gravitated to the committees , and by a species of fiction characteristic of all governments the committees substituted their own will and their own ideas for that of the membership . "
In opposition to this , he urged what would now be called a " rank and file movement " to combat the bureaucracy .
The workers " could only defend their rights and their autonomy in only one way : the workers called general membership meetings .
Nothing arouses the antipathy of the committees more than these popular assemblies .
. .
In these great meetings of the sections , the items on the agenda was amply discussed and the most progressive opinion prevailed . "
This is the key to anarchism in the workplace -- the active participation of members in their organisations , of strikers in their strikes .
It is the basis of building a rank - and - file movement inside and outside the current trade unions , one which aims to empower the worker at the expense of the boss and the bureaucrat .
From the bottom - up
This shows how anarchists think the labour movement should be organised , from the bottom - up .
The basis of the union should be the mass meeting of workers assembled at their place of work .
This meeting elects its factory committee and delegates .
It is for the workers affected to decision when and what kind of action to take , not distant bureaucrats .
To co-ordinate common struggles , anarchists advocate federalism .
The workplace union is federated to all other such committees in the locality , each locality federates and so upwards .
This promotes class solidarity .
In addition , unions within the same industry federate together .
The IT workplace is affiliated to a district IT federation .
In district federation is affiliated to the national federation .
The decision making process flows from the union meeting upwards .
The committees are not vested with power to abuse .
The members of union committees should not be representatives like MPs who air their own views and ignore the people .
Rather they are delegates who carry the message of the workers who elect them .
If they try to tell the workers what to do , then they are replaced as every delegates is subject to instant recall by the persons who elected them .
Rather than being highly paid , the aim would be for as few as possible to receive wages as delegates and if they do then it should be the average wage of the workers at the base of the union .
Thus the anarchist vision is for a fighting workplace organisation where the members control the organisation - not the bureaucrats controlling the members .
In a trade union the higher up the pyramid a person is the more power they wields ; in a real union the higher they are the less power they have .
Do n't vote , organise !
Over a hundred years of left - wing participation in electioneering has proven anarchism correct .
Rather than push the struggle for socialism forward , it has simply gutted it of any real radical practice and theory .
Instead of constructive organisation and struggle at the grassroots , energy and resources are wasted trying to elect politicians who will not betray us or the ideals of socialism .
Sometimes the parties involved do not even need to get elected for this to happen .
The current shenanigans of the SWP in regards to the " Respect " proposal comes as no surprise .
With socialist principles and class politics happily forgotten for the chance to sell some more papers and get a few comrades elected , the question surely is how long will the rank and file members who have some principles remain within it ?
Instead of the dead - end of electioneering , socialists should be stressing working class self - activity and control over the class struggle .
Workers , Bakunin argued , must " count no longer on anyone but yourselves .
. .
Abstain from all participation in bourgeois Radicalism and organise outside of it the forces of the proletariat .
The bases of this organisation are already completely given : they are the workshops and the federation of workshops , the creation of fighting funds , instruments of struggle against the bourgeoisie , and their federation , not only national , but international . "
The British labour movement has still to learn this .
Such direct action had a politicising effect far stronger than any election campaign .
It was , to quote Bakunin again , only " through practice and collective experience . . . [ and ] the progressive expansion and development of the economic struggle [ that ] will bring [ the worker ] more to recognise his [ or her ] true enemies : the privileged classes . . . and the State , which exists only to safeguard all the privileges of those classes . "
Moreover , as well as undermining capitalist normalcy , workers ' organisations also create the framework of socialism .
The " organisation of the trade sections , " Bakunin argued , " their federation in the International , and their representation by Chambers of Labour , . . . [ allow ] the workers . . . [ to ] combin[e ] theory and practice . . . [ and ] bear in themselves the living germs of the social order , which is to replace the bourgeois world .
They are creating not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself . "
Such workers ' collective organisation and struggle were essential , as Kropotkin also stressed .
To free humanity " a decisive blow will have to be administered to private property : from the beginning , the workers will have to proceed to take over all social wealth so as to put it into common ownership .
This revolution can only be carried out by the workers themselves . "
The " great mass of workers will not only have to constitute itself outside the bourgeoisie . . . it will have to take action of its own during the period which will precede the revolution . . . and this sort of action can only be carried out when a strong workers ' organisation exists . "
Getting there ...
Clearly such a movement does not exist and it will not appear overnight .
It will require anarchists to work together to spread our ideas to our fellow workers .
It will require , as Kropotkin put it , " Revolutionary Anarchist Communist propaganda within the Labour Unions . "
Like Bakunin , he stressed that " the Anarchists have always advised taking an active part in those workers ' organisations which carry on the direct struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector -- the State . "
This was because such struggle , " better than any other indirect means , permits the worker to obtain some temporary improvements in the present conditions of work , while it opens his eyes to the evil done by Capitalism and the State that supports it , and wakes up his thoughts concerning the possibility of organising consumption , production , and exchange without the intervention of the capitalist and the State . "
Anarchists " have endeavoured to promote their ideas directly amongst the labour organisations and to induce those unions to a direct struggle against capital , without placing their faith in parliamentary legislation . "
The role of anarchists as anarchists is essential .
The nature of the current unions proves Malatesta when he argued that " all movements founded on material and immediate interests ( and a mass working class movement cannot be founded on anything else ) , if the ferment , the drive and the unremitting efforts of men [ and women ] of ideas struggling and making sacrifices for an ideal future are lacking , tend to adapt themselves to circumstances , foster a conservative spirit , and fear of change in those who manage to improve their conditions , and often end up by creating new privileged classes and serving to support and consolidate the system one would want to destroy . "
Thus " the Trade Unions are , by their very nature reformist and never revolutionary .
The revolutionary spirit must be introduced , developed and maintained by the constant actions of revolutionaries who work from within their ranks as well as from outside , but it cannot be the normal , natural definition of the Trade Unions function . "
We need to think about how we can work within the labour movement ( at the rank and file level , of course ) is essential to gain influence for anarchist ideas , just as working with unorganised workers is also important .
It means rejecting the " one size fits all " approach on the trades unions that has become sadly dominant in certain parts of our movement .
When sensible we should be working with the rank and file of the labour movement while keeping our own identity as anarchists and organising as anarchists .
In other cases , it may make more sense to form a branch of the Industrial Workers of the World ( for example ) or create an informal grouping like the McDonalds ' Workers Resistance .
No matter the actual concrete activity , we should be working with the rank and file and trying to create autonomous workplace organisations , independent of the trade union bureaucracy and organised in a libertarian way and using libertarian tactics .
This is the aim of the Anarchists Workers Network .
What now ?
All revolutionary anarchists support the ideas of workplace organisation and struggle , of direct action , of solidarity and so on .
Some anarchists , however , refuse to call these workplace organisations " unions " and instead call them " workers ' councils " or " strike committees . "
The name does not matter , the principles are the same .
The key difference dividing some anarchists ( mostly , but not exclusively , anarcho - syndicalists ) from others ( mostly anarcho - communists ) is on whether such rank - and - file managed bodies should become permanent organisations or not .
However , this is a question that is best left to a future date when libertarian ideas have become better known and practised within the class struggle .
We are far from being in a position when such a debate will have relevance .
What we should be concentrating on now is working together and spreading basic anarchist ideas amongst our fellow workers , unionised or not .
This is the rationale of the AWN .
It aims to group anarchists who want to influence the class struggle together .
It does not aim to become a new federation ( SolFed or the AF ) .
Rather it seeks to complement those bodies and be a tool to co-ordinate activity of all anarchists interested in workplace struggle .
We aim to give a focus around which anarchists can work together within their unions , for example , to raise anarchist ideas of workers ' autonomy and direct action .
The AWN has just started .
We produced a poster supporting the posties wildcats last year .
We are leafleting the Convention of the Trade Union Left to show that there is an alternative to supporting would - be politicians with our dues .
We have produced articles for Freedom .
We aim to do a leaflet for this years May Day march and organise a " red and black " bloc for the London trade union organised one .
Ultimately , what we do depends on who gets involved and what they want to do .
If no one gets involved , the AWN will not exist .
It is as simple as that .
If you are interested in getting involved then please contact us .
We have a world to win !

Looking back at the Anarchist Workers Network
A while back I wrote an article for Freedom on anarchism and trade unions called " There is Power in a Union . "
It was a basic introduction to anarchist ideas on the subject and an edited version of it was published in that paper .
It was produced to complement a leafleting of a trade union activist meeting in London by the Anarchist Workers Network ( AWN ) .
The AWN is now defunct , having failed to produce enough activity or people to take the burden from its founders .
Which was , it should be mentioned , the fate of its immediate precursor , the Anarchist Trade - Union Network ( ATUN ) .
The key issues were raised at the end of the article :
" We need to think about how we can work within the labour movement ( at the rank and file level , of course ) is essential to gain influence for anarchist ideas , just as working with unorganised workers is also important .
It means rejecting the ' one size fits all ' approach on the trades unions that has become sadly dominant in certain parts of our movement .

Those ideas still ring true .
It still makes sense for libertarians to work together to put their ideas across to their fellow workers .
It also makes sense to do so on an organised basis with a recognised collective identify .
It also make sense to do so outside the national federations given their current positions and state .
In other words , the AWN ( or something like it ) could and should be created .
And this was agreed by people who attended our meeting at the 2003 bookfair and subsequent follow up meeting at Freedom bookshop .
But in spite of the positive response we had , the AWN failed .
Why ?
I think part of the reason is that too few people were willing to put their time and energy where their mouth was .
It seemed to be the case that people were happy to be an audience rather than take an active role in doing something .
Perhaps the informal nature of the AWN could be blamed for this .
It was designed to be a tool , something people could use to get their ideas across .
It was not meant to be a formal organisation like the AF or SolFed .
Perhaps this very informality meant that people did not have the organisational framework which allowed the participation the AWN needed to survive .
However , to make it a formal organisation would have meant becoming a " rival " to the existing federations and necessitated more political agreement on policies and positions .
Perhaps such a discussion on industrial strategy is needed .
It appears that a key problem with anarchism in the UK is its position on the unions .
Too heavily influenced by Council Communism , the UK movement has failed to take a realistic approach to the current state of the labour movement .
Indeed , this influence can be so bad that a few comrades seriously argue that the trade unions are as much an agent of capital as management or the state .
If this really were the case we would have a near 100 % unionisation rate and bosses would be encouraging , not fighting , unions across the world .
If this were the case , there would be more strikes in workplaces without unions than ones with .
That this is not the case suggests that this position is deeply flawed .
The key issue is , I think , lack of perspective .
Simply put , I get the impression some people think we are living in the 1970s or early 1980s .
While talk of workplace assemblies , strike committees and workers councils is all fine and well , the reality of the situation is that such developments , essential as they are to winning the class war and creating anarchism , are unlikely to happen any time soon .
As such , we need to adjust our politics to this reality and help create a movement towards such developments .
That , I would suggest , means revising certain currently held positions on trade unions .
Do not get me wrong .
The trade unions are bureaucratic , reformist , sectionalist and the leadership will sell you out given half the chance .
Yes , the objective pressures of what unions do produce these tendencies and , consequently , even self - managed unionism is subject to reformist and bureaucratic tendencies .
Yet these are not good reasons to ignore them , particularly as there is no real alternative at the present time .
The sad thing is that outside of the unions there is not much collective action .
This suggests that the alternative to being " good trade unionists " is not strike committees , workers ' councils and revolution but , rather , nothing beyond abstract revolutionary propaganda directed to workers who fail to see its relevance to their real lives .
If we were living during the 1970s , I could see the point of many current libertarian positions -- but we are not .
If there was massive levels of strike action and the union bureaucracies were hindering it then the anti-union position would make sense -- but there is n't that level of struggle .
Indeed , some anarchists use this low level of workplace activity to justify a community organising approach .
Instead of a two - pronged approach based on workplace and community , we end up dismissing the former due to the obvious difficulties in workplace agitation .
This seems less than convincing , particularly as the workplace experience has hardly got better over the last 30 years !
Perhaps it will be argued that I am attacking a straw man position here .
However , I feel that this is not the case .
When I read , for example , the Anarchist Federation 's ( AF ) position on trade unions I do not feel that it allows me much flexibility in terms of being active in my local union .
It says in no uncertain terms that trade unions are a hindrance to class struggle and I could not in all honesty remain in active in my union and feel I was being true to the spirit of the AF .
I know that many AF members are members of the IWW , a contradiction in my eyes .
The AF members I have spoken to justify their position by saying the IWW is not a real union but rather a network of militants .
Which is true , for the time being .
The aim of the IWW is to become a real union .
If the IWW became successful then it would do and where would that leave the AF members ?
They would have helped build an organisation they claim will eventually betray the working class .
Perhaps I am missing something in terms of the AF 's position .
If so , perhaps someone would enlighten me but I feel that a many of the AF 's members are active in ways that contradict their organisations stated position .
A position which if contradictory in regard to the IWW becomes a straight jacket when applied to ordinary trade unions .
My own experience suggests that the trade unions can be a means by which workers do take action and , as a consequence , anarchists should be active in them at the base .
And what of the alternatives to working in the rank and file of the unions ?
These boil down , in the medium term , to either dual unionism or workers ' councils .
Both , I feel , misunderstand the historical contexts of both approaches .
Dual unionism ( i.e. building revolutionary unions in opposition to social democratic ones ) has been successful .
The CNT , IWW and USI were all " dual unions . "
However , the idea that we can just create them from scratch is false .
The history of the formation of dual unions is not along these lines .
Every successful revolutionary union came out of , or was built from , existing unions .
Take the IWW .
Its founding conference in 1905 brought together existing militant unions and built upon a revolutionary union tradition which dated back to the anarchist IWPA of the 1880s .
The CNT was formed by the existing unions within Catalonia and , again , built upon a history of anarchist union organising dating back to the 1860s .
From this base it quickly became the majority union in the 1920s and 1930s .
The USI came out of the syndicalist " direct action committees " which had been created within the social democratic unions in the decade before it was founded in 1912 .
Its 100,000 members did not just appear and , consequently , it was in a position to play a leading role in factory occupations of 1920 .
In the UK , the syndicalist building workers union formed in 1914 came out of years of agitation within the existing trade unions .
As for the workers ' council idea , this is equally flawed .
Looking at Council Communism , the workers unions they founded were forged in the revolutionary situation itself when existing union members left the social democratic trade unions .
If we wait for such a development to happen then , firstly , it probably wo n't come and , secondly , if it did it would be as unsuccessful as in German or Russian Revolutions .
Without an anarchist presence in the workplace , any spontaneous organisation is in danger of being co-opted by the trade union bureaucracy or left - wing parties .
All of which is not to say that strike committees , etc. , are not essential or that the trade union bureaucracy will not attempt to stop militant action .
Nor is it to suggest that we take part in union bureaucracies or fail to attack the ( many ) problems of the current trade unions .
Far from it .
I am not suggesting that we can " capture " the existing unions merely that we have an interest in working within the rank and file to promote libertarian ideas of struggle and organisation .
Nor am I suggesting that we reduce our tactics just to that .
As my article indicates , we need to apply tactics which are sensible and refuse to squeeze our activity into pre-set positions .
All I am suggesting is that it is somewhat optimistic to think that a handful of militants can recreate the labour movement , particularly when their politics effectively cuts them off from rank and file trade unionists who would appreciate the principles they are expounding .
But these are medium term options , options which , while not existing , successfully divide libertarians into different organisations .
In the short term and long term , we are more in agreement .
Obviously , long term we aim for a libertarian socialist society based on self - management .
In the short term , we support all attempts at workers ' autonomy and self - management in the class struggle .
Perhaps if we looked at these common principles and the current circumstances we could start to apply the more flexible approach suggested in my article ?
That such a development may need a long hard look at how we organise as anarchists goes without saying , particularly given the fate of the AWN .
So what could we be doing ?
Obviously raising the idea of workers ' control / self - management of unions , struggles and industry .
We should be presenting the idea of co-operatives as an alternative to both nationalisation and privatisation .
We should be encouraging of attempts by union members to organise by workplace and industry , overcoming trade union divisions and wrestle control from the bureaucracy .
We should organise unions where possible , either existing ones or the IWW ( where applicable ) .
We should be co-operating as anarchists in a network to raise a libertarian voice in both the unions base and in the workplace as general .
We should be critical of trade unionism while , at the same time , being aware of the current industrial environment and offering realistic alternatives rather than the abstract revolutionary propaganda that so often today passes as an industrial strategy .
If we do not we will be stuck with an anarchism which spends its time expounding which form of ( non-existent ) industrial grouping is better , an " industrial network " versus a " workplace resistance group . "
One which splits hairs over whether a ( non-existent ) revolutionary union movement would be reformist or not .
One which discusses the best thing to do during a ( non-existent ) revolution .
One which , ultimately , fails to practice the positive ideas of anarchism in the workplace and labour movement and , consequently , fails to help bring about situations where its correct analysis of the role of trade unionism and its positive alternatives ( such as workplace assemblies and strike committees ) become relevant .
Which would be a crying shame .

Ever wondered why traffic lights turn red when they do ?
How Amazon works out its recommendations ?
Or how Google prioritises its search lists ?
It 's all done by algorithms - jealously guarded mathematical recipes that increasingly dictate how we lead our lives .
Bobbie Johnson reports
When you last used your supermarket loyalty card , or pulled up just as the traffic lights turned red , you probably were n't thinking much about maths .
Why would you ?
Most of us see mathematics as baffling school algebra that has no application in real life .
But you probably meet hundreds of bits of complex maths every day without realising it : the discounts on your loyalty card are the result of deep data analysis , and those traffic signals run on an algorithm that determines when the lights will switch to green .
In fact , large bits of modern lives are secretly underpinned by complex algorithms - the mathematical equivalent of cookery recipes , which take a piece of information and turn it into an action or decision .
Algorithms are like computer programs or flowcharts - a sequence of steps that examines what is happening and comes to a conclusion .
Take traffic lights : the computer controlling them asks a series of related questions .
What time of day is it ?
When did the lights last go red ?
Has a pedestrian pushed the button at the crossing ?
The algorithm guides the computer , step by step , to change the lights .
Algorithms are pervasive , even controlling , in our lives .
Book a low - cost flight and an algorithm will determine how much the tickets will cost , depending on supply and demand ; arrive at the airport and air - traffic algorithms will determine which place in the queue your plane gets .
Watch the weather forecast on TV and the predictions will have been fine - tuned by an algorithm ; listen to the radio and the playlist may have been generated by one .
Supermarkets , in particular , are a hotbed of algorithms .
Almost every aspect of their operation - from deciding the order that products are stacked on the shelves to picking which special offers to run - is determined by a computer .
And since computers are increasingly dominant in our lives , algorithms are increasingly important - and nowhere is this more apparent than on the internet .
In the online world , mathematical analysis is n't just important : the algorithm is king .
Everywhere you turn online , companies are using algorithms in their quest for success .
From Google 's search results and Apple 's music recommendations to Amazon telling you that " customers who bought this item also bought ... " algorithms are at work .
" There is no way , with the size of the internet , that one can do exhaustive searches , " says Marcus du Sautoy , professor for the public understanding of science at Oxford , and one of Britain 's leading mathematicians .
" So you have to rely on mathematics to give you clever and fast ways to get information . "
Online supermarket Ocado , for instance , analyses every detail of every activity - from the choices shoppers make to warehouse movements - to make sure there is enough stock in the right places , and to help the company plan future strategies .
" We 're using complicated forecasting algorithms to predict demand , " says Jon Rudoe , head of retail .
" The customer sees nothing .
It all looks very simple , but it 's actually governed by complex mathematics in the background " - mathematics we can put to use because we now have technology that did n't exist a decade ago .
Since these recipes have helped internet companies cook up billions in profits , the precise details of the mathematical mechanisms are jealously guarded as among the companies ' most valuable assets .
Forget the recipe for Coke or the Colonel 's blend of herbs and spices , these are the trade secrets of the 21st century .
And wherever there are secrets , there are people desperate to unlock them .
Around the world , countless hours and millions - perhaps billions - of pounds are spent trying to unravel the inner workings of the web 's most powerful algorithms .
Among those rooting for answers is Russell Davies , an advertising consultant from London .
His fascination started when he decided to try to understand how to lift his book - a guide to Britain 's greasy - spoon cafes called Eggs , Bacon , Chips and Beans - up Amazon 's rankings .
On the surface , the Amazon charts seem straightforward .
They are largely based on sales , but there is also analysis of buying activity so that a sudden rush of orders can push a book , CD or DVD up the chart .
The rewards for chart - topping are enormous : it can drive thousands more sales .
But there are other benefits too , including ( crucially ) a shot at appearing in the algorithmically generated " customers who bought this also bought ... " section , which is hugely popular .
Davies thought he could try a variety of tricks to shift his book up the bestseller list and - if he succeeded - work out the secret ingredients behind Amazon 's recipe .
" I started to think about what makes the number change and realised that it's a big secret , which made it more interesting , " he says .
Over the course of several months it became a minor obsession ; after all , for writers and publishers , even a small insight into Amazon 's algorithm could be like discovering the Rosetta Stone : " The Amazon ranking is the only feedback the average author gets on how their book is doing , and you 're desperate for feedback . "
Davies wrote about the book in newspapers and online ; he asked friends to buy copies and even bought a few himself , all the time closely monitoring whether his actions were reflected by his place in the rankings .
But although he had a few moments when he seemed close to a breakthrough , he has n't cracked the code .
" I learned that you can't really influence it , " he concludes .
" Thinking about it , it 's not that surprising - you 're in such a massive pool of data that a few sales here or there are just invisible . "
Amazon is not alone in working hard to keep its methods confidential .
EBay 's reputation system is largely based on user feedback , but the company constantly works on adaptations aimed at stopping scammers from getting status they do n't deserve .
Apple , similarly , has mathematical secrets that are increasingly important to its business , among them a recent addition to the iPod , the new " Genius " function that creates playlists of similar songs .
On the surface , Genius looks like hi-tech wizardry .
It takes a song you own and works out similar music that you might like to hear : stick in a shiny happy song and you 'll get 25 tracks of sunshine back ; give it a mournful dirge and you 'll end up with a mixtape to die to .
Underneath all the whizziness , though , the Genius function is really about number crunching .
Apple analyses the song choices of millions of other iTunes users around the world and , based on this , is able to take a stab at which songs match your seed track .
And it 's profitable , too : Genius can encourage users to hear and buy songs from iTunes that they knew nothing about .
Another aspect of Apple 's business it keeps quiet about is the way its iTunes charts are put together .
While the charts appear largely based on sales and the number of times people listen , iTunes is also believed to use a so - called " decay algorithm " to give more weight to very recent activity .
The company refuses to confirm how the system works , although little pieces of information have slipped out in the past .
Its podcast chart , apparently , is " driven purely by an algorithm that looks at new subscriptions during the past week " , for example .
Nobbling the mathematics behind iTunes is almost impossible , but some people have learned how to subvert it the old - fashioned way .
Little - known group
Hit Masters rode high in the charts earlier this year with a karaoke cover of the recent Kid Rock hit All Summer Long .
They managed a modern twist on the age - old tactic of riding somebody else 's success , when they noticed that the original version was not available to buy on the US iTunes store .
Their speedily produced cover appeared high in the search for the Kid Rock song , making them more likely to get downloaded ; more downloads meant a higher placing in the chart , which itself generated more sales .
It 's a self - fulfilling cycle that eventually pushed Hit Masters to a chart high of 19 in the US Billboard Hot 100 .
But the efforts of Amazon , eBay and Apple pale in comparison to the most famous algorithm on the web : Google 's algorithm is the mathematical engine that drives the web 's most powerful company .
" It 's not that Google is smarter at the maths , it just had a better recipe , " says Danny Sullivan , editor of the SearchEngineLand.com website .
" It had ingredients that other people did n't . "
Given Google 's dominance of web search , getting a high ranking there is a guarantee of more clicks - and more clicks means more money .
With so much at stake , decoding Google 's algorithm has become an industry in itself .
Experts in search engine optimisation ( SEO ) know the basics of Google 's operations - they are well documented - but the California company now spends vast amounts of time and energy trying to keep its formula secret .
" Large sites such as Amazon and Google are tweaking the internals of their systems almost constantly , " says Jon Kleinberg , a professor of computer science at Cornell University in New York state .
" The front end of Google looks the same to us , but behind the scenes they can be busily swapping out ideas . "
Kleinberg believes the internet is making so much data available about how we relate to each other that we could soon be able to create algorithms for the social interactions we always thought were too complicated for maths , such as controversy , disagreement or fame .
" They 've always been fleeting , ephemeral , invisible and essentially unknowable , " he says .
" Now we can try to get in there and understand why , at a microscopic level . "
All of which will have potential applications , both corporate and individual .
Your PC could use algorithms to recognise exactly what document you are looking for , or to predict which news stories you might be interested in when you log on .
Your mobile phone could recognise you are in a bad mood and screen your calls automatically , allowing only people that it has determined are your closest friends to get through .
Learning to sift through the vast amount of information being sent across the internet every second to divine people 's feelings or intentions could , Kleinberg believes , be the next great technological leap .
Mathematicians rule !
A 26 - year - old man in the Pilbara town of Karratha has died after being shot in the chest with a crossbow .
A man aged 27 has been charged with murder .
Police say the accused was in the bedroom of his house on Matebore Street when he heard his brother arguing with two men in the driveway .
It is alleged he armed himself with a cross bow and shot the victim in the chest at close range .
He is due to face the Karratha Magistrates Court his morning .
Tonight is the Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All - Star Weekend .
No wait , I have to be official here and call it the 2010 Sprite Slam Dunk competition ( where ’s my money Sprite ? ) .
This year ’s competitors are Nate Robinson , Gerald Wallace , Shannon Brown and Dunk - in winner ( Eric Gordon or DeMar DeRozan ) .
Now , the dunk competition has had its ups and downs .
Over the past decade it has been criticized for lackluster dunks , although Dwight Howard and Nate Robinson have brought a certain amount of excitement in the past two years .
In case this year ’s contest ends up a bit lackluster , here are ten great dunks that wo n’t be a letdown :
10 . The Flying Squirrel
Slamball athlete Chris Robbins proves you can dunk from your back .
9 . The Mascot Flip
The Raptors mascot shows he can dunk while flipping and with a giant foam dinosaur head .
8. The World Record
Not to be outdone in terms of trampoline dunks , a world record for distance is set .
7. The Backboard Pass Windmill
There are plenty of backboard pass dunks , even a few self - passes off the backboard .
But how many threw in a windmill off the bounce ?
6. Dunk Fail
Not sure if the dunk actually went in , but make or not when you hurt yourself in the process it ’s a fail .
This one gets bonus points for the hilarity of it all .
It ’s funny because it ’s not me !
5. Shattered Glass
From Darryl Hawkins to Darvin Ham , the shattered glass dunk is always a great one .
This one gets extra credit for the alley - oop and the reverse jam .
4. The 720
Even as the defense backs off , this one is still impressive .
3. The Self Pass
You do n’t even need the backboard to do a real self - pass .
2. The Dunk of Death
I think Vince Carter ended Frédéric Weis ’ potential NBA career on this dunk in Sydney .
The French dubbed it “ le dunk de la mort ” .
1. Jordan posterizes Ewing
The greatest basketball player of all time doing his best dunk , right in the face of Patrick Ewing .
Gregory Wells from www.polarisinsight.com, which treats depression , PTSD and trauma with Ketamine Therapy joins me in a discussion about trauma , ketamine , the therapeutic process , and more
Here 's the next installment of the audiobook of my memoir , Being Infinite .
It , along with several other of my audiobooks , is available at Audible and the iBookstore .
Next couple of weeks we 'll be back with interviews . . .
Chapter 2 of my memoir wraps up with this installment of Being Infinite .
Next up . . . can you guess ?
That 's right - chapter 3
My guest this week is the organizer for the upcoming Psilocybin Summit ( Sept 17 - 20 ) , Daniel Shankin .
We talk all about the event , its inspiration , the line up , psychedelic culture , and more .

Author Tom Lane shares unique insights into authentic indigenous uses of the Sacred Mushroom in Mexican cultures and the archetypal energetic process of becoming Quetzalcoatl .
His book , Sacred Mushroom Rituals , is a profound look into how these mushrooms potentiate profound healing and transformation .
Here 's the second part of Chapter 2 of my memoir , Being Infinite .
It 's a pleasure to have Thomas Roberts back on the podcast to discuss his recent book , MindApps , which dismantles the " single state fallacy " of consciousness and explores how a multi-state approach to mindbody experiences can reshape academics , philosophy , therapy , and more .
In this section of my memoir , I head off to college and experience psilocybin mushrooms for the very first time , getting me started on my psychedelic journey
For this very important episode , I 'm joined by long - time friends of the podcast , Tom and Sheri Eckert , authors of the 2020 Oregon Psilocybin Services Initiative , which recently qualified for the November ballot .
Oregon now has the possibility to be the first state in the US to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin " magic mushrooms . "
This episode gives you all the details of what the initiative does and does n't do , correcting some gross misunderstandings currently circulating in the Oregon psychedelic community .

Close - up photography allows us to capture a unique view of our world , especially when that world is printed larger than life .
Capturing small subjects requires careful attention to the technical aspects of photography : focus , lighting , sharpness , depth of field , exposure , and composition .
All of these factors came into play with the image of the red - eye tree frog ( above left ) , photographed with a Canon EF 50 mm f/2.5 Compact Macro lens and ring light .
( The black background in this picture was created by holding a black T - shirt about two - feet behind the subject — far enough so that it was n’t illuminated by the ring light ) .
For newcomers to the fascinating , fun , and rewarding aspects of close - up photography , this article introduces a few of the basic techniques .
The macro lens
For true macro photography , you need a macro lens , as opposed to the macro / close - up setting on a zoom lens .
Macro lenses let you get much closer to a subject than zoom lenses .
This picture of a newly hatched butterfly was taken with a Canon MP - E 65 mm f/2.8
Macro lens , which offers tremendous magnification — much like a bellows system for SLR cameras .
It ’s a specially designed , manual focus macro lens that actually lets you fill the frame with subjects as small as a grain of rice .
The remaining photographs in this article were taken with more commonly used macro lenses : 50 mm and 100 mm .
The main difference between these two lenses is that that 100 mm lens provides a greater camera - to - subject distance so you do n’t frighten skittish subjects , such as butterflies .
Getting close
Okay , let ’s move on to some macro shooting tips and techniques .
Steady your shots : Macro lenses exaggerate camera shake , as do telephoto lenses .
To reduce the chance of a blurry picture caused by camera shake , which is most noticeable in natural light pictures , you need to use a tripod .
I used a tripod with a ball head ( for easy positioning ) when I took this natural light photograph of an Atlas moth with the 100 mm f/2.8 Macro lens .
Compose carefully :
The background can make or break a close - up picture .
Try to compose a picture so the background complements the main subject and does not detract from it .
Add a background :
If the background is too distracting , you can change it .
Photograph a leaf , make an inkjet print , and use the print as a background .
For more creative control , try blurring the leaf in the digital darkroom ( using the Gaussian Blur filter in Photoshop ) to simulate the effect of using different f-stops .
Add light :
When adding light , a ring light is a good choice .
A ring light attaches to the end of a lens and can provide ratio and even ( “ shadowless ” ) lighting .
The light from a ring light also adds contrast to a picture , making it look sharper than a natural light photograph .
A Canon Macro Ring Lite MR - 14EX attached to the front of the 50 mm macro lens was used for this picture of a cabbage white butterfly .
Focus carefully :
In close - up photography , as with telephoto photography , focus is extremely critical .
You need to focus on the most important element in a scene , such as the eye of an insect or small animal .
It ’s also important to shoot at a small aperture ( f/11 or f / 22 ) for good depth of field ( unless you want the area in front of and behind your subject out of focus ) .
I set the 50 mm macro lens at f /22 for this photograph .
Set the white balance and image quality setting :
When using a ring light as the main light source , set the white balance to Flash .
When the light is mixed ( daylight and flash ) , set the white balance to Auto .
For the very best quality image , set the image quality to RAW .
The RAW setting gives you a little more exposure latitude ( is more forgiving ) than the Fine or High JPEG setting .
What ’s more , with a RAW file you ’ll have less chance of getting banding in solid colors and dark areas , such as the black background in the opening image for this article .
Experiment :
It ’s important to be aware of how different angles and different shooting distances can greatly affect a picture .
In close - up photography , moving just a few inches , or a faction of an inch for that matter , can provide a completely different view of the same subject , as illustrated by these two pictures of an orchid , which I took with the 50 mm macro lens .
Also play around with different color modes , including black and white .
Okay , now it ’s your turn to have fun exploring your own close - up world !
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Florida wildlife managers have launched an experiment to see if they can keep crocodiles from returning to residential neighborhoods by temporarily taping magnets to their heads to disrupt their “ homing ” ability .

Researchers at Mexico ’s Crocodile Museum in Chiapas reported in a biology newsletter they had some success with the method , using it to permanently relocate 20 of the reptiles since 2004 .
“ We said , ‘ Hey , we might as well give this a try , ” Lindsey Hord , the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ’s crocodile response coordinator , said on Tuesday .
Crocodiles are notoriously territorial and when biologists move them from urban areas to new homes in the wild , they often go right back to the place where they were captured , traveling up to 10 miles a week to get there .
Scientists believe they rely in part on the Earth ’s magnetic fields to navigate , and that taping magnets to both sides of their heads disorients them .
“ They ’re just taped on temporarily , ” Hord said .
“ We just put the magnets on when they ’re captured and since they do n’t know where we take them , they ’re lost .
The hope would be that they stay where we take them to . ”
Hord and his co-workers have tried it on two crocodiles since launching the experiment in January , affixing “ a common old laboratory magnet ” to both sides of the animals ’ heads .
One got run over by a car and died , but the other has yet to return , Hord said .
Once an endangered species , American crocodiles ’ numbers have rebounded to nearly 2,000 in coastal south Florida , their only habitat in the continental United States .
That puts them in increasing contact with humans , especially in areas where backyards border on canals around Miami and the Florida Keys .
Crocodiles are still classified as a threatened species , so game managers are reluctant to move them to new areas where they might be killed battling other resident crocodiles for turf rights , Hord said .
Unlike alligators , which are far more numerous , each crocodile is considered important to preserving the species , he said .
“ These crocodiles are unique and valuable creatures and we feel like we have a responsibility to live with these animals as much as we can , ” he said .
Many frightened residents do n’t share that view , although crocodiles are shy creatures , Hord said .
Wildlife managers will try to relocate any thought to pose a significant risk , mainly those that seem to have lost their fear of humans .
Most crocodiles in Florida are tagged as hatchlings so biologists can easily recognize them , Hord said .
Any that come back twice after being captured and moved are sent to zoos or otherwise placed in captivity , something biologists hope to avoid if the magnet experiment works .
“ This one is by no means a really well - developed scientific study with a control group .
It ’s just something we thought we would try , ” Hord said .
“ We do have to make some room to live with them . ”
The Obama administration is off to a good start on civil liberties when it comes to Guantanamo , reviving some hopes of due process and the possibility that arrest by federal agents will less frequently result in people dangling by their thumbs .
President Obama is also making the right noises on medical marijuana .
But gun owners are more than a bit concerned that their rights will be ridden over roughshod during the next few years .
While there 's no sure way of heading off government action , it is possible to evade and sabotage the enforcement of restrictive laws .
Specifically , gun owners should continue to acquire and distribute the know - how for making their own guns .
Gun owners ' concerns may well be justified ; President Barack Obama has a history of hostility to private ownership of firearms and Attorney General Eric Holder went so far as to sign on to former Attorney General Janet Reno 's amicus brief ( PDF ) in the case of D.C. v. Heller , opposing the position that the Supreme Court finally adopted : that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects an individual right to keep and bear arms .
There are already a couple of long - shot gun control measures circulating in Congress , including H.R. 45 , a licensing and registration measure .
But laws are only as good as their enforceability -- a lesson that politicians need to take to heart in a country where 42.4 % of the population has smoked illicitly cultivated grass decades after marijuana was outlawed , and where Prohibition was a moonshine - soaked failure .
If self - defense - rights activists want to preserve their liberty , they need to continue battling in legislatures and the courts , but they should also take steps to make sure that gun laws are unenforceable -- that bans on firearms are countered by the equivalent of homebrew , moonshine and speakeasies .
This is n't exactly reinventing the wheel .
Underground weapons manufacturing is a major business in places as far apart as the Philippines and Pakistan .
VBS.tv offers a fascinating video tour of firearms and ammunition manufacturing and sales under remarkably crude conditions in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
In the market there , gunsmiths turn out everything from muzzleloaders to hand - crafted Lewis guns and AK - 47s in facilities less well - equipped than the average American home workshop .
So , where do you start ?
Well , you need plans , of course .
You could copy an existing firearm , like those Pakistani craftsmen do , or like the World War II - era Polish resistance and pre-independence Israelis did when they churned out vast quantities of Sten guns .
Or you could acquire plans purposely created for home manufacturing .
Yes , they exist .
And one of the better known sources for such plans is Philip A. Luty .
Probably the best endorsement for Luty 's designs is that at least one of them works .
We know it works because he went to prison in Britain for building a working copy from the design he published in the book , Expedient Homemade Firearms : The 9 mm Submachine Gun .
The book was written as a rejoinder to the British government 's restrictive laws regarding firearms , and the powers - that - be did n't appreciate the rebuttal .
The time behind bars seems to have just ticked him off , since Luty , now free , is the proprietor of The Home Gunsmith Website , which offers several free plans for simple , improvised firearms .
The site also offers plans for more complicated weapons for sale .
And should the authorities get clever and decide to restrict ammunition ... well , Luty now offers a book for sale on how to improvise that , too .
It should be noted that , given Luty 's ex-con status and the relatively close scrutiny under which he certainly operates these days , his more - recent designs have probably not been test - fired as diligently as the original .
So , caveat emptor .
The point here is n't that setting up underground firearms bazaars is an adequate substitute for living with a government that knows its limits and respects our rights .
It 's that the means exist for rendering restrictive laws impotent and pointless .
Short of turning your basement into a reproduction of the Ayalon Institute , the best use for simple gun plans may be to mail them to members of Congress as evidence that Americans are prepared to short - circuit their most draconian efforts .
Imagine how much grief and blood could have been spared if pre-Prohibition legislators had been buried under such a weight of homebrew recipes that they 'd conceded the point that a ban on alcoholic beverages was destined to fail .
Well , OK .
Such an effort is unlikely to elicit rational thought in the minds of government officials .
But it 's a low - cost approach that just might have some effect .
And the effort would help in developing and distributing effective plans that would ensure the ultimate failure of legal restrictions on the means for self defense .
Besides , it 's just pretty nifty to have plans for building your own submachine gun .

Fry sausage and chorizo together .
Add onion and bell pepper and fry to wilt .
Drain , but save , rendered fat .
Beat eggs and milk together .
Stir jalepenos and cilantro into egg / milk mixture .
Using a basting brush , paint both sides of 3 to 4 flour tortillas with rendered fat and cover the bottom and sides of the pie pan , tearing the tortillas and overlaping as necessary to fill the gaps .
Repeat , with another layer of tortillas painted with rendered fat as before .
Spread sausage mixture over tortillas .
Spread the cheddar and jack cheeses over sausage .
Pour the egg mixture over the cheese .
Bake in 375 degree oven until pie is set .
Serve with salsa fresca and sliced canned jalepenos .
Makes one 10 inch pie .
Note : I think the original recipe called for 15 jalepenos , but when no one else would eat it I cut the recipe back to 10 chiles so others could add more heat if they desired to accommdate their own taste and tolerance for chile heat .
Note :
Ive been feeling a little guilty about collecting all the great chile info and recipes from the Chile - Heads list without offering anything back .
I posted the following recipe to FOODWINE just before Super Bowl 29 in reply to some anti-San Diego diatribes in the national news media ( such as describing San Diego Charger fans as a bunch of undeserving , QUICHE eating , sun worshipping , wimpy surf bums ) .
I thought " Chile - Heads " who dont subscribe to FOODWINE ( I no longer do ) might enjoy it .
I found the recipe in a newspaper ( the Orange County Register ) about 15 to 20 years ago .
Ive altered it a bit over the years , but its still pretty close to the original ... so , with apologies to the original author ...

Smartlet Stations Charge Plug - In Vehicles from Sidewalk
February 18th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
It seems like new plug - in hybrid vehicles ( PHEV ) are being announced every day .
If Coulomb Technologies has its way , you ’ll be powering your next PHEV with the help of “ Smartlet Charging Stations ” — curbside plug - in charging machines that activate with “ ChargePoint Smart Cards ” .
The company is in direct competition with Better Place , which also has plans to install PHEV charging stations in public areas .
But while Better Place is focusing on stations that offer both charging and battery - swapping , Coulomb is speeding up its roll - out by only focusing on charging .
While fewer than 300 PHEVs are on the road today in the US , Coulomb wants to install 40 Smartlet Stations along California highways and at fueling stations by the end of this business quarter .
Demonstration charging stations are already in place in downtown San Jose , California .
The company is also working on software to manage electricity flow between PHEVs and power grids .

A week or so ago I wrote a blog post summing up the arguments surrounding the possible creation of an arts czar / culture minister .
I came out in favor of senior staff - level liaison for the various arts , humanities and culture entities in and around the government .
The arts and humanities get a pretty raw deal .
I ’m thinking of the West Wing episode where Toby has to fight to keep the entire budget for the National Endowment for the Arts , and his prime opponent is a congresswoman rattling off various ridiculous - sounding art projects — nakedness , animals , you know : all the random shit weird artists do that has no impact on society as a whole .
It was painful to watch the purported centrists in the Senate cut out nearly $ 100 million worth of funds for arts , culture and education — “ purported ” because the list of axed items looks like a Republican ’s top 20 list of awful “ nanny state - cum - socialist ” policies .
But I digress .
At Culture Monster , The Los Angeles Times ’ arts and culture blog that ’s leaving all other outlets in its dust in terms of national arts policy coverage , Christopher Knight laid a compelling thought experiment that does n’t have “ a snowball 's chance in Hades ” : pump $ 62 billion into the non-profit sector .
Why ?
It employs some six million people across all 50 states and , because they ’re constantly looking for cash , countless non-profits have “ shovel - ready ” projects .
Knight ’s best argument ( and where the above figure of $ 62 billion comes from ) is his comparison of the non-profit sector to the industrial - military - lobbying complex that , among other things , is pushing for continued funding of a much - criticized fighter jet , the F - 22 :
President Obama must decide by March 1 on its continuation .
Lawrence Korb , assistant Defense secretary in the Reagan administration and a widely respected national security analyst , has described the F - 22 as “ the most unnecessary weapons system being built by the Pentagon . ”
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , a holdover from the Bush administration , has been critical of its usefulness and cost .
Yet that has n't stopped 46 senators , led by Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga. ) and Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) , senior legislators in the states that primarily build the thing , from signing a letter to the president urging F - 22 continuation in the 2010 budget .
So have more than 150 representatives in the House .
According to Congressional Quarterly , the old pitch that the airplane is a security demand has been gilded with a new one :
An ad campaign ( above ) says the F - 22 is now essential to stave off unemployment in a collapsing economy .
Knight points out this is exactly what FDR warned about , and that the amount of jobs the military lobby is crying for is “ dwarfed ” by the amount of jobs in the non-profit sector .
But America is not in the business of accommodating the arc of cultural renewal and invigoration .
Why ?
Because ever since a bunch of farmers , merchants and other small - businesspeople fought the American Revolution against the East India Company and its nominal CEO , King George III , corporations have been the nation 's primary obstacle to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
They still are .
Culture is all about pursuing happiness , so even in a crisis it barely stands a chance .
If you doubt it , ask the Wall Street bankers who have gotten hundreds of billions in bailouts and bonuses — and stand to get more .
Then ask your senator or representative , who can't get elected without them .
The culture wars of decades past still have a corrosive effect not only on political and moral discourse but also on the state of American culture .
Today ’s congressional leaders lived through Vietnam and the Cold War , while the electorate , year by year , moves away from those defining milestones .
That a largely derided fighter jet is pretty much guaranteed continued funding while the very front yard of the U.S. government falls into disrepair is an example of how we still have a long way to go in terms striking a balance of priorities .
Sam Tanenhaus recently penned a piece for The New Republic titled ( over- provocatively ) “ Conservatism is Dead . ”
One of several money quotes :
[ The Conservative Mind author Russel ] Kirk , for example , denounced federally sponsored school lunch programs as a " vehicle for totalitarianism " and Social Security as a form of " remorseless collectivism . "
Where in this , Schlesinger asked , was even a hint of classic conservatism , with its concern for the social and moral costs of unchecked industrial capitalism ?:
“ Disraeli with his legislation on behalf of trade unions , his demand for government intervention to improve working conditions , his belief in due process and civil freedom , his support for the extension of suffrage , his insistence on the principle of compulsory education !
If there is anything in contemporary America that might win the instant sympathy of men like Shaftesbury and Disraeli , it could well be the school lunch program .
But for all his talk of mutual responsibility and the organic character of society , Professor Kirk , when he gets down to cases , tends to become a roaring Manchester liberal of the Herbert Hoover school . ”
For years to come , this paradox would roil the right , which remained split between the Burkean politics of realistic adjustment and the revanchist politics of counterrevolution .
The right has developed a visceral knee - jerk reaction to anything involving culture , and their “ loyal opposition ” stranglehold does n’t seem to be loosening anytime soon .
Bombs make jobs , but renovations and building projects and part - time jobs or anything else within a stones throw of a — gasp — opera house do not .
This is government as violent adolescent child .
Knight also stumbled across a neat factoid : Republican Senator Sam Coburn of Oklahoma is the “ Dr. No ” of any arts - related funding — and his daughter is an opera singer .
This is almost as ironic as a vice president of a virulently anti-gay administration having a gay daughter .
At the rededication of Ford ’s Theatre in Washington , D.C. , President Obama opened his remarks with :
Michelle and I are so pleased to be here to renew and rededicate this hallowed space .
We know that Ford 's Theatre will remain a place where Lincoln 's legacy thrives , where his love of the humanities and belief in the power of education have a home , and where his generosity of spirit are reflected in all the work that takes place .
Right now , love of the humanities and belief in the power of education are in the doghouse , though at least not in the alley .
Obama has a lot on his agenda , so much so that he had to let a strike go over the plate in the form of state secrets privileges and the like .
I ’m not ultimately that upset about losing billions for the arts and humanities and education ( and science and culture ) from the stimulus package .
Straight up , there are more important things in the immediate sense .
Nor do I believe the arts and humanities will wither on the vine without a taxpayer - backed bailout .
But the sector ’s potential for growth — growth in jobs , cultural output , international respect — is undeniable .
Down the line , I hope for a tipping point — an extended period of cease - fires , a few balanced budgets in a row , etc. — that will allow for the open backing and funding of American culture .
Until then , even those with a passing interest are forced to watch men ( and a few women ) from a generation ago grapple with boogy - and strawmen that have little to no relation to the country we live in now .
Politistii au partea lor de dreptate .
Drumurile Romaniei sunt pline de soferi inconstienti , care ii pun si pe ceilalti in pericol .
Pe langa cele doua probe pe care doritorii de permis trebuie sa le sustina , cel teoretic , in sala , si traseul , politistii cred ca ar mai trebui inca doua probe .
Prima ar fi proba intr-un poligon in care sa se poata testa inclusiv iscusinta viitorului sofer in situatiile unui carosabil ud sau alunecos .
O a doua proba ar fi conducerea pe timp de noapte .
Deocamdata totul este in stadiu de proiect , care urmeaza sa fie transmis Guvernului .
Politistii vor examene mai dure pentru ca au constatat ca numarul infractiunilor comise in trafic dar si al accidentelor comise de incepatori este tot mai mare .

GAZA  A dentist stood at the bed of a doctor , his good friend Ehab Madhoun , 32 , who had just died , his shrapnel - pitted body wrapped in a white shroud .
The day before , Dr. Madhoun , a general practitioner , was in an ambulance responding to an Israeli strike at the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza .
Another missile hit the ambulance .
The driver , Muhammad Abu Hasira , died instantly .
Dr. Madhoun lingered for a day , dying of his wounds on Wednesday in the intensive care unit of Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of people have been brought since Israel began its heaviest assault on Gaza in three decades .
The dentist cried .
“ He was just doing his work , ” said the dentist , who would not give his name .
“ He ’s a doctor , and I ca n’t understand why Israel would hit an ambulance .
They can tell from the cameras it ’s an ambulance . ”
It has always been this way , over years of conflict here , that civilians are killed in the densely populated Gaza Strip when Israel stages military operations it says are essential for its security .
But five days of Israeli airstrikes have surpassed past operations in scale and intensity ; the long - distance bombardment of the Hamas - controlled territory has , however well aimed at those suspected of being militants , splintered families and shattered homes in one of the most densely populated places on Earth .
This is the story about a girl that ’s actually a dude who ’s brought in 3.8 – 19.4 million visitors * to Village Voice Media websites by gaming Digg .
Village Voice Media appears to be running an organized reciprocal Digg campaign using staff at their network of alt - weekly newspapers across the United States .
Two Digg users , Ivanb and Philostrato , are responsible for the vast majority of that traffic :
Backstory
A recent article in the Minnesota Independent included an interesting look into Village Voice Media ’s Minnesota property , CityPages.com ’s , traffic .
In that article , CityPages ’ editor , Kevin Hoffman boasted about recent phenomenal success of one of CityPages.com ’s blogs , The Blotter :
In October , Hoffman said , the blog garnered around 35,000 page views ; by December , that number rose to around 250,000 .
How does one manage to grow a blog ’s traffic by 7X over two months ?
The subject piqued my interest .
I presumed that this was not a case of sudden organic growth based on the fact that the site has had the same author over that entire time period ( Emily Kaiser ) and has n’t grown a large RSS subscriber base of loyal readers ( less than 100 Google Reader subscribers ) .
What ’s changed ?
CityPages ’ effectiveness at getting front - paged on Digg appears to have played a significant role .
What ’s Digg ?
Digg.com is a social media website where people submit news stories , photos , videos and blog posts they think are remarkable and thus worth sharing .
Other users view the shared content , and if they like it , vote it up by clicking a Digg button next to that story .
Stories receiving the most Diggs are promoted to the front page of Digg.com , which leads to enormous spikes in traffic ( 20,000 – 100,000 visits within hours is quite common ) .
A site that is good at getting “ Dugg ” will boost its traffic numbers significantly through occasional floods of Digg users to the front - paged story .
CityPages.com ’s Digg History
Historically ( we ’re talking Internet time here , so back to 2006 ) , CityPages.com has received little traction on Digg.com .
However , that has changed in recent months , as this chart of successful City Pages front page stories shows :
Coincidentally , CityPages started to see more front page Digg success around the time that City Pages web editor , Jen Boyles , joined Digg :
Jen is an active Digg user , and personally submits a ton of CityPages.com ’s stories to Digg , as you can see here ( jbizzy is Jen ’s username on Digg ) :
If you look at the numbers to the left of each story submission , you ’ll see that the ones submitted by jbizzy received few votes while stories submitted by IvanB received a TON of votes .
Those are examples of stories that made it to Digg ’s homepage .
IvanB is a lot better than Jen at pimping CityPages ’ stories on Digg .
Coincidentally , Jen Boyles ’
Digg friends seem to live in cities where Village Voice Media properties are located , including Minneapolis , New York , Miami , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Dallas , Houston and St. Louis :
Ivanb and Philostrato
Who are the influential Digg users ivanb and philostrato ?
I figured someone at Village Voice Media would know ( Jen Boyles is a mutual friend of both of them as the screenshot below shows ) :
Representatives from CityPages and Village Voice Media both refused to answer questions regarding their identities over the past week .
You can learn a lot about someone ’s interests based on what they submit to Digg .
Here is a breakdown of the top - 25 web properties these two users have submitted :
What kind of people read essentially every local alt - weekly owned by Village Voice Media and submits stories from those sites to Digg on a frequent basis ?
Clearly , people with a financial interest in seeing VVM properties get dugg .
Philostrato ’s profile places “ her ” in Houston .
I say , “ her ” because I do n’t believe someone who looks like this spends their days on Digg :
Ivanb , on the other hand , may or may not look like this :
Philostrato Has Balls
Just for fun , I ’m going state the obvious :
The Digg user Philostrato is NOT a she , but a he ( pictured on the right here and left here ) .
Philostrato is a he by the name of Keith Plocek , whose work titles are :
* Social Media Manager at Village Voice Media
* Web Editor at Houston Press
Exactly the kind of roles a person would have who obsesses over Village Voice Media ’s web traffic .
Ivanb and Philostrato Are Good at What They Do
Why is Village Voice Media so reliant on these two Digg users ?
Because being influential on Digg takes a lot of effort and skill .
Much more effort and skill than typical VVM employees have shown to date .
Digg takes a lot of variables into consideration when weighing a vote ( digg ) on their system .
If someone only Diggs their own website ’s stories , their votes will begin to carry less weight .
It ’s important to diversify your Diggs if you want your occasional self - diggs to carry weight .
For example , Ivanb has dugg over 60,000 stories on Digg and maintains an almost 60:1 ratio between posts he diggs to posts he submits .
Jbizzy , on the other hand , is running around 8:1 ( and almost all of her Diggs are for other VVM properties ) .
Is Digging Part of the Job for Village Voice Media Employees ?
CityPages Blotter writer , Emily Kaiser , appears to have been brought under Jen Boyles ’
Digg wing and is now actively digging her own stories ( and stories from other VVM properties ) after Jen submits them .
Here ’s a breakdown of what Emily has dugg to date :
and who submitted those stories to Digg :
Another CityPages employees who ’s playing along is Ward Rubrecht .
Others may be doing so under less obvious Digg usernames .
( I do appreciate Emily and Ward ’s transparency .
Jen Boyles used to include her name on her profile but has since switched to displaying just her Digg username ) .
Does any of this matter ?
I believe it does , and here ’s why : Village Voice Media serves up local advertiser ’s ads against this type of traffic .
As CityPages ’ Publisher , Mark Bartel explained in the comments of a previous post , Digg strategies contribute a significant amount of traffic to their site :
Traffic from digg.com represented 8 % of our traffic over the last 30 days .
It can range anywhere from 1 percent to 10 percent in a given month .
Mark stated that they plan to switch to geotargeting ads soon ( showing local ads to local audiences rather than to national or international visitors who are not relevant to local advertisers ) , which is certainly a move is the right direction .
Frankly , Digg traffic is fairly worthless for most advertisers ( at least those paying on an impression basis ) and for publishers ( if they ’re earning on a per click or conversion basis ) .
I ’ve written about this previously .
Marco Arment has also written about the poor quality of Digg traffic from an advertiser ’s perspective .
His comparison of his site ’s typical traffic vs. traffic on days where he gets Dugg is worth studying :
What Digg traffic looks like
* 0.66 % average click - through rate ( CTR ) on normal days
* 0.10 % click - through rate from Digg traffic
Ad profits are often measured in cost ( for the advertisers … profit for the site owner ) per 1,000 pages viewed ( CPM ) .
* $ 2.00 effective CPM on normal days
* $ 0.92 effective CPM from Digg traffic
That ’s quite a difference .
I would n’t want to pay the same amount
for Digg referred traffic ( that leads to clicks less than 1/6th as often ) as I would for more organically grown traffic .
Here ’s my take on this traffic tactic
1. Digg has plenty of weaknesses .
Their ranking algorithm is too easily gamed by networks by motivated users .
CityPages.com ’s recent Digg success – with no correlation with the quality of the content – makes that case .
2. Advertisers buying impression - based advertising from any website should ask where the site ’s traffic is coming from .
If Digg users are what you ’re looking for , you could just as easily buy traffic directly on Digg .
3 . A publisher performing well on Digg is not necessarily a bad thing .
There are many long - term benefits to it , including raising awareness about an online property and link building ( especially in the form of links that come from people blogging about stuff they found on Digg ) .
What ’s your take ?
Do you think the Village Voice Media advertisers who are having their ads served up against the 3.8 – 19.4 million visits generated by Ivanb and Philostrato are getting their money ’s worth ?
Is Digg too easily gamed by people like Ivanb and Philostrato ?
Will Ivanb or Philostrato
Digg this story ?
* This is based on an oft - cited figure of a frontpage Digg generating between 20,000 – 100,000 visits .

A plane that crashed onto a house in New York state , killing 50 people , dropped by 800 feet ( 245 metres ) in five seconds , officials say .
Air safety official Steve Chealander said the plane had fallen from 1,800 ft to 1,000 ft shortly before impact .
He also said investigators had not found that there were " severe icing " conditions , which would have required pilots to fly the plane manually .
The plane 's autopilot was on until just before the crash , Mr Chealander said .
Analysis of the plane 's data recorders shows the crew noticed significant ice build - up on its wings before the crash .
Mr Chealander , a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , had earlier told the the Associated Press news agency that the NTSB recommended pilots disengage their craft 's autopilot facility in icy conditions .
The plane 's de-icing system had been switched on before the crash Pilots using manual controls may be able to sense a problem sooner than the autopilot , he said .
But in a press briefing on Sunday he said there was no evidence that the Continental Airlines pilot had done anything wrong .
" The only restriction that they see - the manufacturer of this airplane - and that they write about is that disengage the autopilot in severe icing conditions , " Mr Chealander said .
" Thus far we have n't determined that it 's severe icing so , so far we see that everything seemed to be normal in using the autopilot . "
Pitches and rolls
The Bombardier Dash 8 was approaching Buffalo's airport when it crashed flat on the house in Clarence Center , a suburb of Buffalo , last Thursday .
BOMBARDIER DASH 8 AIRCRAFT
The Canadian - made Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was delivered new last year Q400 is newest member of the Dash 8 family Twin-engine turboprop , mainly for short - haul flights
First flown in 1998 , entered commercial service in 2000
' The plane did n't sound normal ' 9/11 widow among dead
The pilots did not tell air traffic controllers of any problems during the flight , and a recording of communications appears normal until shortly before the crash .
At that point , the crew are heard discussing snowy and misty conditions and asking for permission to descend .
The crew then discussed " significant ice build - up " on the windshield and leading edge of the aircraft 's wings , Mr Chealander said on Friday .
The plane 's de-icing system had been switched on before the crew talked about the ice , he said .
Preliminary investigations suggested the plane was pointing away from the airport at which it was meant to land when it crashed .
Analysis of the data recorders shows the plane made a series of severe pitches and rolls seconds before plunging into the house .
The dead include 44 passengers , four crew and one off - duty pilot on board , and one person on the ground .
The twin -prop Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft , operated by Colgan Air for Continental Airlines , was flying from Newark airport in New Jersey to Buffalo Niagara International Airport .

With the financial sector on the rocks during the last few months , many banks have had to come up with emergency acquisitions and mergers to stay afloat financially .
Other banks have outright failed and some are on the brink of failure .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) providers insurance to account - holders to make sure they wo n’t lose their money in the event that their bank fails , but it only applies to certain types of accounts and has deposit limits .
Typically , FDIC insurance will grant protection for the first $ 100,000 that you have in your savings , checking or certificate of deposit accounts .
Investment accounts such as money market accounts , mutual funds , stocks , and bonds are not covered .
The $ 100,000 figure will be for the total sum of your assets in your account .
If you have two accounts at one bank , your limit is still $ 100,000 .
So you want to make sure that the total amount of money you have at any one bank is less than $ 100,000 at any given time .
There are some ways that you can increase the amount of FDIC insurance that your account receives .
For the year of 2009 , the FDIC has temporarily raised that insurance amount to $ 250,000 because of a recent law passed by Congress , but after that , the limit will drop down to $ 100,000 again .
If you have a joint account , such as an account with both a husband and a wife ’s name on it , the limit will double to $ 200,000 .
If the money is in a retirement fund , the limit will increase up to $ 250,000 .
For those that have extremely large amount of money , there ’s a program called CDARS which will provide FDIC insurance for large sums of money .
Essentially , you ’ll have one account with a fixed interest rate , but the money will be spread across a number of banks offering you virtually unlimited FDIC insurance .
You can visit www.cdars.com for more information about that program .
Typically , financial advisors will recommend that you do n’t have more than $ 90,000 to $ 95,000 in any one bank .
This way , both your principal and interest will be protected if the bank that you deposit money into were to go bankrupt or otherwise be insolvent .
By staying a few thousand dollars under the limit that gives your account some room to grow without going over that $ 100,000 mark .
If you have money invested in a credit union , it will be insured by the National Credit Union Association ( NCUA ) .
Your money invested in these accounts are equally safe , but there are different rules regarding the limits , so you ’ll want to investigate those if you have a large amount of money stored up at a credit union .
If you play your cards right , you can keep 100 % of your money FDIC insured via splitting your money between banks or via participating in the CDARS program .
Having more than $ 100,000 in any given bank might not be an issue for you right now , but someday it might be , so make sure that your funds are protected .

According to Schwarzenegger biographer Joe Mathews , the Governator was seriously considering ditching the GOP a few months ago .
Daily Beast :
A few months ago , Arnold Schwarzenegger and a few close associates discussed whether he should leave the Republican Party , according to two people familiar with the conversation .
His friend Mike Bloomberg , the New York mayor , had become an independent .
Maybe Schwarzenegger should , too .
But the governor and his people quickly concluded that Californians already saw him as independent of the Republican Party .
So what would be the point of a switch ?
( A spokesman for the governor declined comment . )
Arnold is far from a model politician , but he has always struck me as far too pragmatic and insufficiently insane to be a Republican .

Meet the nine - year - old bride who has fulfilled her dying wish to get married
Dream come true : Jayla Cooper , nine , wore a white dress and headband for her ' wedding ' to Jose Griggs
A little girl with leukaemia has enjoyed her dream wedding just two weeks before she is expected to die .
Nine - year - old Jayla Cooper dreamed of being a bride so her parents allowed her to ' marry ' her seven - year - old groom - her friend and fellow hospital patient Jose Griggs .
And the blushing bride pulled out all the stops , dressing up like a princess in a white ruffled dress and tiara .
She was walked down the aisle by her father Jerrod Cooper before she and Jose exchanged little gold rings and vowed to be ' friends forever ' .
After the service the newlyweds danced to their favourite song - The Love Bug by The Jonas Brothers .
Of her new husband , Jayla told reporters : '' He is very cute and I love him .
I was so excited and happy .
It was really fun , we had dances and did a lot of things . '
The two families wanted the mock wedding , which took place in Dallas , Texas , on Sunday , to be a ' celebration of life and friendship ' .
Big day :
The wedding official has to kneel down to Jayla and her groom to conduct the ceremony which was watched over by the children 's mothers
Jayla , whose aggressive illness is expected to claim her life within two weeks , became friends with Jose while being treated at the Children 's Medical Hospital in Dallas .
Unlike his tragic bride , Jose is said to be on the road to recovery from his leukaemia .
President Obama , please take note of this trend .
Let us begin trimming defense expenditures unneeded on the current global stage .
Invest the money saved on a comprehensive health care package , preferably a single payer approach , that covers all Americans along with transferring excessive weapons purchasing into green technology .

The beauty of functional programming is that there does n't have to be a conflict between those who prefer explicit and those who prefer implicit recursion .
Think of them as different views on the same functions - just as with graphical visualizations , pick the view best suited to your purpose and use equational reasoning to transform one view into another , as needed .
Improving your experience in reasoning about code is going to help at every level of abstraction , and since you 've already paid the price ( using a pure language , to make reasoning easier ) you might as well avail yourself of the facilities ;-)
While developing , I might prefer abstraction , as fewer details mean that I can hold more of the problem in my head at any point , increasing my chances of seeing all the way to a solution ; if optimizing , or when I have n't found the right abstractions yet , I might have to resort to less abstract code until I 've sorted out those details or until GHC deals with the more abstract forms as well as with the less abstract ones .
Fine , you say , but I 'd never would have thought of abstract views like splitAt as a state transformer .
Okay , before this thread , I might not have thought of using that , either .
But after this thread , I 'd hope for it to become part of my thinking about Haskell code .
And the way I do that is by taking the abstract code and unfold it ( replacing instances of left - hand sides with instances of right - hand sides of definitions - the source links in the Haddock documentation are very useful for that ) until I get to some less abstract code that I might have come up with .
That does n't mean that I 'd have had the insights to play the derivation backwards , but by breaking the transformation from less abstract to more abstract view into smaller steps , starting from the abstract form that incorporates the additional insights I was missing , I can increase my understanding of what is going on , and my chances of noticing the opportunities next time .
It also confirms whether or not the two solutions really are the same ( as has been pointed out , that was n't the case here ) .
Paraphrasing and tweaking Sjur Gjøstein Karevoll 's remark a little : clever Perl code is what you hope you understood in the past , when you wrote it ; clever Haskell code is what you hope you 'll understand in the future , when you 'll write it yourself ! -)
The derivation below is best followed by replaying it yourself in your editor , but I hope you 'll find it helpful anyway .

LOS ANGELES , MID - JUNE 2008
Sitting on a plush couch in the neon - infused nightclub , I asked again :
“ What ’s it about ? ”
Neil Strauss glanced around and looked nervous , which I found strange .
After all , we ’d known each other for close to two years now .
In fact , he was – as New York Times bestselling author of The Game and others – one of the first people to see the proposal for The 4 - Hour Workweek and offer me encouragement .
“ C’mon , dude , give me a break .
Do n’t you trust me ? ”
“ Guilt .
That ’s good .
Use guilt , ” Neil said .
But the Woody Allen approach was n’t working .
“ I ca n’t let the meme out early ” he said , “ I trust you — I ’m just paranoid , ” he offered to no one in particular as he downed another RedBull .
So I fired a shot in the dark .
“ What , are you writing about the 5 Flags or something ? ”
Neil ’s heart skipped a beat and he stared at me for several long seconds .
He was stunned .
“ What do you know about the 5 Flags ? ”
I was in .
The 5 Flags
Neil ’s new book , Emergency , teaches you how to become Jason Bourne .
Multiple passports , moving assets , lock - picking , escape and evasion , foraging , even how to cross borders without detection ( one preferred location : McAllen , Texas , page 390 ) –it ’s a veritable encyclopedia of for those who want to disappear or become lawsuit - proof global citizens …
I proofread the book months ago , and it ’s been torture to keep some of the content from you , as I find the topics endlessly fascinating .
For example , let ’s take the concept of “ geoarbitrage ” to it ’s natural but extreme extension :
The 5 Flags .
I was first introduced to the 5 Flags approach by a deca-millionaire in San Francisco , but here is Neil ’s explanation :
“ The way to break free of nationality , according to Schultz ’s pamphlet , was to follow a three - flag system .
The three flags consist of having a second passport , a safe location for your assets in another country , and a legal address in a tax haven .
To these , Hill added a fourth and fifth flag : an additional country as a business base and a number of what he called ‘ playground countries ’ in which to spend leisure time . ”
I never implemented the 5 Flags , but I fantasized about getting a second passport and the infinite options it could provide .
Neil actually went out and did it .
I ’ll get stopped at the airport in a lock - down ; Neil wo n’t .
If the FDIC collapses and bank withdrawals are blocked ( as happened in Argentina in 2002 when the currency collapsed due to hyperinflation ) , I ’m out of business ; Neil has assets elsewhere .
Do I think the US banks are all going to collapse ?
Not at all .
Do I think it ’s intelligent to have a lot of options ?
Indeed .
Do I think it ’s fun to read about what billionaires and money launderers do , even if I do n’t imitate them ?
Most definitely .
I ’m very happy to offer you an exclusive first look at Emergency .
Get this book .
The following excerpts will set your mind spinning .

Lesson 22 – The Gone With the Wind Guide to Asset Protection
If you wanted to withdraw your entire life savings and move it to a bank in Switzerland , what would you do ?
Now that I ’d decided to hide my assets offshore , the information from the Sovereign Society conference about the government tracking withdrawals and transfers of more than $ 10,000 applied to me .
It seemed impossible to get the money from my American bank to the Swiss bank Spencer recommended without ringing alarm bells .
Even if I moved it in small increments , there would still be a paper trail detailing exactly how much money I ’d transferred .
So I did what any resourceful American would do : I bought a book on money laundering .
After all , it is n’t a crime to move money secretly as long as the income ’s been reported to the IRS and any other necessary reporting requirements are met .
And my intention was n’t to hide my earnings from the government , customs , or creditors , but to protect it from bank collapses , inflation , seizure , and lawsuits , which required leaving few traces of where it went .
Securing money overseas is not a new idea .
Even in the novel Gone With the Wind , Rhett butler keeps his earnings in offshore banks , enabling him to buy a house for Scarlett o’ Hara after the Civil War — in contrast to his Southern colleagues , who lose their fortunes due to blockades , inflation , and financial collapse .
For more practical , non-fictional inspiration , I bought Jeffrey Robinson ’s 1996 book The Laundrymen .
I ’d always wondered how empty video stores renting movies for $ 3 a day could stay in business , and why I ’d see Russian thugs running clearly unprofitable frozen yogurt stands on deserted side streets .
According to Robinson , it ’s because , in order to make illegal funds appear legitimate , crooks will slowly feed the money into the cash registers of a normal business .
“ It ’s almost impossible to spot an extra $ 500 coming in daily through the tills of a storefront stocked with 15,000 videos , ” he writes .
“ Nor would anyone ’s suspicions necessarily be raised if that same owner ran a chain of twenty video rental stores and , backed up with the appropriate audits , awarded himself an annual bonus of $ 3.96 million . ”
Buried elsewhere in Robinson ’s book was the answer I was looking for .
The best legal way to surreptitiously move money , it seems , is to buy something that does n’t lose its cash value when purchased .
For example , there ’s a black market for people who transfer money by buying expensive jewelry , art , watches , and collectibles , then selling them in their destination country for a small loss — usually no greater than the percentage banks charge for exchanging currencies .
So once AIG private bank in Switzerland returned my phone call — assuming that , unlike Spencer ’s [ a billionaire who appears earlier in the book ] lawyer , they were actually willing to work with me — I planned to go shopping for rare coins .
But if it was all so legitimate , why did it feel so wrong ?
While I waited to hear from the Swiss bank , I drove to Burbank to meet with the asset protection lawyers Spencer had recommended , Tarasov and Associates .
The receptionist led me into a room with black - and - silver wallpaper where Alex Tarasov sat at a large mahogany desk with a yellow legal pad in front of him .
With this pad , he would rearrange my business life forever .
“ You did a very smart thing by coming here , ” Tarasov said .
Twenty - five years ago , he had probably been a frat boy .
Maybe even played varsity football .
But a quarter century spent sitting at desks scrutinizing legal papers had removed all evidence of health from his skin and physique .
“ By taking everything you own out of your name , we can hide it from lawyers trying to do an asset search on you . ”
“ So if they sue me and win , they wo n’t be able to get anything ? ”
“ We can make it very difficult for them to find the things you own and get at them .
It ’s not impossible , but the deeper we bury your assets , the more money it ’s going to cost to find out where they are .
And if we can make that time and cost greater than the worth of the assets , then you ’re in good shape . ”
Like Spencer had said , this was just insurance .
The cost of setting this up would be like taking out a policy against lawsuits .
“ So what do you own ? ” he asked .
I laid it all out for him .
“ I have a house I ’m still paying for .
I have some stocks and bonds my grandparents gave me when I was a kid .
I have a checking and a savings account .
And I have the copyrights to my books . ”
I paused , trying to remember if I owned anything else .
I thought there was more .
“ I guess that ’s about it .
I have a secondhand Dodge Durango , I guess .
And a 1972 corvette that does n’t work . ”
In truth , I did n’t own that much .
But ever since my first college job , standing over a greasy grill making omelets and grilled cheese sandwiches , I had started putting money in the bank .
Since then , I ’d saved enough to live on for a year or two if I ever fell on hard times or just wanted to see the world .
I did n’t want to lose the freedom that came from having a financial cushion and not being in debt for anything besides my house .
“ Here ’s what we can do , ” Tarasov said .
He then sketched this diagram on his legal pad :
The stick figure was me .
as for the boxes , I had no idea what those were .
“ These are boxes , ” Tarasov explained .
I was clearly getting the asset - protection - for - dummies lecture .
“ Each box represents a different LLC ” — limited liability company .
“ If we can wrap everything in an LLC , and then all those LLCs are owned by a holding company , and that holding company is owned by a trust that you do n’t even technically own , then you ’re safe . ”
I liked that last word .
But I did n’t understand the rest of it .
“ So we ’re just basically making everything really complicated ? ” I asked .
“ That ’s the idea .
We ’ll even put your house in a separate LLC , so that if someone trips and falls , they ca n’t get at anything else you own . ”
When Tarasov was through explaining everything , I could n’t tell whether I was protecting myself from being scammed or actually being scammed myself .
But I trusted Spencer , because he seemed too rich , too smart , and too paranoid to get taken in .
So I told Tarasov to start wrapping me up in LLCs until my net - worth was whatever spending money I had in my pocket .
“ Once we have these entities set up , we can talk about transferring them to offshore corporations , ” Tarasov said as I left .

Lesson 54 – Secrets of Escaped Felons
Kelly Alwood did n’t say a word as he handcuffed my hands behind my back , opened the trunk of a rental car , and ordered me to get inside .
With his shaven head , which looked like it could break bottles ; his glassy green eyes , which revealed no emotion whatsoever ; and the .32 caliber pistol hanging from a chain around his neck , he did n’t seem like the kind of person to cross .
As he shut the trunk over my head , the blue sky of Oklahoma City disappeared , replaced by claustrophobic darkness and new - car smell .
Instantly , panic set in .
I took a deep breath and tried to remember what I ’d learned .
I curled my right leg as far up my body as it would go and dipped my cuffed hands down until I could reach my sock .
Inside , I ’d stashed the straight half of a bobby pin , which I ’d modified by making a perpendicular bend a quarter inch from the top .
I removed the pin , stuck the bent end into the inner edge of the handcuff keyhole , and twisted the bobby pin down against the lever inside until I felt it give way .
As I twisted my wrist against the metal , I heard a fast series of clicks , the sound of freedom as the two ends of the cuff disengaged .
I released my hand , then made a discovery few people who have n’t been stuffed inside a trunk know : most new cars have a release handle on the inside of the boot that , conveniently , glows in the dark .
I pulled on the handle and emerged into the light .
“ Thirty - nine seconds , ” Alwood said as I climbed out of the trunk .
“ Not bad . ”
I could n’t believe classes like this even existed .
In the last forty - eight hours , I ’d learned to hotwire a car , pick locks , conceal my identity , and escape from handcuffs , flexi- cuffs , ducttape , rope , and nearly every other type of restraint .
The course was Urban Escape and Evasion , which offered the type of instruction I ’d been looking for to balance my wilderness knowledge .
The objective of the class was to learn to survive in a city as a fugitive .
Most of the students were soldiers and contractors who ’d either been in Iraq or were about to go , and wanted to know how to safely get back to the Green Zone if trapped behind enemy lines .
The class was run by a company called onPoint Tactical .
Like most survival schools , its roots led straight to Tom Brown .
Its founder , Kevin Reeve , had been the director of Tracker School for seven years before setting off on his own to train navy SEALS , Special Forces units , SWAT teams , parajumpers , marines , snipers , and even SERE instructors .
As a bounty hunter , his partner , Alwood , had worked with the FBI and Secret Service to help capture criminals on the Most Wanted list .
…
As the sun set , we drove to an abandoned junkyard , where Reeve let us practice throwing chips of ceramic insulation from spark plugs to shatter car windows , using generic keys known as jigglers to open automobile doors , and starting cars by sticking a screwdriver in the ignition switch and turning it with a wrench .
As I popped open the trunk on a Dodge with my new set of jigglers , I thought , This is the coolest class I ’ve ever taken in my life .
…
Over a barbecue dinner later that night , Reeve asked why I ’d signed up for the course .
“ I think things have changed for my generation , ” I told him .
“ We were born with a silver spoon in our mouths , but now it ’s being removed .
And most of us never learned how to take care of ourselves .
So I ’ve spent the last two years trying to get the skills and documents I need to prepare for an uncertain future . ”
I ’d never actually verbalized it before .
I ’d just been reacting and scrambling as the pressure ratcheted up around me .
Reeve looked at Alwood silently as I spoke .
For a moment , I worried that I ’d been too candid .
Then he smiled broadly .
“ You ’re talking to the right people .
That ’s what we ’ve been thinking .
Kelly has caches all over the country — and in Europe . ”
Lesson 28 – Calculate the Odds That You ’re In Jail Right Now
ST . KITTS , EASTERN CARIBBEAN
In a few days , I ’d be committed to an expense of over half a million dollars , which was more money than I had .
And what was it all for ?
Symbolic paper .
A passport , which is just a teeny little booklet that means nothing to the universe .
Realistically , the world was n’t likely to end in my lifetime .
And if it did , everyone on St. Kitts would be just as dead as everyone in America .
If there were a smaller - scale world disaster , things would probably be even worse on an island in the Caribbean , where I was more likely to be a victim of food shortages , droughts , hurricanes , blackouts , and tsunamis .
There ’s nowhere to run and nowhere to hide on an island — especially one in the smallest country in the Americas .
I ’d become so focused on my search for a passport — so consumed with escaping the blowback of American politics — that I ’d forgotten the survivalist lessons I ’d learned on Y2 K and 9/11 .
Soon , the whole endeavor began to seem like the biggest travesty ever .
If something horrible happened in America , would a St. Kitts passport even get me out during a state of emergency ?
What if it was confiscated by customs agents ?
Or what if Victor , Maxwell , and Wendell were in collusion and just ripping me off ?
I did n’t have anyone to protect me here .
Once I ’d ridden out that wave of anxiety , a new one formed .
I began worrying that I ’d blabbed my name and occupation to too many people .
If they Googled me and saw the filth I ’d written , they might not sell me the apartment or give me a citizenship .
And then I ’d be stuck in America if anything bad happened .
And so it went , all night , one wave of anxiety after another — half of them spent worrying that I would n’t get a passport , the other half spent worrying that I would .
I fell asleep around dawn for a few fitful hours , until I was woken by my cell phone .
AIG Private Bank was finally returning my call .
Every day , my small savings were dwindling as the dollar dropped relative not just to the euro , but even to the Caribbean currency here .
I never thought I ’d see the day when Eastern Europeans came to the United States for the cheap shopping .
“ I ’d like to inquire about opening a private banking account , ” I told the woman .
“ Great , ” she said , with barely a trace of a Swiss accent .
“ Let me ask you a few questions . ”
“ Sure . ”
“ Are you an American citizen ? ”
“ Yes , I am . ”
“ We do n’t deal with American citizens for a few years now . ”
“ But my friend Spencer Booth is American , and I think he has an account with you . ”
“ It ’s likely an older account .
We do n’t do business with American citizens anymore .
Sorry , good - bye . ”
Before I could respond , she had hung up .
I felt like an outcast .
I could n’t believe a bank would n’t take my money solely because I was American .
I ’d noticed that many of the banks I ’d researched had special policies for dealing with United States citizens .
Even some of the online companies selling vintage travel documents said they no longer shipped to America because U.S. customs agents were opening and confiscating the packages .
The government seemed to be sticking its nose everywhere .
In the meantime , I ’d discovered a few other interesting facts : according to a report issued by Reporters Without Borders , the United States was ranked as having the fifty - third freest press in the world , tied with Botswana and Croatia .
According to the World Health organization , the United States had the fifty - fourth fairest health care system in the world , with lack of medical coverage leading to an estimated 18,000 unnecessary deaths a year .
And according to the Justice Department , one in every thirty - two Americans was in jail , on probation , or on parole .
Rather than having actual freedom , it seemed that , like animals in a habitat in the zoo , we had only the illusion of freedom .
As long as we did n’t try to leave the cage , we ’d never know we were n’t actually free .
That phone call was all it took to let me know I was doing the right thing .
Before going home , I had dinner with Wendell at a restaurant called Fisherman ’s Wharf [ in St. Kitts , not San Francisco ] and thanked him for his help .
After the meal , he patted my shoulder and smiled .
“ Next time I see you , you ’ll be a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis just like me , ” he said .
“ When you get married , your wife will be a citizen .
And when you have kids , so will they . ”
He stepped into his SUV , started the engine , then unrolled the window and concluded his thought : “ One day , ” he said , beaming , “ when you come back to America , no one will recognize you .
You ’ll be a Kittitian . ”
At the St. Kitts airport the next morning , I felt like I was returning not to a country but a fortress .
“ Your country is so tough to get into , ” the ticket agent complained as she checked my documents for the flight home .
“ They make it so hard for us . ”
She looked up at me and said it louder , almost with venom , as if it were my fault .
“ They make it so hard for us . ”
She was n’t alone in her opinion .
A survey released the previous month by the Discover America Partnership had found that international travelers considered America the least - friendly country to visit .
“ That ’s why , ” I told her , with the newfound pride that Wendell had instilled in me , “ I ’m moving here . ”
Lesson 59 – Iceland is the New Caribbean
Maybe it was when Bear Stearns became the first brokerage house to be rescued by the government since the Great Depression .
Maybe it was when IndyMac became the fifth American bank to fail in recent months .
Maybe it was when the government gave customs agents authority to confiscate , copy , and analyze any laptop or data storage device brought across the border .
…
Maybe it was the unshakable sense that the worst was still to come .
But I was no longer alone .
It was a hot summer , and pessimism hung thick in the air .
Most people I talked to felt as if they were inching closer to some darkness they could n’t understand , because they ’d never experienced it before and did n’t know what it held .
…
Even Spencer ’s housemate Howard , who had once made fun of us for taking precautionary measures , was now looking into Caribbean islands .
As it turned out , he would beat all of us there when his company collapsed and he had to hide from possible indictment .
“ I ’m so glad we started preparing ahead , ” Spencer told me over dinner at the Chateau Marmont , where he was staying in Los Angeles .
Having struck out with the Swiss , I took Spencer ’s advice and opened an account with a Canadian bank that had a branch in St. Kitts .
Since both Canada and St. Kitts are part of the British Commonwealth , he ’d explained , I would have easy access to my money if anything happened in America .
Unfortunately , in the process , I discovered that keeping international accounts secret is now illegal : the IRS requires Americans with over $ 10,000 in foreign accounts to file an annual report disclosing not just the amount of money and the banks it ’s kept in , but the account numbers .
Meanwhile , Spencer was moving forward with his ten - year plan .
He started an Internet business in Singapore , enabling him to open a private banking account in the country , which he claimed was fast becoming the new Switzerland .
Though he had n’t gotten his St. Kitts passport yet either , Spencer had done more research into buying an island .
“ I ’m looking at islands in the north , around Iceland , because no one will think of looking for anyone there , ” Spencer said , his thick lips spreading into a self - satisfied smile .
“ If I can get some other B people [ billionaires ] to go there with me , we can build underground homes and use geothermal energy . ”
“ What about your submarine ? ”
“ It ’s a great way to move between islands undetected , but we ’re running out of time .
We need to move faster .
This is only the beginning . ”
“ How bad do you think it ’s going to get ? ”
Spencer seemed to understand the economy at a higher level than most people did , perhaps because he knew so many of the people who ran it .
“ I do n’t think the whole country ’s going to collapse , but we ’re looking at the worst economic disaster in America since the Great Depression .
What I ’m also concerned about is the increase in violent crime that ’s going to accompany this . ”
Everywhere I went that summer , the demon of Just in Case seemed to follow me , growling in my ear louder than it ever had , its jaws terrifyingly close to my jugular .
I ’d learned so much , changed so much , tested myself so much .
It now was time to stop preparing , turn around , and face the demon — and my fears — head on .
And a musician would lead me there .

No further details about the man , who has not been charged , were released .
His arrest follows Kent Police 's seizure of an Indymedia server in Manchester on January 22 .
The two user comments that prompted the investigation were posted on Indymedia in response to a story about the jail sentences given to members of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty ( SHAC ) .
Mr Justice Neil Butterfield handed down sentences of between four and 11 years for blackmail to three women and four men after they were convicted of harassing people and companies connected to Huntingdon Life Sciences ( HLS ) .
Kent Police carried out the SHAC investigation , led by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Robbins .
The receipt left with the Manchester colocation firm hosting Indymedia 's server said he had instigated the seizure .
The first comment , entitled " Mr No Justice Butterfield " , said : " Or plain old Neil Butterfield when you strip away his wig , gown and pompous titles .
You might want to let this friend of HLS know exactly what you think about him .
Just do n't mention his son Sam who was killed in a taxi crash in India last year . "
Sam Butterfield died on his honeymoon in January 2008 .
The post went on to give Mr Justice Butterfield 's personal details , which were deleted by Indymedia administrators in line with the site 's privacy policy .
A second commenter however reposted the information hours later on 21 January , writing : " Butterfield 's details were posted on Indymedia but removed .
Not before I had a chance to write them down though :-) . "
Indymedia administrators again removed the personal details .
The site was contacted by Kent Police on the morning of 22 January requesting that information about the posters be retained .
Indymedia responded that it had configured its Apache server software not to log IP addresses in order to protect its users ' privacy .
An Indymedia spokesman declined to immediately comment on today 's development .
Kent Police said the investigation was ongoing .
In 2004 Indymedia servers were seized as part of an FBI investigation into violent protests at G8 meetings . ®
On the eve of the inaugural , a coalition of Latino organizations gathered to lay out their priorities for the Obama administration .
At the top of their list was immigration : amnesty for the estimated 13 million illegal aliens living in the United States and still higher levels of government - mandated immigration .
These professional ethnic - interest advocates came to Washington touting that Latino voters favored Barack Obama over John McCain by a better than 2 - 1 margin and “ to settle debts accrued during the campaign season , ” according to an article on the New York Times website .
But aside from the fact that Obama would have coasted to victory even without his sizable advantage among Latino voters , this coalition managed to overlook one other important detail :
More immigration is not what Latino voters want .
The Pew Hispanic Center , a respected Washington think tank , took the trouble to ask Latinos what issues they considered to be “ extremely important . ”
For 57 % of the respondents to its poll , released just before the inauguration , the economy was the most important issue .
Close behind were education and healthcare .
Rounding out the top five were national security and the environment .
Although the groups purporting to represent the interests of Latinos in the U.S. have set amnesty for illegal aliens and higher levels of immigration as their No. 1 priority , immigration ranks only sixth among the concerns of ordinary Latinos .
Fewer than one in three Latinos in the U.S. surveyed , 31 % , rated immigration as an extremely important issue .

And of the five issues Latinos rated as their highest priorities for President Obama to address , all of them would be made more difficult by amnesty and higher levels of immigration .
The economy .
With the economy shedding jobs at a rate of half a million a month , legalizing 13 million illegal aliens and adding to the already record levels of government - mandated immigration would be like dousing a flame with gasoline .
Education .
The schools attended by predominantly Latino students are affected the most by immigration .
In 2004 , about 44 % of the students attending the Los Angeles public school system were classified as “ limited English proficient , ” according to the latest district information available .
Nationwide , the 2006 dropout rate among Latinos in the U.S. was 22 % -- double the rate for African American students and quadruple that of whites .
Healthcare .
Immigrants and their U.S. - born children accounted for 71 % of the increase in the medically uninsured population between 1989 and 2007 , according to the Center for Immigration Studies .
In all , 34 % of immigrant households lack basic health insurance , compared with 13 % of the native - born population .

National security .
America ’s already dysfunctional system for processing immigration could not possibly handle the tens of millions of amnesty applications they would likely receive .
As in the much smaller amnesty of 1986 , the government likely would resort to rubber - stamping applications without conducting adequate background checks .
The environment .
The Census Bureau projects that at current immigration levels , the U.S. population will grow by 135 million people over the next 40 years .
An amnesty , coupled with higher immigration levels , would surely send us over the half - a- billion mark by midcentury , effectively dooming all environmental initiatives .
The agenda being pressed by the ethnic - interest and immigration advocacy groups has nothing to do with the concerns or well - being of Latinos in the United States .
Rather , in direct contrast to President Obama ’s inaugural declaration “ that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve , ” it is about raw political power .
“ I anticipate a dramatic shift in power toward heavily Latino parts of the United States ” after the next census , said Simon Rosenberg , director of the New Democratic Network , an advocacy group that is pro-amnesty .
“ Remember :
In redistricting , we count people , not citizens . ”

Throughout the campaign and standing on the west portico of the Capitol , Obama has sought to inspire the nation toward a common purpose .
Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds are prepared to answer his call .
Whether on immigration or countless other issues , the nation is hungry for a leader who demonstrates through action that his only debt is to the American people .
Probably only aviation geeks will find this interesting .
Whether or not to circumcise your newborn son is probably the very first big decision you ’ll make for him .
Several decades ago , the choice would have been easy ; in the 1970 ’s , around 90 % of American - born males were circumcised .
Today that number has fallen to around 60 % , and the practice is markedly less popular in many other countries .
The debate over whether or not to circumcise can get quite fiery , and it remains a divisive and controversial issue .
Every couple should research the pros and cons of circumcision and come to the decision about what is best for their baby .
To aid men in thinking through the issue and in hopes of creating civil discussion on the matter , today we present a point / counter point on circumcision .
We ’ve brought together a few of our friends who have taken a side on the issue .
First , we have Ryan and Amy Lee who will be arguing against circumcision .
In the pro-circumcision corner , we have Jeff Trexler .
And just to give fair warning , this article does discuss sex .
So if you ’re easily scandalized like a Victorian housewife , please go ahead and skip this article .
Point : Circumcision does more harm than good , carries unnecessary risks , and should not be performed routinely .
Written by Ryan and Amy Lee
Considering routine neonatal circumcision is the most frequently performed surgery in the United States , it is surprisingly often misunderstood .
Despite medical doctors ’ vow to uphold the Hippocratic oath , primum non nocere ( above all , do no harm ) , circumcision seems to be the exception to their rule .
Typically the burden of proof would be upon a medical intervention to prove itself worthy of possible attending risks .
However , because circumcision is rooted more in tradition than medicine , many doctors and parents agree to the procedure without fully examining the logic , or lack thereof , substantiating it .
As a Canadian - born intact male , I have the unique perspective of understanding the anatomical function of the foreskin firsthand , as does my wife .
Based on personal experience , as well as extensive research , we have concluded that the procedure does more harm than good , carries unnecessary risks , and should not be performed routinely .
Though the literature contains far more information than can be encapsulated here , we will attempt to scratch the surface of the case against circumcision and will also encourage your further consideration and research as you make choices on behalf of your children , or discuss the matter with other parents .
Because an intact penis is the default , rather than attempting to extol what is simply natural , we will approach our argument against circumcision by elaborating on the logical fallacies in the pro-circumcision arguments .
We recognize the proliferation of web - based arguments on both sides of this issue , so all arguments here come from peer - reviewed articles , professional medical associations , and our own personal experience .
That said , one of the most compelling pieces of web - based information on this subject is the video footage available , so if you really want to see why circumcision is a bad idea , search “ routine infant circumcision ” on Google video and brace yourself .
Fallacy # 1 : Circumcision is desirable because it promotes cleanliness and prevents disease .
As an owner of an intact penis , I can confidently say that my cleaning habits are probably identical to yours and are more than sufficient to get the apparatus clean as a whistle .
If our primary goal is removing people ’s folds of protective , functional skin to prevent the possible accumulation of secretions , we should be going after baby girls with the scalpel .
Thankfully , this idea that would horrify most everyone in the U.S. , and I think the idea of approaching baby boys similarly should be equally horrifying .
Regarding disease , the notion that circumcision is a legitimate preventative measure is simply unsubstantiated and , in fact , some research indicates that the foreskin may be protective against infection .
The rate of circumcision is a mere 6 % in the UK , and , in fact , the U.S. may be the only developed nation to practice routine infant circumcision .
Check out this global distribution map provided by the World Health Organization .
Fallacy # 2 : The foreskin is unnecessary and can be removed with no adverse effects .
In my experience , the loudest proponents of this argument are circumcised men who , with all due respect , do n’t have much basis for comparison .
Admittedly , I have never had a circumcised penis myself , but accounts of men circumcised as adults compare the difference in sexual sensitivity after the procedure to seeing in black and white after once seeing in color .
This seems understandable given the foreskin is significantly more highly innervated than the rest of the shaft .
In my experience , the foreskin itself is the source of by far the most genital sensation and pleasure .
In a circumcised adult male , the amount of skin missing is about the size of a 4X6 index card ( depending on overall size ) - over one third of the penile skin .
The foreskin ’s anatomical function is myriad .
One important function is protecting the glans the way the eyelid protects the eye ; in the absence of a foreskin , the glans becomes keratinized from rubbing against clothing and is much less sensitive .
Another important function that the foreskin provides an erotogenic ( good feeling ! ) gliding sheath over the shaft , reducing loss of lubrication and decreasing the friction that can decrease pleasure for both partners .
In infants the foreskin is adhered to the glans , like a fingernail , and so before it is cut off , it must be separated .
One can imagine this is extremely painful and leaves the glans exposed before it is mature enough for the foreskin to separate on its own , usually during early childhood .
Additionally , I have both read about and personally known individuals with complications resulting from circumcision and , though very rarely , sometime even death can result from excessive blood loss or infection .
It should be noted that these cases , though rare indeed , occur with similar or greater frequency than deaths from penile cancer , which is often cited as a reason to circumcise .
Perhaps we should start removing infants toes at birth too , to prevent possible ingrown toenails in old age , or the dreaded toe cancer .
Just sayin’ .
Fallacy # 3 : If circumcision is going to be done , it is most ethical to do it during infancy , so the person wo n’t remember it .
I ’ve heard many circumcised men remark that they sure are glad the procedure was done when they were babies so that they do n’t have to remember it .
While I agree that having a piece of my penis cut off without anesthesia is a memory I would prefer to avoid , there is a better way to avoid it - leaving those kids alone !
As I become more educated about circumcision and find myself discussing it with others it seems that for every man who , with bravado , claims his circumcised member is exactly to his liking , there is at least one humble fellow who admits , sometimes with great emotion , that he wishes such important decisions about his body had been left to him - he would have chosen to spare himself a traumatic experience during his first moments and live life with a complete , intact penis .
I am glad that so many circumcised men are as satisfied with their penises as I am with mine .
I am also glad that so many wives and partners are equally pleased .
However , I know some men and women who grieve the loss of the foreskin from their relationship and wonder how things would be different .
When a baby boy is born he , obviously , ca n’t consent to the procedure and by the time his opinion can be known , it is often too late .
Parents must make many choices about their children without their consent , it ’s true , but choosing a cosmetic genital surgery is , in my mind and many others ’ , taking that liberty way too far .
If there is a chance your son would n’t want it done to his penis , why would you take the risk ?
At the end of the day , if you decline to circumcise your son , he always has the option to do so himself later in life .
But if you consent to the procedure , everyone ’s hands are tied .
There is no way to fully restore what has been lost .
Fallacy # 4 : Intact penises are less cosmetically desirable .
Whoa there !
Again , I am relieved to know that so many men like the looks of their circumcised penises , and pleased that their partners share their appreciation , but this is a bold claim .
Understandably , people with positive experiences with a penis , their own or their partner ’s , will develop an affinity for that specific penis and may come to think that theirs is the “ best . ” Great .
We want everyone to love their penis around here ; taking good care of penises is really what we ’re talking about anyway .
But my wife emphatically prefers my penis just as it is : intact .
And , I ’m not gonna lie , so do I .
People like the penises that they personally have good experiences with .
Fallacy # 5 : It is important for a boy to look like his father .
Of all the fallacies , this one is the most confusing to me personally , probably because my dad is circumcised but I am not and neither are my three brothers - and nobody gives a rat’s .
I understand that making a different choice for your son than your parents made for you may tacitly imply some level of dissatisfaction with your own experience , and heaven knows the idea that a man ’s penis has been compromised is a bitter pill for him to swallow .
However , in the spirit of this blog , I submit to you this question : is it manlier to protect your ego or your newborn ?
I know lots of circumcised guys who are proud as can be of their penises but leave their sons intact .
In many other cases , the baby ’s mother would prefer the baby be left alone and it is the father who insists on the surgery , without having done any real research on the subject .
Be a man , do your homework and be rational .
Emotions are important , but when protecting your pride comes before your duty to protect your family , something is out of whack .

Counterpoint : Circumcision is a legitimate choice with few disadvantages and several advantages .
Written by : Jeff Trexler
I ’d like to start off by saying that I ’m not really pro-circumcision per se .
I would n’t try to convince someone who was n’t going to circumcise that they were making the wrong choice .
It ’s no skin off my , um , back .
What I would like to argue is that circumcising is in fact a perfectly legitimate choice .
This is a stance that many anti-circumcision advocates will simply not allow .
Take for example the following reader ’s comment made in reference to a recent article in Men ’s Health on the subject ( an article I highly recommend everyone read ) :
“ Subjecting non-consenting individuals to any amputation of any of their normal , healthy , living body parts grossly violates their unalienable human rights .
It constitutes crimes against humanity ; torture , mutilation , human vivisection .
Nazi doctors were convicted at Nuremberg after World War II of committing these crimes against humanity during the war . ”
The idea that circumcision constitutes a human rights violation is positively ridiculous .
I take the same stance that the American Academy of Pediatricians does : there are benefits and there are disadvantages to circumcision and everyone should do their research and come to the decision they feel is best for their child .
As for me , if I have a son , I plan on circumcising him .
And I do n’t think I should be put on trial at Nuremberg .
Here ’s why .
First let me address three of the points opponents make and then I will add my positive reasons :
Traumatic for the baby ?
Circumcision is undoubtedly no picnic in the sun .
But I do n’t think it ’s abject torture for the kid either .
Yes there are videos that string together shots of screaming babies as they undergo the procedure , but those are cherry picked and misleading .
Who knows when these pictures were taken ?
The videos often show the baby with its arms restrained crucifixion style - which is rarely done anymore .
And babies today are also routinely anesthetized before the procedure and given a sugar covered pacifier which helps mitigate the pain .
This does n’t mean that the procedure is painless , but it ’s not cruel and unusual punishment either .
My sister - in - law works as a neonatal nurse and has seen tons of circumcisions done ; she says that some babies sleep right through it .
Yes , some babies do scream and cry , but babies scream and cry even when they ’re not being touched at all .
Furthermore , there ’s no evidence to show that it permanently damages kids ’ psyches or causes any kind of psychological trauma when they grow up .
If that were true , you would think that babies who had true medical emergencies as newborns , the ones that were being stuck with needles , incubated , and cut open , would grow up to be insane .
The baby does n’t know why you ’re cutting him after all .
But alas , this simply is n’t the case .
So a little snip is not going to leave them emotionally scarred ; either way they do n’t remember it .
The baby does n’t have a choice !
So true !
And the baby sadly does n’t have a choice in who its parents are , where it ’s going to live , what it ’s going to be fed , what religion it will be raised in , where it will go to school , and on and on and on .
Parents make hundreds of choices for their children , many of which will have far greater effects on their life than circumcision will .
That ’s a parents job - to make decisions for their kids that they feel are in their best interest .
I understand that men can choose to be circumcised later in life , but it would be more traumatic then , a fully remembered event .
Best to snip it in the bud right away .
The sensitivity issue .
Perhaps the most fear - inducing argument the anti-circumcision people employ is the idea that a circumcised penis is not as sexually sensitive as its circumcised counterpart .
Yet no study has conclusively proven that to be true .
The American Academy of Pediatricians reports that in a self - reporting study , circumcised men enjoyed “ more varied sexual practice and less sexual dysfunction ” than their uncircumcised brothers .
And the APA calls reports of loss of sensitivity in circumcised men merely “ anecdotal . ”
Meanwhile a real study has shown the idea to be a myth .
The LA Times reports :
“ A recent controlled study published in the January issue of BJU International , the British Journal of Urology , looked at nearly 4,500 Ugandan men , ages 15 to 49 , who were all sexually experienced .
Researchers randomly selected half to undergo circumcision , and half to have a circumcision in 24 months .
They compared the two groups at six , 12 and 24 months to measure sexual satisfaction and performance .
The circumcised group ’s rate of sexual satisfaction remained constant , with 98.5 % reporting sexual satisfaction before circumcision , and 98.4 % reporting so two years after the procedure . ”
Men who are circumcised later in life do sometimes say that it takes more friction to get things going , but find their orgasms equally or sometimes even more intense .
And if you can keep the great orgasms while also lasting longer and pleasing your woman , is n’t that a good thing ?
I doubt a lot of women are wishing their men were more sensitive than they already are .
Anti-circumcision advocates also say that sex is less pleasurable for the women because the foreskin provides natural lubrication .
But again , such a theory is based on anecdotal evidence .
For every story you can find online of women preferring sex with an uncircumcised penis , you can find ones which favor the alternative .
( Warning !
This link contains graphic language and pictures ) .
Many women prefer the feeling of an circumcised penis ; women have said that having sex with a uncircumcised man feels as though he is having sex inside his own foreskin instead of inside of her .
And now for the pros :
Like Father , Like Son .
I ’m circumcised , and my son will be circumcised too .
My son should look like me in that way .
Some people , especially women it seems to me , dismiss this reason as baloney .
While it ’s true that my son will not see my member very often , if he does , I want them to look alike .
I ca n’t even explain why ; I just do .
Hygienic .
The inner layer of the foreskin has glands that create a substance called smegma , which the dictionary describes as a “ cheese - like substance . ”
Uncircumcised men must regularly lift and cleanse under their foreskin to prevent this build - up .
Sure , doing that is no big deal for adult men ( although knowing the cleanliness habits of my male friends , I ’m not sure it would always get done ) .
But for little boys and old men who do n’t realize the importance of hygiene or can no longer clean themselves respectively , the foreskin can be problematic .
It ’s not just a myth ; my grandfather , who lives in a nursing home , developed an infection in his nether regions because he did not clean under his kangaroo pocket .
And his is not an isolated case .
In fact , the reason that circumcision became the norm in this country can be traced to the experiences of our GI ’s during World War II .
145,000 soldiers who took part in the North African campaign were beset with foreskin related ailments , including “ balanoposthitis ( inflammation of the foreskin and glans ) , phimosis ( a foreskin that ’s too tight to retract over the glans ) , and paraphimosis ( a foreskin stuck in the retracted position ) . ”
( MH ) Whether or not you ’ll ever find yourself in the trenches , circumcision keeps a man ’s member nice and clean .
Which brings me to my next point :
The Ladies Love It .
I ’ve known a handful of women who have been with both uncircumcised and circumcised men , and they all preferred the latter , especially when it came the act of oral sex .
There ’s nothing erotic about anything that can be described as “ cheese - like . ”
Women like how a circumcised penis looks and they perceive it as cleaner .
My evidence for this claim is of course anecdotal , but scientific studies back it up as well .
Circumcision helps reduce disease .
Anti-circumcision advocates would have you believe that there are no bonafide medical reasons for being circumcised .
But such is not the case .
Lise Johnson M.D. the director of healthy - newborn nurseries at Boston ’s Brigham Women ’s Hospital said recently , “ The weight of scientific evidence might be shifting in favor or circumcision . ”
Here are the reasons backing up such a statement :
A study carried up by the National Institute of Health reports that circumcision can prevent a man ’s acquiring of HIV by up to 64 % .
( NIH )
Circumcised men have a reduced risk of contracting syphilis .
( APA )
Uncircumcised male infants have as much as a 10 times greater risk of getting a urinary tract infection than their snipped brethren do .
( APA )
Uncircumcised men have a 3 times greater risk of developing penile cancer .
( APA )
Circumcised penises reduce the rate of cervical cancer in women .
( BMC )
In conclusion , I truly believe that circumcision is a perfectly legitimate choice .
But I encourage you to do your own research and make the choice you feel is best .
As you do so , be careful when simply googling the subject .
Many of the sites that come up such as circumcision.org and cirp.org look to be straightforward information sites but are in fact heavily biased on the anti-side .
It ’s best to stick with looking at scientific studies and sources which do not have a preset agenda and bias .
Thanks Lee family and Jeff !
British teenagers have lower IQ scores than a generation ago , new study reveals
Middle - class teenagers are less intelligent than a generation ago due to the dumbing down of youth culture and school tests , a new study suggests .
IQ tests show that scores for the average 14 - year - old have dropped by more than two points between 1980 and 2008 .
For those in the upper half of the intelligence scale - a group typically dominated by the children of middle - class families - average IQ scores were six points down on 28 years ago .
The authority on IQ testing who conducted the study said the demands made on teenagers ' brainpower by today 's youth culture may be ' stagnating ' .
Brainpower drain : Teenagers use their leisure time to watch TV or play computer games instead of reading or conversing with others
Leisure time is increasingly taken up with playing computer games and watching TV instead of reading and holding conversations , he said .
Education experts said a growing tendency in schools to ' teach to the test ' was affecting youngsters ' ability to think laterally .
For the study , Professor James Flynn , of the University of Otago in New Zealand , analysed UK children 's scores in IQ tests over time .
He found that IQs increased among children aged between five and 10 over the 28 - year - period , at the rate of up to half a point a year .
He believes these gains are linked to changes to the home environment children experience when they are young , with parents increasingly providing stimulating activities .
But Professor Flynn also found that teenagers ' scores had dipped slightly over the past generation .
It is the first time IQ scores have fallen for any age group during the past century , his research suggests .
Professor Flynn discovered the ' Flynn effect ' which holds that IQ scores have been consistently rising , among all age groups and in most industrialised countries .
' It looks like there is something screwy among British teenagers , ' Professor Flynn told the Sunday Telegraph .
' While we have enriched the cognitive environment of children before their teenage years , the cognitive environment of the teenagers has not been enriched .
' Other studies have shown how pervasive teenage youth culture is , and what we see is parents ' influence on IQ slowly diminishing with age .
' Up until the age of nine and ten , the home has a really powerful influence , so we can assume parents have been providing their children with a more cognitive challenging environment in the past 30 years .
' After that age the children become more autonomous and they gravitate to peer groups that set the cognitive environment .
' What we know is that youth culture is more visually orientated around computer games than they are in terms of reading and holding conversations . '
He said previous studies have tended to show IQ increasing as teenagers move into adulthood , entering university or starting work .
Professor Flynn added that he believes the larger drop in IQ among the upper half of the ability range could be due to effects of social class .
He said : ' IQ gains are typically correlated by class , but the results in this case are very mixed .
Maybe the rebellious peer culture of the lower half of British society has invaded the peer culture of the upper half .
' It could be the classes in the upper half were insulated from this rebellious peer culture for a time , but now it is universal . '
IQ , or intelligence quotient , is normally expressed as a single numerical score , with 100 being the average .
Previous studies have claimed that using text messages and email can temporarily reduce IQ by causing concentration to drop , while smoking marijuana has also been linked with a decline in IQ .
Professor Flynn 's study , published in the journal of Economics and Human Biology , was conducted using a IQ test known as Raven 's Progressive Matrices , where questions involve matching a series of patterns and sequences , so that even people with no education can take the test .
Dr Richard House , a senior lecturer in therapeutic education at Roehampton University and a researcher into the effects of television on children , said : ' Taking these findings at face value , it appears that there is something happening to teenagers .
' Computer games and computer culture has led to a decrease in reading books .
The tendency for teachers to now ' teach to the test ' has also led to a decrease in the capacity to think in lateral ways . '
While parents have the right not to pay for your birth control , they do not have the right to keep you from obtaining it yourself or using it .
Audrey asks :
I
would appreciate a little light shed on my question , it puzzles me
greatly .
I asked a good while ago if I could start on Birth Control ,
and my father actually would n’t mind , in fact , he supports it .
My
stepmother , on the other hand , does n’t seem comfortable with it .
Despite the obvious discomfort , she said she ’d call her doctor and see
what she could do .
Days later , she told me they wo n’t take anyone under
18 . This confused me .
I know many teenagers on Birth Control .
I hope
she ’s not just saying that , although it would n’t be the first time she
did something rather similar to that .
At first I got the feeling that
she thought I would change if I was on the pill , like I was invincible
and I could never get pregnant , so I can have sex whenever I want .
The
thing is , I ’m not sexually active , I ’m a virgin .
I often get the
feeling she thinks I ’m a tramp .
I would NEVER think in that fashion .
So , my question to you , do you have to be a certain age to consult a
doctor about Birth Control ?
And although I ’m only 16 , would that be my
personal choice to take the pill ?
Or do they have a say in it until I’m
a legal adult ?
Heather replies :
While
some doctors may choose not to see children or adolescents in their
practice , period — because they just do n’t specialize in that group —
it sounds far more likely your stepmother was simply being dishonest
with you .

Abortion .

If her doctor was someone who chose only to see adults , he or she
most certainly would have given her a reference for you to see another
doctor .
You do not have to be a certain age to talk to a doctor about
anything at all , including about contraception .
You also do not have to
be a certain age to obtain methods of contraception from a doctor , and
the only place there would be age limitations would be for methods
which a doctor felt were not good choices for someone your age .
For
instance , Depo - Provera is n’t always a good choice for very young women
because of bone mass concerns .
IUDs often are n’t comfortable for women
who have not been pregnant before .
Most doctors will not approve
permanent sterilizations for young adults .
In addition , while a parent
certainly has the right and the ability not to pay for your birth
control they do not have the right to keep you from obtaining it
yourself or using it .
It ’s solely up to you , and in your control , as to
whether or not you acquire and use methods of contraception .
I do n’t know what the overall dynamic is like in your home beyond
this situation , but it sounds to me like this is something you should
talk to your stepmother herself or your father about .
If one or both of
them do not want you using birth control , you deserve a candid ,
forthright discussion about why , rather than to be manipulated or lied
to .
If one of them is supportive of you in this way and the other is
not , as co-parents , they need to work that out amongst themselves or
with you like grownups .
It seems like it might also be helpful to
address those ideas you think she has .
Ideally , she ’d have been the
adult here and done that with you , but you ’re becoming an adult , too ,
and can go ahead and take the wheel of that discussion if she has not .
If you do want to call this out , what I ’d suggest is just asking for
a family meeting , or for time to talk to whichever parent you want to
talk to .
I ’d calmly explain that you ’re aware that teens do not have to be 18
to obtain birth control , and that you feel you may have been deceived .
I ’d ask if that was the case , then ask why if your stepmother admits
she was not truthful .
I ’d also state that you feel like you have a
right to be communicated with honestly , and that if one or both of them
has an objection to you using birth control , or helping you get it , you
deserve to be part of a real discussion about that .
Again , be calm , and
be an active listener .
The high ground here is yours , so keep it .
Even
though either of them does have the right to prefer not being part of
getting you contraception , you still deserve the respect of just being
told that outright , and you still have the right to obtain it on your
own and know that ’s something you ’ll need to do for yourself if one or
both of them does n’t want to help or support you in it .
You might find
that this link
for parents about talking to teens in regard to contraception is
helpful for you , or may even be something you want to print out for
your family .
If that ’s not a conversation you want to have , or you do n’t want to
confront one or both of them on this , know that you can go see a sexual
healthcare provider on your own .
I do n’t know what country you ’re in ,
but in most areas , you can do that by either scheduling a visit with
your family doctor yourself ( you do n’t specifically need a gynecologist
for this : most general physicians provide pelvic exams , STI testing and
prescribe contraception ) , or by visiting a general or sexual healthcare
clinic , like Planned Parenthood here in the U.S. or Canada , or through
independent public clinics .
If you ’re not sure what ’s available in your
area , you can use your local phone directory to find out , or ask a
friend who she sees for her birth control and sexual healthcare .
However you get to a healthcare provider for contraception , you may
find it handy to inform yourself about methods in advance so that you
can have some idea of which might be best for you , and know what your
questions about any method may be so you can be sure to ask them .
So , have a look here for that information , and good luck in working this out .
This post is rather for the beginners in Cisco ’s world than for advance professionals , but still I encounter situation when IOS image was corrupted even if it was uploaded to the device by a network guru .
Why ?
It ’s quite simple !
Because you can be the master of the Cisco networking , but still sometime you cannot control the device behavior or the transport of the packets to destination .
The problems is that in case of a corrupted IOS image being uploaded on a Cisco device , and having that device reloaded you can run into situation when it will not boot up anymore .
When the device is in front of you , or on your desk , there is not a problem , because you can troubleshoot , find the issue ( e.g wrong or corrupted IOS image ) and solve it !
But , what if your device is at 5000 km distance , it is 3:00 AM and you have no professional help on that location ?!
That ’s one ugly situation and the reason for which I always insist to verify the IOS image after it is uploaded and ready to go into production .
For those of you who are dealing with this stuff everyday , this post may seem like a joke , but I bet that there are out there IT ’s which never check this stuff or they are beginners and do n’t know how to do it .
It ’s more simple that you may think it is , make you spend about 4 - 5 minutes for a full check , but can spare you for bigger problems in the future .
So , what are the 4 steps :
1. Check what Cisco device you have ( to know what IOS image you need )
2. Check what IOS image Cisco device has ( to know what IOS release to download )
3. Verify the IOS image
4 . Check the results of your verification
As simplest as it can get .
Please check the tutorial by clicking the image below :
For those who cannot see a Flash movie , please read this text file , that consist of the command you should perform for IOS checking .

I 've removed convertSnip .py from this release since most snippets should be converted by now ; if you still need it , just grab it from an earlier release .
snipMate.zip 0.79 2009-04-14 7.0 Michael Sanders
Added support for more than 9 tab stops , fixed typos in certain snippets , and cleaned up the code a bit .
snipMate.zip 0.78 2009-04-06 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed bug with aliased filetypes ( e.g. loading C snippets for Obj - C files ) , updating placeholders on separate lines , and extracting snippets on Windows .
Also added a few more Python , C , and Obj - C snippets , and fixed some typos in the Latex and C++ snippets .
snipMate.zip 0.77 2009-03-30 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed bug with single quotes ( ' ) in snippet triggers , and hyphenated global snippets ( e.g. , _- mysnips.snippets ) .

snipMate.zip 0.74 2009-03-26 7.0 Michael Sanders
This release completely eliminates command - based snippets in favor of a new , easier to read & maintain syntax .
A python script , convertSnip.py , has been included in this release to make it easier to migrate .
For more information , see :h snippet - syntax ; it 's not very complicated , so it should n't take too much time to understand .
This release also fixes a number of bugs , including : support for supertab , special characters in snippet variables , the popup - menu , and adds support for hyphened snippet folders ( e.g. snippets / c-snippets / for C ) .
snipMate.zip 0.73 2009-03-15 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed bug with redefinition of C++ snippets , fixed a bug when using the completion menu , added support for the ' shellslash ' option ( thanks Derek Wyatt ) , and added support for buffer - local snippets ( thanks Meikel Brandmeyer ) .

snipMate.zip 0.71 2009-03-09 7.0 Michael Sanders
First and foremost , the code has been significantly re-factored ; it is a bit longer now , but hopefully at the sake of being much easier to read and maintain .
This release also adds : support for file - based snippets , support for delimiters before snippet triggers ( e.g. , " bar.foo " could expand " foo " ) , and bug fixes .
snipMate.zip 0.6956 2009-02-25 7.0 Michael Sanders Forgot a backslash in the supertab.vim fix .
snipMate.zip 0.6955 2009-02-24 7.0 Michael Sanders Actually fixed the supertab bug ( thanks Asher VanBrunt ) ; also added some more Objective - C snippets , and fixed another bug with expanding snippets before text introduced in the previous version .
snipMate.zip 0.6954 2009-02-24 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed a bug when expanding snippets with text after them , and a bug with expanding evals ( `...` ) that prevented substitutions containing " \= " such as substitute ( ' foo ' , '.*' , ' \=toupper ( submatch (0 ) ) ' ) from working .
Also fixed another typo in the Python snippets , and supertab compatibility .
snipMate.zip 0.6942 2009-02-21 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed some typos in LaTeX and Python snippets , and added a snippet for the HTML 5 doctype .
Also added support for cycling through completions using supertab , and using completions to expand placeholder text .
The indentation amount for ' expandtab ' also now defaults to ' sw ' if ' sts ' is not set .
snipMate.zip 0.61803399 2009-02-16 7.0 Michael Sanders
I apparently forgot to update the " Snip ! " commands to " Snipp ! " in the last version ; this update takes care of that ( thanks Martin Krauskopf for the bug report ) .
The regex command to update these should actually be " : %s/exe \(.\) Snip \( \|!\) / exe \ 1Snipp\2 " .
This update also fixes a typo in the " def " ruby snippet ( thanks Reza Jelveh & Jan Andersson ) .
snipMate.zip 0.6180339 2009-02-15 7.0 Michael Sanders Added support for ' virtualedit=all ' and ' virtualedit=onemore ' .
Thanks Mikhail Daen for the bug report .
snipMate.zip 0.618033 2009-02-14 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed another bug concerning loading a filetype more than once .
snipMate.zip 0.61803 2009-02-13 7.0 Michael Sanders
Fixed some other bugs for compatibility with supertab.vim and ' set expandtab ' and added check to ensure snippets are not loaded twice .
I also changed the " Snip " command to " Snipp " to maintain compatibility with vimscript # 244 ( imaps.vim ) .
Unfortunately this breaks backward compatibility ; to update any snippets you have added , just execute this regex on the appropriate files : " : %s/exe \(.\)
Snip / exe \ 1Snipp / g "
From KATV :
Little Rock [ Oklahoma ] -
A legislative committee is expected to debate a bill next week that would remove the statute of limitations on rape and first - degree sexual assault .
This change is needed and long overdue .
DNA evidence is one reason for this change .
Because of backlog issues related to processing forensic evidence , the longer statute of limitations when there is DNA evidence still can allow rapists who can be identified through DNA to escape justice after the statute of limitations for rape cases without DNA evidence .
For an example of how rapists who have been IDed via DNA have escaped justice under complex statute of limitations , read my post about the LA rape kit backlog .
Another reason to eliminate the statute of limitations is that many serial rapists will be treated like a serial rapist only if there is no statute of limitations for rape .
This can and does impact sentencing and the decisions made by parole boards .
The responsibility for proving guilt falls on the prosecution so arguments that innocent defendants will be victimized by eliminating the statute of limitations is false .
Despite this indisputable fact , there are men's rights advocates who oppose this change because as Glenn Sacks wrote in Men 's News Daily , " While the goal of convicting more actual rapists is laudable , this is yet another proposed change in the law of rape that does not take into account the unjust effect on innocent men and boys . " [ correction this quote was written by Pierce Harlan , Esq. in Glenn Sacks ' MND blog which indicates that Sacks approves of this statement ]
Notice the prioritization .
Catching rapists is laudable , protecting all men accused of rape who have n't been convicted before the current statute of limitations expire , is imperative .
People like Glenn Sacks would be screaming if those he opposes on this issue mirrored his own views by writing , " While the goal of protecting innocent men accused of rape is laudable , this is yet another law that does not take into account the unjust effect on innocent rape victims . "
He would acknowledge what the use of " laudable " really means .
Glenn Sacks and his ilk put the desires of men who fear being accused ( wrongfully of course ) above the rights of those who were raped .
They support guaranteed injustice in the name of protecting men from possible injustice .
If you live in Oklahoma please contact your state legislators to voice your support for this bill .
Without feedback from voters many legislators will assume that nobody cares about this issue .
There are 2 other bills under consideration in Oklahoma related to victim rights .
SB 894 will allow a rape victim to have immediate access to medical care without pursuing legal charges against her attacker .
At this time , a nurse or other medical professional is required to contact local law enforcement at the time a victim seeks medical attention .
[...]
[ Senate President Pro Tem Glenn ]
Coffee will also offer SB 932 , allowing those who have sought protection from an emergency Victim ’s Protective Order to obtain an emergency concealed carry license for their protection .
Both of these bills are worthy of support .
The concealed carry bill will help victims who do n't choose to carry a gun since the possibility that they have a gun may serve as a deterrent for some violent people .

Fernando Ocegueda has n’t seen his son since gunmen dragged the college student from the family ’s house three years ago .
Alma Diaz wonders what happened to her son , Eric , a Mexicali police officer who left a party in 1995 and never returned .
Arturo Davila still pounds on police doors looking for answers 11 years after his daughter and a girlfriend were kidnapped in downtown Ensenada .
For the hundreds , perhaps thousands , of families of people who have vanished amid Baja California ’s drug wars , the search for justice has been lonely and fruitless .
But their hopes have been buoyed recently by the Jan. 22 arrest of a man Mexican authorities believe is behind the gruesome disposal of bodies in vats of industrial chemicals .
Santiago Meza Lopez , a stocky 45 - year - old taken into custody after a raid near Ensenada , was identified as the pozolero who liquefied the bodies of victims for lieutenants of the Arellano Felix drug cartel .
Authorities say he laid claim to stuffing 300 bodies into barrels of lye , then dumping some of the liquefied remains in a pit in a hillside compound in eastern Tijuana .
His capture riveted Mexico with sickening details behind drug violence that has left more than 8,000 dead in two years .
For the families of the disappeared , however , it was a chance to revive cases that seemed long forgotten .
A day after Meza ’s arrest , Ocegueda and 40 other people showed up at the federal attorney general ’s office in Tijuana , with family snapshots in hand , demanding that authorities query Meza about whether he recalled dissolving their missing loved ones .
In the following days , dozens more people came forward with tales of disappearances .
“ Please help me find out what happened to him , ” wrote one woman on a photograph of a young man smiling in a car .
“ He was my husband . ”
Victim rights groups estimate that there are more than 1,000 people missing in Baja California , including students , businessmen , merchants and cops .
Their cases have been ignored , bungled or blocked by law enforcement officials , activists say .
As a potential cartel insider , Meza could peel back the mysteries surrounding the disappearances , they say .
Ocegueda , president of the Citizens United Against Impunity , plans to visit Mexico City this week , where he will request a personal audience with Meza .
Authorities are unlikely to grant access to the suspect , but families hope they ’ll follow through on their promise to confront him with the photos .
His capture has provided their greatest leverage against a government that for years has paid little attention to their concerns , said Ocegueda and other group leaders .
“ The government wants to silence what can not be silenced . . . but they did n’t count on someone saying that he personally disintegrated 300 bodies , ” said Cristina Palacios Hodoyan , whose son , Alejandro , disappeared in 1997 .
“ They ’re going to have to pay attention to us now . ”
Federal authorities have told the local media that they are cooperating with the families , having met with them and taken more than 100 photos .
The hillside compound where Meza told authorities he labored lies in an area acquainted with death .
There are two cemeteries tucked in the surrounding hills , and funeral processions pass by daily on potholed Ojo de Agua road .
Behind the white gate , Meza said , he would fill a barrel with water and two large bags of lye .
Wearing gloves and protective goggles , he ’d light a fire underneath , and bring the liquid to a boil before depositing a body .
After 24 hours , he would dump the disintegrated remains in a pit and set them aflame .
In Tijuana , the process is known as making pozole .
That ’s because the pink liquid in the barrel resembles the popular Mexican stew .
When a Mexican official asked Meza what he did for a living , he replied , “ Me llaman el Pozolero ” :
They call me the Pozole Maker .
He earned $ 600 weekly and said he learned how to disintegrate bodies by first experimenting with pig legs , according to the Mexican federal attorney general ’s office .
Meza allegedly told authorities he worked for several top cartel lieutenants over a 10 - year period , most recently for Teodoro Garcia Simental , whom authorities believe is behind the kidnappings of hundreds of people in recent years .
Meza ’s alleged deeds apparently went unnoticed in the shabby area of ranches and pig and chicken farms .
Several neighbors said they had never seen him , and were n’t curious .
“ It ’s best to be ignorant of such diabolical things , ” said a local pig farmer , who did not want to be identified because he feared for his safety .
Ocegueda , a slender , intense man with a chain - smoking habit , vows to shatter that ignorance .
After his 23 - year - old son , Fernando , was kidnapped , authorities did little , so Ocegueda investigated on his own .
He donned dirty clothes and a hooded shirt and rode a wobbly bike in tough neighborhoods , chatting up drug dealers and other criminals .
These days he leads demonstrations , camps out at City Hall , and corners military and government officials any chance he gets .
After Meza ’s arrest he went to the San Diego area to meet with 20 families who gave him photographs of loved ones , some of them U.S. citizens , who vanished while going to work or visiting relatives in Mexico .
Ocegueda believes he knows the identities of his son ’s kidnappers .
But his probe , like others , hit a dead end .
He believes police protect organized crime members , fear investigations will reveal their own complicity , or are incompetent .
Some families have been threatened by police after reporting the crimes .
In one case , a man who reported the abduction of his family was kidnapped himself the next day , said Ocegueda , whose claims are supported by many families and a Mexicali - based group , the Hope Assn. Against Kidnapping and Impunity .
“ Authorities have told people not to report anything , saying their loved ones were criminals .
. . .
Instead of helping resolve their cases , they threaten them , ” said Miguel Garcia , a Mexicali - based attorney who provides legal advice to the Hope Assn .
Last year , the groups gained a key ally when the then - top military commander in the region , Gen. Sergio Aponte Polito , accused several state law enforcement officials of links to organized crime .
Among them , he said , was the head of the state anti-kidnapping squad in Tijuana .
Aponte was removed from his post in August , and most of the state officials he accused have not been prosecuted .
Last week at Meza ’s compound , federal agents continued digging up soil samples looking for human remains .
Experts and law enforcement say chances are slim they will be able to identify any of them .
Salvador Ortiz Morales , the state deputy attorney general in Tijuana , said forensic teams have never been able to identify victims dissolved in barrels because so little remains .
The site may not yield answers for another reason .
Meza admitted disintegrating bodies over a 10 - year period , but neighbors said the compound was constructed only six months ago .
All the more reason , the families say , to pressure Meza to disclose other grave sites , and demand other details on the fate of the missing .
“ There are many other families suffering like me , ” Ocegueda said .
“ We need to find out what he knows . ”

What they are escaping is a broken country where half the people are going hungry , most schools and hospitals are closed or dysfunctional and a cholera epidemic has taken a toll in the thousands .
Yet they are arriving in a place where they are unwelcome and are resented as rivals for jobs .
Last year , Zimbabweans were part of the quarry in a spate of mob attacks against foreigners .
For those in the know , crossing the border can be a simple chore , a bribe paid on one side and a second bribe on the other .
But for the uninitiated and the destitute , the journey is as uncertain as the undercurrents of the Limpopo and the appetites of the crocodiles .
Where is it best to enter the river ?
Where are the holes in the barbed fences beyond ?
Where do the soldiers patrol ?
Perhaps the greatest risk is the gumagumas  the swindlers , thieves and rapists who stalk the vulnerable as they wander in the bush .
Williad Fire , 16 , who arrived here on Jan. 4 , is one of nine boys who came from Murimuka , a town in a mining region of central Zimbabwe .
His story is a fairly typical one of serial catastrophe .
He was living with an uncle after his parents died , but then the uncle died , too , stricken in November with an illness that Williad described with a mystified shrug : “ He was vomiting blood . ”

The boy was hungry , and scrounging in South Africa seemed to hold more promise than scrounging at home .
To get train fare south , he sold his most valuable possession , a secondhand pair of Puma sneakers two sizes too big .
He and eight friends then did odd jobs in Beitbridge , on the Zimbabwean side of the border , until they had saved about $ 35 .
about this card
Let 's all imagine , for the sake of the argument , that it 's Christmas eve .
What 's a good Christmas movie ?
I mean , apart from Diehard ?
( This description has nothing to do with the card .
Rules are for squares , baby ) .
Mostly about programming , mostly in Python .
Yes , yes , finally a Ruby VM that fits in your backpocket , it ’s there , it ’s here .
I mean , yay !
It all started 2 weeks ago .
I was stocked by Potion and had been studying Lua and other VMs for a little while .
So I dove in and hacked a little Ruby VM with bytecode and all .
It 's Tiny Because There 's Not A Lot in There
The primary goal is to keep it small .
This way , lots of people can understand it and change it quickly .
My objective is to keep the VM ( the C part ) under 64 K .
Right now , it ’s 43 K and 1541 LOC .
Not sure it ’s possible , but I ’ll take this as a challenge .
But , some very basic things are missing : no Float , no Module , no Proc or Bloc , no Array , Hash , IO , basically , almost nothing .
But most of the keywords and core objects are there : Class , Object , Fixnum , Symbol , String , def , class , if , unless , while , until , etc .
The lexer is written in Ragel and the parser in Lemon .
I wish to support the commonly used stuff in Ruby but give up on the dark corners or things that are too complex .
Right now the grammar is just 100 LOC , that ’s nice .
The rule is :
Everything in tinyrb should run in the big Ruby .
( except bugs and things that do n’t comply to the principle of least surprise . )
But not everything in the big Ruby should run in tinyrb .
It 's Kinda Fast , For Now At Least
I implemented a couple optimizations already , Monomorphic method cache is there , means method lookup is cached at the call site .
Also , as a test , I inline 3 methods , Fixnum # + , Fixnum #- , Fixnum # < , which makes a pretty big difference .
The interpreter loop uses direct threaded dispatch when available and falls back to while - switch for portability .
Of course , I ran a couple micro-benchmarks .
Now you know what they say about benchmarks ?
So take those with a grain of salt .
But I think it just shows that a “ fast ” interpreter does n’t need to be huge , at least …
UPDATE well of course I did something wrong here , I forgot to run jruby w/ the - server option .
So please consider this benchmark completely false and useless .

Hacking tinyrb 101
To compile it :
git clone git://github.com/macournoyer/tinyrb.git cd tinyrb make make test # optional
This should produce a nice tinyrb file .
You can use tinyrb like you usually do with ruby , see the -h option for usage ..
./ tinyrb -e " puts 1 " ./ tinyrb test/loop.rb
You can see the generated bytecode using the -d option and you ’ll get something like that :
; block definition : 0x6cf78 ( level 0 ) ; 2 registers ; 1 nested blocks ; 0 args .value fib ; 0 .value 34 ; 1 [ 000 ] def 0 0 0 ; fib => 0x6cf20 [ 001 ] self 0 0 0 [ 002 ] loadk 2 0 1 ; R [ 2 ] = 34 [ 003 ] boing 0 0 0 [ 004 ] lookup 0 0 0 ; R[ 1 ] = R [ 0 ] . method ( : fib ) [ 005 ] call 0 1 0 ; R[ 0 ] = R [ 0 ] .
R[ 1 ] ( 1 ) [ 006 ] return 0 0 0 ; block end
I ’ll talk more about the bytecode later .

FRESNO , Calif . —
As the operations manager of an outreach center for the homeless here , Paul Stack is used to seeing people down on their luck .
What he had never seen before was people living in tents and lean - tos on the railroad lot across from the center .
“ They just popped up about 18 months ago , ” Mr. Stack said .
“ One day it was empty .
The next day , there were people living there . ”
Like a dozen or so other cities across the nation , Fresno is dealing with an unhappy déjà vu : the arrival of modern - day Hoovervilles , illegal encampments of homeless people that are reminiscent , on a far smaller scale , of Depression - era shantytowns .
At his news conference on Tuesday night , President Obama was asked directly about the tent cities and responded by saying that it was “ not acceptable for children and families to be without a roof over their heads in a country as wealthy as ours . ”
While encampments and street living have always been a part of the landscape in big cities like Los Angeles and New York , these new tent cities have taken root — or grown from smaller enclaves of the homeless as more people lose jobs and housing — in such disparate places as Nashville , Olympia , Wash . , and St. Petersburg , Fla .
India has endorsed an ambitious £ 1.7bn plan to launch its first astronauts into space by 2015 , a move seen by many as an attempt to catch up with its bigger neighbour , China , in an emerging Asian space race .
The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) proposes to put two people into orbit 171 miles above the Earth for seven days – a plan that has been endorsed by the country 's top economic policymaking body , the Planning Commission .
" Isro has done an expert job and it needs to be supported , " said Montek Singh Ahluwalia , deputy chairman of the Planning Commission .
The Human Space Flight project is to have two phases : an unmanned flight launched in 2013 - 2014 and a manned mission the following year .
The Indian cabinet still has to approve the plan but S Satish , a spokesman for Isro , said the support of the Planning Commission " was a major step forward " .
If the country succeeded , it would become only the fourth – after the US , Russia and China – to send a man into space .
But India is not the only Asian country in the new space race – Iran recently announced that it will attempt a manned space flight by 2021 .
There is little doubt about India 's sense of purpose .
Earlier this month , Isro's chairman , Madhavan Nair , unveiled blueprints at an international aeronautical show in Bangalore for the three - tonne space capsule , which would have enough room for a three - person crew .
India is also setting up a training centre for astronauts in the south of the country – and demonstrated it could launch and recover a space capsule that splashed down in the Bay of Bengal in January 2007 .
The new mission will not be entirely homegrown .
Moscow will help to build the astronaut capsule and select and train the astronauts .
An Indian astronaut will also get a " trial run " abroad a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2013 .
They will be the second Indian in space after Rakesh Sharma , who was part of a joint space programme between India and Russia in 1984 .
Analysts have also warned India that it would need to initiate a review of its space programmes , which are primarily civilian in nature , given " the military character and military functions " of China 's space programme .
Richard Fischer
Jr , a senior fellow at Washington 's International Assessment and Strategy Centre , told an audience last week in Delhi that India needed to develop new technologies to counter China 's growing space power .
The decision to send astronauts into space follows the successful launch last October of India 's first unmanned lunar mission , Chandrayaan - 1 , which signalled entry into an elite club of nations that have reached the moon .
However , some experts have criticised the move , saying space agencies in wealthier parts of the world have eschewed putting man into space .
Gopal Raj , author of Reach for the Stars , a book about the country 's rocket programme , said : " This smacks of Isro looking to keep up with China .
It 's becoming a national prestige issue .
I am not sure what you get from astronauts in space .
Even the Europeans , who are much richer , have not got manned space flight programmes . "
However , Isro says such talk underestimates India 's final goals .
" We are not doing this because of China [ which launched astronauts into space in 2003 ] .
We want to get beyond the moon , which we see as just an intermediate base in the future .
For this , you need humans ; robots will not be enough . "
Others have warned that Isro's budget is expanding at a time when the country faces both an economic slowdown and widespread poverty .
An estimated 40 % of the world 's severely malnourished children live in India , and more than 800 million people live on half a dollar a day in the country .
Isro 's budget last week was boosted by 27 % to 44.6 bn rupees ( £ 611 m ) – excluding the £ 1.7bn cost of the manned spacecraft programme .
" India has major issues regarding education , health [ and ] rural sanitation , and these struggle to get funds , " said the columnist Praful Bidwai .
" Yet here we are , funding a giant national ego trip when people do not have latrines .
It 's monstrous ...
If the aim is to promote science , why not invest in climate change technologies ? "
A MAN sought by the UK authorities for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice by sending a controversial DVD to a judge and jury foreman during a trial relating to bomb attacks in London in July 2005 has appeared before the High Court after being arrested in Co Meath .
Sheffield - born Anthony John Hill ( 60 ) was arrested by gardaí at his home in Carrick Street , Kells , early yesterday morning on foot of a European Arrest Warrant , Mr Justice John MacMenamin was told .
Mr Hill ’s extradition is being sought in relation to his alleged actions during the trial of several people on conspiracy charges related to the attacks on July 7th , 2005 , that took place on the London underground and a London bus .
It is alleged that , in May and June 2008 , Mr Hill sent several copies of a DVD entitled 7/7 Ripple Effectto the judge and the foreman of a jury at the trial at Kingston Crown Court of people allegedly involved in assisting the 2005 bombings .
7/7 Ripple Effectis a film , available on the internet , which claims people accused of involvement in the bombings are innocent and that the bombings were an “ inside job ” , perhaps involving state intelligence agencies in either Britain or Israel .
The British authorities claim copies of the DVD were sent , in packaging with Irish postal marks , between September 2007 and December 2007 to five relatives of people who had been killed during the bombing .
In court yesterday , Sgt Seán Fallon said that when arrested at his Kells home at 8.14 am , Mr Hill , when asked about the DVD , had said : “ I sent it .
I believe those men to be innocent . ”
Sgt Fallon said Mr Hill had said that a friend of his had made the DVDs and that copies were made on his computer .
Gardaí took possession of computers at Mr Hill ’s home yesterday and will apply to the court to send those computers to the British authorities .
The matter was adjourned by Mr Justice MacMenamin to February 18th and Mr Hill was remanded in custody .
In today ’s mad world , underpaid workers are bailing out banks and corporations run by overpaid , undertaxed bosses who milked their companies and our country like cash cows .
While workers across America were losing jobs , homes and health insurance , Merrill Lynch paid nearly 700 employees more than $ 1 million each in bonuses last year , amounting to a $ 3.6 billion bonus bonanza while Merrill lost $ 27 billion .
Workers have been sacrificing for years .
Average worker paychecks are worth less now than in 1973 , but CEOs and other rich Americans not only make much more , they pay less in taxes .
Average full - time workers made $ 41,198 in 1973 and $ 37,606 in 2008 , adjusted for inflation .
CEOs made 45 times as much as workers in 1973 and more than 300 times as much as workers now .
The top tax rate was 70 % in 1973 and just 35 % now ; taxpayers pay the top rate on the portion of taxable income that falls within the highest bracket and pay lower rates on income below that .
The top rate for capital gains on the sale of stock and other assets was 36.5 % in 1973 and 15 % now .
Irrational pay and tax cuts have generated a massive redistribution of income and wealth from workers to CEOs , hedge fund managers and others in the richest 1 % .
By 2006 , the richest 1 % had increased their share of the nation ’s income to the second - highest level on record .
The only year higher was 1928 — on the eve of the Great Depression .
According to the latest IRS data , excluding tax - exempt interest income from state and local government bonds , the richest 400 taxpayers had an average adjusted gross income of $ 263 million each on their federal income tax returns in 2006 — up from $ 221 million in 2005 and $ 67 million in 1992 , adjusted for inflation .
Remember , that ’s annual income , not accumulated wealth .
$ 263 million comes to more than $ 5 million a week .
In 2006 , the 400 ultrarich were taxed at an average rate of 17 % — down from 26 % in 1992 .
The ultrarich get most of their income from capital gains .
The capital gains tax was cut from 28 % in 1992 to 20 % in 1997 and cut again to 15 % in 2003 .
To make matters worse , the rich cheat more on their taxes .
Forbes recently reported on a study using IRS data showing that taxpayers with income between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million a year understated their adjusted gross incomes by 21 % in 2001 , compared to 8 % for those earning $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 , and lower rates for those earning less .
We should raise taxes at the top so the nation ’s richest bosses no longer pay lower effective rates than workers and we can start reversing the obscene rise in inequality rather than reinforcing it .
President Obama ’s plan to cap CEO cash pay at $ 500,000 for senior executives at companies on the government dole sounds better than it is , affecting few firms and full of loopholes .
At the very least , President Obama should not delay restoring the top tax rate to the 39.6 % rate that prevailed in 2000 .
The Bush tax cuts saved the top 1 % nearly half a trillion dollars between 2001 and 2008 , reports Citizens for Tax Justice .
The $ 79.5 billion in tax cuts for the top 1 % in 2008 was more than the budgets of the Department of Education and Environmental Protection Agency combined .
In 2008 , it took an annual income greater than $ 462,000 just to get into the top 1 percent .
Even better , we should add a top rate of 50 % on income above $ 1 million , as advocated by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings among others .
People for whom $ 1 million and above is an annual paycheck should pay more so people for whom $ 1 million is an unattainable lifetime fortune do n’t have to .
If we do n’t start taxing the wealthy more now , then you can be sure that the mountain of debt created by tax cuts and the bailout will be used to drive “ entitlement reform . ”
Workers ’ last forms of security — Social Security and Medicare — will be on the chopping block to pay for the wreck the truly entitled made of our economy .
Bake on the Run Location : Piknik Park – 1122 SE Tacoma Bake on the Run The Story : Do you know where Guyana is ?
Did you know Portland has an authentic Guyanese food cart ?
Most do n’t , but when you visit Bake on the Run at Piknik Park in Sellwood , owner and chef Michael Singh will use hand gestures to describe the country ’s location sandwiched between Venezuela and Suriname and north of Brazil .
A pretty cool description to get you in the mood for some authentic Guyanese cuisine .
Michael and his mother Bibi are the team behind Bake on the Run .
I had the pleasure of meeting them awhile ago on one of my food cart tours while they were visiting Portland to see how we do it .
Even then , I was intrigued to hear about the different dishes they were planning to offer , so when I discovered they opened the cart , I ventured south .
Guyana has a number of culinary and cultural influences going back centuries ranging from Portuguese to Chinese and those influences are showcased in the dishes Mike and Bibi offer .
On the menu you ’ll find Bibi ’s Chow Mein , noodles in teriyaki and soy mixed with veggies and chicken .
Egg and Baclhau Bake from Bake on the Run I was intrigued by the the namesake dish , the bake .
A lightly fried bread which I can only describe as a modded puffed pastry , but less sweet is filled with your choice of items .
I chose the Portuguese salted cod omelette .
While we think of omelettes for breakfast , placing it in the bake was perfect for lunch .
The mix of fried bread and the salty cod was divine and to top if off , Michael proffered some of his homemade spicy sauce which gave the dish the perfect amount of kick .
You can also get the bake with a chickpea and potato curry or go sweet with jam and Nutella .
Portland ’s food cart scene continues to evolve and I ’m happy to report that new vendors like Bake on the Run are here to feed a new generation of eaters .
You can find Bake on the Run ’s authentic Guyanese cuisine at Piknik Park Food Cart Pod in Sellwood off Tacoma .
They are open daily for lunch and offer covered and heated seating and a beer cart .
When you visit , say hi to Mike and Bibi and let them know Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Flew The Coop Location : NE 60th and Halsey , The Barley Pod
Hours : see updated hours via website The Story : There ’s a new pod in town .
Baerlic Brewing opened up a taproom and food cart lot in NE Portland and brought in eight food carts .
One of those vendors , Flew The Coop , is bringing southern fried chicken to Rose City Park .
Fried chicken sandwiches have become ubiquitous throughout the Portland food scene with both restaurants and food carts putting out tasty little gems .
I was first introduced to the southern style hot chicken more than a few years ago when a native of Memphis moved to town .
I had n’t really explored the southern fried chicken nor the simple fried chicken world other than buckets of KFC at school potlucks as a child .
So many options and so many flavors and styles .
Portland , be proud of the options you have .
Flew The Coop offers up five different southern fried chicken sandwiches .
The KFC is n’t what you think , just a play on words .
Korean Fried Chicken tossed in a sweet & spicy Korean chili sauce , topped with pickled daikon , pickled carrot , sesame seeds , & slaw .
Or you can get a traditional fried chicken or even Buffalo chicken .
I opted for the Nashville Hot .
There is something going on in Memphis and Nashville and Buffalo where hot sauce and chicken just simply fall into place .
The Nashville was spot on .
Spicy as F , yet with a creamy coleslaw to calm the tastebuds and pickles on the bottom .
I love that mix .
The first bite , your tongue gets vinegar and then spice and then the cool of the slaw .
Flew The Coop is now open at the The Barley Pod which offers an indoor taproom by Baerlic Beer and outdoor covered seating .
A welcoming place to enjoy lunch or dinner with friends and family .
Next time you ’re in the neighborhood , stop on by and let them know Food Carts Portland sent ya .

Pioneer Courthouse Square Food Cart Lot Portland ’s living room now has permanent food carts .
As part of the year long renovation of the park in 2016 - 17 , the city decided to create a more active space for street food vendors and attract some rock stars .
Prior to the construction , the carts at the square were open - air and had to move any time the square was used for large events .
In the new model , three full size food carts have been placed up by Broadway with a fourth vendor ( an original ) is parked down off Yamhill where they ’ve been for years .
The new vendors are some of Portland ’s most famous and well known – Burger Stevens – opened in Hillsdale a few years ago , this cart brought back the simple cheeseburger and does it well .
Get it with two patties event and you ’re still getting a deal at $ 9 for all the fixin’s .
The Whole Bowl – After more than a decade and eight locations , including two restaurants and outposts in Cinicnatti , The Whole Bowl is now bringing their signature dish to the square .
Just the one bowl has made them famous world wide .
Fried Egg I ’m
In Love – Fried egg sandwiches were never the same in Portland once Fried Egg I ’m In Love opened a few years back on SE Hawthorne .
The Yolko Ono says it all – Fried egg , homemade pesto , parmesan , and a hand - pressed house sausage patty .
Steak ’s Fifth Avenue – aka Philly Cheesesteaks and Burgers –
The last of the original vendors who returned after construction has been around more than a decade feeding Portland some of the best Philly Cheesesteaks in downtown .
According to sources , more vendors are in store , but I kinda like the look and feel of the four currently there along with the large covered seating area above the KGW studios .
Come summer , I hope these guys can handle the masses .
Pioneer Courthouse Square is located in the center of downtown Portland at the cross streets of SW Broadway , Yamhill , 6th Ave and Morrison .

The Navy is hoping the stimulus bill will pay for more missiles , and fighter jets , and torpedoes .
The gazillion dollar economic aid package , making its way through Congress , puts a premium on projects that can generate jobs , ASAP .
So the Pentagon has given " some suggestions in terms of military hospitals , clinics , barracks , some child - care centers and things like that , where we think the work could begin right away or is already under way and could be accelerated , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates told senators the other day .
But an internal Navy memo , obtained by InsideDefense.com ace Chris Castelli , goes farther than these mom-and - apple - pie construction projects .
Instead , the Navy suggests , what about some ...
* Tomahawk cruise missiles , MK - 48
torpedoes or SM - 2 air defense missiles ; warfighting equipment such as small boats , riverine and coastal warfare craft , and sonobouys ; ship construction of DDG - 51 destroyers or Littoral Combat Ships ; aircraft construction of F / A - 18 strike fighters , E / A - 18 electronic warfare aircraft or E - 2 surveillance aircraft ; vital support equipment such as that for communication network security ; military construction to build needed facilities , reduce the footprint of existing facilities , and modernize ; research and development ( including science and technology )
to identify new innovations ; and short - term personnel programs to build critical skills and improve manning in junior technical ranks . *
Which sounds a lot more like the Navy 's typical shopping list , than an attempt to get Americans working in a hurry .
Not surprising .
But lame .
Meanwhile , Taxpayers for Common Sense finds an extra billion in the stimulus bill for nuclear stockpile watchers at the Department of Energy 's National
Nuclear Security Administration .
Plus , there 's another $ 200 million for the oft - troubled effort to build a high - tech fence along the Mexican border .
" DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano at her nomination hearing this month criticized the fence , which has already doubled in cost since construction began , " the good - government group notes .
" Considering the controversy around increased spending on the weapons complex and border fence , these passages of the legislation should raise some flags over its shovel - readiness . "
Here 's my question to y'all : Should defense projects even be considered part of the stimulus package ?
Obviously , some of them do generate jobs .
But with the Pentagon already gobbling up more than $ 600
billion a year , has n't the military - industrial complex had more than its fill ?
Talk it over , in the comments .
UPDATE : " Weapons procurement should no longer be charity , " writes Jim Arkedis .
When choosing which weapons systems to buy , relevancy must remain the guiding principle , not economics ...
Where they ’re useful and relevant to ongoing and future missions of the United States military , fund them .
But this economic crisis is tough on everyone , the government included , and the Obama administration should risk the urge to be all things to all people , even if a few votes are lost .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict rehabilitated on Saturday a traditionalist bishop who denies the Holocaust , despite warnings from Jewish leaders that it would seriously harm Catholic - Jewish relations and foment anti-Semitism .
The Vatican said the pope issued a decree lifting the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops who were thrown out of the Roman Catholic Church in 1988 for being ordained without Vatican permission .
The four bishops lead the ultra - conservative Society of Saint Pius X ( SSPX ) , which has about 600,000 members and rejected modernizations of Roman Catholic worship and doctrine .
The Vatican said the excommunications were lifted after the bishops affirmed their willingness to accept Church teachings and papal authority .
In healing a 20 - year - old schism that had wounded the Catholic Church , the decree looks set to spark one of the most serious crises in Catholic - Jewish relations in 50 years .
“ We have no intention of interfering in the internal workings of the Catholic Church , however , the eagerness to bring a Holocaust denier back into the Church will cast a shadow on relations between Jews and the Catholic Church , ” Israel ’s ambassador to the Vatican Mordechai Lewy , told Reuters .
One of the four bishops , the British - born Richard Williamson , has made a number of statements denying the full extent of the Nazi Holocaust of European Jews , as accepted by mainstream historians .
In comments to Swedish television broadcast on Wednesday , he said “ I believe there were no gas chambers ” and only up to 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps , instead of 6 million .
Williamson said : “ I believe that the historical evidence is hugely against 6 million having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler . ”
Pope Benedict XVI waves at the end of his Wednesday general audience in the Paul VI hall at the Vatican in this recent photo from January 21 , 2009 .

Israel - based Rabbi David Rosen , head of inter-religious affairs for the American Jewish Committee , told Reuters : .
“ The late Pope John Paul II called anti-Semitism a sin against God and man .
The denial of the overwhelmingly detailed documentation of the Shoah is anti-Semitism at its most blatant .
“ In welcoming an open Holocaust denier into the Catholic Church without any recantation on his part , the Vatican has made a mockery of John Paul II ’s moving and impressive repudiation and condemnation of anti-Semitism , ” he said .
VATICAN DEFENDS DECREE
Asked about Williamson ’s comments , chief Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said they were “ totally extraneous ” to the lifting of the excommunications .
“ This act regards the lifting of the excommunications , period , ” Lombardi told reporters .
“ It has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree . ”
Elan Steinberg , vice president of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants , told Reuters : “ At a time when the Vatican should have sided with the victims it acted instead to desecrate their memory .
“ This was an act of moral debasement unworthy of a moral institution .
For this Vatican political expediency trumps ethical and human considerations , ” he said .
Catholic - Jewish relations were already severely strained over the figure of wartime Pope Pius XII , who Jews have accused of turning a blind eye to the Holocaust .
Jews have asked the Vatican , which denies the charges , to freeze the procedure that can lead to his sainthood pending more study of wartime records .
Pope Benedict has already made several gestures of reconciliation to the schismatic group , including allowing the unconditional return of the old - style Latin Mass .
That move also angered Jews because the ceremony includes a Good Friday prayer for their conversion .

The lure of eternal youth has produced a multibillion - dollar - a - year global marketplace full of potions and pills that , the manufacturers claim , can offer life - extending benefits .
Amid the dizzying array , one substance is capturing prime time attention : resveratrol .
Resveratrol advertisements - Reverse your biological clock !
A miracle molecule ! - are popping up everywhere , from the Internet to local health food stores .
The stuff is even showing up in anti-wrinkle creams .
Ever since Harvard University molecular geneticist David Sinclair announced in 2003 that resveratrol appeared to dramatically extend the life span of yeast and fruit flies , the race was on to prove it worked in people .
Six years later , scientists have yet to demonstrate the substance can extend the life of creatures bigger than a mouse .
But that has n't slowed the resveratrol rage or claims by some manufacturers that they have captured the secret to long life in a capsule .
Resveratrol , a compound found in grape skins and red wine , is the most requested type of anti-aging product at the Vitamin Shoppe in Harvard Square .
" We have about seven different company brands , " said assistant store manager Koudjo Ala .
Most of the requests , he said , come from middle - agers who have " done a lot of research on it and they know exactly what they want . "
At Good Health Natural Foods in Hanover , new resveratrol items are " 100 times more popular " than the long - sold products with red wine extracts , said manager Tony Latessa .
" A lot of wellness counselors and homeopathic counselors are recommending it , " he said .
" I even had one doctor recommend it to one of his cardiovascular patients . "
After his tantalizing 2003 announcement about resveratrol 's apparent impact on yeast and fruit flies , Sinclair cofounded a private company , Sirtris , headquartered in Cambridge , that is researching resveratrol - based drugs designed to target genes called sirtuins .
Sirtuins trigger enzymes that help repair and protect against cell damage .
Sinclair 's early research showed that sirtuins could be switched on by resveratrol .
Scientists have known for decades that rats on severely restricted diets lived longer and suffered fewer maladies of aging , such as heart disease and cancer .
The caloric restriction appeared to stimulate sirtuin activity .
So scientists have focused on finding a substance , such as resveratrol , that could trigger this same effect in humans - without the famine - like diet .
Yet even Sinclair - who declined through a Harvard spokesman to be interviewed for this story - issued a recent reality check on the resveratrol front .
Interviewed on the CBS News program " 60 Minutes , " Sinclair said he believed it would be " five years , to be conservative " before the public would see a pill that could help people not only live longer , but keep them healthy longer .
" This will happen within our lifetimes , " he said .
" I 'm fairly certain about that . "
Ever since the birth ( and subsequent euthanization of ) Fake Steve Jobs , there have been a plethora of other fake executive personalities online .
Some have been received better by the companies they claim to represent than others .
Most simply ignore the satirical alter - egos , but Canon is one company that is n't taking all the smack talking from its fake exec lying down .
The company has requested that WordPress.com remove the Fake Chuck Westfall Blog , a parody supposedly authored by Canon 's Technical Information Advisor Chuck Westfall .
The header of the blog , " FAKE CHUCK WESTFALL : Canon Camera Guru - Ya Better Recognize ! " seems to clearly convey that this blog is , in fact , not written the real Chuck Westfall .
Still , in a letter ( PDF ) sent by Canon 's law firm last week , the company claims that the Fake Chuck Westfall blog uses the real Westfall 's name and likeness as well as Canon 's trademark without authorization .
Canon also notes that various blog posts seem to violate WordPress.com '
Terms of Service as well as " many and federal state laws " by the unauthorized use of the Canon logo , " threats of physical violence , " and " the outrageously privacy - invasive identification ... of Mr. Westfall 's wife , Ying , and young daughter , Anne . "
Finally , Canon takes issue with the overall look and feel of the blog , which it claims is " calculated to mislead recipients as to the source of the material . "
As noted on the blog over the weekend , Fake Chuck Westfall has removed the Canon logo and lessened the violence in one of his posts .
However , the company behind WordPress.com , Automattic , has decided to stand up to Canon on some of the other points .
In a letter sent back to Canon 's lawyers and published on Thomas Hawk 's Digital Connection , Automattic responded to Canon 's privacy complaint by pointing out that the real Chuck Westfall names his wife and daughter in his own bio elsewhere on the Web .
Automattic also rejected Canon 's assertion that the blog could be confused with any official Canon site .
" [ T ] he blog name and URL contain ' Fake ' , the about page starts with ' Hi , I ’m not actually Chuck Westfall . ' , and the tone and content of the whole blog are clearly satirical , " wrote Automattic .
This is , of course , not the first time someone has tried to rain on a satirical site 's parade .
In 2005 , the White House bullied The Onion into dropping the presidential seal , and Ludlow Music raised a fit in 2004 over a satirical Flash video depicting George W. Bush and John Kerry in alternating singing roles in a rendition of " This Land is Your Land " by Woody Guthrie .
And , although it was n't exactly satire , home improvement store Lowe 's has attempted to take down customer complaint site Lowes - Sucks.com with a number of trademark infringement claims .
Not only are these attempts largely futile , they have the effect of drawing attention to that which these companies are trying to hide .
We 'll be honest : we did n't even know Fake Chuck Westfall existed before today , but you bet we ( and all of you ) know about it now .
And how could we not keep reading after posts like " 5D Mark II Fix Coming , 50D is F ***ed " ?
Keep on keepin ' on , Fake Chuck Westfall .

Leftover bread is so important in my pantry that if I do n't have any on hand , I 'll buy a loaf and dry it out in the oven .
Then it 's perfect to toast and tear into pieces to add to an arugula salad , or turn into buttered breadcrumbs for the first of the season 's asparagus .
Usually though , I have an assortment of leftover bread on hand - past - their - prime croissants ready to turn into a sweet bread pudding , or rosemary or ciabatta bread for a savory version .
Growing up , I had little experience with leftover bread .
My mother used to make a custardy bread pudding with Langendorf 's soft white bread and would tear bits of it into her meat loaf mixture .
She scolded my father for eating bowls of " blue milk and bread , " which was bread sprinkled with sugar and milk poured over it .
I never tasted it , but I saw that it got soggy very quickly .
However , when I lived in Provence I learned the importance of not only really , really fresh bread , but also of good stale bread .
My neighbors bought fresh bread at least once and sometimes twice a day , and there were almost always leftovers .
It was saved , stored in the pantry in big paper bags or plastic buckets and used to make crumbs , croutons , toasts and stuffings , and to feed the dogs , goats and chickens .
When I was teaching cooking classes in Provence a few years ago , Craig Ponsford , the baker - owner of Artisan Breads in Sonoma , came to visit , and a local baker kindly let us make baguettes in his bakery , using Craig 's recipes and techniques .
We made about 50 or 60 baguettes because we had to make a batch big enough to engage the equipment , which of course was far more than my cooking school guests could eat , but there was no waste .
Craig and I delivered loaves throughout the countryside , despite a drenching spring rain .
Everyone was curious to sample the American 's bread and they also , as always , welcomed extra bread for their pantry .
Here in the Bay Area we have access to a rich selection of artisan breads , and I buy them all .
Ciabatta , Italian batard , black olive , green olive , rosemary , plain baguettes , sesame seed baguettes , rye , brioche , croissants - the list goes on and on .
I keep a bag of dried odds and ends of bread in my freezer to make dried breadcrumbs , to soak for bread puddings , and to stuff poultry , pork chops and chickens .
I cut up bread for croutons before it gets so hard it shatters , and these , too , go in the freezer .
Virtually every type of bread can be used for crumbs , croutons , toasts , stuffings , to thicken soups , even lighten ( and stretch ) ground meat .
Each bread brings its individual characteristic .
Croutons made with leftover rosemary bread , for example , impart a different flavor to a stuffed chicken or a tossed salad than croutons made from olive bread .
Delicate croutons made from brioche make quite a different garnish for carrot soup than sturdy , rustic ones made from an Italian batard .
Having plenty of leftover bread , in all its myriad forms , makes me feel secure , knowing there is always something good to eat that I can make using the most basic food .

Saudi judge sentences pregnant gang - rape victim to 100 lashes for committing adultery
A Saudi judge has ordered a woman should be jailed for a year and receive 100 lashes after she was gang - raped , it was claimed last night .
The 23 - year - old woman , who became pregnant after her ordeal , was reportedly assaulted after accepting a lift from a man .
He took her to a house to the east of the city of Jeddah where she was attacked by him and four of his friends throughout the night .
A judge in the Saudi city of Jeddah , pictured , ruled that the woman was guilty of adultery and should be jailed for a year
She later discovered she was pregnant and made a desperate attempt to get an abortion at the King Fahd Hospital for Armed Forces .
According to the Saudi Gazette , she eventually ' confessed ' to having ' forced intercourse ' with her attackers and was brought before a judge at the District Court in Jeddah .
He ruled she had committed adultery - despite not even being married - and handed down a year 's prison sentence , which she will serve in a prison just outside the city .
She is still pregnant and will be flogged once she has had the child .
The Saudi Arabian legal system practices a strict form of medieval law .
Women have very few rights and are not even allowed to drive .
They are also banned from going out in public in the company of men other than male relatives .
Zimbabwe 's new prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has called on the world " to get over " President Robert Mugabe and stop seeing him as the principal problem facing his country .
Speaking to the Guardian shortly before ministers in the new powersharing government were due to be sworn in today , Tsvangirai said that his most immediate challenges – from finding the money to pay government workers and prising political detainees from prison , to purging the system of some of its worst crooks – now have little to do with the man who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence 29 years ago .
" Unfortunately people are preoccupied with Mugabe as a person .
They need to get over it .
This has gone beyond Mugabe .
People need to stop talking about him as the only issue .
Mugabe is part of the problem but he is also part of the solution .
He is not the obstacle we are now facing , " he said .
But hours later , Tsvangirai received a sharp reminder of another more sinister challenge his administration faces as one of his new ministers , Roy Bennett , was arrested today .
The Movement for Democratic Change said Bennett , a former white farmer who is a particularly hated figure within Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , was " abducted " by the police law and order unit .
The detention , along with the continued imprisonment of dozens of opposition supporters who have been held for months and tortured , reflects deep divisions within the upper echelons of Mugabe 's power structure , with some of the military chiefs apparently attempting to sabotage the powersharing agreement that brought Tsvangirai into government .
The MDC believes that if it can establish itself as a partner in government , pay civil servants and bring in foreign aid , power will bleed from Mugabe and Zanu - PF to Tsvangirai .
But the coming days will be difficult as hardliners , such as the armed forces chief , Constantine Chiwenga , the police chief , Augustine Chihuri , and other senior security officials who said they would never recognise Tsvangirai 's authority , keep up attempts to undermine the new political setup .
The new prime minister won immediate support from government workers after his inauguration on Wednesday by promising that civil servants , the police and soldiers – struggling along on salaries in nearly worthless Zimbabwe dollars – will be paid in hard currency at the end of the month .
But there were immediate questions about where the money to pay them is coming from , given the state 's coffers are nearly empty and foreign governments have said they want to see if Tsvangirai is really in charge before they start handing over a £ 1.2 bn aid package .
Tsvangirai needs to find about $ 100 m by the end of the month to pay 236,000 civil servants , teachers and health workers , as well as the police and military , in foreign currency .
Some of his party colleagues had urged him not to make such a specific commitment at his inauguration .
But the new prime minister told them that there was no hope of beginning to rebuild Zimbabwe without getting government employees back to work .
" It was not something lightly considered .
It 's not something you just say .
We will meet the commitments .
I can assure you we will find the funds , " he said .
Eddie Cross , nominated to be the MDC 's new state enterprises minister , said the government already had a commitment of $ 50 m from foreign donors , although he did not name them .
Money is the key to reviving Zimbabwe 's economy , but Britain and other donors have laid down several standards by which the new administration will be judged , before the money is released .
These include a return to the rule of law , the freeing of political detainees and the lifting of draconian restrictions on the independent press .
" People have set benchmarks , " said Tsvangirai .
" We have to earn the confidence of the international community .
Their scepticism is justified .
This is 29 years of one - man rule .
But I 'm quite certain if we start moving on the benchmarks , that will be the basis for incremental support .
It 's a process of engagement . "
An early marker will be the fate of the central bank governor , Gideon Gono , who has overseen world - record inflation running above 10 sextillion percent and the eradication of the national currency , as he did the electronic equivalent of furiously printing money by adding strings of zeros to government bank accounts .
He also facilitated the plunder of Zimbabwe 's coffers by its ruling elite .
Western governments want him out .
So do most Zimbabweans , but he has clung to office in part because he has a hold over other Zanu - PF leaders , because he knows who stole what .
Tsvangirai acknowledges that getting rid of Gono and the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , who has abused the law to lock up Mugabe 's opponents , will be seen by foreigners and Zimbabweans as an early test of his power .
" We are dealing with that issue of Gono .
The government has to deal with it because I appreciate that people have no confidence in our central bank governor and our attorney general .
It is an issue that was addressed in the [ South Africa - brokered regional ] negotiations .
It will be dealt with , " he said .
Asked how , he said : " We recognise that it will be hard to win the donors ' confidence if the central bank governor is still there .
I can not say more right now but it will be dealt with . "
Another early test is the fate of 30 political detainees who have been held for months and brutally tortured .
Tsvangirai sought to dampen accusations that he is not doing enough for them , in part because he abandoned a pledge not to be sworn in until they were free , by visiting Chikurubi maximum security prison yesterday and demanding to see the political prisoners .
He succeeded in getting three of them moved to a private clinic for treatment , including Jestina Mukoko , who is reported to be ill .
But prison authorities removed Mukoko from the hospital a few hours later and returned her to jail .
Tsvangirai acknowledges that their continued detention is seen by many as a test of whether he wields sufficient power to overcome the hardliners .
" I do agree that it 's a question of credibility , " he said .
" I went to the prison and talked with them and said it is taking longer than we anticipated but we are dealing with it . "
Asked why it is taking longer than anticipated , he said : " The problem is not Mugabe .
It lies elsewhere .
It is others .
We need to overcome that , " he said , declining to name names .
Tsvangirai said that while the dissent by the old regime 's hardliners was of concern , he did not believe they would be able to retain power or carry out a coup .
" The region wo n't accept it .
The world wo n't accept it .
They can't get away with it , " he said " We know there are people who are disgruntled .
We know the agreement does not have support from all parties .
The leadership challenge for us is to negotiate away these areas of disgruntlement .
We can do that and we are going to begin by getting people back to work . "

Confidential memorandums from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's secret and illegal Operation COINTELPRO against domestic political organizations and activists in the 60's and 70's reveal dirty deeds by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover .
The archives of Political Research Associates offer up long - held secrets of FBI misdeeds from one of the nation 's largest collections of COINTELPRO documents .
Hoover had targeted the Black Panthers for the full fury of his clandestine war on political activists he disliked .
Directives were sent out nationwide with orders to " disrupt " the group and each field FBI office was to develop proposals targeting local Panther chapters and leaders .
In Omaha , Nebraska , the chief FBI targets were Edward Poindexter and Mondo we Langa ( formerly David Rice ) who were leaders of the National Committee to Combat Fascism , also known as the Nebraska Committee to Combat Fascism .
Omaha was not on the initial list of 23 FBI field offices ordered to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit or otherwise neutralize " the Black Panthers in a COINTELPRO directive of August 25 , 1967 .
Marching orders for Omaha FBI agents came on March 4 , 1968 in the form of a memo from George C. Moore , head of the Racial Intelligence Division , to William Cornelius Sullivan , head of the Domestic Intelligence Division .
" In view of the tremendous increase in black nationalist activity , and the approach of summer , this program [ COINTELPRO ] should be expanded . "
The Omaha SAC ( Special - Agent - in - Charge ) responded to Hoover in a confidential memo dated April 3 , 1968 .
The heavily redacted document discusses one " militant Black Nationalist " but concludes there is no organized activity in Omaha .
" There are no organizations or individuals in the Omaha Division presently considered of potential danger as to be considered for Counterintelligence action . "
" Omaha has no suggestions to offer at the present time regarding the over all Counterintelligence Program or administration of this program .
It is felt , however , that this program can be very beneficial to the Bureau in helping to prevent the coalition of militant Black Nationalist Groups and violence on their part . "
On May 31 , 1968 the Omaha SAC reaffirmed , " There continue to be no organizations or individuals in the division currently considered of potential danger as to be considered for counterintelligence actions . "
Making quarterly reports , the message was again repeated to Hoover by the Omaha SAC that there was no activity to disrupt .
On September 6 , 1968 , the Omaha office finally had something to tell Hoover .
" It is anticipated that in the near future [ REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ] might be targets of counter intelligence action as well as the organizations of which they are leaders .
The Black Panther group in Omaha has vaguely discussed in general terms creating violence , however , it has taken no positive action in this regard to date . "
An October 6 , 1968 COINTELPRO memo from the Omaha SAC to Hoover expressed concern about the " revolutionary and criminal nature " of the Black Panthers and proposed a plan to contact " Leaders of the Negro community " .
The memo went on to describe actions of the local police .
" It should be noted that the Omaha Police department has instigated an harassment campaign against the BPP [ Black Panther Party ] members by stopping vehicles registered to these individuals at every opportunity .
This activity has become of great concern to those members involved .
In addition , this campaign has resulted in identification of additional persons associated with the BPP movement and its leadership . "
Hoover replied on October 23 , 1968 .
" Proposals for counterintelligence measures against the Black Panther Party … have merit and are worthy of more detailed consideration . "
" The utilization of your sources and informants to spread gossip in the ghetto area concerning BPP leaders and members must be done on a selective basis so as to preclude tracing the origin of the gossip to the FBI .
This is an effective but risky maneuver and you must insure that your informants are not compromised .
Prior to undertaking such maneuvers , you must identify your informants you intend to use in this program and the rumors they will spread . "
" Although these recommendations have merit , they are so broad and nonspecific that authority is not being granted at this time to implement them .
Omaha is being instructed to submit specific recommendations after which an independent decision can be made at the Bureau as to whether or not they should be authorized . "
By December 2 , 1968 there were developments Omaha could share with Hoover .
" [ REDACTED ] of the Black Panther Party in Omaha , was interviewed on 11/27/68 by Special Agents of the Omaha Office in connection with an Antiriot Laws matter . "

When President Barack Obama unveiled his “ comprehensive , new strategy ” for the war in Afghanistan it struck many how decidedly old most of the strategy looked .
A vague justification for throwing more money and troops at the seemingly endless war , bundled with posturing about how vital the war ’s success ultimately would be .
But is that the whole story ?
Was the much - heralded new strategy just about polishing up the same old escalation in Afghanistan and selling it as a change ?
Perhaps the real novelty in this plan takes place outside of Afghanistan , in neighboring Pakistan .
Indeed , while they emphasize Afghanistan in public comments about this plan , the white paper ( PDF ) distributed by the White House on the strategy looks decidedly Pakistan - centric .
It calls for “ a more capable , accountable , and effective government ” in Afghanistan , but promises “ a vibrant economy ” for Pakistan .
It pledges to “ disrupt terrorist networks in Afghanistan and especially Pakistan . ”
While promising “ A New Way Forward ” ( not so coincidentally the working title of the 2007 escalation in Iraq ) , it seems that all roads lead to Pakistan .
The government will be getting billions in new aid , the US is committing itself to fight militants in the area ( above and beyond the repeated drone attacks ) .
They ’re not even ruling out sending ground troops .
So Afghanistan has its new strategy , which is its old strategy with more guys .
But maybe the real story here is that President Obama has made the equivalent of a de facto declaration of war against Pakistan ’s border regions .
Hey , we are all looking for a way to make an extra buck or two , right ?
Did you realize that there is a small ‘ gold mine ’ right in front of you ?
That ’s right .
Aluminum is in high demand and the prices that it garners at reclaiming and recycling centers makes this worth looking into as far as a secondary source of cash is concerned .
Even though the plastic bottle has replaced the aluminum can as the delivery material of choice for bottlers , the fact remains that there is still a significant amount out there .
You have to look no farther than your own community to see this in full force .
Next time you are filling your tank with gasoline , look into the waste receptacles .
Yes , you will see aluminum cans there for the taking .
So , how much cash can one generate by collecting and selling aluminum ?
It depends on where you live , but currently as of this writing , used beverage cans ( UBC ) in loose bags ; either whole or flattened brings around $ .14 per pound .
That might not seem like a lot , but consider that we have a lot of used beverage can waste in our communities .
Here are some tips to help you get into aluminum can collections for profit .
Look at less traveled highways .
If you go walking and looking for cans , look along roadsides where there is not a great amount of traffic .
This is where many people are prone to throw out their trash , and inevitably you will find aluminum cans .
Parks and public places .
Look at parks or other public locations where there are high concentration of outdoor activities .
In fact , if you can schedule your foraging right after a major event , you will score big time .
Get a crusher .
After you collect your cans , clean them out and let them dry .
Then , get yourself a crusher and flatten them .
They consume less space that way .
Check with your local recycling center to make sure that they take aluminum and then find out what the current rate for the metal is bringing .
Your search for aluminum cans might be better as a part of a search for other metals that are recyclable as well .
Copper and other metals are worth more , but are more difficult to find .
If you take a strategy of looking for everything , then you will be surprised at what you will find especially along roadsides .
While this might not seem to be a worthwhile effort , you might consider doing this with a local group like boy scouts , etc .
They like these kinds of efforts .
Also , consider that the effort you are putting forth is helping the eco system as well .
And on top of that , you get paid for it .
Not bad .
CIA destroyed 12 tapes showing ' enhanced interrogation methods '
Muriel Kane
Published : Friday March 6 , 2009
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union has received new information about 92 interrogation videotapes which were previously revealed to have been destroyed by the CIA .
Documents provided on Friday to a federal court in New York indicated that twelve of the 92 tapes depicted " enhanced interrogation methods . "
Ninety of those tapes showed one detainee and the other two a second detainee .
However , the inventory of the tapes was almost entirely redacted .
" The government is needlessly withholding information about these tapes from the public , despite the fact that the CIAs use of torture -- including waterboarding -- is no secret , " ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh complained .
" This new information only underscores the need for full and immediate disclosure of the CIAs illegal interrogation methods . "
In December 2007 , the ACLU filed a motion -- which is stil pending -- to hold the CIA in contempt for its destruction of the tapes in violation of a court order to produce or identify all records that had been requested by the ACLU .
The tapes were also withheld from the 9/11 Commission .
The government has now promised to release additional information about the tapes by March 20 .
According to a letter sent to the court by two assistant US Attorneys , " Point 2 requires the production of a ' list of any summaries , transcripts , or memoranda regarding the records , and of any reconstruction of the records ' content .
The CIA will complete this list on or before March 20 , 2009 .
On that same date , the CIA will provide a public version of the list to the Court and Plaintiffs and , if necessary to explain fully the records at issue , will make available a classified version for the Court 's ex parte , in camera review . "

Spammers often change their subject lines in a bid to escape detection and filters .
But there are some tried , tested and true subject lines they keep returning to again and again .
For this week , PayPal topped the list of top spam subject lines , being used in three of the top 10 .
HSBC Bank Canada came in second with two , according to research from anti-malware vendor McAfee.com .
In terms of the subject matter of spam , gift giving for Christmas is the spammer 's best friend .
The clear leader is spam for products and services , accounting for 38 percent of spam received , according to McAfee .
" Considering the time of year , that 's not surprising , " Dave Marcus , security research and communications director of McAfee Avert Labs , told InternetNews.com .
Spammers tend to rev up their efforts around special occasions such as the Olympics and the major holidays .
Billing - related e-mails accounted for two of the top 10 subject lines in e-mail , and the list was rounded off with one message each for two types of alerts , and one Spanish - language e-mail subject .
However , subject lines change over time as spammers adjust to the market , its targets and as antispam software gets familiar with existing subject lines .
Listing by subject , Russian - language spam accounted for 29 percent of spam received , and advertisements came in third , at 16 percent .
Despite the bad economy , financial spam accounted for only two percent of spam received .
Spam for products and services talks about specific products or services , as compared with advertising spam , which is more general , Marcus said .
" We 're seeing a lot of stuff that 's product - and service - centric , so we 're breaking that out into its own category ; a year ago we probably would n't have been able to do that . "
The amount of spam sent in Russian has increased this year because more Internet - related activity is coming out of Russia , Marcus said .
McAfee also wants end -users to be wary of holiday season scams .
They include charity phishing scams , holiday e-cards , fake invoices , purported new friends on social networking sites like Facebook , and holiday search - related terms .
Just say no
For example , if you get an e-mail from the Salvation Army , the Red Cross , or any other charitable group asking for donations , do not click on the link in the e-mail , McAfee warns .
Instead , go directly to the organization 's Web site to donate .
Or , you may get an e-card or worse yet , an e-mail purporting to be from Hallmark asking you to download an attachment to get to your e-card .
Remember Nancy Reagan and just say no .
And triple check when you see an invoice or waybill in your e-mail .
Spammers are trying to cash in on the online shopping trend , sending fake invoices or waybills from one of the courier companies or the U.S. Customs Service , McAfee said .
These e-mails ask recipients for their credit card information so their account can be credited , or require the recipients to open an invoice or customs form to receive the package .
Doing so will download a Trojan or other malware .

Man breaks the World Record by Holding this Lamborghini from taking off for 7 seconds .
Strangely , the job marked the beginning of Hyde ’s lifelong study of the roots of the creative imagination , and of his literary ascent .
At the time , Berryman was writing and publishing his landmark “ Dream Songs . ”
In the anguished , self - pitying tone of the poems , Hyde heard an echo of the tales spun by the residents on the ward , and he wrote a long essay drawing the parallel .
“ Alcohol and Poetry : John Berryman and the Booze Talking , ” published in 1975 , was widely anthologized and widely debated .
More important , it won Hyde a $ 7,500 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts , which he lived on for a year and a half as he haunted libraries , tramped around and tried to figure out what he wanted to do next , and how .
“ I worked on how I work ” is how he puts it .
At the time , Hyde ’s passion for poetry was quickly being matched by a passion for cultural anthropology , particularly the writings of Ivan Illich , an Austrian priest - cum - social - critic who drew wide public attention for his book “ Deschooling Society ” ( 1971 ) — a polemic against modern public education .
Hyde traveled to Cuernavaca , where Illich ran a language center and salon for Western missionaries heading to Latin America .
It was Illich who lent Hyde a book of anthropology that contained a chapter about Marcel Mauss ’s essay on gift exchange .
Hyde ’s intellectual course for the next several years was set .
The work captivated Hyde .
“ There was language in this which seemed to me metaphorically related to creativity , ” he told me .
Mauss was a scholar of the old polymathic sort — a sociologist , a linguist , a historian of religion , a Sanskrit expert , a philosopher .
His essay on gift exchange drew on the work of the seminal turn - of - the - century ethnographers Franz Boas and Bronislaw Malinowski to explore aboriginal societies in which the person of consequence — the man or woman who is deemed worthy of adulation , respect and emulation — is not the one who accumulates the most goods but the one who disperses them .
Gift economies , as Mauss defines them , are marked by circulation and connectivity : goods have value only insofar as they are treated as gifts , and gifts can remain gifts only if they are continually given away .
This results in a kind of engine of community cohesion , in which objects create social , psychological , emotional and spiritual bonds as they pass from hand to hand .
The ideas resonated deeply with Hyde .
For nearly a decade he had been struggling to explain — to his family , to nonartist friends , to himself — why he devoted so much of his time and energy to something as nonremunerative as poetry .
The literature on gift exchange — tales , for example , of South Sea tribesman circulating shells and necklaces in a slow - moving , broad circle around the Trobriand Islands — gave him the conceptual tool he needed to understand his predicament , which was , he came to believe , the predicament of all artists living “ in an age whose values are market values and whose commerce consists almost exclusively in the purchase and sale of commodities . ”
For centuries people have been speaking of talent and inspiration as gifts ;
Hyde ’s basic argument was that this language must extend to the products of talent and inspiration too .
Unlike a commodity , whose value begins to decline the moment it changes hands , an artwork gains in value from the act of being circulated — published , shown , written about , passed from generation to generation — from being , at its core , an offering .
Hyde worked on “ The Gift ” for seven years , barely scraping by , spending long months hunting through obscure folk tales for narratives that reflected what he came to call “ the commerce of the creative spirit . ”
When the book was finally published , the critic Martha Bayles castigated it in The New York Times for naïvely “ esp[ ying ] a noble savage in every struggling artist ” — a critique that was echoed elsewhere .
Yet the artistic community immediately embraced Hyde ’s work .
A bevy of poets , including Robert Pinsky , Donald Hall and Gary Snyder , published a group letter in The Times responding to Bayles ’s review and praising Hyde ’s “ search to regain the unity of economic , aesthetic , social and religious life . ”
Bill Viola , the pioneering video artist , remembers New York artists in the 1980s excitedly exchanging dog-eared , marked - up copies .
“ In a society that mostly talks about money , ” says Margaret Atwood , who keeps a half - dozen copies of “ The Gift ” on hand at all times to distribute to artists she thinks will benefit from it , “ Lewis carved out a little island where you can say , ‘ Life does n’t always work that way . ’ ”
Since the mid-1980s , when his work began to gain in popularity , Hyde has often been invited to speak publicly about creativity and gift exchange .
Invariably , the discussions following his lectures have wound their way to a practical question :
If creative work does n’t necessarily have any market value , how is the artist to survive ?
In the course of writing “ The Gift , ” Hyde underwent an intellectual transformation on this subject .
He began the work believing there was “ an irreconcilable conflict ” between gift exchange and the market ; the enduring ( if not necessarily the happy ) artist was the one who most successfully fended off commercial demands .
By the time he was finished , Hyde had come to a less - dogmatic conclusion .
It was still true , he believed , that the marketplace could destroy an artist ’s gift , but it was equally true that the marketplace was n’t going anywhere ; it had always existed , and it always would .
The key was to find a good way to reconcile the two economies .
One of the first time management books I read was Alan Laeken ’s excellent How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life , which recommended the now - familiar advice of triaging tasks into A , B and C categories .
Appropriately , the book had plenty of discussion on the importance of doing A tasks first , and it even occasionally mentioned doing B tasks .
But nowhere could I find any discussion on doing C tasks , leading me to infer that the author was arguing that either :
The handling of low - priority tasks is self - evident
Anything classified as a “ C ” is not a low - priority task , but a non-priority task that should n’t be done at all
I found both explanations problematic .
The system that only advocates doing high - impact tasks , aside from being unrealistic , leaves no room for anything else .
More importantly , if something is n’t worth doing at all , it should n’t be classified or tracked , period .
An alternative triage
I would divide things up , instead , like this :
Commitments :
Things you track on your calendar , project and action lists
Things you track on your calendar , project and action lists Options : Considerations for the future reviewed less regularly ( e.g. weekly instead of daily ) on your Someday / Maybe list , calendar or tickler file
Considerations for the future reviewed less regularly ( e.g. weekly instead of daily ) on your Someday / Maybe list , calendar or tickler file Non-commitments :
Things that do n’t require any further thinking or tracking
Something is either worth doing , or it ’s not .
If you decide it ’s worth doing , then it ’s either a next action or a project .
If you ’re undecided , then it ’s a someday / maybe .
If you ’ve decided that it ’s not worth doing , do n’t waste time tracking it .
Notice that having an explicit Someday / Maybe category requires that you make the decision to classify something as “ undecided , ” which is very different than simply not deciding .
Having all of those indecisions in one place to review weekly is more efficient that occasionally thinking about each of 60 consideration as they spring to mind randomly .
A more strategic approach
There ’s a Catch - 22 to designating tasks a “ C , ” or by implication , unimportant .
If something needs to be done , but is considered unimportant , there ’s no incentive to ever do it .
Without a positive motivation to do a task , the mind has find a negative motivation sufficiently strong enough to act on .
I ’ll get fired , my spouse will complain , my utilities will be shut off , I wo n’t be able to drive on an empty gas task , and so on .
Since the motivation has to be sufficiently strong enough to take action , the tendency is to procrastinate until the crisis point , when a C suddenly turns into an A .
That ’s not a strategic way to live , and it breeds apathy and anxiety .
The urgent , the important and the necessary
The first order of business is to acknowledge the necessary , not just the urgent or important .
Here are some ways to get to small - but - necessary things early before they turn into big things .
Batch your next actions by context .
If you ’re a GTD user , you ’re probably already using context lists to organize your tasks .
If all of your phone calls are on your @Calls list , it ’s more efficient to complete as many calls on that list in one sitting as possible rather than alternate between phone calls and actions in other contexts .
It ’s easier to know that you ’ve completed all your calls than to wonder which call you should make next .
If you must use a prioritized list , make sure it ’s congruent with the context you ’re in — no errands or home tasks on a list you need to review at work .
Use the Two Minute Rule .
If an action would take longer to write down now and reconsider doing later , do it now if it ’s worth doing at all .
For convenience sake , we settle on the Two Minute Rule as the Do It Now breakpoint , but lengthen or shorten as your workload allows .
Do n’t clutter your mind or your organizer with “ minutiae , ” in the literal sense .
Use the Two Action Rule .
It ’s ideal to work through an action list starting with the highest - priority item , but sometimes your energy level requires an approach with more finesse .
The Two Action Rule states :
To regain momentum on a stuck action list , commit to completing a minimum of two actions on it , however small , in quick succession , with a bias toward the oldest items .
The rationale behind the rule being :
Just as two points make a line , completing two tasks , however small , creates a sense of direction and perceived progress .
The more quickly you can complete two next actions in a row , the greater the sense of momentum you ’ll have that will feed itself into how you carry out the rest of the list .
As always , high - priority tasks are better than low - priority ones , but moving from inaction to action is the highest priority , as long as it ’s not indiscriminate action .
Use weekends and “ holidays . ”
If no time ever seems to be a good time to do low - priorty tasks , batch them for the weekend , ideally before doing your weekly review to lighten your lists .
If the prospect of doing anything non-recreational on the weekend is an anathema , schedule a specific block of time to handle low - priority tasks .
Use the “ rocks and sand ” approach .
If high - priority tasks are the few “ big rocks ” that fill the bulk of your day , handle the “ sand ” of lower - priority tasks in between them .
Assuming the big rocks take more energy than sand , cycling between them is a great way to pace yourself .
You do n’t burn yourself lifting rocks all day , and you do n’t lament wasting the day doing nothing more than sweeping sand .
“ Reward ” yourself with easy or desirable tasks .
A common piece of advice is to reward yourself for doing something arduous or onerous by promising yourself a reward at the end , like watching a movie ( no joke : I once saw a father bribe his six - year - old daughter into brushing her teeth by promising her ice cream ) .
You can take the same approach by following up something undesirable to do with something more desirable .
If you want to get started exercising , try scheduling it immediately after doing some “ real ” work , like making a batch of sales calls .
That ’s similar to the rocks - and - sand approach , but here it ’s not a routine ; it ’s done occasionally , on an as - needed basis .
Immediately after a weekly review .
During a weekly review , make note of which next actions are getting a little too familiar .
If you ’ve seen them on two or more weekly reviews in a row , do them immediately if possible , or at least “ debug ” them by figuring out if they have unidentified dependencies — actions that have to be taken before the written ones can actually be done .
While you ’re doing something else .
Do your laundry while listening to a podcast , rehearse questions for a job interview while gardening , build your knowledge of classical music while reading a novel .
Create a multitasking checklist of low - concentration actions that can be done competently while attending to another one .

Enlarge By Ron Edmonds , AP President Obama , seen here on Monday meeting with reporters in the Oval Office at the White House in washington , plans a media blitz on his economic stimulus plan .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Obama planned Tuesday to blanket U.S. television with the message that Congress must approve hundreds of billions of dollars to fight off economic collapse .
In more normal times , Obama 's plans to name a third Republican to his Cabinet — New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg as commerce secretary — would have dominated White House news .
But with the United States facing an uncertain financial future and rising unemployment and discouraging economic data , Gregg 's nomination falls to a distant second as Obama 's plan to grant interviews to every national television network .
OBAMA : Wall Street bonuses ' shameful '
Obama campaigned for the presidency and took office promising to yank Washington out of decades of bitter bipartisanship but has struggled on the stimulus measure despite his unprecedented courting of the opposition party even before he was inaugurated .
Republican want to reshape his massive stimulus plan — budgeted at $ 819 billion as it passed the House of Representatives and rising to nearly $ 900 billion under debate in the Senate .
While issuing praise of the highly popular president 's call for quick stimulus action , they have been attacking their Democratic congressional colleagues for what they say is loading the measure down with pet projects and failing to provide larger tax cuts — the perennial Republican prescription for economic troubles .
Obama bore down on fellow Democratic congressional leaders at a White House meeting late Monday and planned to talk economics with party rank - and - file at House and Senate retreats later in the week .
While battling to hold together a stimulus measure acceptable to both parties , Obama faced the unwelcome distraction of a second Cabinet nominee falling under an income tax cloud .
Former Sen . Tom Daschle , under Senate scrutiny as secretary of health and human services , apologized Monday for failing to pay more than $ 120,000 in taxes and appealed to his former colleagues to approve him all the same .
Obama said he was " absolutely " sticking with his nominee .
The White House at once underscored the magnitude of the problem while trying to minimize Daschle 's culpability .
" Nobody 's perfect , " said press secretary Robert Gibbs , while acknowledging " it was a serious mistake . "
There was welcome news when another Cabinet choice , Eric Holder , was confirmed by the Senate late Monday .
Holder was to be sworn in Tuesday to become the first African - American U.S. attorney general .
Holder 's nomination initially had been viewed as problematic because of questions over his role in controversial pardons when he was the No. 2 Justice Department official under President Bill Clinton .
Now Holder will be the country 's chief law enforcement official as head of the Justice Department .
Holder easily overcame some Republican objections over what they considered his insufficient commitment to fight terror and his support for gun control , but even his critics agreed that Holder was well - qualified for the post .
While there were no predictions
Daschle would be rejected , his tax troubles proved difficult for senators who only last week confirmed Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary despite his separate tax - payment problems .
The issue strikes a nerve as many Americans are struggling with their own serious money problems .
The political scrum over Obama 's stimulus measure took place as the Commerce Department reported that personal spending fell for the sixth straight month in December by 1 % .
Analysts had predicted a decline of 0.9 % .
Incomes also dipped , and the personal savings rate shot higher , a sign that consumers remain extremely nervous about the economy .
Also Monday , the president predicted some of America 's troubled banks still could fail , despite a $ 700 billion financial bailout program , half of which has already been spent by the former Bush administration .
The bailout program is separate from the Obama administration 's stimulus plan .
Top Senate Democrats plan to add a big increase in highway and mass transit funding to the recovery program Tuesday , even as others in the president 's party hope to trim the cost of the plan .
Republicans were pressing to lower mortgage costs to try to jolt the housing market out of its slump .
In the Capitol , Republicans said their goal was to change the bill , not to block it .
" Nobody that I know of is trying to keep a package from passing , " said Sen .
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader .
" We need to fix housing first , " he said .
Nineteen Democratic and Republican state governors , meanwhile , cited frozen credit markets and rising unemployment in urging lawmakers to resolve their differences and asking Obama to sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk .
The governors said the money it provides for public education , health care and rebuilding the nation 's infrastructure will create and preserve jobs while making a sound investment in the country 's long - term economic interests .
" While we all believe in the importance of free markets , we believe that the markets today need stimulating , " the governors of both parties told Obama in a letter dated Monday .

[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : c2hs 0.16.0
All , c2hs version 0.16.0 is out and is available from hackage http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/c2hs
What is c2hs ============
The c2hs tool assists in the development of Haskell bindings to C libraries .
It extracts interface information from C header files and generates Haskell code with foreign imports and marshaling .
The major advantages of using c2hs compared to writing foreign imports by hand ( or using hsc2hs ) are : * Cross - language type safety : C functions are imported with the correct Haskell types .
* Saves time : boilerplate marshaling code is generated .
Changes in this release =======================
The major change in this release is that it now uses the Language .C library .
This brings the code full circle .
Benedikt Huber split out and developed the Language .
C library from the C parser I originally wrote for c2hs some years ago .
Other changes since 0.15.x : * Works better on OSX , it now uses gcc - E to do the pre-processing of C header files .
Previously it used cpp , however on OSX the cpp program appears to operate in an antiquated compatibility mode .
* " enum hooks " are now implemented but not yet documented *
A couple fixes in the default mapping of C names to Haskell names . * A number of other bugs fixes .
Credits =======
Benedikt Huber gets the credit for majority of the work in this release .
Thanks also to John Lato for numerous cleanup patches .

We advocate on issues and policy that impact the lives of Coloradans .
We help to educate the public on policy and listen to the public on the issues that matter the most to them .
We ’re committed to working with grassroots activists and groups to support them however we can .
... and the Republicans are still floundering , what happens ?
Yglesias says the GOP comes back anyway :
[ A ] hard - right agenda ... certainly is n't where the country is right now but it's not so unreasonable to think that things might change .
I think we 'll be growing again in late 2012 and Obama will probably get re-elected no matter Republicans say or do .
But it 's possible that things will really go off the rails and we 'll have a years - long L - shaped recession in which case if what the opposition party has to offer is hard - right nihilism , then hard - right nihilism is what the voters will embrace .
Will Wilkinson says do n't bet on it :
... Obama seems to be very boldly arguing : " If not my specific package of policies , then surely disaster ! "
I think this can be a bit perilous but in this case probably smart since the Republicans are so hapless .
If Republicans can sabotage the thrust of the Democrats ' policies -- refuse funding for your state , call for a spending freeze -- and the recovery occurs anyway , then Obama 's bold conditional is decisively falsified .
But voters are n't logicians , and if we get a recovery , Obama 's going to get the credit anyway .
So that tack seems like a loser for the Republicans even in the best case .
( And in the worst case -- everything goes further south and they get pinned with the blame -- totally disastrous . )
The only plausible Republican strategy is to put forward an attractive personality able to forcefully and intelligently explain in a relatively detailed way why the Dem 's plans are likely to fail , and to forcefully and intelligently articulate a plan likely to work better .
That 's the only way to sow broad doubt in the wisdom of the majority 's leadership : offer an alternative that looks at least as or more credible .
David Cameron is a great example of how to do this incredibly well .
But as Jindal 's embarrassing performance shows , the GOP has absolutely no one capable of doing anything approaching this .
So , as far as I can tell , the GOP is going to continue to get flattened , Obama will get basically whatever he wants , and if it does n't work , then it almost worked and who else are you going to trust ?
It 's worth bearing in mind that there 's a third option .
When Jim Fallows anticipated a different ( though not entirely different ) economic calamity in his big " Countdown to a Meltdown " essay for us several years ago , he framed the whole thing as a strategy memo to a soon - to - be- elected third party candidate , who was on the verge of triumphing after two consecutive failed post - Bush administrations , one Democratic and one Republican .
This is obviously an unlikely scenario - but there 's nothing written in stone that says the current two - party lock on the presidency has to endure unbroken forever , and a long L - shaped recession in which both parties look ineffectual is exactly the kind of time when unlikely scenarios start looking at least somewhat more likely .
Ross Perot 's 1992 candidacy , you 'll recall , was premised on the idea that the GOP had failed and the Democrats could n't be trusted ; if Obama 's presiding over an economic disaster in 2012 , then a third - party run premised on the idea that the Democrats have failed and the Republicans can't be trusted might do rather well indeed .
At the very least , I bet Ron Paul could get 5 or 10 percent of the vote running as an Independent in that landscape ...

Visitors can contemplate the horror of slavery from their luxury rooms
One of pop superstar Michael Jackson 's brothers , Marlon , is involved in a controversial plan to develop a $ 3.4bn ( £ 2.4 bn ) slavery memorial and luxury resort in Badagry , Nigeria .
The historic slave port is to be transformed through the bizarre combination of a slave history theme park and a museum dedicated to double Grammy - winning pop-soul group the Jackson Five .
The idea is that the band will help attract African - American tourists keen to trace their roots back to Nigeria .
The men behind the plan say it will honour the history of the transatlantic slave trade and provide employment opportunities for Nigerians .
But the plan has been condemned by Nigerian commentators .
Slave tourism
The African - American history trail is worth billions of dollars , the developers say .
Ghana and Senegal have successfully turned slave ports into tourist attractions .
The Jackson Five got discos moving in the 1970s and the 1980s
The developers say the Badagry Historical Resort will be marketed to African - American tourists as a mixture of luxury tourist attractions and historical education .
Visitors will be able to see the route their ancestors walked , shackled together as they were whipped toward the " point of no return " .
They can then retire to their five - star hotel to drink cocktails by the pool .
Visitors will be able to pay their respects at the site of a mass grave for those who died before boarding ships across the Atlantic Ocean .
And then travel a few yards in a buggy to play a round of golf .
They can visit a replica slave ship to see the conditions Africans suffered , before visiting the world 's only museum dedicated to the career of the Jackson Five .
Academics believe up to two million people died and at least 10 million transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade between the 16th and 19th Centuries .
The Jacksons ' upbeat tunes like ABC and Blame it on the Boogie enlivened US and UK discos throughout the 1970s .
On display at the museum will be animatronic vignettes of the band , memorabilia and " holographic displays " of the group that launched the career of Michael Jackson .
' The right place ' " The Badagry Historical Resort development project will certainly enhance the quality of life for millions of people across Nigeria , " promotional material for the resort says .
It 's like dancing on the graves of dead people and telling them you 're honouring them
C Don Adinuba
Writer
But critics have dismissed the project as a cynical money - making scheme , inappropriate for the subject of such seriousness as the transatlantic slave trade .
The idea to bring together slavery and the Jackson Five came during a visit to Nigeria by US businessmen and former Jacksons singer Marlon Jackson .
" The Jackson Family had been looking for a place to site their memorabilia collection for some time , " says Gary Loster , a former mayor of Saginaw , Michigan , and chief executive of The Motherland Group .
" We visited the site of the slave port in Badagry and Marlon turned to me and said : ' Let 's put it here , this is right ' .
" It 's such an emotional place , and I think we all felt that it was the right place to have the Jackson family memorial . "
Money
But respected writer and historian Toyin Falola has condemned the project .
" It is not appropriate from a cultural or historical point of view .
Those who are looking for money care about money and no other thing , " he said .
THE SLAVE TRADE Transatlantic slave trade ran between 1650 and 1866 About 10.2 m slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa 35 % came from the Niger River area 10 - 20 % died on the journey An estimated 4.5 % died in slave ports like Badagry Source : slavevoyages.org
The professor of history at the University of Texas and author of many books on the Nigerian diaspora and African - American history said the development was exploiting painful history .
" Money - making and historical memory are allies in the extension of capitalism .
You cry with one eye and wipe it off with cold beer , leaving the other eye open for gambling , " he said .
Writer , columnist and PR consultant C Don Adinuba said if the resort was being built by a company run by a white person , there would be uproar .
" This plan is morally reprehensible , it 's like dancing on the graves of dead people and telling them you 're honouring them . "
The developers say they will treat the slave memorial with sensitivity .
They hope it will become a " historical destination " similar to the Holocaust museum in Berlin .
The luxury hotels near the site will provide jobs and development to the local economy , they say .
' Aggressive '
The developers , who include the creator of the hit TV series Power Rangers , have ambitious plans for the resort .
The Motherland Group says the resort alone will pull in 1.4 m visitors in the first year , rising to 4.4 m in five years .
But that would represent an incredible increase .
Mr Loster says they will have to work with the government to change some of the bureaucratic restrictions on tourists if their project is to attract the numbers it needs .
Currently fewer than 300,000 tourists a year visit Nigeria , they say .
It is impossible to get a visa without a letter of invitation .
Flights to Nigeria are expensive , and there is little tourist infrastructure to cater for European or American consumers when they get there .
And then there is the country 's reputation as a chaotic and violent place .
Mr Loster admits their projected figures are " aggressive " .
" We know the problems facing us , we have visited Nigeria several times , " he said .

A matched pair of burlesque dancers charge in a shocking new lawsuit that they were pressured to perform “ twincest . ”
In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court , “ Porcelain Twinz ” Heather and Amber Langley say the owner of a Manhattan nightclub bullied them into performing sexual acts on each other in private with him and on stage in their erotic show .
PHOTOS : 24 Tantalizing Twins
While the Langleys had made a ca reer out of simulating sex acts with each other on stage , they “ are identi cal twin sisters who never before have engaged in incestuous sexual relations with each other either privately or professionally within the confines of their perform ance art , ” their suit says .
“ That ’s not what we ’re about , ” Heather told The Post .
The suit seeks unspecified money damages .
Accused ha rasser Simon Hammerstein , co-owner of The Box , where the twins performed , had no comment .
The sisters said they were invited to perform a two - week stint at the up scale , Lower East Side bur lesque showplace – whose patrons have reportedly included Moby , Jay - Z , Jude Law , Cameron Diaz and Lindsay Lohan .
“ It was the opportunity of a lifetime for our careers and something we were very excited about , ” Heather said .
Hammerstein offered to put them up in his loft above the club when they arrived on July 9 , 2007 , they say .
Their trial performances led to a long - term contract , and the twins retrieved their belongings from Portland , Ore .
When they returned , they were stuck stay ing with Hammerstein , and he “ commenced a campaign of sexual harassment , ” the suit says .
“ He felt free to treat them as his porcelain toys to play with at will , ” said their lawyer , Jack Tuckner .
The twins finally found their own accommodations in November , but needed Hammerstein to sign as a guarantor , the suit says .
That ’s when he called them in to his bedroom “ to talk ” – and they found him lying on the bed in his underwear , the suit says .
He told them to get in to bed with him , and “ required ” them “ to remove their underwear before demanding ” oral sex from them , the suit says .
He then allegedly ordered them to engage in oral sex with each other .
Around the same time , he also allegedly demanded they change their erotic show to include “ actual sex acts ” with each other using sex toys .
The sisters “ believed if they did not alter their performance , ” they “ would be fired , ” the suit says .
They followed orders , and the club changed the name of their act to “ Twincest . ”
Amber called it a “ huge compromise , ” but “ we made it very artistic so we could hold our heads high . ”
The act went on until last July , when they said they finally quit after the owners pushed them to take their show further .

' Self - censoring ' journalists gave visual nod to GOP : study Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday February 24 , 2009
Print This Email This Journalists , so concerned with being accused of having a liberal agenda , will at times overreact by self - censoring themselves , resulting in more favorable coverage of Republicans , a new analysis of television coverage finds .
A book by two Indiana University professors details their study of the three broadcast networks ' -- ABC , CBS and NBC -- presidential campaign coverage from 1992 to 2004 .
According to the analysis , the coverage favored Republican candidates in each election .
" We do n't think this is journalists conspiring to favor Republicans .
We think they 're just so beat up and tired of being accused of a liberal bias that they unknowingly give Republicans the benefit in coverage , " said Maria Elizabeth Grabe , an associate professor at IU , who along with Associate Professor Erik Bucy , wrote Image Bite Politics : News and the Visual Framing of Elections .
" It 's self - censorship that journalists might be imposing on themselves . "
Grabe and Bucy 's book is the first major research project to analyze the visual coverage of presidential elections and how it influences public opinion , according to a press release on the book .
The authors examined 62 hours of network news coverage between Labor Day and Election Day over the four presidential elections .
Among their findings were that candidates were steadily shown more visually in so - called image bites , while their verbal statements , or sound bites , shortened in average length .
Notably , cable news outlets , including CNN and Fox News , were not included in their research .
The professors are now looking at 2008 election coverage .
More so than the networks , cable news outlets have received the most criticism of bias in their broadcasts with Fox News generally being accused of a conservative bias and MSNBC generally accused of a liberal bias .
" Grabe and Bucy found the volume of news coverage focusing exclusively on each party -- one measure of media bias -- favored Republicans .
Their research found there were more single - party stories about Republicans overall and in each election year except 1992 , " reads the release .
The authors examined one of the most negative forms of image bites , the " lip - flap shot , " in which a reporter 's narration is overlaid on video of the candidate talking .
In their findings , Democrats were more likely than Republicans to be given the " lip - flap shot . "
" This phenomenon , though relatively easy to find in news coverage of elections , is generally viewed as a violation of professional television news production standards that has detrimental consequences , " said the authors .
" Not only is ' lip - flap ' unflattering for the candidate who appears . . . but it also distracts from the reporter 's narration because viewers focus attention on making sense of what the lip flapper appears to be saying . "
Also looked at was the " Goldilocks effect , " which is who was given the last say in a piece and so better remembered by viewers .
The authors found that Republicans were more likely to get the last word in every presidential election studied but the 2004 election .
Interestingly , the findings of Image Bite Politics contravene the results of a 2005 UCLA - led study which found that there was a liberal media bias .
That study examined not only the networks but also newspapers , cable news , prominent blogs and public radio .
Of the 20 major media outlets studied by UCLA , 18 scored left - of - center , with CBS ' " Evening News , " The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second , third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal .
Only Fox News ' " Special Report With Brit Hume " and The Washington Times scored right of the average U.S. voter , according to a UCLA press release on the study .
The UCLA study found that the most centrist outlets were the " News Hour With Jim Lehrer , " CNN's " NewsNight With Aaron Brown " and ABC's " Good Morning America . "
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Back in the heady days of September 2007 I was at an arms fair in the Docklands in London , though to avoid confusion I should add I was outside speaking against it , rather than inside browsing .
The crowd I addressed was a mixture of Quakers and crusties and for my troubles the police stopped and searched me as I left the event , an incident that I wrote about in Cif .
When the police conduct a stop and search they have to fill out a form giving their reasons and hand a copy over to you .
On mine they wrote that Mr Thomas appeared to be an " influential individual " – a quote I intend to use in future publicity – and had attempted to walk past the police with an " over - confident manner " – always a sure sign of criminal intent .
Maybe I am wrong , perhaps there is a forensic linkage with having an " over - confident manner " and criminality , perhaps the police routinely chase suspects through our metropolis shouting , " Stop him , he 's got a jaunty demeanour ! "
But I got the distinct impression the police were stopping me because they thought they could .
My rakish over - confidence might be the reason I was stopped but the official purpose was to look for items I might use to commit criminal damage ( the arms fair had been subject to a paint attack earlier in the day ) .
So exactly what tools did the police hope to find rummaging through my wallet ?
Unless my wallet possessed some Tardis - like qualities it was unlikely that a large crowbar might clatter out from between a photo of my daughter and my British Library card ?
Was n't this intrusive as well as unlawful ?
Although protesters are often targeted for stop and search , often claiming these are unlawful , they seldom seem to put in official complaints .
So with the help of solicitors at Fisher Meredith I brought a complaint against the police .
Being Britain the first step in a complaint against an official body is for the very body you are complaining about to investigate itself .
And lo the police did find themselves innocent .
In official interviews the officers who conducted the stop and search described me as " pleasant and conversational throughout the incident " and thus were " surprised and disappointed that Mr Thomas has made this complaint " .
Please note that it is me that has disappointed them in this complaint , we had a bond in those moments you see , a brief passing moment of pleasant intimacy , then I let them down .
I do n't return their calls , ignore them in the street and am later seen being searched by other police officers .
In their logic my decent behaviour exonerates their bad behaviour .
So had I been rude or surly would this have implied guilt on their part ?
If when stopped I had responded by saying , " Fuck off copper " , would they have blinked and spluttered , " Oh blimey , you got me bang to rights guv 'nor !
It 's an unlawful search , an ' no mistake . "
How else are we meant to respond to the police if not politely ?
If innocent people respond rudely they become guilty by default .
Suffice to say the police deemed there was " no case to answer " .
So pressing on , the issue was put before the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) .
Now the IPCC generally attack the police with all the effective ferocity of a moth taking on a lightbulb .
So I was somewhat taken aback when at the end of last year they declared that they " consider[ed ] the stop and search of Mr Thomas and the subsequent search of his wallet was unlawful " .
And that " it would appear that the officers had misinterpreted their powers under PACE ( Police And Criminal Evidence Act ) " .
In an earlier point in the investigation the police said they had stopped everyone at the demo with a bag , this the IPCC said was " an indication that the officers did not consider whether or not they had reasonable grounds to suspect each individual may have been in possession of items to use in criminal damage " .
Fifteen months after the event the police have been found to be acting unlawfully .
So what sanctions do the police face ?
" The appropriate way to address the failure in standards is that the officer is given words of advice , " says the IPCC , " Such advice is neither given nor received lightly and is delivered by a senior member of the officer 's management team . "
I am sure you will agree this is a daunting sanction .
The debate about the use of stop and search – be it protesters or young black and Asian men , be it in the case of stopping knife crime or deterring terrorism – is one that has understandably perhaps been fixed on the police results rather than the times they get it wrong .
But it is in the cases where they get it wrong that attitudes towards police are sharpened and the rights we feel we have as citizens practically defined .
So I am writing to the police requesting a formal admission of liability on the part of the commissioner and damages for assault and false imprisonment .

This story begins not in a galaxy far away , but at a Milwaukee rummage sale a few years ago .
Tom Lynch paid $ 10 for an odd hunk of metal he figured might be copper or bronze with potential salvage value .
He had no idea it had dropped from space into the Arizona desert some 50,000 years ago .
" For the last two years , it kept my grandson 's basketball hoop from blowing over in the yard .
It weighs 50 pounds , " said Lynch , a retired foundry and General Motors worker who lives in South Milwaukee .
Recently , he saw a show about meteorites on the Travel Channel and realized that 's probably what he had .
It was curious , he thought , that the thing never oxidized in the weather .
Following advice from the TV show , he held a magnet up to the object and it stuck .
He took his 4.6 billion - year - old find to the Milwaukee Public Museum and then to Chicago 's Field Museum last month .
The scientists got excited .
Yes , they said , it 's a meteorite .
He got one offer from a collector for $ 10,000 , but soon had a sense from Internet research that a meteorite with this unique basket shape might fetch closer to $ 100,000 .
Before he could get too excited , a call came from Jim DuFoe , a minerals expert he had consulted .
Bad news , DuFoe said .
The meteorite was stolen in 1968 from the Meteor Crater Visitor Center near Flagstaff .
He had himself a hot rock .
DuFoe remembers Lynch 's reply : " We ca n't sell what we do n't own . "
So Lynch plans to toss the meteorite in the car and personally deliver it to the visitor center on the crater 's edge .
" It was going along pretty good there for a while .
I 've been really lucky in my life , so this does n't faze me , " he said .
" I 've got mixed emotions .
I 'm glad it 's going back and a lot of people will be able to see it .
And I 'm feeling sorry I did n't get $ 100,000 for it . "
Lynch , 62 , is more of a car buff than a space nut , but he 's getting a kick out of his meteoric leap into the geological realm .
Conversation piece
On Tuesday , he invited me to see the meteorite at Market Place Café , a restaurant he likes in Oak Creek .
The deceivingly heavy chunk of mostly iron and nickel sat on a table in the basement banquet room , and a stream of customers and employees came to see and photograph it .
DuFoe was there , and so was Peter Sheehan , curator of geology at the Milwaukee Public Museum .
Sheehan said he regularly is approached by people who think they have a meteorite .
It 's usually slag from the foundry process .
" I think in 30 - some years I 've identified one other , maybe two , " he said .
At the Chicago museum , where they sawed off a little piece for analysis , they were similarly thrilled by Lynch 's find .
" It was like a ' Tom and Jerry ' moment .
Eyeballs bulged and jaws hit the floor , " said DuFoe , who runs a business out of Rockton , Ill. , called Geoscience Collections Services .
The 10 - inch - tall meteorite is brownish with knobby protrusions and little caves and dents and what looks like a handle .
It traveled here as part of the massive Canyon Diablo meteor , which strayed from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and said hello to Earth with a crater not quite a mile wide and 550 feet deep .
Most of the meteor vaporized on impact .
More than 250,000 people a year visit the site , which opened as an attraction in 1942 , said Brad Andes , president of Meteor Crater Enterprises .
The basket meteorite now held by Tom Lynch was found by a rancher three miles from the crater and permanently lent to the Meteor Crater facility .
Because of its novel shape , it was a favorite piece , and in fact was featured on a postcard the museum used to sell ( which now is peddled on eBay ) .
On Aug. 12 , 1968 , someone walked away with the meteorite , according to an article in the Yuma newspaper .
At the time , the value was placed at $ 5,000 , and the Coconino County sheriff issued a nationwide bulletin for its return .
About five years ago , Andes received a phone call from a lawyer who said he represented the family who had the piece .
" He would n't give me his name .
The people were really paranoid about the legal ramifications of having that in their possession , " Andes said .
The lawyer hinted at a reward , but Andes said thieves do n't deserve that .
The man never called back .
Lynch does not remember where the rummage sale was where he made the find .
Lynch said the visitor center is rewarding him with $ 1,000 , which he is happily accepting .
Andes said Lynch is doing the honest thing and the decent thing , which is no guarantee in the world of meteorite collectors .
" That says a lot about his character , " Andes said .
A tribute to Lynch will be posted at the museum , and the basket meteorite will once again be displayed .
Under glass this time .

Sure , anyone can write CSS .
Even programs are doing it for you now .
But is the CSS any good ?
Here are 5 tips to start improving yours .
1. Reset
Seriously , always use a reset of some sort .
Whether you are using the Eric Meyer Reset , the YUI Reset , or your own custom reset , just use something .
It can be as simple as removing the margin and padding from all elements :
The Eric Meyer and YUI Resets are awesome , but to me , they just go too far .
I feel like you end up resetting everything , and then redefining a lot of properties on the elements .
This is why Eric Meyer recommends that you should not just take his reset stylesheet and drop it in your projects if there is a more effective way of using it .
Tweak it .
Build on it .
Make it your own .
Oh and please , stop this :
It takes more time to process , and what do you think should happen to a radio button when you remove the padding ?
Form elements can sometimes do some funky things , so it may be best to just leave some of them alone .
2. Alphabetize
A Little Quiz
Which example would you think is faster to find the margin - right property ?
Example 1
Example 2
You ca n’t tell me that Example 2 is n’t faster .
By alphabetizing your properties , you are creating this consistency that will help you reduce the time you spend searching for a specific property .
I know some people who organize one way and others who organize another , but at my company , we made a consensus decision to all organize alphabetically .
It has definitely helped when working with other people ’s code .
I cringe every time I go into a stylesheet where the properties are not sorted alphabetically .
3. Organization
You should organize your stylesheet so that it is easy to find things and related items are close together .
Use comments effectively .
For example , this is how I structure my stylesheets :
By using comments and grouping similar elements , it becomes much quicker to find what you are looking for .
4. Consistency
Whatever way you decide to code , stick with it .
I am sick and tired of the whole 1 line vs. multiple lines for your CSS debate .
There is no debate !
Everyone has their own opinion , so pick what works for you and stick with it throughout the stylesheet .
Personally , I use a combination of both .
If a selector is going to have more than 3 properties , I break it to multiple lines :
It works for me because 3 properties is about what fits on 1 line in my text editor before wrapping to another line .
So just figure out what works for you and be consistent .
5 . Start in the right place
Do n’t you dare touch your stylesheet until you have written your markup !
When I am preparing to slice a site , I go through and mark - up the entire document from the opening body tag to the closing body tag before even creating a CSS file .
I do n’t add any superfluous divs , ids , or classes .
I will add some generic divs like header , content , footer because I know these things are going to exist .
By marking up the document first , you wo n’t run into such diseases as divitis and classitis , which can sometimes be fatal !
You only need to add in that stuff once you have begun to write the CSS and realize that you are going to need another hook to accomplish what you are trying to achieve .
Utilize CSS ’s descendant selectors to target children elements ; do n’t just automatically add a class or id to the element .
Just remember , CSS is worthless without a well formatted document .
* Editor 's Note : I can't stress this point enough .
As Trevor said , do n't even touch your CSS file until the markup is 100 % complete .
Conclusion
These are just some of the tips that help me to write better code .
This is by no means the end of the list .
As I come up with others , I ’ll share .
What tips do you have for writing better CSS ?
Researchers at the Centenary Institute in Sydney have discovered a molecule on the surface of immune cells which plays a critical role in cancer rejection .
Using advanced multi-photon microscopy , the scientists have tracked the migration of immune cells called T cells within tumours in experimental models , and found that the surface molecule ( CD44 ) directly impacts whether a tumour progresses or is rejected by T cells .
Professor Wolfgang Weninger , Head of the Immune Imaging program at Centenary , says this discovery advances our knowledge of the immune processes at play in cancer .
" The immune system and cancer were first linked in the 1900s but it was n't until the 1980s that interactions between the immune system and cancer cells became a focus for medical researchers , " says Professor Weninger .
" We know that migration of T cells within tumours is very important for rejection but we did n't know about how it worked .
We found that this particular molecule regulates the navigation of T cells in tumours .
In its absence , T cells are inhibited in migration and show a defect in their ability to reject a tumour . "
Understanding how tumours avoid the natural processes of the immune system is one of the biggest questions in cancer .
Finding the answer could significantly improve cancer treatment .
Professor Weninger explains : " By understanding how the immune system fights tumours , we may be able to optimise cancer therapies in the future .
It may provide the opportunity to design treatments that mimic certain aspects of immune responses and cellular processes , making cancer treatments less hit and miss and reducing the toll on patients . "
Centenary Institute Executive Director , Professor Mathew Vadas , points out this discovery has been made possible by recent advances in research technology – in particular multi-photon microscopy .
" Previously , cancer researchers could only build assumptions by linking series ' of still images of the immune system at work , " Professor Vadas says .
" Multi- photon microscopy allows us to make real time movies showing exactly how the immune cells interact and is opening up new frontiers for medical research . "
Professor Weninger , a world leader in this form of imaging , is driving this research revolution using one of Australia 's first multi-photon microscopes at the Centenary Institute in Sydney .
This discovery firmly places Professor Weninger and his team 's focus on the next piece of the puzzle - how does the actual process of tumour rejection work ?
" This next stage of our research is very exciting .
What are the physical interactions of T cells and tumours and how do the T cells actually defeat a tumour ? " says Professor Weninger .
" If we can get to the bottom of these immune system interplays , the benefits for cancer patients around the world could be truly enormous . "
The stu­dents at Mia­mi Edi­son Senior High School in Flori­da ​ “ fail ” every day .
Edi­son is a text­book exam­ple of the strug­gling urban school : dis­mal test scores , high dropout rates , a rep­u­ta­tion for vio­lence and a large­ly poor , black stu­dent body .
‘ It ’s no coincidence that the schools that are failing are in the harshest neighborhoods .
There are no street lights , no police .
It ’s filthy , there are drug addicts and prostitutes walking the streets . ’
So , it was no sur­prise when the Flori­da Depart­ment of Edu­ca­tion gave Edi­son a grade of ​ “ F ” for the 2007 – 2008 school year – a des­ig­na­tion that , under the fed­er­al dic­tates of No Child Left Behind , is sup­posed to com­pel the school to revamp itself .
But cur­rent senior Tranette Myrthil sees the government ’s report card as part of the fail­ure .
The school ​ “ reforms ” the state has hand­ed down are squeez­ing out the things that make edu­ca­tion mean­ing­ful for her .
Myrthil rel­ished read­ing in Eng­lish class , and is frus­trat­ed that her class spent so much time drilling for the FCAT ( Florida ’s mul­ti­ple - choice read­ing test ) , instead of delv­ing into more nov­els .
In the end , she got a 10th - grade read­ing score of two ( on a scale of five ) – a grade that she says ​ “ does n’t speak for me . ”
Recall­ing books that stirred her , she says , ​ “ I learned things that I could use now … in the 12th grade . ”
But the mate­r­i­al she stud­ied to pass the FCAT , ​ “ I ca n’t bring with me to the 12th grade , because it ’s just for that moment .
It ’s just for that test . ”
After sev­en years of the Bush administration ’s land­mark edu­ca­tion law , No Child Left Behind , a dis­con­nect remains between the edu­ca­tion­al demands imposed on stu­dents like Myrthil , and what Myrthil wish­es she could demand from her education .
Class­room politics
The premise of No Child Left Behind , passed in 2001 , sounds basic enough : ensure that chil­dren from all back­grounds attain a qual­i­ty edu­ca­tion from good teach­ers .
But the debate over how to reach that goal is frac­tured by ide­ol­o­gy , bureau­cra­cy and entrenched bar­ri­ers to opportunity .
Main­stream reform dis­cus­sions have cen­tered on ​ “ school choice ” ini­tia­tives that move pub­lic invest­ment toward less - reg­u­lat­ed char­ter schools and pri­vate ser­vices .
Mar­ket - ori­ent­ed reform­ers , both Repub­li­cans and Democ­rats , cham­pi­on exper­i­men­tal char­ter schools and rigid , test - cen­tered ​ “ account­abil­i­ty ” man­dates for teach­ers – mea­sures that have attract­ed polit­i­cal momen­tum but also alien­at­ed teacher unions .
Oth­er advo­cates , includ­ing one of Pres­i­dent Obama ’s lead­ing edu­ca­tion advis­ers , Lin­da Dar­ling - Ham­mond , favor more coop­er­a­tive strate­gies , focus­ing on com­pre­hen­sive teacher train­ing and aca­d­e­m­ic stan­dards that extend beyond rote skills .
Pro­gres­sive edu­ca­tion activists point to social fac­tors dri­ving racial and eco­nom­ic gaps in achievement .
Edu­ca­tion was a side issue in the pres­i­den­tial race .
But after get­ting mired in polit­i­cal grid­lock through­out the Bush era , activists hope the Oba­ma admin­is­tra­tion will recast the debate on how to make pub­lic schools work for all communities .
Under No Child Left Behind , schools that con­sis­tent­ly miss year­ly tar­gets for read­ing and math improve­ments and oth­er cri­te­ria may be hit with strict sanc­tions .
Reform mea­sures could range from pri­vate tutor­ing to full - scale state takeover or con­ver­sion to a char­ter school .
For the past few years in Mia­mi , Edison ’s teach­ers and admin­is­tra­tors have worked under gov­ern­ment man­dates to boost stu­dent per­for­mance by dra­mat­i­cal­ly restruc­tur­ing pro­grams and staff .
School sys­tems in Wash­ing­ton , D.C. , New York City and oth­er areas have float­ed ini­tia­tives to weed out sup­pos­ed­ly incom­pe­tent teach­ers or to tie pay scales to staff per­for­mance .
Obama ’s pick for edu­ca­tion sec­re­tary , Arne Dun­can , is seen as a mod­er­ate but gained promi­nence as head of Chica­go Pub­lic Schools by push­ing for the clo­sure of under­per­form­ing schools and boost­ing charters .
But pro­gres­sives in the edu­ca­tion com­mu­ni­ty ques­tion con­ven­tion­al notions of ​ “ achieve­ment ” and ​ “ fail­ure . ”
To Mil­dred Bove­da , a spe­cial - edu­ca­tion teacher at Myr­tle Grove Ele­men­tary School in Mia­mi Gar­dens , Fla. , the obsta­cle to real change is the con­fine­ment of the school pol­i­cy dia­logue with­in class­room walls .
“ It ’s not a coin­ci­dence that the schools that are fail­ing are in the harsh­est neigh­bor­hoods .
There ’s social issues that are going on , ” she says .
The cri­sis in schools par­al­lels oth­er com­mu­ni­ty prob­lems : ​ “ There are no street lights , there are no police .
It ’s filthy , there are drug addicts and pros­ti­tutes walk­ing the streets .
You ’re going to tell me that that ’s not going to affect teacher morale , stu­dent morale and then stu­dent per­for­mance – then you ’re kid­ding me . ”
Smarter than the test
Edison ’s stu­dents are n’t the only ones in trou­ble .
Accord­ing to 2007 – 2008 state data com­piled by Edu­ca­tion Week , near­ly 30,000 schools missed ​ “ ade­quate year­ly progress ” bench­marks .
For 2007 , while a large por­tion of all stu­dents fell short of state pro­fi­cien­cy lev­els in read­ing and math , fail­ure was espe­cial­ly preva­lent among low - income , black , Lati­no and Native Amer­i­can students .
At Edi­son , the polit­i­cal fren­zy over stan­dards trans­lates into a dis­en­gaged class­room .
Myrthil says that while her read­ing score left her dis­cour­aged about the sys­tem , some fel­low stu­dents , faced with repeat­ed fail­ures , do n’t even attend class anymore .
“ Know­ing that you ’re smarter than what this test is say­ing – but you still ca n’t pass it – it makes you feel angry and frus­trat­ed , ” she says .
Mean­while , schools are hurtling toward No Child ’s key dead­line – all stu­dents at grade - lev­el read­ing and math pro­fi­cien­cy by 2014 .
Teach­ers , crit­ics warn , are pres­sured to align cur­ric­u­la with tests , in turn sap­ping resources from sub­jects like music and art , and under­min­ing edu­ca­tion­al approach­es based on crit­i­cal think­ing and dialogue .
For pro­gres­sive edu­ca­tors , the stiff bureau­cra­cy of the test­ing estab­lish­ment runs counter to both stu­dents ’ inter­ests and teach­ers ’ aspirations .
“ I ’m glad the prin­ci­pals are pay­ing atten­tion to what stu­dents are n’t gain­ing , and what we are going to do to make sure that they can gain , ” Bove­da says .
​ “ But at the same time , I wish there was more than just that state test . ”
High - stakes tests tend to demor­al­ize rather than moti­vate , she says : ​“ Stu­dents and teach­ers get phys­i­cal­ly sick .
That ’s how much we want to pre­pare for this test .
But it ’s like the whole thing is set up for you to fail , anyways . ”
One loom­ing con­cern about test - based account­abil­i­ty sys­tems is that they might actu­al­ly dri­ve schools to dilute or erode stan­dards – dumb­ing down tests , for exam­ple , or eas­ing the cre­den­tial­ing process for teach­ers .
In a recent Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go study , researchers linked high - stakes test schemes to a pat­tern of short­chang­ing under­served stu­dents : teach­ers would con­cen­trate on stu­dents most like­ly to reach pro­fi­cien­cy , poten­tial­ly leav­ing strug­gling kids , who need the most help , to fall fur­ther behind advan­taged peers .
Pro­gres­sive edu­ca­tion activists argue that one - dimen­sion­al test­ing repli­cates and deep­ens struc­tur­al bias­es by fur­ther stig­ma­tiz­ing blacks , Lati­nos , Eng­lish - lan­guage learn­ers and oth­er mar­gin­al­ized groups .
JoEt­ta Gon­za­les , direc­tor of Equi­ty Alliance at Ari­zona State Uni­ver­si­ty , one of 10 region­al equi­ty assis­tance cen­ters for schools nation­wide , says that in prin­ci­ple , the stan­dards them­selves are not harm­ful , but ​ “ it ’s the instruc­tion­al prac­tices that are fail­ing the communities . ”
In racial­ly and eco­nom­i­cal­ly mar­gin­al­ized com­mu­ni­ties , she says , ​“ one of the things that ’s being left out is adapt­ing and mod­i­fy­ing the cur­ricu­lum so that it ’s cul­tur­al­ly respon­sive , and that it incor­po­rates the learn­ing inter­ests of the stu­dents that they ’re teaching . ”
Teacher - ori­ent­ed reform­ers pro­mote more holis­tic , par­tic­i­pa­to­ry teach­ing prac­tices ; peer - review sys­tems for eval­u­at­ing staff per­for­mance ; and alter­na­tive assess­ment meth­ods for stu­dents , like port­fo­lios and cre­ative projects .
Mark Simon , nation­al coor­di­na­tor of the Tom Mooney Insti­tute for Teacher and Union Lead­er­ship , a pro-union reform group , says test - based pro­grams do n’t encom­pass the intel­lec­tu­al chal­lenges stu­dents will face in the real world .
​ “ There has to be a shift , ” he says , ​“ toward learn­ing how to think , learn­ing how to prob­lem - solve , and learn­ing how to grap­ple with infor­ma­tion that you ’ve nev­er seen before and make sense out of it . ”
Just anoth­er pattern
In Mia­mi , Myrthil is far removed from the school reform debate in Wash­ing­ton , but nev­er­the­less grasps the root caus­es behind her school ’s cri­sis .
Last school year , she worked with class­mates to explore edu­ca­tion­al qual­i­ty as a civ­il rights issue in Project POW­ER – Pro­mot­ing Our Will through Edu­ca­tion and Research – an action - research ini­tia­tive at Edi­son that engaged youth as edu­ca­tion researchers and advo­cates .
Myrthil real­ized that stu­dents in more afflu­ent areas had access to tutor­ing , arts pro­grams and oth­er enrich­ments that are nowhere to be found in her school ’s community .
“ I feel like we should have the same oppor­tu­ni­ties , ” Myrthil says .
​ “ But the peo­ple han­dling the school sys­tem – they feel like : ​‘ Oh , this is where we came from , and this is where our par­ents came from , and it ’ll just be anoth­er pattern . ’ ”
Though No Child Left Behind ’s test­ing fix­a­tion alien­ates many edu­ca­tors , the nation­wide col­lec­tion and analy­sis of test data under the law has fueled advo­ca­cy around racial and eco­nom­ic dis­par­i­ties .
Still , edu­ca­tion activists say the harsh man­dates leave schools with­out the fund­ing or flex­i­bil­i­ty need­ed to con­front sys­temic inequities .
No Child ’s sta­tis­tics under­score the blight of school seg­re­ga­tion , says John Beam , exec­u­tive direc­tor of Ford­ham University ’s Nation­al Cen­ter for Schools and Com­mu­ni­ties .
But ulti­mate­ly , he says , ​ “ I do n’t think we ’ll have bet­ter pub­lic schools until we ’re will­ing to take on insti­tu­tion­al racism in our urban school sys­tems and to be seri­ous about the inequitable dis­tri­b­u­tion of resources that it causes . ”
Richard Kahlen­berg , a senior fel­low with the lib­er­al Cen­tu­ry Foun­da­tion think tank , sug­gests eco­nom­ic inte­gra­tion can alle­vi­ate school dis­par­i­ties , chiefly by expand­ing No Child ’s school trans­fer pro­vi­sions .
The idea is to allow stu­dents to move from fail­ing schools to bet­ter ones – typ­i­cal­ly in high­er - income com­mu­ni­ties that pro­vide bet­ter teach­ers and oth­er aca­d­e­m­ic supports .
“ Prob­a­bly the sin­gle best thing you could do for a low - income stu­dent is give her a chance to attend a mid­dle - class school , ” Kahlen­berg says .
Yet reform­ers tak­ing a long - range view con­tend trans­fer pro­grams will not tru­ly equal­ize a sys­tem that lacks the resources to ensure every kid a spot at a qual­i­ty school .
Rather than shut­tling stu­dents around , they say school pol­i­cy should focus on build­ing the capac­i­ty of under­served com­mu­ni­ties to edu­cate their chil­dren well .
Nik­isha Valdez , a social stud­ies teacher at Edi­son who helped lead Project POW­ER , says that over time , the school has lost stu­dents through trans­fers , but in many cas­es , ​“ if the resources were there , if we had the sup­port that we need , we could ful­fill that goal for them .
It ’s real­ly sad , espe­cial­ly when you think of Edi­son being such a fix­ture in the community . ”
Beyond No Child
Years after No Child Left Behind promised to trans­form pub­lic edu­ca­tion , polit­i­cal dis­cus­sions still hinge on a basic ques­tion :
How broad­ly should the chal­lenge of fix­ing schools be defined ?
While the class­room offers a start­ing point for address­ing inequal­i­ty , not even the best - equipped school can lev­el out the skewed social land­scape stu­dents go home to each day .
To New York Uni­ver­si­ty edu­ca­tion pro­fes­sor Deb­o­rah Meier , pol­i­cy­mak­ers can’t tack­le school reform with­out a deep­er con­scious­ness of under­ly­ing socioe­co­nom­ic barriers .
“ We have only one area in Amer­i­can life , vir­tu­al­ly , that we demand equal­i­ty from , and that is test scores in schools , ” she says .
With­in No Child ’s nar­row frame­work of account­abil­i­ty ​ “ we want test scores to be more equal , but do we want people ’s incomes to be more equal ?
Do we want people ’s health to be more equal ? ”
In oth­er pol­i­cy are­nas , she adds , ​“ there ’s been a con­cert­ed dri­ve against that egal­i­tar­i­an notion . ”
Recent­ly , a coali­tion of pro­gres­sive reform­ers and civ­il rights activists pre­sent­ed a ​ “ broad­er , bold­er approach to edu­ca­tion ” that empha­sizes social pro­grams to advance edu­ca­tion­al and eco­nom­ic oppor­tu­ni­ty : expand­ing health­care for fam­i­lies , strength­en­ing rela­tion­ships between com­mu­ni­ties and schools ; improv­ing out - of - school enrich­ment pro­grams for neigh­bor­hood youth .
Louie F. Rodriguez , a Flori­da Inter­na­tion­al Uni­ver­si­ty edu­ca­tion pro­fes­sor who launched Project POW­ER , says nation­al pol­i­cy should empow­er com­mu­ni­ties to shape schools from the ground up , through local youth , par­ents and oth­er stakeholders .
“ It would be pret­ty amaz­ing , ” Rodriguez says , ​ “ if Oba­ma said , ​‘We need teach­ers that are going to moti­vate stu­dents , that believe in stu­dents , that are going to have high expec­ta­tions for stu­dents . ’
And then leave it up to the local com­mu­ni­ty peo­ple to define what high expec­ta­tions look like . …
We need to fun­da­men­tal­ly change the way we do things in our edu­ca­tion sys­tem by shift­ing the role that stu­dents , edu­ca­tors and com­mu­ni­ties play in the reform process . ”
“ If you ’re look­ing for poli­cies that will improve out­comes for kids in low - per­form­ing schools , that has to be dri­ven by peo­ple who deeply under­stand pub­lic edu­ca­tion , ” says Stan Karp , a vet­er­an teacher work­ing with the pro­gres­sive edu­ca­tion jour­nal Rethink­ing Schools .
​ “ If the admin­is­tra­tion relies on social engi­neer­ing , by peo­ple who basi­cal­ly want to break up the pub­lic sys­tem and blame teach­ers and their orga­ni­za­tions for its prob­lems , then we ’re going to have the same kind of fights that we ’ve had for the last eight years , and we ’re not going to get the progress that we need . ”
Teach­ers like Bove­da , her­self a grad­u­ate of local pub­lic schools , know what a real con­ver­sa­tion about edu­ca­tion might sound like .
“ Instead of stig­ma­tiz­ing the school and putting more pres­sure on stu­dents , ” she says , ​“ let ’s talk about the social issues that are going on , with­in and out­side and around the school . ”
Such schemes have already stirred considerable controversy elsewhere in the world , including in Great Britain , where since 2005 some three dozen terror suspects have been detained for a time under house - arrest - like conditions , in some cases being required to wear ankle monitors , obey curfews , and refrain from using phones or the Internet .
In America , such a compromise is sure to alarm many human - rights advocates and civil libertarians , who regard indefinite detention as antithetical to the American legal system ’s most basic tenets .
Alberto Mora , a Republican lawyer who , as general counsel of the Navy , broke with the Bush Administration after concluding that some of its brutal counterterrorism policies were potential war crimes , warns , “ We simply ca n’t have indefinite detention .
Due process and fundamental fairness make that clear . ”
“ Well , that was a birthday party the kids wo n’t soon forget . ”

Marri himself is cautiously hopeful .
Despite restrictions on his consumption of television and print news , he followed the Presidential campaign from inside the brig .
According to Hafetz , “ He ’s happy about Obama , but worried he wo n’t be able to fulfill all the promises and expectations . ”
Through his lawyers , Marri , speaking publicly for the first time , said , “ I am not asking to be taken at my word and to be released , although I very much want to go home to my family .
All I am asking for is to be treated like every other person in the United States who is accused of a crime , including terrorism , and to be given a fair trial in an American court . ”
As a candidate , Obama promised a sharp break with the Bush Administration ’s counter terrorism policies .
In a written statement for the Boston Globe , Obama , who taught constitutional law in the nineteen - nineties , said , “ I reject the Bush Administration ’s claim that the President has plenary authority under the Constitution to detain U.S. citizens without charges as unlawful enemy combatants . ”
( In fact , the Bush Administration went beyond this claim , arguing that Congress had explicitly granted the President this authority , in a bill passed after the attacks . )
In the Globe , Obama went on , “ The detention of American citizens , without access to counsel , fair procedure , or pursuant to judicial authorization , as enemy combatants is unconstitutional . ”
In his Inaugural Address , Obama further underscored his differences with Bush in this area , saying , “ As for our common defense , we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . ”
A top legal adviser to Obama told me that the President also believes that legal residents in America , like Marri , are entitled to due process .
Former Bush Administration officials who were involved in its anti-terror program suggest that Obama may find it harder than expected to translate idealistic rhetoric into action .
“ Governing is different from campaigning , ” says Bellinger , who predicts that Obama and his officials will soon discover that “ they ca n’t just set the clocks back eight years , and try every terror suspect captured abroad in the federal courts . ”
Bellinger now says that the treatment of Marri was a “ failed experiment . ”
John Ashcroft , who was Attorney General when Marri was designated an enemy combatant , makes no such apologies .
Interviewed just before the Inauguration , he defended what he described as a “ sound decision ” to “ maximize the national interest , ” and predicted that , in the end , President Obama ’s approach to handling terror suspects would closely mirror his own : “ How will he be different ?
The main difference is going to be that he spells his name ‘ O - b - a - m - a , ’ not ‘ B - u - s -h . ’ ”
So far , the Obama Administration has declined to state a position on the Marri case .
It ’s already becoming apparent , though , that Ashcroft was mistaken in his broader point .
Obama , in his first week in office , issued three executive orders , undoing many of the most controversial elements of the Bush Administration ’s detention and interrogation programs .
Most notably , Obama declared that the Administration hoped to close Guantánamo within a year .
A little noticed memorandum issued at the time of the orders was dedicated to Marri .
It called for a Cabinet - level inter-agency task force , led by Attorney General Eric Holder , to review Marri ’s case , with an eye toward finding alternative ways to deal with him .
The same officials will review the status of the enemy combatants held in Guantánamo .
The Obama Administration has indicated that it hopes to return the majority of the detainees to other countries , or to try them in civilian and military courts .
The looming question , however , is whether there is a category of terror suspect whose status precludes such options .
It ’s unclear whether some home countries can provide fair trials or secure prisons .
More important , the high standard of evidence required in U.S. courts — guilt must be proved “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” — might result in dangerous individuals being set free .
Qatar has made known its interest in having Marri come home .
But the Obama Administration has to decide whether he poses a recidivism risk — an assessment that has to be made , in part , on the basis of statements elicited through torture .
( Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - described mastermind of the 9/11 plot , was waterboarded by the C.I.A. , and reportedly said that Marri was a fellow - terrorist . )
As such , Marri may exemplify what Greg Craig , Obama ’s White House counsel , calls “ the toughest question ” facing the Administration as it tries to bring the Bush program within the rule of law : what to do with the so - called “ third category ” of detainees — suspects who may be difficult to convict under the American standards of justice , but who may pose a palpable threat if released .
Depending upon how many such “ hard cases ” exist , Craig says , the Administration will decide whether new laws , including possibly those enabling some sort of preventive detention , are necessary .
Although the detainees from the Bush era pose the most immediate problem , he said , it ’s possible that the new Administration may also want to handle future prisoners outside the existing criminal - and military - court system .
“ A good deal of policy research remains , ” he said .
“ The door was not left open by accident .
Obama wants the freedom to hear the recommendations of the most experienced and smartest people , on how to protect the American people while still respecting the rules of the road on liberty . ”
He suggested that the Administration would prefer not to go in that direction .
“ It ’s possible but hard to imagine Barack Obama as the first President of the United States to introduce a preventive - detention law , ” Craig said .
“ Our presumption is that there is no need to create a whole new system .
Our system is very capable . ”
Then again , the idea is not being ruled out , which may be surprising to some constituents , given Obama ’s past support for civil liberties and Craig ’s own record — in the early nineties , he served as the chairman of the board of the International Human Rights Law Group , an advocacy organization now known as Global Rights .
Obama ’s legal team is aware that every step it takes will be seen as an indication of core convictions .
Craig , who will coördinate the revamping of the Bush Administration ’s legal policies on terrorism , said , “ One way we ’ve looked at this is that we own the solution .
We do n’t own the problem — it was created by the previous Administration .
But we ’ll be held accountable for how we handle this . ”
The Obama Administration has already inflamed some members of the human - rights community .
On February 9th , the Justice Department adopted the same position that Bush had taken in a case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The government attempted to squelch a lawsuit initiated by a group of terrorist suspects — one of whom had allegedly been tortured in Morocco after being transferred there by the C.I.A.— on the ground that it would open up state secrets .
Scott Horton , a law professor at Columbia University , characterized the new Justice Department ’s position as a betrayal of the “ promises of transparency and accountability ” made by Obama during the campaign .
The first step in cases such as Marri’s , Craig suggests , will be to evaluate the “ dangerousness ” of each detainee , and to scrutinize all documents passed on by the previous Administration .
“ We need the facts , ” he said .
“ And we need fresh eyes . ”
For years , John Ashcroft has justified the military detention of Marri as a safety precaution .
“ Sometimes the criminal courts are not up to it , ” he told me .
But , as the new team reviews Marri ’s story , it will likely find ample grounds to reassess the notion that the courts can’t handle terror suspects , and that such suspects ca n’t be safely housed in the United States without incident .
In a recent interview , David Kelley , a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York , who supervised the early stages of the Marri case , revealed that he had warned his bosses in the Justice Department that they were making a mistake by sidestepping the criminal courts .
Kelley co-chaired the Justice Department ’s nationwide investigation into the 9/11 attacks , and headed the investigations into the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole , in Yemen , and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania ; he also led the prosecution of Ramzi Yousef , in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
In 2003 , he successfully prosecuted John Walker Lindh , the American accused of aiding the Taliban .
In the interview , Kelley said he believed that the government had a strong case against Marri : he had been charged with credit - card fraud , bank fraud , identity theft , and lying to a federal agent .
He thought that Marri could be convicted in a matter of a few months , and sentenced to years in prison .
Kelley , who is now a partner at Cahill Gordon , in Manhattan , was disappointed when , on the basis of a one - page executive order , Marri was suddenly sent to the brig .
“ My view is , we have n’t really exhausted the potential for using the criminal - justice system , ” he said .
James Benjamin , a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York , is now a partner at the law firm Akin Gump .
In 2008 , he co-wrote a review of the Marri case , characterizing the switch to military detention as counterproductive .
“ Definitely , the criminal - justice system can handle someone like Marri , ” he told me .
“ They caught him under the criminal - justice system .
And , based on what we know , they were poised to convict him . ”
What happened to Marri before he was moved “ proves the system was up to it . ”
Marty Lederman , a former Georgetown Law professor , whom Obama has appointed to be a deputy in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , argues that the Bush Administration ’s claims to be acting out of necessity were “ nonsense . ”
In an essay published before he joined the Administration , Lederman wrote , “ Even if everything the government alleges about al - Marri ’s ties to al Qaeda are true , ” he was not a danger “ because he was already incapacitated — imprisoned — within the criminal - justice system , where his trial was pending . ”
Marri had aroused the suspicion of law - enforcement officers almost as soon as he arrived in the Midwest with his wife , Maha , who spoke no English , and their five young children .
His timing was conspicuous — he arrived in Chicago the day before 9/11 .
The next day , the family took a hundred - and - fifty - mile taxi ride to Peoria .

Marri enrolled in computer - science classes at Bradley University , where he and a brother had obtained undergraduate degrees .
Qatar , which has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world , pays college tuition for many of its citizens , and several members of the Marri family have attended school in America .
According to the Washington Post , as an undergraduate at Bradley Marri wore a ponytail and was known for his partying and his quick sense of humor .
He returned to Qatar in 1991 , after graduation .
Later that decade , a palace coup in Qatar shook his family , eventually prompting some members to leave for Saudi Arabia , where many of his brothers and his wife now live .
Marri reportedly ended up in Afghanistan .
According to the sworn statement given by Jeffrey Rapp , the D.I.A. analyst , at some point between 1996 and 1998 Marri was trained in chemical weaponry at an Al Qaeda camp there .
( Marri , through his lawyer , denied these allegations . )
Patrick Theros , who was the U.S. Ambassador to Qatar during this period , is skeptical of the terrorism allegations .
“ I ’ve never heard anyone say this Qatari kid did anything , ” he told me .
Theros described Qatar as both religiously conservative and tolerant , and says that as far as he knows it is home to virtually no violent radical Islamic movements .
In the summer of 2000 , Marri returned to Illinois , where he allegedly registered a carpet business in Macomb , and opened multiple bank accounts , under a false name and Social Security number .
When he went back in the fall of 2001 , according to the Washington Post , he had a briefcase filled with hundred - dollar bills .
Rapp ’s statement claims that Marri had obtained more than thirteen thousand dollars in cash from Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi , the financier in the United Arab Emirates who is known to have bankrolled the September 11th hijackers .
Phone records apparently offered further evidence of a tie between Marri and Hawsawi .
Law - enforcement authorities pieced together this picture bit by bit .
In September , according to the Post , local police stopped Marri while he was driving , checked his license , and discovered an outstanding warrant for drunken driving , dating back to his earlier student days , as well as the briefcase filled with cash .
The police notified the F.B.I. Several weeks later , his lawyers say , a cell - phone salesman , noting discrepancies in Marri ’s identification documents , also called the bureau .
In October and December , 2001 , F.B.I. agents interviewed Marri ; they say that he offered to let them search his laptop computer , his minivan , and his small rental apartment .
Later , Marri ’s lawyers argued that the agents had failed to obtain a warrant , and that the information from the search could therefore not be admitted into evidence .
According to Rapp ’s statement , Marri ’s computer was filled with information on deadly poisons , including a step - by - step guide to making hydrogen cyanide — a toxic substance that can be used in poison - gas attacks .
Marri , in claiming his innocence , has had no chance to see the evidence against him .
Asked recently why he was researching such chemicals , Marri , through his lawyers , gave his first public answer .
He was “ doing research for a family member in the petrochemical industry to be used for industrial purposes .
The research involved visiting Web sites that contained hundreds of nonpoisonous chemicals ( not just cyanide ) .
And even cyanide has numerous industrial uses . ”
The laptop also reportedly contained lectures by bin Laden , and unsent e-mails to an address that Rapp said was connected to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Some of Marri ’s e-mails were encoded .
Upon discovering this information in his laptop , the F.B.I. arrested Marri as a material witness to its investigation of the attacks .
Soon after , he was charged with credit - card fraud and with failing to tell the F.B.I. about his 2000 visit to America and his phone calls to Hawsawi .
On the morning of June 23 , 2003 , only days before Marri ’s defense team was to make its arguments about suppressing the laptop and other evidence , one of his lawyers received a phone call informing him that a U.S. Attorney would be making an unexpected appearance at the courthouse that day .
President Bush , the lawyers soon learned , had signed an executive order directing the military to seize Marri .
“ We should have seen it for what it was — the foreshadowing of an Administration that was going to forsake the Constitution in the war on terror , ” Lawrence Lustberg , one of the earliest defense lawyers on what has come to be Marri ’s team , said .
“ From then on , we did n’t see Marri or hear from him again until late 2004 .
He just went into the abyss . ”
Before agreeing to transfer Marri to the brig , however , the presiding judge in the case ruled that the White House would be barred from charging Marri again with the same crimes .
In legal jargon , the original charges were “ dismissed with prejudice , ” to protect Marri ’s right not to be placed in “ double jeopardy . ”
As a result , if the Obama Administration decides to charge him in the criminal system now , it has to bring a different set of charges , unless Marri ’s lawyers offer a deal .
Benjamin , the former prosecutor , insists that “ there is a whole bag of tools for dealing with truly bad guys — there are many other statutes that the government could explore , including material support of terrorism , conspiracy charges , and mail - and wire - fraud charges . ”
But , he suggests , by taking Marri outside the regular criminal system “ there ’s no doubt they made all kinds of problems for themselves . ”
Andrew McCarthy , a former federal terrorism prosecutor who writes for National Review , defends Marri ’s transfer to the brig .
“ Sure , the criminal - justice system , by permitting Marri ’s pretrial detention , neutralized him , at least for a time , ” he says .
“ But there ’s always the chance the court will release a defendant on bail . ”
Moreover , he argues that open criminal trials run many risks , including the accidental , or oblique , disclosure of classified information .
It ’s also unclear how to handle witnesses who may themselves be terrorists : they may demand immunity before they will talk .
Or it may be that their testimony was obtained by unsavory means , which could scuttle a conviction .
In the Marri case , however , it does not appear that a fear of losing led Bush to transfer him to the Navy brig .
Kelley , for example , thought that the case the government had was “ solid . ”
Instead , it appears that the real motive was frustration on the part of the Justice Department at being unable to make Marri confess .
Kelley was told to push him hard , which he did , but Marri kept professing his innocence .
As Ashcroft wrote in his 2006 book about fighting terrorism , “ Never Again , ” “ Al - Marri rejected numerous offers to improve his lot by cooperating with the F.B.I. investigators and providing information .
He insisted on becoming a ‘ hard case . ’ ” Mark Berman , an early member of Marri ’s defense team , asserts that the Bush Administration “ really just wanted to interrogate him ” in a rough manner .
“ No doubt about it . ”
The right to remain silent is a fundamental aspect of the American justice system .
Justice John Paul Stevens , dissenting in the 2004 case Rumsfeld v. Padilla , wrote , “ Executive detention of subversive citizens , like detention of enemy soldiers to keep them off the battlefield , may sometimes be justified to prevent persons from launching or becoming missiles of destruction .
It may not , however , be justified by the naked interest in using unlawful procedures to extract information .
Incommunicado detention for months on end is such a procedure .…
For if this Nation is to remain true to the ideals symbolized by its flag , it must not wield the tools of tyrants even to resist an assault by the forces of tyranny . ”
The summer of 2003 , when Marri entered the brig , was the height of the Bush Administration ’s program of authorized abusive interrogations .
The C.I.A. had just taken Khalid Sheikh Mohammed into custody , and was using extreme measures to make him divulge information ( much of which he later recanted ) .
Marri was among those whom Mohammed apparently implicated during this period .
By then , Bush appointees in the Justice Department had produced numerous memos advising the C.I.A. and the Pentagon that there were virtually no legal impediments to the use of physical and psychological force to break “ unlawful enemy combatants . ”
Suspects considered especially “ high value ” were subjected to extreme sensory deprivation and other harsh tactics , which were modelled on Soviet and Chinese torture programs that had been studied and copied by the C.I.A .
Inside the Charleston brig , documents show , officials were ordered to follow the same rules as those at Guantánamo .
Lustberg , however , says , “ I ’ve been to Guantánamo .
Marri was far more isolated .
He had no contact with any other detainees .
Most days , he had no human contact at all . ”
For the first six months , Marri was kept in an eight - foot - by - ten - foot cell with one blacked - out window , no social interaction , and nothing to do or to read .
An internal report , declassified in 2005 , showed that during this period the Department of Defense ordered the removal of the mattress , pillow , and Koran of a detainee in the brig .
Marri was also deprived of visits from the Red Cross , in violation of international laws .
He was denied hot food , and consistently felt cold : he was given no socks , and his bed had only a stiff “ anti- suicide ” blanket — one that can not be made into a noose .
Andrew Savage , the local counsel for Marri in Charleston , says , “ It was a psychological effort to devalue him .
He was going crazy .
He thought the smells from the nearby paper mill were poisoning him . ”
At other points , Marri started feeling “ tingles ” all over , and began hallucinating that microphones had been installed in his cell .
“ He was getting delusional , ” Savage said .
Newt Gingrich is right : “ It is European socialism transplanted to Washington . ”
How else to describe an economy in which the government controls the entire financial center and is now supplying life support for the auto industry ?
That ’s on top of the existing socialist economy run by the military - industrial complex , which , thanks to George W. Bush , now absorbs upward of 60 percent of the non-entitlement federal budget .
Although we still have a way to go to catch up with the good parts of the European system , including universal health care , high - quality public education and decent working conditions , we do have a system that is now as socialist in budget size as Europe’s .
That part I get when I listen to the right - wingers on Fox News bemoaning the reversal of the Reagan Revolution .
But what I do n’t understand is how in the world they can blame this startling turn of events on Barack Obama .
The vast majority of money allocated so far on President Obama ’s watch is an extension of Bush ’s banking bailout , which has committed trillions to failed Wall Street conglomerates .
I certainly do n’t want to defend the bailout and personally think the banks and stockbrokers deserve to go belly up , but what does that mess have to do with Obama , who was in college when the Reagan Revolution launched the deregulation that allowed Wall Street to run wild ?
Did n’t Obama inherit the current financial meltdown less than two months ago from the Republicans , who for eight years under Bush assured us that the markets were not in any need of tighter regulation ?
Was n’t it GOP congressional members led by folks like Gingrich who pushed though the deregulation legislation that enabled the growth of “ too big to fail ” financial institutions that now have to be saved by the taxpayers ?
Nor has Obama demanded anything more in the way of accountability from those Wall Street swindlers than had the Bush administration .
Under both presidents a total of $ 170 billion was given to insurance giant AIG , and , as The Wall Street Journal reported , at least $ 50 billion of that money was passed on to top foreign and domestic banks without any public accounting .
Indeed , the second in command at the Fed told a Senate committee last week that he would n’t reveal the names of the banks that grabbed our money .
Nor has there been any serious demand put on the banks to use the hundreds of billions in federal funds they received to increase liquidity .
Indeed , the banks are raising interest rates and cutting limits on credit cards at a time when the government is hoping consumers will use those cards to pump some life into the retail market .
As bank industry analyst Meredith Whitney wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op - Ed article , consumer credit card lines “ were reduced by nearly $ 500 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 alone . ”
She estimates that credit card limits for consumers will be halved over the next year , mostly on consumers who have not done anything wrong .
This will take “ credit away from people who have the ability to pay their bills , ” she notes .
So what we have here is socialism without even the pretense of a soul .
Certainly that has been the case with the abject refusal of the banks that received government bailouts to be more aggressive in preventing home foreclosures .
And the Obama administration has made it clear that it has no intention of taking over the operation of any of the mega - companies that are in trouble , even when , as in the case of AIG , the government already owns 80 percent of the shares .
The reason ?
Because that would be viewed as nationalization .
So what exactly would Obama ’s critics do differently ?
Nothing on the bailout side .
Instead , they have settled for carping criticism of the stimulus package , playing games by nitpicking lesser - cost programs while ignoring the big items that most governors , be they Republican or Democrat , eagerly want .
The great fear of the GOP seems to be that some of the stimulus program might actually prove helpful to struggling Americans , but the Republicans ca n’t just come out of the closet and say so .
What they have picked up on instead is that Obama ’s tax cuts provide some redistribution of income to favor the rapidly disappearing middle class at the expense of the super - wealthy , who have profited wildly from Bush tax cuts .
Which brings us back to Gingrich ’s complaint that Obama is importing European socialism .
If that means a system of governance in which a robust middle class is rewarded for work with a strong social safety net supported by higher taxes on the most affluent , well , let ’s get it on .

March 23 , 2009 --
It would be wrong to see the massively successful protest actions in France on March 19 as distant and exotic , of no particular relevance to us here in Canada .
With the economic meltdown heralding a new political era , and with most of the country 's left and social movements still stunned and disoriented following their embrace of the misguided and failed Liberal Party - led coalition plan , the French experience is instructive and inspiring .
France has just gone through another day of mass strikes and protests against the hard - right government of president Nicolas Sarkozy .
The protest action is hugely popular in opinion polls and comes on the heels of another successful but smaller day of action on January 29 , a victorious six - week general strike on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe that spread to other overseas colonial territories and the proliferation of radical protest actions among students and in a number of workplaces -- all in the context of growing job losses and a deepening financial and economic crisis .
' France 's Thatcher ' on the defensive
Not long ago , Sarkozy was widely hailed in Anglo - American circles , from the Blairite " centre left " across to the neo- conservative right , as the French Thatcher -- the man that would usher in the " normalisation " of French society by at long last breaking resistance to growing inequality , job insecurity , privatisation and cutbacks .
And yet , a mere 18 months into his mandate the swaggering and obnoxious Sarkozy is now stumbling in the face of the resilience and scale of popular resistance .
Though still very far from being defeated , Sarkozy and the neoliberal project more generally are on the defensive in France , a country at the heart of the global capitalist and imperial order .
This has not failed to raise a few eyebrows in other European and Western capitals , where the fear is that developments in France will serve as an example for workers and young people in their own countries .
Further stoking these fears is the fact that Olivier Besancenot -- the 34 - year - old postal worker and spokesperson of the newly created New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) -- has consolidated his position as by far the most popular opposition figure in the country .
For several months now , polls have ranked him well ahead of the leader of the nominally social - democratic Socialist Party ( PS ) Martine Aubry -- and even further ahead of the PS candidate in the 2007 presidential elections Ségolène Royal and centre - right leader François Bayrou .
Besancenot recently even earned the unusual distinction of being the only left - wing and working - class figure to be named to the Financial Times ' list of 50 people " who will frame the debate on the future of capitalism . "
New party , new politics for France 's left
As its name suggests , the NPA has an explicitly anti-capitalist profile and its program calls for a revolutionary transformation of the country 's political institutions and property relations .
It is an activist party , with a growing base of more than 10,000 members across the country involved in local organising efforts and broad activist campaigns and the internal work and debates of the NPA itself .
The party brings together former members of the largest surviving ( and now " self - dissolved " ) organisation of the 1968 - era far - left ( the " Trotskyist " Revolutionary Communist League , LCR ) , a wide array of experienced and previously non-party affiliated trade union and social movement activists , a new generation of radicalised students and youth and a significant layer of people of all ages for whom the party is their first political experience ever .
It is quite easily -- certainly within the industrialised world at any rate -- the most dynamic and radical example of attempts at fashioning a left - wing alternative to the increasingly discredited policies and institutions of neoliberalism and capitalism .
Relevant to Canada 's left ?
This is all very heady stuff .
So heady , in fact , that it is tempting to see these developments in France as distant and exotic , of no particular relevance to our own work and debates here in Canada .
That would be unfortunate .
To be sure , there are important differences between the context and relationship of forces in the two countries .
For one thing , today 's protest movements are at least in part an extension of those that have shaken France since late 1995 ; and the initiative to found the NPA was taken only after a long , complicated and occasionally rancorous debate between the various political and social - movement forces involved in these movements in one way or another .
It will certainly take time and a significant upsurge of protest and resistance in Canada before these kinds of debates get any kind of traction beyond the margins of political life here .
Fundamentally , however , the strategic lay of the land in the two countries is not so dramatically different .
Whatever the fate of Sarkozy 's cabinet in the face of the present protest movement or of Sarkozy himself in the 2012 presidential elections , the NPA are under no illusions that there will be a serious breakthrough for anti-capitalists in the short term .
Even in France , the relationship of forces and rules of the institutional game are firmly stacked against such an outcome .
The NPA understand that they are just now entering a long period of rebuilding working - class and anti-systemic movements and of developing a new vision and strategy for enduring radical change .
This is something the party 's program describes as " 21st century socialism " , tipping its hat to the Bolivarian revolutionary process underway in Venezuela and other Latin American countries .
Collective action possible in face of economic crisis
What are the broad lessons we can take away from the French experience ?
For one thing , the protests and strikes , and the organising that made them possible , show that resignation , panic and " everyone for themself " are not the only possible responses to the onset of economic hard times .
While people will often respond in a conservative and individualist manner at the onset of a crisis , there comes a time when they realise that systemic issues are at play and that only broad , collective action and political alternatives will do .
For another , the party and trade union organisations of the traditional left are too weakened and compromised by years of adaptation to neoliberalism and dependence on positions in parliament and the state to respond to the challenges thrown up by the hard right and the economic crisis .
While rightly associated with a range of measures of socioeconomic progress , the post - war mediations between the organised working classes , their party , trade union and social movement representation and the state itself were never ideal ; but after 25 years of neoliberalism they have ceased even to be operative for some time now .
In France , repeated waves of mass protest and organising over the past 13 years have failed to halt the traditional left 's drift towards the Blairite " centre left " .
As the right and ruling elites toy with various ineffective solutions to the crisis , the forces of the " centre left " will be quick to latch on to the handful of " stimulus " and ersatz " Keynesian " measures that are thrown into the mix to artfully declare a major breach in the neoliberal fortress .
So the crisis is just as likely to deepen the rightward trend of the traditional left and " centre left " as it is to push these forces in a more radical and combative direction .
The new days of action in France provide further confirmation of this analysis .
While they could not have occurred without trade union unity at the top , this unity " from above " came about in response to pressure " from below " and simultaneously acts as a trammel on the further development of the current movement .
The pressure " from below " has itself been the result of a surprising and noteworthy development -- the confluence of a substantial segment of public opinion with radical sectors scattered across traditional and new trade union groupings , local workplace and activist campaigns , the student and international solidarity movements and the relatively small party - political organisations of the radical left .
How a ' radical left ' can get a wide hearing
And this brings us to the particular significance of the NPA .
It is as much a product of this surprising confluence of forces as it is a vital ingredient in ensuring that the present unity and momentum are not lost in the face of hard - right intransigence and " centre - left " weakness and perfidy .
In other words , the debate on political strategy and organisation now occupies centre stage ; and the main lesson of the NPA 's undeniable success is that a radical - left political project can both receive a sympathetic hearing and play this strategically essential unifying and galvanising role , on condition that :
Its message consistently targets the systemic origins of the crisis and identifies those responsible for bringing us to the brink of economic and ecological calamity .
It contains an iron - clad commitment to the broadest unity " in the streets " of all forces willing to oppose the right - wing agenda , overall and on an issue - by - issue basis .
It confidently enters the electoral , institutional and media fray but strikes a position of defiance and strict independence on the question of electoral and governmental agreements and alliances with the forces of the traditional " left " and " centre left " ( not to mention centre right forces such as those around François Bayrou in France and the Liberal Party here in Canada ) .
These forces are beyond redemption as any kind of credible vehicle for popular aspirations and seek to govern at all costs -- in practice along lines that vary only slightly from those of the right and hard right .
It prioritises work among those sectors of the population and country ignored or abandoned by the traditional institutions of the " left " and " centre left " .
The NPA has , for example , made a priority of organising in the working - class and immigrant areas that have been hit hard by neoliberal structuring and were the backdrop of the banlieues revolt of late 2005 .
This is why the topics of racism and the precarious work imposed on young people figure prominently in the NPA 's internal discussions .
It aims to be a grassroots force , rooted in the actual struggles and debates of workers and young people , eschewing any kind of elitist , rigid and hyper - activist model of organising and transformation , throwing its doors wide open to seasoned activists and interested newcomers alike , while creating a democratic and transparent framework for collective discussion , decision - making , action and the drawing of balance - sheets .
It takes a long - term approach to its project of social and political transformation and understands that we are in an extended period of resistance and development of alternatives to capitalism and imperialism .
While history and politics always have surprises in store , especially in a period of deep crisis such as now , the relationship of forces is too unfavourable , and the vision of an alternative too weak , to expect major breakthroughs on an institutional level in the near term .
Better to understand this and get down to the serious work of organising and rethinking than to feed technocratic and armchair illusions about quick fixes and imminent elite - level " paradigm shifts " .
A new generation 's ' new left '
Finally , the protest movements in France and the birth of the NPA inaugurate a new chapter in the life of the international radical left , especially when viewed in tandem with the developments of recent years in Latin America .
The fact that the main figure associated with events in France was born in the mid-1970s also signals the emergence of a new generation of radicals .
We had a whiff of this trend during the wave of anti-globalisation protests ushered in by the Battle of Seattle in 1999 .
But now it appears to be asserting itself much more forcefully , with a larger and more receptive audience than the one that existed just a short time ago .
This , too , is a tremendously important and encouraging development .

Tenth Amendment Center
February 25 , 2009
Legislators in Tennessee submitted House Joint Resolution 108 ( HJR0108 ) on February 18th .
While it ’s non-binding , some of the language is quite well put .
Here ’s the intro :
A RESOLUTION to affirm Tennessee ’s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and to demand the federal government halt its practice of assuming powers and of imposing mandates upon the states for purposes not enumerated by the Constitution of the United States .
Halting the practice of assuming powers not enumerated is a great step .
Rolling back all the previous unconstitutional legislation is also a must in the future .
Here ’s the rest of the bill :
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 108
By Lynn
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
WHEREAS , the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ” ; and
WHEREAS , the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States and no more ; and
WHEREAS , the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states ; and
WHEREAS , today , in 2009 , the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government ; and
WHEREAS , many powers assumed by the federal government and federal mandates are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ; and
WHEREAS , the United States Supreme Court has ruled in New York v. United States , 112 S. Ct. 2408 ( 1992 ) , that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and
regulatory processes of the states ; and
WHEREAS , a number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United States ; now , therefore ,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE , THE SENATE
CONCURRING , that we hereby affirm Tennessee ’s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States .
We also demand the federal government to halt and reverse its practice of assuming powers and of imposing mandates upon the states for purposes not enumerated by the Constitution of the United States .
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that a committee of conference and correspondence be appointed by the Speaker of the House and of the Senate , which shall have as its charge to communicate the preceding resolution to the legislatures of the several states , to assure them that this State continues in the same esteem of their friendship and to call for a joint working group between the states to enumerate the abuses of authority by the federal government and to seek repeal of the assumption of powers and the imposed mandates .

Texas Senate
OKs bill allowing guns , ammo in cars at work State may loosen laws on storing guns
Schools not covered in bill passed by Senate
The Senate voted 31 - 0 to prohibit employers from enforcing restrictions against employees possessing a legally owned handgun or ammunition inside a locked vehicle while in a company parking lot .
Firearms and ammo must be stored out of sight .
“ Here in Texas people like their firearms and … if they want to bring them to the workplace they are going to do it whether there ’s an employee policy against it or not , ” said state Sen .
Glenn Hegar , R - Katy , the measure ’s author .
“ This is designed to stop employers from punishing employees who legally bring weapons to work . ”
Supporters say employer rules banning guns in a company parking lot infringe on their Second Amendment right and their ability to protect themselves as they travel to and from work .
Opponents , among them a number of influential business groups , argue the bill is an affront to an employer ’s property rights and are wary of potential gun violence as a growing number of Texans lose their jobs .
“ We believe it ’s a basic property right that should be preserved , ” said Bill Hammond , president of the Texas Association of Business .
“ Someone who is terminated or laid off can go to a parking lot and in a matter of seconds be back with a weapon and it could be a disaster as a result of this legislation . ”
Under the bill , employers would not be liable in most cases if an episode of workplace violence with a gun were to occur .
Businesses and employers still have the right to prohibit workers from bringing a firearm into an office building or into fenced parking lots where access is restricted .
Third time for bill
The issue — along with a separate proposal to let students and faculty with a concealed handgun license carry on campus — is a top priority for gun-lobby groups this session .
This is the third consecutive session lawmakers will seek to pass the parking lot measure .
“ This impacts public safety , ” said Alice Tripp , legislative director for the Texas State Rifle Association .
“ There are people who are n’t able to practice this form of self - defense during their daily lives going to and from work . ”
The bill , which exempts schools , now heads to the House , where in 2007 it died .
State Rep. Stephen Frost , D - New Boston and vice chairman of the House Public Safety Committee , is carrying an identical measure .
An amendment to the bill by Sen. Steve Ogden , R - Bryan , exempts workplaces where a contract prohibits weapons , such as oil and gas drilling sites situated on private property .

It was the rarest of encounters : Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs separated by generations and bitter conflict .
Teenage musicians from a Palestinian West Bank refugee camp played the notes , although sometimes flat , of classical Arabic melodies .
An audience of elderly Jewish Holocaust survivors tapped their feet and nodded in rhythm .
Lately , Israelis and Palestinians seldom mix in any setting , and this concert Wednesday morning near Tel Aviv by refugee children for concentration camp survivors came with plenty of historic , cultural , and political baggage .
But for about an hour the enmity vanished .
A dozen performers and about 30 survivors connected through music and , perhaps , gave one another some empathy for lives intertwined by conflict but separated by borders .
" They have a difficult past and we have a difficult past , " says Keren Naiomi , a native of Poland who lost her entire family at the age of 5 and then was sent to a concentration camp .
" They 're from a refugee camp and we 're from a concentration camp . "
For many of the Palestinian young people , who come from a neighborhood that was leveled by an Israeli invasion seven years ago , the rare permits to cross legally into Israel stirred excitement first and foremost – mostly about their first visit to the beach and to the land that their grandparents and parents called home before Israel was created in 1948 .
The orchestra knew little , however , about their audience .
The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools or many places in the Middle East because of its political sensitivity as one of the seminal events leading to the creation of Israel .
" They told us that it is important to be kind to them because they are old , " says Ali Zaeid after the performance .
" They told us that these people have been through a war just like you . "
The Palestinian music group was founded five years ago by Wafa Younes , a retired music teacher from the Israeli Arab town of Ara who crosses military checkpoints several times a week to teach in the Jenin refugee camp .
For children traumatized by daily clashes between militants and the Israeli army , the lessons are a form of therapy , she says .
Perhaps that contribution emboldened her to take children to performance sites that some Palestinians might say go too far at normalizing relations with Israel .
" Everyone should be embraced , " says Ms. Younes .
" Regardless of whether they are Holocaust survivors , the elderly need their hearts warmed .
My goal is to play for anyone who is in pain . "
For their part , the audience of Holocaust survivors in this Tel Aviv suburb knew only that they were being treated to a performance of Middle Eastern music .
But they were n't informed until the last minute that the band members were children from a Palestinian refugee camp who first had to wait two hours at a military checkpoint before leaving for the concert date .
As the performers moved through a brief set of songs that included an Arabic prayer for peace and music from Umm Kultum , the serious faces of the children turned into grins as they noticed their audience tapping along .
Two of the Holocaust survivors were invited to the microphone to sing a Yiddish song translated into Hebrew that recalled their childhood in Europe .
The concert culminated in a chorus of drumming and clapping that featured a duet with Israeli billionaire Shari Arison , whose Ruach Tova ( Good Spirit ) organization sponsored a national " Good Deeds Day " throughout Israel .
" Let 's hope that this violence ends and we only sing and make music together , " says Younes .
" God willing . "
As part of the same event , the Palestinian orchestra was scheduled later in the afternoon to perform for a group of Arab and Jewish children at an after - shoool activity center in the mixed town of Jaffa .
Ms. Arison shies away from questions about the political sensitivity surrounding the encounter between the survivors and the refugee children .
" The idea is to remind people that it does n't take much to do a good deed , " she says .
" I stay far away from politics .
This has nothing to do with that . "
Still , the political message of Arison 's and Younes 's good deed was not lost on Zaeid , one of the young musicians .
Even though he considered his own status as a refugee to be a result of the Holocaust refugees whom he played for , he says , " there are Israelis who live here and have [ no bone of contention ] with us .
They are obliged to be in the army . "
As the meeting ended in a round of photographs and handshakes , one survivor came up to thank Younes for " the music that went straight to my heart . "
Had the seniors made new friends from the concert ?
" Friendship ? " asks Tova Nichery , a survivor of a labor camp , who had just posed with the young musicians .
" Not so fast .
They 're back to where they came from and we go back to where we came from .
There needs to be dialogue . "
It was just a matter of time .
With all of the white - hot , ultra - hyperbolic invective radiating from Fox News screens across the land , there was really no escaping the obvious end game .
The usual suspects in the Fox Confederacy have been so filled with revulsion by the neo-Socialist path that they believe the country is on , that they can no longer abide nor accept it .
So now Fox News is preparing to depart from the union with a fanfare , a blast of light , a loud swoosh and gong .
And an advertising campaign .
The Fox Nation Launches A Dud See also the update to this article :
On first viewing of this ad I thought it may have been a joke akin to the Colbert Nation .
It begins by declaring that “ It ’s time to say ‘ NO ’ to biased media . ”
Was Fox News coming clean and denouncing itself ?
No such luck .
It was just that old “ fair and balanced ” Foxian doublespeak .
Instead ,
Fox was announcing the birth of a nation – The Fox Nation .
This should not come as a surprise .
There has been much foreshadowing of this inevitable outcome .
Glenn Beck proclaimed his intentions last month when he said :
“ … do n’t get me wrong .
I am against the government , and I think that they have just been horrible , and I do think they are betraying the principles of our founders every day they ’re in office . ”
Not to be outdone , Bill O’Reilly joins in with his view of a nation that is coming apart :
“ We ’d love to see America become more unified , but I do n’t think that ’s going to happen any time soon .
There ’s a struggle going on to redefine America .
And in 2009 , that struggle will become even more intense . ”
Beck , O’Reilly , and others at Fox News and across the conservative landscape , have been employing their airtime to turn
Fox into a rallying point for rightist revolutionaries .
They are recruiting “ Culture Warriors ” who will be dispatched to “ Tea Parties ” until they can shout victoriously that “ We Surround Them . ”
The battle lines are drawn and the broadcast brigades are deployed and armed for combat .
This is an unprecedented , and frightening , initiative to use a major television network as an organizing tool for political activism .
The sort of advocacy work normally done by independent organizations like MoveOn or Freedom ’s Watch is now being conducted by a billion dollar media enterprise with a well known partisan agenda .
No matter how much the right wallows in their delusions of NBC or the New York Times being mouthpieces for the left , those institutions have never set themselves up as coordinating committees for social movements .
But this goes far beyond conventional interest group pandering .
There is a strain of hostility that runs through the conservative ranks that borders on the violent .
Just last April , Rush Limbaugh was encouraging riots in Denver at the Democratic Convention .
Now the Fox Nation invites viewers to …
“ Be a part of the REAL NEWS of America and join in the online community that believes in the right to express your views , your values , your voice . ”
Indeed , the Fox Nation will be a “ community that believes in the right . ”
For a taste of what to expect , just take a look at the community that Fox already provides on their Fox Forums :
Tom BB : America ’s enemies rejoice now around the world and in the US .
Obama the terrorist is in charge .
Steven : Hell No! Obama is of the devil !
drwoo : MAY OBAMA ’S WIFE AND KIDS BE THE FIRST TO BE BLOWN UP , BURNED ALIVE OR HAVE TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW ON THE 88TH FLOOR ( SPLAT ) .
MAY OBAMA REAP WHAT HE HAS SOWN > AMEN !!!
Jim : The Antichrist has arrived and is doing well in the White House .
Say goodbye to what we all know as a free and God loving America .
Jim P : WHEN THE BOYS FROM GITMO GET HERE OBAMA WILL GIVE THEM WELFARE , SECTION 8 HOUSING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE STUPID ASS PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM IN OFFICE GET .
LET THEM LIVE IN DC .
THEY WILL BLEND IN WITH THE REST OF THE DC RESIDENTS !
HOPE ALL THE LOW LIFE AND WELFARE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR OBAMA ARE HAPPY .
BY THE WAY , WHEN WILL THE TICKETS TO THE FORD THEATER GO ON SALE ?
Don Brown : Obama needs to be checked to see if he has a 666 somewhere on his body .
It is not presently known exactly what form the Fox Nation will take ( We ’ll find out on Monday , March 30 ) .
As a self - described “ online community ” it could be modeled on MySpace , which is also owned by Fox News ’ parent company , News Corp .
But the purpose of the Fox Nation is not hard to surmise .
It is just another brick in the great wall dividing Americans from one another .
It will likely tap in to existing movements like Beck ’s 912 Project and the Tea Partiers .
Then these fanatics will be able to accumulate friends and form alliances .
One thing is known for sure :
There has never been anything like it from a social movement perspective .
Fox News has a large and faithful following .
Their daily exhortations to rise up against the Socialist hordes they imagine are occupying Washington could be channeled into an army that is loyal only to the hallucinatory paranoia of the Foxian mindset .
Beck , O’Reilly , and Hannity , do n’t view themselves as commentators so much as they do as saviors .
O’Reilly has confessed that he believes that he was “ blessed with talent ” and that he is “ here for a reason . ”
Beck beseeches his viewers at the start of every program to “ Come on , follow me . ”
Hannity leads into his All - Star Panel sermonizing with a preachy “ Let not your heart be troubled . ”
An evangelical fervor literally drips from these would - be prophets like a poisonous sap .
So now Fox wants to start a new nation populated with believers and disciples .
The nation that the rest of us inhabit is far too corrupt and sinful .
It is infested with Secular - Progressives and far - left loons .
There is no course left for the righteous , but to secede .
The mysterious video that Fox is airing to promote the launch of the Fox Nation ends with this comforting enticement that seems deliberately crafted to appeal to lost souls : “ Finally , a place to call home . ”
How the US armed Iraq with chemical and biological weapons
Note : to turn off these warnings you need to set the ' safe mode ' to OFF ( on the top right )
In what 's being called the most sweeping land protection law in a quarter century , the US House of Representatives Wednesday passed a conservation plan to set aside more than 2 million acres of desert and forest in nine states .
The Omnibus Public Lands Management
Act , which cleared the Senate last week , was approved by a margin of 285 to 140 and has been sent to President Obama for his signature .
The bill would officially designate land in California , Colorado , Idaho , Michigan , New Mexico , Oregon , Utah , Virginia , and West Virginia as wilderness .
That means no logging , mining , drilling , or even vehicles .
The Associated Press details the provisions by state .
They include setting aside more than 450,00 acres of wilderness near Santa Clarita , Calif. , and along the California - Nevada border , nearly 250,000 acres of Colorado 's Rocky Mountain National Park , 517,000 acres in Idaho 's Owyhee Canyonlands , and more than 250,000 acres of wilderness in and near Utah 's Zion National Park .
Environmentalists are hailing the measure .
Upon passage of the bill , this blogger 's email inbox was flooded with press releases .
William H. Meadows , president of The Wilderness Society was quoted as saying :
“ This is a monumental day for wilderness and for all Americans who enjoy the great outdoors .
With passage of this bill , Congress has made a great gift to present and future generations of Americans .
These special places make our communities better places to live , clean our air and water for free , and provide ecological resilience in the face of climate change .
They ’re also great places to hike and camp and fish with family and friends , of course . ”
And here 's Dave Jenkins , director of government affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection :
" This bill is the most important conservation legislation that Congress has passed in many years .
We are especially pleased that 38 Republicans from all parts of the country supported this bill .
It 's a powerful demonstration of the good that can be accomplished for our country when Republicans return to their roots as the party of conservation . "
Of course , not all were thrilled about the bill .
The AP notes that opponents of the measure , mostly Republicans , called the bill a " land grab . "
The news agency quotes Rep. Doc Hastings , a Washington Republican who argued that the bill would deprive the US of much - needed energy development .
" Our nation ca n't afford to shut down the creation of jobs for jobless Americans , and we can't afford to become even more dependent on foreign sources of energy , " Hastings said .
The bill " even locks up federal lands from renewable energy production , including wind and solar , " he said .
Cannabis Culture Magazine Editor Marc Emery is encouraging all marijuana smokers to boycott Kellogg ’s cereal company for dropping their sponsorship of Olympian Michael Phelps after he was caught on film smoking from a bong .
Michael Phelps is a 23 - year - old swimmer who won eight Olympic medals ( six gold , two bronze ) for swimming competitions in 2004 , and eight more Olympic GOLD medals in 2008 , making him the most successful Olympic athlete in the 113 - year history of the Olympic Games .
At the end of January , the News of the World published a photograph of Mr. Phelps hitting a ROOR bong at a party in South Carolina , and now cereal maker Kellogg Co. have dropped the world ’s swimming Superman as a representative , claiming Phelp ’s pot use is “ not consistent with the image of Kellogg . ”
I recommend that for 2009 , marijuana smokers across the world boycott some or all Kellogg ’s products in response to this clearly ignorant and prejudicial decision .
( Click here to see the full array of Kellogg ’s products . )
Historically , the Kellogg decision seems a little ironic .
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was a rich eccentric who , along with the cereal company he founded in his name , ran a health farm call Wellville ( in Battle Creek , Michigan , of course ) for the wealthy .
The members were put through a regime of extreme vegetarianism , laughing therapy and the purging the ‘ polluted ’ body by exercise ; and sex , masturbation , and even sensual stimulation were forbidden .
Members were forced to eat a vicious Spartan diet of Kellogg ’s “ Corn Flakes ” , and subject to cleansing remedies including the use of laxatives , an anal yogurt cure , enemas , and brutal mechanical cleansing .
In many ways Kellogg was insane , but hey , they still want you to eat his cereal !
A protest in front of the offices of USA Swimming in Colorado Springs , Colorado , is being organized by Mason Tvert and the activists at SAFER Colorado to address the suspension of Michael Phelps from competition in the USA for three months .
As to Phelps ’ athletic worthiness , here is his daily regimen from jockbio.com ,
His training regimen is grueling — two to five hours a day in the pool .
He does minimal weightlifting ; at this point flexibility and a feel for the water are more important to him .
The leg strength Michael added during his 2007 wrist - injury rehab was evident in Beijing on his powerful turns .
In the races where he trailed , he made up an extraordinary amount of time pushing off the wall .
That extra power in his kick also bought him the hundredth of a second edge he needed to come from behind in the 100 - meter butterfly .
His physique notwithstanding , endurance may be Michael ’s single greatest asset .
He ’s able to hold his stroke under pressure and when fatigue begins to creep in .
From a mind over matter standpoint , Michael is also off the charts .
His ability to relax , focus and block out the pain all at once is unique in his sport .
He never seems nervous before a race , yet his intensity on the starting block is unmatched .
Relaxed indeed .
The last line is a tribute to cannabis and its usefulness in sport , athleticism , and competition .
In early February , former Cannabis Culture Magazine editor Dana Larsen wrote for the respected Forbes.com about other athletes who have used cannabis .
Championship wrestler Rob Van Dam also wrote extensively about the incredible usefulness of cannabis to extreme athletes in CC # 69 ( “ Weed , Wrestling , and Athletic Enhancement ” ) .
Recently , Japanese Olympic power lifters , NFL football players and NBA basketball players have been penalized , charged , or reprimanded for their use of cannabis to improve performance .

Phelps Suspended 3 Months , Dropped by Sponsor
by Associated Press
COLORADO SPRINGS , Colorado ( AP ) — Michael Phelps was suspended from competition for three months by USA Swimming , the latest fallout from a photo that showed the Olympic great inhaling from a marijuana pipe .
The sport ’s national governing body also cut off its financial support to Phelps for the same three - month period , effective Thursday .
“ This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated , but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people , particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero , ” the Colorado Springs - based federation said in a statement .
“ Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust . ”
Phelps won a record eight gold medals in Beijing and returned to America as one of the world ’s most acclaimed athletes .
Now he ’s enduring a wave of bad news in the wake of the photo , published Sunday by News of the World , a British tabloid .
Earlier Thursday , cereal and snack maker Kellogg Co. announced it would n’t renew its sponsorship contract with Phelps , saying his behavior is “ not consistent with the image of Kellogg . ”
The swimmer appeared on the company ’s cereal boxes after his Olympic triumph .
USA Swimming provides a $ 1,750 monthly stipend to national team members to help defray travel and training expenses , plus performance bonuses .
However , it ’s a small percentage of the millions Phelps makes through endorsements .
“ Michael accepts these decisions and understands their point of view , ” said one of his agents , Drew Johnson .
“ He feels bad he let anyone down .
He ’s also encouraged by the thousands of comments he ’s received from his fans and the support from his many sponsors .
He intends to work hard to regain everyone ’s trust . ”
Phelps ’ coach , Bob Bowman , said he believes Phelps will emerge from the experience a stronger swimmer and person .
“ Michael ’s been through a lot and he ’s learned a lot , hopefully , ” Bowman told The Associated Press during a telephone interview .
“ I support him and I want to see him do better .
I ’m here , as always , to try to help him move forward .
He ’s learned some tough lessons and he ’s disappointed a lot of people , me included . ”
Phelps has acknowledged “ regrettable ” behavior and “ bad judgment . ”
He did n’t dispute the authenticity of the photo , reportedly taken at a house party while Phelps was visiting Columbia , S.C. , in November during an extended break from training .
“ I certainly understand USA Swimming needed to take action , ” Bowman said .
“ We will certainly abide by everything they ’ve put down . ”
The 23 - year - old has resumed training in his hometown of Baltimore , but his plans to return to competitive swimming will have to be put on hold .
Phelps had planned to compete in early March at a Grand Prix meet in Austin , Texas .
Now , he wo n’t be able to compete until early May , which would give him a little more than two months for some racing before July ’s world championships in Rome .
“ This is the result of a poor decision Michael made , ” U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman Darryl Seibel said in an e-mail .
“ He understands there is accountability and has pledged to not repeat this in the future .
We have offered our assistance to make certain he is as consistent and successful away from the pool as he is in it , and we are confident that will happen . ”
After the suspension , Phelps would be able to compete at a May meet in Charlotte , N.C. ; there ’s another Grand Prix competition in Santa Clara , Calif. , the following month .
The U.S. team for Rome will be chosen at the national championships , which begin July 7 in Indianapolis .
“ He ’s been very good in practice , ” Bowman said .
“ I think he feels good to be back in the water .
Certainly , he ’s not in very good shape .
“ We ’re anxious to get back to a really normal routine and we have .
We ’re moving on . ”
Several of Phelps ’ Olympic teammates rallied to his defense .
Among them was Dara Torres , the 41 - year - old silver medalist whom Phelps jokingly referred to in Beijing as “ Mom . ”
“ I see him as a kid trying to grow up in the most intense spotlight known to any athlete .
He has apologized and what else can he do ? ” she told the AP by telephone .
“ The thing I hope is that people realize Michael is still a person and not just a swimming hero . ”
Torres said she sent Phelps a text a few days ago to extend her support .
“ He did n’t let the USA down at the games , so we should n’t let him down , ” she said .
Torres does n’t expect a three - month suspension in a non-Olympic year to have much affect on Phelps ’ career .
He intends to keep swimming through the 2012 London Games .
“ Knowing Michael the way I do , I guarantee you it ’s going to make him want to do well , ” Torres said .
“ All this is going to do is light a fire under him . ”
Amanda Beard compared Phelps ’ ordeal to some of the disdain she faced after posing nude in Playboy magazine before the Beijing Games .
“ If anyone knows public scrutiny , it ’s me , ” the four - time Olympian said in a text message .
“ When I posed for Playboy , so many officials looked down on me .
Michael knows he is n’t a bad person .
He made a mistake .
People need to get over it .
I want to cheer him on in London . ”
Even a rival agent came to Phelps ’ defense .
“ Enough is enough , ” said Evan Morgenstein , who represents a large number of Olympic swimmers .
“ The penalty is far greater than the crime .
He has said he is sorry .
Let ’s move on to the real problems in this country . ”

TOKYO ( AP )  A 93 - year - old Japanese man has become the first person certified as a survivor of both atomic bombings by the United States , officials said Tuesday .
The survivor , Tsutomu Yamaguchi , had already been a certified hibakusha , or radiation survivor , of the bombing on Aug. 9 , 1945 , in Nagasaki , but he has now been confirmed as surviving the attack on Hiroshima three days earlier , in which he suffered serious burns to his upper body .
Certification qualifies survivors for compensation , including monthly allowances , free medical checkups and funeral costs .
Mr. Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip on Aug. 6 , 1945 , when an American B - 29 dropped an atomic bomb on the city .
He returned to Nagasaki , his hometown , before the second attack , officials said .
“ My double radiation exposure is now an official government record , ” Mr. Yamaguchi said , according to The Mainichi Daily News .
“ It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die . ”

New research published today will bring prenatal testing for autism significantly closer , prompting experts to call for a national debate about the consequences of screening for the disorder in the womb and allowing women to terminate babies with the condition .
The breakthrough study by Cambridge University 's autism research centre has followed 235 children from birth to the age of eight .
It found that high levels of testosterone in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women was linked to autistic traits , such as a lack of sociability and verbal skills , in their children by the time they are eight .
It raises the possibility of an amniocentesis ( the same procedure used to test for Down 's syndrome ) to detect autism .
Enabling couples to terminate the pregnancy if an autistic disorder is detected is highly controversial .
Autism is a spectrum disorder , which famously includes mathematical and musical savants as well as children who are unable to communicate and spend their lives in an institution .
Parents of children with autistic spectrum disorders are particularly strongly opposed to testing linked to termination and fear it would lead to greater discrimination and less support for them .
Professor Simon Baron - Cohen , director of the research team , told the Guardian that it is now time to start considering where society stands on the issue .
" If there was a prenatal test for autism , would this be desirable ?
What would we lose if children with autistic spectrum disorder were eliminated from the population ? " he said .
" We should start debating this .
There is a test for Down 's syndrome and that is legal and parents exercise their right to choose termination , but autism is often linked with talent .
It is a different kind of condition . "
The research could , equally controversially , open the way for treatment , he said .
" We could do something about it .
Some researchers or drug companies might see this as an opportunity to develop a pre-natal treatment .
There are drugs that block testosterone .
But whether we'd want to would be a different matter . "
Only a small minority of people are at the very high - functioning end of the spectrum , with formidable powers of focus and concentration and a love of systems which may lead to extraordinary abilities in mathematics .
A prenatal test would not be able to identify such a child , or one who will have extreme learning difficulties - and anyway , says Baron - Cohen , " ethically the same issues apply wherever the person is on that spectrum " .
The National Autistic Society says some of its members think a test to predict autism could be useful in helping parents prepare and get support for their child .
At the moment , many children are not diagnosed for two or three years , which is a source of frustration .
But none have said they wished it had been possible to have a termination .
" I think it is really important that the autism community has a key role in shaping the research priorities in this area , " said Amanda Batten , head of campaigns for the NAS .
" There could be some real gains in recognising autism early .
There are benefits , but there are concerns .
People think it is about eugenics .
" It is important to stress that everyone with autism has the potential to make a unique and valued contribution to society .
It is not always the autism that is a problem .
It is other people and a lack of services and support . "
Vivienne Nathanson , head of ethics at the British Medical Association , agreed a debate was needed .
" The question , then , is are we comfortable with [ testing ] for a disorder which is life - limiting in terms of opportunities and experience , rather than life - ending ? " she said .
" My guess is that society would look at it like Down 's syndrome , " she said .
" There are people who would n't approve of terminations and people who would .
If you talk to parents of people with autism , however much they love their children , they find it very difficult .
They agonise over their child 's limited life opportunities and some of them say it would have been better not to have had the child and some do n't . "
The more complicated ethical issue would be that of treatment in the womb , she said .
" You get to the situation where you have a very great difficulty if families say we would n't want to be tested .
As a society , do we accept that people can refuse tests when the outcome can make a difference to that unborn child ? "

Sun - like stars end their lives as shimmering planetary nebula , such as the Cat ’s Eye Nebula ( Image : NASA / ESA / HEIC / Hubble Heritage / STScI / AURA )
To see stunning images of planetary nebulae click here
Planetary nebulae are the final butterfly - like state that heralds the end of a Sun - like star ’s energy - generating life .
They form when stars up to eight times the mass of the Sun begin to die , bloating into red giants before shedding as much as half their mass as gas and dust nebulae .
The Sun itself will begin its death throes in about 5 billion years , when it starts to swell into a red giant star .
Though it ’s not clear exactly what its planetary nebula will look like – its shape will likely be sculpted by factors such as the Sun ’s future magnetic field – observations of the 1600 or so known planetary nebulae suggest our star will go out in a blaze of glory .

Lasting no more than a few tens of thousands of years , planetary nebulae help seed space with heavier chemical elements that can be incorporated into the next generation of stars .

Susan Davis reports on politics .
Congressional Democrats swept into power in 2006 after a steady drumbeat of attacks against Republicans for allowing a systemic “ culture of corruption ” to define their majority .
It was n’t a new charge , but it took a perfect storm of GOP scandals that year — lobbyist Jack Abramoff , former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas , former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham of California , and Florida Rep. Mark Foley of Florida — for it to register with the electorate .
Now , with solid Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate , Republicans are echoing the same attacks of corruption among Democrats — and they may have a point .

New videogame lets you ' slap ' a CEO online Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday February 23 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  A Web entertainment company has launched an online videogame called " Trillion Dollar Bailout " which allows players to " slap " or reward CEOs and hand out bags of money to deserving homeowners .
Players of the game , created by AddictingGames.com , are given one trillion play dollars with which to " rescue the US economy before total economic meltdown strikes . "
In the game , homeowners and corporate CEOs pop out of a New York City skyline requesting taxpayer - funded handouts -- such as the eight billion dollars requested by " Crysalot Motors . "
Players can either hand out money by clicking on a money bag icon or give the person requesting a bailout a slap by clicking on an icon which looks like a hand .
The player 's actions are charted on a graph and determine whether the economy is " saved " or " tanks . "
The game 's creators urge players to " punish greedy fat cats and save honest people " and " put the hurt on dudes in suits ! "
The game can be found at this link .

Hollywood gets a bad rap for being a place filled with nothing but people who lie to you all day .
And that is really not the case .
It 's not that people lie in Hollywood .
It 's just that they are completely delusional .
People in show biz are n’t vicious , horrible people who are trying to screw you at a moment ’s notice ( okay , some are , but those are the really really successful people whom you ’ll never meet and will probably drop dead of a coronary any minute now ) .
They are people who , through the necessity of self - preservation , have deluded themselves into believing they are more important than they really are .
When someone says they think they can get your movie made , they truly believe it .
There is no master plan to fuck you over .
They think they have the power , clout and juice to do it .
Therein lies the problem .
They have zero power , are clout free and the only juice they have is Minute Maid .
So there is no malice , just a ridiculous sense of self - worth .
People even get deluded on their business cards .
I ca n’t tell you how many cards I ’ve been given that say “ VP of Production ” or “ Director of Development ” or , my personal favorite , “ Creative Executive ” .
Now , these cards are n’t fake .
Real people have these jobs and are given these real job titles .
It ’s just that the titles mean nothing .
They just sound really cool .
They might as well add to their business cards “ I have no real authority but , hey , at least I do n’t have to answer the phones . ”
Let ’s not even call it “ lying ” .
Let ’s call it “ omitting ” .
For example , a producer may tell you , “ I have a connection to Matthew Mcconaughey . ”
She ’s not lying .
She ’s telling you the absolute truth .
She ’s just omitting that that connection is a sister of the cousin of the equipment manager of McConnaughy ’s high school football team .
This not lying happens all over town .
The actor who says “ I ’m working on a Hugh Jackman film ” who ’s really just an extra ; the singer who ’s “ in the studio working with will .i.am ” is really just Xeroxing sheet music ; the young producer who ’s “ helping produce the next Judd Apatow movie ” is actually a PA getting donuts ; and the hot model who says “ I ’m nailing Vince Vaughn ” … okay , well , she probably is and you should become friends with her immediately .
There are no liars in Hollywood – just people trying to keep the dream alive .
Now if you ’ll excuse me , I have a meeting for a MAJOR new MadAtoms project that I ’m involved in that I ’m late for .

LAST December California approved a power line between San Diego and the Imperial Valley — a spot blessed with sun , wind and geothermal energy resources .
The Sunrise Powerlink would twist around a state park , an Indian reservation and much of a forest ( see map ) .
Its builders would be banned from harming burrowing owls or rattlesnakes .
It is just the sort of green infrastructure project that might be expected to delight environmentalists .
Their response ?
An appeal and a petition to the state Supreme Court .
“ Environmentalists have never been a well - mannered lot ” , says Terry Tamminen , who has advised Arnold Schwarzenegger on climate change .
But they seem to be becoming more ornery .
A growing fear that the environment is on the brink of collapse is making many greens less willing to compromise , even with each other .
And George Bush 's departure from the White House has removed a common adversary .
The fiercest disputes are over electricity transmission .
Many environmentalists , including Mr Schwarzenegger , argue that more power lines must be built to connect cities with potential sources of renewable energy .
The governor strongly supports the Sunrise Powerlink project .
The Sierra Club opposes it , along with another line that would run east from Los Angeles .
Together with the Centre for Biological Diversity , the organisation is holding out for a guarantee that the line will be used to transmit electricity solely from renewable sources .
Environmental groups in Nevada and the Midwest have issued similar ultimatums .
To an extent this is a dispute between pragmatism and idealism .
Politicians like Mr Schwarzenegger tend to believe that energy projects should be judged on whether they improve on current practice .
Activists , by contrast , prefer to measure them against an environmental ideal .
“ A little bit better than the status quo is n't good enough , ” explains Bill Magavern , the Sierra Club 's California director .
He wants power to be generated close to those who will use it , and envisages a rash of solar roofs in San Diego .
A more profound difference has to do with how the problem is diagnosed .
Although no big environmental group is unconcerned with global warming , they view the threat in different ways .
The big divide is between those who fret about measurable changes in greenhouse - gas emissions and those who worry more about harm to natural habitats , whether caused by global warming or anything else .
The first group — call them the environmental nerds — includes people like Al Gore and Mr Schwarzenegger .
The second group — call them the tree - huggers — includes the Sierra Club , the Centre for Biological Diversity and other established conservation groups .
The dispute is likely to intensify in the next few months as Washington weighs in .
This week Congress reached a deal on a stimulus plan that encourages the construction of yet more power lines .
Barack Obama wants to create green jobs , but he needs to create jobs above all , and quickly .
Environmentalists , who know how to hold up big projects better than anybody , will not be bounced so easily .
A shame : after all , the greens are winning .
The government has promised curbs on council spying Councils in England and Wales have used controversial spying laws 10,000 times in the past five years , figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show .
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) was designed to fight serious crime .
But officials have been using it to spy on suspected dog fouling , littering and other minor offences .
The government has promised curbs on its use but the Lib Dems warn it could still become a " snoopers ' charter " .
The figures , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , reveal for the first time how widespread the use of Ripa is among council officials in England and Wales .
A survey of more than 180 local authorities found : • 1,615 council staff have the power to authorise the use of Ripa . • 21 % ( or 340 ) of these staff are below senior management grade .
• Ripa powers have been used 10,333 times in the last five years .
• Just 9 % of these authorisations have led to a successful prosecution , caution or fixed - penalty notice
The Lib Dems are calling on the government to ensure that Ripa powers are only used where strictly necessary and that their use is sanctioned by magistrates .
New guidelines
The party 's local government spokesman Julia Goldsworthy said : " This government has seen civil liberties as little more than a temporary inconvenience .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " Slowly but surely freedoms have been eroded and we 're now in a situation where dog fouling is considered sufficient to warrant surveillance by council officials . "
Shami Chakrabarti , of civil rights campaign group Liberty , called for tighter restrictions on the use of surveillance powers .
She told BBC News : " The over - use of surveillance is destroying trust in proper law enforcement . "
Council officials were even using " targeted surveillance , " including monitoring phone calls , e-mails text messages and CCTV , to police school catchment areas , she added .
The government is planning to issue new guidelines to councils on the use of Ripa .
' Proper use ' Local government minister John Healey has written to councils to emphasise that the powers are " not appropriate " for tackling offences like littering or dog fouling .
The public must have confidence in who has these powers and that they are used in a proportionate and proper way
John Healey , local government minister " It is right and important that councils have these powers of surveillance , " he said , as an effective weapon against rogue traders , fly tippers and loan sharks .
But he added : " The public must have confidence in who has these powers and that they are used in a proportionate and proper way . "
Ministers want applications for the use of Ripa to go to the top of organisations , such as the chief executive of a council rather than the head of trading standards or environmental health .
The Conservatives say they would restrict the use of Ripa powers by local authorities only to crimes which could lead to a prison sentence .
Local councils would also require judicial approval for the use of surveillance powers and council leaders would have to sign off each use of the powers , under Tory proposals .

Original Peking Man fossils were lost in World War II Iconic ancient human fossils from China are 200,000 years older than had previously been thought , a study shows .
The new dating analysis suggests the " Peking Man " fossils , unearthed in the caves of Zhoukoudian are some 750,000 years old .
The discovery should help define a more accurate timeline for early humans arriving in North - East Asia .
A US - Chinese team of researchers has published its findings in the prestigious journal Nature .
The cave system of Zhoukoudian , near Beijing , is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites in the world .
Between 1921 and 1966 , archaeologists working at the site unearthed tens of thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans .
Palaeontologists later assigned these members of the human lineage to the species Homo erectus .
The pre-war Peking Man fossils vanished in 1941 whilst being transported to the US for safekeeping .
Luckily , the palaeontologist Franz Weidenreich had made casts for researchers to study .
Experts have tried various methods over the years to determine the age of the remains .
But they have been hampered by the lack of suitable techniques for dating cave deposits such as those at Zhoukoudian .
Open habitats Now , Guanjun Shen , from Nanjing Normal University in China , and colleagues have applied a relatively new method to the problem .
This method is based on the radioactive decay of unstable forms , or isotopes , of the elements aluminium and beryllium in quartz grains .
This enabled them to get a more precise age for the fossils .
The Zhoukoudian caves have yielded many fossils of Homo erectus
The results show the Peking Man fossils came from ground layers that were 680,000 - 780,000 years old , making them about 200,000 years older than had previously been believed .
Comparisons with other sites show that Homo erectus survived successive warm and cold periods in northern Asia .
Researchers Russell Ciochon and E Arthur Bettis III , from the University of Iowa , US , believe these climatic cycles may have caused the expansion of open habitats , such as grasslands and steppe .
These environments would have been rich in mammals that could have been hunted or scavenged by early humans .
Recent revised dates for other hominid occupation sites in North - East Asia show that human habitation of the region began about 1.3 million years ago .
The Nature study forms an important addition to this work .
The Peking Man fossils are a vital component of the Out of Africa 1 migration theory , which proposes that Homo erectus first appeared in Africa around two million years ago before spreading north and east ( modern humans , Homo sapiens , would follow much later and supplant all other Homo species ) .
Evidence of the first dispersal comes from the site of Dmanisi in Georgia , where numerous hominid fossils dating to 1.75 million years ago have been unearthed .
Finds from Java suggest early humans reached South - East Asia by 1.6 million years ago .
Homo floresiensis survived on Flores until 12,000 years ago
The northern populations represented at Zhoukoudian were probably separated from southern populations represented on the island of Java by a zone of sub- tropical forest inhabited by the giant panda , orangutans , gibbons and a giant ape called Gigantopithecus .
These early humans may have survived in island South - East Asia until 50,000 years ago .
Recent discoveries suggest that on the Indonesian island of Flores , Homo erectus , or another early human species , became isolated and evolved into a dwarf species called Homo floresiensis , nicknamed " The Hobbit " .
It is not clear whether H. erectus ever reached Europe ; the earliest European fossils have been assigned to the species Homo antecessor .
But this classification is disputed , and some researchers believe the Spanish antecessor fossils do indeed belong with H. erectus .

Personal blog
2/9/07 : " David Ray Griffin has web - published a splendid , highly footnoted account of The Destruction of the World Trade Center : Why the Official Account Cannot Be True :
This scholarly work , rich in eyewitness accounts , includes 11 separate pieces of evidence that the World Trade Center towers 1 , 2 [ each 1300 + feet tall , 110 stories ] and 7 were brought down by explosives .
[ Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
Finally , on 11/20/08 , more than seven years after 9/11 , the Federal government published its final report on the collapse of WTC 7 , which " found that the fires on multiple floors in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event . "
Despite the absence of any visible fire at the time of collapse , the government report alleges WTC Building 7 is the first and only steel - framed high - rise building in the history of mankind to collapse simply as the result of a fire . ]
... I implore my fellow physicists and engineers who may have the time , expertise , and ( ideally ) supercomputer access to get to work on the physics of the World Trade Center collapses and publish their findings in refereed journals like , say , the Journal of Applied Physics .
The issue of knowing who was really behind the 9/11 attacks is of paramount importance to the future of our country , because the " official " assumption that it was the work of 19 Arab amateurs ( 1 ) does not match the available facts and ( 2 ) has led directly to the deplorable Patriot Act , the illegal Iraq war , NSA spying on ordinary Americans , repudiation of the Geneva Conventions , and the repeal of habeas corpus ( a fundamental point of law that has been with us since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 ) .
Surely these Orwellian consequences of public ignorance constitute more than sufficient motivation for any patriotic American physicist or engineer to join the search for 9/11 Truth ! "

Despite the absence of any visible fire at the time of collapse , the government report alleges WTC Building 7 is the first and only steel - framed high - rise building in the history of mankind to collapse simply as the result of a fire . ]
... I implore my fellow physicists and engineers who may have the time , expertise , and ( ideally ) supercomputer access to get to work on the physics of the World Trade Center collapses and publish their findings in refereed journals like , say , the Journal of Applied Physics .
The issue of knowing who was really behind the 9/11 attacks is of paramount importance to the future of our country , because the " official " assumption that it was the work of 19 Arab amateurs ( 1 ) does not match the available facts and ( 2 ) has led directly to the deplorable Patriot Act , the illegal Iraq war , NSA spying on ordinary Americans , repudiation of the Geneva Conventions , and the repeal of habeas corpus ( a fundamental point of law that has been with us since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 ) .
Surely these Orwellian consequences of public ignorance constitute more than sufficient motivation for any patriotic American physicist or engineer to join the search for 9/11 Truth ! "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "

" Without any serious study I had simply accepted that the events of 9/11 were as commonly perceived , although I was not happy with the way the disaster was being used to promote what I felt were illegal and self defeating imperialistic policies in the guise of the War on Terrorism .
It was not until early 2006 that I stumbled upon sufficient information to become suspicious of the " official " and generally accepted 9/11 storyline .

" Scholars and professionals with various kinds of expertise --- including architects , engineers , firefighters , intelligence officers , lawyers , medical professionals , military officers , philosophers , religious leaders , physical scientists , and pilots --- have spoken out about radical discrepancies between the official account of the 9/11 attacks and what they , as independent researchers , have learned .
They have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the official account of 9/11 is false and that , therefore , the official “ investigations ” have really been cover - up operations .
Thus far , however , there has been no response from political leaders in Washington or , for that matter , in other capitals around the world .
Our organization , Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth , has been formed to help bring about such a response .
We believe that the truth about 9/11 needs to be exposed now --- not in 50 years as a footnote in the history books --- so the policies that have been based on the Bush - Cheney administration ’s interpretation of the 9/11 attacks can be changed .
We are , therefore , calling for a new , independent investigation of 9/11 that takes account of evidence that has been documented by independent researchers but thus far ignored by governments and the mainstream media . "

Essay Painful 9/11 Truth 9/4/07 : " Many technical analyses cast doubt on the official explanation of the collapse of three World Trade Center buildings , including those presented by an impressive new group : Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
More difficult than discovering the truth , however , is convincing most of the public to accept the bitter truth .
...
When it comes to 9/11 , we face the strong belief that only al - Qaeda caused 9/11 .
But analyses by many experts reveal the collapse of the three WTC buildings was not caused by the two airplanes exploding into the twin towers .
Without getting into details that one can spend many hours examining on a number of websites , the general view is that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition .
If correct , the immediate reaction is like a cosmic big bang .
It would have taken considerable effort by a number of people with expertise and access to the buildings to rig them so that they could be intentionally collapsed when the two jets hit the towers .
Tough questions flood in : Who could have engineered all this ?
Could foreign agents accomplish such complex actions - and if they did , why not take credit for it ?
If Americans did it , why would they intentionally inflict inevitable mass death and devastation ?
Worse , they seemingly knew about the plan to fly the jets into the towers .
Post - 9/11 , why have the government and official investigations not come to the same controlled demolition conclusion ?
This makes sense if the government was involved .
...
Like other groups , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth wants a new , honest and comprehensive study that considers all the evidence for controlled demolition .
As a former engineering professor with growing skepticism about the official WTC story I share their concerns .
First , let the technical truth emerge .
Then , if necessary , cope with the inevitable political , conspiracy and other questions .
But let us not allow a possible painful truth block the primary task of determining once and for all what caused the collapse of the WTC towers and building no .
7 . ...
If those that believe the official 9/11 story - especially elected officials - trust their views , then let them support a serious effort to test the validity of the controlled demolition hypothesis .
If they fear and reject doing so , then let us see that as suspicious and unacceptable .
To sum up , horrific possible answers can cause us to shun a question .
But clearing our minds of the fear of painful truths is essential to clearing our nation of destructive lies .
Otherwise , we stay stuck in a delusional democracy . "

Statement to this website
12/14/09 :
" Truth , Ethics and Professionalism are completely lacking in the official aftermath and investigations surrounding the 911 disasters .
Unfortunately we went to war predicated on lies , sustained in lies , and perpetuated in lies .
The quickest way to stop this endless warring is to expose the truth about what and who caused the 911 disaster .
It is clear that the World Trade Center buildings 1 , 2 and 7 were brought down in a contrived and controlled demolition from within .
Where is the investigation ?
Who really benefited from this ?
In any criminal investigation the first question asked is “ who benefited ” .
Just follow the money .
Why do we prolong the conflagration through endless war , creating untold misery for men , women and children in the Middle East and for our own young sons and daughters and their families ?
The most disgusting thing I have witnessed in my entire life was the spectacle of the richest and most powerful nations on Earth utterly destroying some of the poorest and most destitute countries .
What corruption lies behind this shame ?
It is time to firmly demand a proper investigation to uncover the truths behind 911 , and set about repairing the damages . "

Video documentary 9 - 11 Open Your Eyes The War On Terror Is A Lie 5/04 :
" There was a discussion going on about what actually hit the Pentagon .
It could scarcely have been an airliner .
There 's been a lot of evidence on that .
And there 's questions whether it might have been a fighter plane or it might have been a missile .
There have been rather detailed engineering calculations -- simulations -- done , which would make it pretty clear that something like an airliner , which is largely aluminum , would have simply been shredded by the number of steel - reinforced columns that occur in the Pentagon , where it hit .
And so there 's no possibility of an airplane penetrating very far into the Pentagon .
Whereas whatever entered actually punched a hole three rings into the Pentagon , so it had been through six reinforced ground floor walls of the Pentagon as well as all these columns .
And it 's impossible .
So , I think the only thing which might conceivably do that is a hardened missile .
... at 6:38 of video at http://www.archive.org/details/911o
" One can make some pretty definite conclusions by looking at evidence about their -- available evidence -- about their collapse .
The towers were supported by 47 massive steel columns , which extended up the central part of each tower .
And the official story is that the fuel from the plane got into this space around these columns and then softened the columns , so that the towers eventually collapsed .
That 's highly unlikely in terms of the amount of heat necessary to soften steel , which just really was n't available and it would require a perfect mix of fuel and all kinds of things like that .
But aside from that , the vision is that this central core of the building was turned into an inferno to soften these columns .
But that 's preposterous because between the columns were the elevators and the services and the staircases going up the towers .
And the elevators and staircases were actually in use during this time .
So the thesis is people were quietly walking through an inferno .
And so , it 's a total absurdity . " at 14:30 of the video at http://www.archive.org/details/911o

We were told that terrorists hiding in Afghanistan perpetrated the attack and few questioned our subsequent military response .
There are , however , troubling questions about 9/11 that are as yet unanswered by our government .
For one , why did our military fail to intercept any of the airplanes on 9/11 ?
Was this failure the result of gross incompetence , or was a stand down order in place ?
Many have come forward to sign petitions to Congress to reopen the investigation of the 9/11 attacks , especially the reason (s ) for the collapse of WTC7 .

" Terrorism supplants communism as the enemy our government uses to justify military intervention abroad .
Former Carter National Security Advisor , Zbigniew Brzezinski , advocated in a 1997 book for America ’s domination of the world through military intimidation .
He audaciously stated that America ’s democracy at home was in opposition to this goal and what was needed was “ a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . ”

Signatory : Petition requesting a reinvestigation of 9/11 , signed by more than 1,500 Architects and Engineers :
" On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
Finally , on 11/20/08 , more than seven years after 9/11 , the Federal government published its final report on the collapse of WTC 7 , which " found that the fires on multiple floors in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event . "
Despite the absence of any visible fire at the time of collapse , the government report alleges WTC Building 7 is the first and only steel - framed high - rise building in the history of mankind to collapse simply as the result of a fire .

Statement 7/1/07 : " The frequently repeated TV images of the aircraft slamming into the World Trade Centre overwhelmed any thoughtful response .
Naturally , the collapse of the buildings was attributable to this traumatic event .
It was only later when pictures emerged showing the inappropriate damage to the Pentagon – reported to have been caused by a large aircraft crashing through several layers of external wall – that professional doubt was aroused in my mind .
Thereafter ,
The fall of the World Trade Center video showed the side of one tower ‘ unzipping ’ along one side of a damaged floor .
My knowledge of structure and dynamics told me that unless the other sides simultaneously ‘ unzipped ’ there was no way that the tower would have ‘ pancaked ’ onto it ’s own footprint : it should surely have toppled outwards .
That both towers did the same was just too improbable to be plausible .
Hence I am anxious to learn what really happened . "

Member : Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth Association Statement :
" Scholars and professionals with various kinds of expertise --- including architects , engineers , firefighters , intelligence officers , lawyers , medical professionals , military officers , philosophers , religious leaders , physical scientists , and pilots --- have spoken out about radical discrepancies between the official account of the 9/11 attacks and what they , as independent researchers , have learned .
They have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the official account of 9/11 is false and that , therefore , the official “ investigations ” have really been cover - up operations .
Thus far , however , there has been no response from political leaders in Washington or , for that matter , in other capitals around the world .
Our organization , Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth , has been formed to help bring about such a response .
We believe that the truth about 9/11 needs to be exposed now --- not in 50 years as a footnote in the history books --- so the policies that have been based on the Bush - Cheney administration ’s interpretation of the 9/11 attacks can be changed .
We are , therefore , calling for a new , independent investigation of 9/11 that takes account of evidence that has been documented by independent researchers but thus far ignored by governments and the mainstream media . "

Video of speech
9/11/04 : " A lot of these pieces of information , taken together , prove that the official story , the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 is a bunch of hogwash .
It ’s impossible . …
There ’s a second group of facts having to do with the cover up . …
Taken together these things prove that high levels of our government do n’t want us to know what happened and who ’s responsible .
...
Who gained from 9/11 ?
Who covered up crucial information about 9/11 ?
And who put out the patently false stories about 9/11 in the first place ?
When you take those three things together , I think the case is pretty clear that it ’s highly placed individuals in the administration with all roads passing through Dick Cheney .
I think the very kindest thing that we can say about George W. Bush and all the people in the U.S. Government that have been involved in this massive cover - up , the very kindest thing we can say is that they were aware of impending attacks and let them happen .
Now some people will say that ’s much too kind , however even that is high treason and conspiracy to commit murder . "

Author of Flying Blind , Flying Safe ( 1998 ) .
Article The New York Observer 2/15/04 : " Ms. Schiavo sat in on the commission 's hearing on aviation security on 9/11 and was disgusted by what it left out .
" In any other situation , it would be unthinkable to withhold investigative material from an independent commission , " she told this writer .
" There are usually grave consequences .
But the commission is clearly not talking to everybody or not telling us everything . " ...
The timeline that is most disturbing belongs to the last of the four suicide missions -- United Airlines Flight 93 , later presumed destined for the U.S. Capitol , if not the White House .
Huge discrepancies persist in basic facts , such as when it crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside near Shanksville .
The official impact time according to NORAD , the North American Air Defense Command , is 10:03 a.m. Later , U.S. Army seismograph data gave the impact time as 10:06:05 .
The FAA gives a crash time of 10:07 a.m.
And The New York Times , drawing on flight controllers in more than one FAA facility , put the time at 10:10 a.m .
Up to a seven - minute discrepancy ?
In terms of an air disaster , seven minutes is close to an eternity .
The way our nation has historically treated any airline tragedy is to pair up recordings from the cockpit and air - traffic control and parse the timeline down to the hundredths of a second .
But as Mary Schiavo points out , " We do n't have an NTSB ( National Transportation Safety Board ) investigation here , and they ordinarily dissect the timeline to the thousandth of a second . "

Press conference statement
6/10/02 : " First of all , the question is not ' What they should have known ? '
And I believe I can show you in just a few seconds the question is , ' What did they know ? '
And believe me , they knew a lot .
The second thing to emphasize is that in every single aviation disaster , whether there was intervening criminal activity or not , in every single one in the course of modern aviation history it has been followed by , not only were it necessary , a criminal investigation , but also a National Transportation Safety investigation into what went wrong in the aviation system .
And the reason for that is so that it never happens again .
[ Editor 's Note :
The NTSB never conducted full investigations of the four plane crashes on 9/11 .
The NTSB 's official position for each plane involved on 9/11 is , " The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 are under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The Safety Board provided requested technical assistance to the FBI , and this material generated by the NTSB is under the control of the FBI .
The Safety Board does not plan to issue a report or open a public docket . " ]
This is the first time , and this is the worst disaster , but this is the first time that families have been attempted to be silenced through a special fund , which I believe is about silence more so than about money .
Why ? ...
And from my rounds on the Hill to find these facts and others , I found that the airlines approached members of Congress and the Senate to get their bailout and their immunity and their protection starting on 9/11 .
They sent their first lobbyist up to the Hill on 9/11 .
And this has been confirmed to me personally by Senators and members of Congress .
Now to me that 's very shocking but to me it raises another question , why ?
Why did they have to rush to the Hill to change the law ? ...
So in the wake of September 11 , 2001 , when we heard the carriers and governments alike saying , “ Oh , no one could have foreseen this .
No one knew that this was coming .
No one knew that there was any risk like this in the world , ” is absolutely false .
...
In the last thirty years we have had 682 hijackings .
682 . Here 's an interesting statistic .
When we had the United States saying , ' Oh , we could n't have known this . '
In the Q&A section : " We did have another plot in the United States to hijack a plane and crash it into a building .
And , by the way , we had a government cost / benefit analysis of this very same scenario .
The only problem with this government cost / benefit analysis was they used a 737 and figured it would be one plane crashed into a building .
So I do believe that the government certainly knew that these things were possible .
In fact it had been attempted before and the information was out there .
But we do tend to get , as a government , tend to get bogged down in the cost / benefit analysis .
And I , for one , happen to agree that the warnings were very fairly specific .
June 22nd FAA issued a bulletin that had concerns about terrorism .
July 2nd FAA told the airlines the man involved in the millennium plot had intention of using explosives in terminal buildings .
July 18th the FAA issued a bulletin that said there are terrorist threats and we urge you to use caution .
July 31 that there are going to be terror groups planning and training for hijacking .
Use caution .
And finally August 16th disguised weapons .
So I think the warning signs were not only ample but specific and there was previous attacks where planes were going to be used to crash into buildings .
So only the government can probably answer now at this point why they did n't take them seriously . "
