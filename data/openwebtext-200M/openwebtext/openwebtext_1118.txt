Sadly , when it comes to Americans and job satisfaction the outlook is not particularly good .
When it comes down to ...
SEPTEMBER 10 -- A quintet of young TV actresses was arrested last month on disorderly conduct charges after they allegedly participated in a photo shoot while hanging over a bridge above a Georgia interstate .
The women , four of whom star in " The Vampire Diaries , " a show debuting tonight on the CW network , were nabbed on August 22 after cops received numerous 911 calls about " females hanging from " the Rumble Road Bridge in Smarr , a town about 65 miles south of Atlanta ( where the drama is filmed ) .
The women were also reportedly " flashing motorists " driving northbound on Interstate 75 .
According to a Monroe County Sheriff 's Office report , the actresses were being shot by photographer Tyler Shields , whose digital cameras were inspected by a cop who discovered numerous images showing " the females hanging , sitting and straddling the bridge . "
One photo , a deputy noted , " even showed one female being held by her legs by the other females , as if they were trying to throw her over . "
As seen in the mug shots at left , the arrestees included Nina Dobreva , 20 , the lead actress in " The Vampire Diaries . "
Dobreva 's co-stars , Candice Accola , 22 , and Kayla Ewell , 24 , were also popped ( Dobreva , Accola , and Ewell are featured prominently on the CW web site and in ads and commercials promoting the show ) .
Actresses Krystal Vayda ( who is not in the cast ) and Sara Canning , 22 , and photographer Tyler Shields , 27 , were also collared .
The six arrestees were booked at the Monroe County lockup , where each posed for a mug shot .
Shields laughed when TSG told him how cops claimed that one actress was dangled from the bridge .
" They have a flair for the drama , " he said .
" I did n't Suge Knight the cast of ' The Vampire Diaries . ' "
The photographer , who said the group " never did anything remotely bad " during the shoot , told TSG that he paid $ 4000 in fines to settle the charges against the group .

What are the political threats of the 21st century going to be ?
Politics changes over time , so it 's fair to say they 're going to be different from those of the past .
However , history has a habit of being self - similar , so to start with I 'm going to take a look back at the past century .
The big political change of the 20th century was the triumph of democracy .
At the start of that period , the overwhelming majority of nations were ruled by hereditary monarchies , where your eligibility for a position of power was dictated by an accident of birth ( and the loyalty of the army and secret police ) .
Most of the monarchies were totalitarian , and lest you think of them as somehow glamorous , I 'd like to remind you that we have another name for absolute monarchism these days : hereditary dictatorship ( and the poster child for that system is currently North Korea , where a third Kim appears likely to ascend to the throne chair of the central committee in the next few months ) .
Nevertheless , we 've somehow fumbled our way through to a world where in an outright majority of nations , your birth is not a barrier to holding high office , and even more importantly , the high officers of state are in principle directly accountable to the public .
This change was not inevitable .
The collapse of the western monarchies between 1917 and 1919 was largely a consequence of a war that need not have happened .
And it left a power vacuum , and warring modernist ideologies sought to occupy the vacuum .
One of these , Communism in its Leninist form , was initially idealist and utopian — but made the fatal twin mistakes of adopting an elitist , authoritarian leadership structure , and of hewing to ideology over pragmatic reality when the piles of skulls began building up .
( The road to hell , good intentions , you know the drill . )
The other big contender , Fascism , made no bones about its purpose : it was going to replace the tired , old hereditary dictatorship monarchy with a thrusting , dynamic , air - minded new dictatorship wearing shiny jackboots and reinvigorating the national spirit , which had grown tired and decadent in the fifty - something years since Italy was reuinted .
Nazism stole Fascism 's uniform and took it to a logical , horrible conclusion , and today Nazism is so thoroughly discredited that nobody takes its politics seriously ( only its xenophobia and hatred ) : but Fascism in the broader sense is worth understanding , because it 's still out there ( especially in Italy ) .
If you have n't read it already , Umberto Eco 's essay Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt is absolutely vital to understanding the Fascist mind - set .
( Obligatory troll - bait : John Scalzi was absolutely correct when he gave Jonah Goldberg a wedgie for trying to redefine the author of the Fascist Manifesto as a Socialist .
If your ideological reality tunnel is so narrow that you do n't get that Mussolini was a Fascist and that Aneurin Bevan was not a Fascist , you 're not going to get much out of the rest of this essay . )
But enough about the 20th century .
We know what happened to the two big modernist contenders for the power vacuum left behind after the fall of the monarchies ( although many books have been filled scratching the surface of their history ) .
We even know about the also - ran contenders that never quite reached take - off speed : Technocracy , Libertarianism , and so on .
And now , the future ...
There are many ways of looking at the politics of the 21st century , and I 'm no political scientist ; so this is an informal brain dump of what I 'm thinking about right now — a pragmatic tour of some issues .
Firstly , it 's not going to be about the environment .
That war is over — what 's currently going on is basically the mopping - up operation , the equivalent of rooting out the last hereditary absolute monarchies to cling on into the 1930s .
What opposition there is , consists of the aristocrats sticking their fingers in their ears and shouting " I can't hear you ! " as they sit in the tumbrils queuing up at the foot of the guillotine .
Quibbling about hockey - stick curves wo n't get you very far when the oceans are being overrun by toxic jellyfish and anoxic zones , when parts of Australia are peaking at 37 degrees ( just shy of human body temperature ) in winter , and Vanuatu is being evacuated ahead of the rising tides .
Secondly , it 's not going to be about privacy and intellectual property .
Or rather , it 's going to be about privacy and intellectual property the way that the 20th century was about steam locomotives and iron foundries .
These were vital 19th century technologies that provided a platform for 20th century industries to evolve on top of , but triple - condensing steam engines tell us nothing about semiconductor fab lines : they lie too far down the stack of incremental technologies .
By the time we reach 2050 , the microprocessor and software industries will be about as innovative and interesting as steam locomotives were in 1950 ; and the big questions about privacy and IP will have been answered ( hint : ubiquitous polycentric surveillance , some sort of abstraction layer to encapsulate and insulate the public against the crisis of copyright , and a generation for whom the concept of " blackmail " makes less sense than bleeding with leeches as a cure for a surfeit of billious humours ) .
Thirdly , it 's not going to be about biotechnology any more than the 20th century was about powered heavier - than - air flight .
Yes , flight was and is important , but not in the way the Italian modernists of the first three decades imagined , with their manifestos about " air - mindedness " and Douhet 's insane , apocalyptic visions of air power — that led to such atrocities as the British Empire 's policing with bombers ( dropping poison gas ! ) in the 1920s , and strategic bombing raids against civilian populations during subsequent wars .
For the most part , military aviation falls into two categories ( better artillery , and better logistics ) ; it does n't really change warfare , it just makes the whole barbaric affair more efficient ( which is to say , more destructive ) .
Biotechnology is going to be an efficiency enabler for a whole lot of things , and have immense second - order effects ( just like cheap air travel ) , but it 's not going to fundamentally change us ( unless some lunatic repeats the mousepox / interleukin - 4 experiment with weaponized smallpox , in which case we are probably all dead ) .
So what should we be looking at ?
Astute readers might just have noticed by now that I have an interest in transhumanism and extropianism .
( I 've even written a novel that takes some of these themes seriously : Accelerando . )
There 's a loose cluster of memes floating around which , like the earlier modernist ideologies , postulate that the human condition is a variable not a constant .
( Conservativism , in contrast , assumes that human nature is unchanging : a notion which I refute by inviting its proponents to show me around their caves and give me a tutorial in knapping flints . )
Unlike earlier Enlightenment ideologies that looked to the perfectability of humanity in terms of training and education ( from the Scottish Kirk to the Soviet Communists ) , transhumanism focusses on minimizing human constraints by applying new technologies : genetic engineering and tissue engineering , smart drugs , brain implants , mind uploading , life prolongation , artificial intelligence , and so on .
I should nail my colours to the mast at this point and say that , as a child of the enlightenment myself , I 'm all in favour of abolishing pain , disability , death , stupidity , and other existential taxes ( although I suspect this laundry list is incomplete without the inclusion of sparkly ponies , or at least a chicken in every pot ) .
Maximizing individual freedom to the extent that it does n't infringe on our neighbours ' freedom is hard to argue with — at least until you start arguing about what freedom is : what about freedom to starve , freedom to abuse your kids , or freedom from having your pocket picked to pay for the influenza vaccine for the deadbeat next door who will otherwise incubate , infect , and kill you ?
Individual freedom versus community interests is a knotty problem , and we do n't have a definitive answer to it because we all have different expectations ( and evaluations of our perceived needs ) .
But .
To get to the money shot : transhumanism is going to influence the next century because , unless we are very unlucky indeed , the biotechnology , nanotechnology , and telecommunications industries are going to deliver goods that combine to fundamentally change the human condition .
We 've seen the tip of the iceberg so far : news stories like this would have been fodder for an SF story twenty or thirty years ago , and this video ( playing pong !
Using transcranial brain interfaces ! ) probably still is .
But do n't be deceived : we 're entering strange territory .
And what particularly exercises me is the possibility that if we can alter the parameters of the human condition , we can arbitrarily define some people as being better than others — and can make them so .
Not all transhumanists have good intentions .
Earlier I went on for a while about Italy , home of the Modernist movement in art and birthplace of Fascism .
Italy 's currently in the grip of a wave of racism and neofascist vigilantism , presided over by an allegedly racist media mogul with a near - monopoly on broadcast media in that country .
So it 's probably not surprising that Italy is the source of a new political meme that I had n't heard of before this week : overhumanism : Italian overhumanism is heavily influenced by the " Nouvelle Droite " , a fringe political movement that emerged from the French neofascist microcosm in the late ' 70s / early ' 80s , and which attempted to bring far - right ideas into the mainstream by discarding the trappings of historical Fascism in order to convey a similar message in a less unpalatable form .
In common with the Nouvelle Droite , it borrows heavily from the extreme left ( anti-americanism , anti-clericalism , opposition to globalisation ) , and has adopted neopaganism as a religious stance .
While affirming the importance of science in modern life , this hybrid offspring of neofascism also maintains more traditional far - right positions such as elitism , antiegalitarianism and an interest in ethnic identity that crosses into differentialist racism .
Did you get that ?
The fascists have noticed transhumanism , and decided that they like it .
To continue to quote Giancarlo Stile 's warning about the overhumanists : Nobody doubts that the overhumanists accept what could be called the Central Meme of Transhumanism ( CMT ) , the affirmation that it is ethical and desirable to employ technoscientific means to fundamentally improve the human condition .
However , this is only the lowest common denominator of transhumanism and can be adopted , and adapted to their own needs , by most political ideologies , bioconservative and neoluddite ones excluded .
That obviously leaves enough room for manoeuvre for some far - right and far - left extremists .
It could be argued that this is a strong point of transhumanism , but the other side of the coin is what we have witnessed with the emergence of overhumanism .
The founders of modern transhumanism , conscious of these risks , attempted to anchor the CMT to concepts such as the respect of the individual , freedom , tolerance and democracy , underlining how transhumanism 's roots are in the Enlightenment , in humanism and liberalism . [ 8 ]
Extropians have gone further , trying to anchor the CMT to concepts such as spontaneous order at first , and open society later , [ 9 ] but it would seem that the overhumanists are more than capable of the ideological contortionism necessary to describe themselves as transhumanists , while maintaning their critique of human rights , their ethno- identitarian obessions , their " Eurasian " fantasies , the fixation with indoeuropean ethnicity , etc .
Did you get that ?
The fascists have noticed transhumanism , and decided that they like it .
To continue to quote Giancarlo Stile 's warning about the overhumanists :
To be fair , Overhumanism is n't the whole story about transhumanism in Italy .
Bruce Sterling picked it up first : there are two different transhumanist organizations , only one of which is wearing the chrome - plated jackboots .
Nevertheless , the emergence of this ideology is giving me the cold shudders , because I suspect it 's a sign of things to come that will have momentous effects down the line , late in the 21st century .
Why does it matter ?
The whole of our constructed weltanschaung of modernity and enlightenment values and democracy rests on the fundamental axiom that existing human lives are of equivalent value .
Back in the bad old days , under the monarchies , in the era of chattel slavery , that was n't so : some people were worth more than others .
Update the vision : if your king ( or your slave owner ) needs a new kidney ( or heart ) , then you 'd better hope you 're not a histocompatible donor .
But as long as we 're only dealing with Humanity 1.0 , it 's hard to argue on empirical grounds that one human is intrinsically worth more than another .
If we run into alien intelligences , or create artificial ones , we will be dealing with beings that may force us to reevaluate that basic axiom of the enlightenment project .
But otherwise we 've got nothing to fear ... except possibly the products of a political ideology that explicitly rejects the assumption of equality of opportunity .
We saw such ideologies at play before : indeed , one of them warped the middle of the 20th century in a ghastly , unforgettable manner .
And now there 's a new one that might , if it flourishes , evolve into the 21st century equivalent of Nazism .
I think a while back I wrote an SF novel about that , too , and it's not a good feeling to discover a bunch of folks who evidently see bits of it as a road map : " Hello .
We 're from the ReMastered race , and we 're here to help you . "
UPDATE : See comments # 64 and # 65 from some folks who are considerably closer to the Italian extropian scene than the rest of us .

Technically , it ’s illegal to resign from the British House of Commons .
Since 1623 the rules have stated that a member of Parliament cannot renounce the trust of his constituents .
So members use a loophole :
An MP who accepts an office of profit under the Crown must leave his post to avoid a conflict of interest .
So today when an MP wishes to resign , the chancellor of the exchequer appoints him crown steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or of the Manor of Northstead , and he can legally resign .
But even this workaround gets awkward .
Because there are only two available offices , sometimes MPs must wait in line .
When 15 Ulster unionists resigned en masse on Dec. 17 , 1985 , they had to be appointed one after another in quick succession through the day .
What will future historians make of this ?
Apple is once again using its updating program that comes with iTunes and QuickTime on Windows to push unwanted software .
This time around , the software in question is an iPhone enterprise tool that is more than useless for most consumers .
ZDNet spotted the update , though when we asked around we learned it was actually pushed out earlier this month .
Nevertheless , we downloaded iTunes and installed it on a Windows 7 machine to see if we could reproduce the annoyance .
We could .
Apple is , for whatever reason , pushing enterprise software to Windows PC users who use Apple software .
Here 's the description Apple gives for the iPhone Configuration Utility :
i Phone Configuration Utility lets you easily create , maintain , encrypt , and install configuration profiles , track and install provisioning profiles and authorized applications , and capture device information including console logs .
Configuration profiles are XML files that contain device security policies , VPN configuration information , Wi-Fi settings , APN settings , Exchange account settings , mail settings , and certificates that permit iPhone and iPod touch to work with your enterprise systems .
For instructions on how to use iPhone Configuration Utility , see the iPhone and iPod touch Enterprise Deployment Guide , available for downloading at http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/
Not only is this irrelevant to many iTunes users , since most of them do n't even have an iPhone , it 's cleary an enterprise tool that even the majority of iPhone users do n't need or want .
This " update " should not be checked by default , and instead should be clearly marked as optional .
To go even further , though , an update utility should not be prompting to install new software .
This is a new program that Apple Software Update is pushing to users , and not an update for a program or programs the user already has installed .
If Apple finds it necessary to include its update tool to anyone who installs iTunes or QuickTime , the company should make sure it only offers updates for installed software , and not push out new software whenever it feels like it .
Apple has been called out in the past for using its updater to push unwanted applications out to Windows users , but it looks like the bad press has n't had any long term impact .
In March 2008 , Apple was heavily criticized for pushing Safari to iTunes and QuickTime users , also through Apple Software Update on Windows .
The obvious goal was to increase the browser 's small market share on Windows ( and it worked , if not at least temporarily ) , but the way the company decided to do so was very sly .
The next month , Apple posted an " update to Software Update for updating software updates " which added a " New Software " category for listing any Apple software for Windows that is not already installed separately from other updates .
Unfortunately , it looks like Cupertino is n't following the rules it created in response to the previous outcries .
In the screenshot above , you can see that the MobileMe Control Panel is in this category , but why is n't the iPhone Configuration Utility ?
We have contacted Apple for comment , but have yet to receive a response to our inquiry .
If you 're not interested in waiting till the company fixes this issue , the only other solution we can offer you is a simple one : uninstall the Apple Software Update program .
The updater is not necessary to keep installed for any Apple software to work correctly on Windows .
If you are capable of updating your software manually , then this workaround is for you .
International Business Machines Corp .'s second - quarter profit rose 12 % as the company continued to hone its operations , but sales fell and the technology giant offered few signs businesses are prepared to resume spending .
IBM , which also raised its profit outlook for the full year , is benefiting from cost cutting and a shift to a richer business mix that includes more software sales and consulting contracts far removed from its traditional sales to corporate data centers -- such as helping utilities manage electrical grids .

The TriMet board is expected on Wednesday morning to take its first vote on a proposal to end free bus service in Fareless Square , effective Jan .
3 .
It would be the first major cut to the free zone , which was established in 1975 and has been expanded several times since .
While Fareless Square started as an effort to curb carbon monoxide emissions from cars , it has evolved into an icon of the region 's commitment to mass transit and sustainability .
It also has become a lightning rod for criticism of crime on mass transit .
Businesses paying the payroll tax that subsidizes free rides in the downtown area are concerned about what value it serves , according to the TriMet transit agency and the Portland Business Alliance .
And the Portland Police Bureau -- and some mass - transit riders -- say the fareless zone promotes an atmosphere of lawlessness , where panhandlers and rowdy teenagers annoy passengers , and drug dealers use the easy access for their trade .
Some in Clackamas and Washington counties say they also see little benefit from the service .
The square also has its champions , including downtown neighborhood advocates , mass transit activists and the tourism industry , which promotes the square 's symbolism .
They say the fareless policy encourages downtown living and mass transit use , which is ever more important in a recession and an era of rising oil prices .
TriMet has had a love - hate relationship with the service , proposing cuts after sporadic incidents of crime over the years , but also basking in the positive attention it draws from visitors .
The change to the square -- covering downtown Portland , Old Town , the convention center and Lloyd Center -- would simplify the system and save money as TriMet 's payroll tax collections fall with the recession , agency officials say .
Free rides would continue on the Portland Streetcar and MAX light rail , including two lines that begin running north - south through the downtown transit mall by September .
MAX and Streetcar riders account for nearly all users of fareless square , TriMet says , and the new north - south routes will extend make rail service accessible for all those trips .
TriMet would also offer a $ 25 two - year bus pass for elderly and disabled riders who live downtown , to help them retain access .
The agency also says that fareless service on buses is confusing for bus drivers , who lose track of riders to begin in the fareless zone but may try to continue to ride outside the zone without paying .
During a public comment period through July 17 and at two open houses last week , the agency received about 600 comments , TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch said .
About 60 percent of the comments supported the change .
TriMet will present a report on the public comments it received on Fareless Square at the board meeting on Wednesday .
The board also will hold a public hearing on the issue during its regular meeting , which is scheduled for 9 a.m. in Room C of the Portland Building , 1120 S.W. Fifth Ave .
The hearing might not come up until about 9:30 a.m. , Fetsch said .
A second reading and vote at the Aug. 12 board meeting would be required for final approval .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- FBI Director Robert Mueller harshly criticized the decision to release the Lockerbie bomber in a letter released Saturday , calling it " a mockery of the rule of law . "
FBI Director Rober Mueller called the release " detrimental to the cause of justice . "
Mueller , in a note to Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill , said MacAskill 's decision to release Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi is " as inexplicable as it is detrimental to the cause of justice . "
Al Megrahi had been serving a life sentence for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people , including 189 Americans , were killed .
MacAskill freed him after doctors concluded he has terminal prostate cancer and estimated he has three months to live .
In explaining his decision to release al Megrahi , MacAskill said that Scotland 's " justice system demands that judgment be imposed but compassion [ be ] available .
Our beliefs dictate that justice be served but mercy be shown . "
Al Megrahi received a jubilant welcome on his return to Libya , where a flag - waving crowd cheered and honked horns .
President Barack Obama said Friday that al Megrahi's warm reception was " highly objectionable . "
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called it " deeply upsetting . "
" Your action rewards a terrorist ... ( and ) makes a mockery of the emotions , passions and pathos of all those affected by the Lockerbie tragedy , " Mueller wrote .
" But most importantly , your action makes a mockery of the grief of the families who lost their own ...
You could not have spent much time with the families , certainly not as much time as others involved in the investigation and prosecution . "
Mueller told MacAskill he typically does n't comment on the actions of other prosecutors , but that he made an exception in this instance because he headed the investigation and indictment of Megrahi as an assistant attorney general in 1991 .
" You apparently made this decision without regard to the views of your partners in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the Lockerbie tragedy , " Mueller wrote .
" You have given the family members of those who died continued grief and frustration .
...
Where , I ask , is the justice ? "
Al Megrahi has always maintained his innocence , complaining that he had spent years in prison for something he did not do .
The Libyan government had accepted responsibility for the bombing and compensated victims ' families in a $ 2.7 billion deal that paved the way for sanctions against Libya to be dropped and for Tripoli to improve ties with the West .
But Thursday , after al Megrahi 's return , the Libyan official news agency JANA issued a statement from the government saying that al Megrahi had been " a political hostage , " as evidenced by his release .

Father Bob Maguire will continue on as parish priest at South Melbourne until February 2012 after reaching a compromise agreement with the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne , Denis Hart .
Father Bob , as he is widely known , has told AAP he will hand over the financial side of running the parish in return for staying on past his 75th birthday , which he celebrated earlier this month .
Under canon law , priests have to tender their resignation when they reach 75 .
" We 've signed an agreement where [ Archbishop Hart ] runs the place , and that 's all right according to my suits , " Father Bob said , referring to his lawyer .
With his lawyer by his side , Father Bob thanked the media and spoke of his victory in military terms .
" I'm an old digger and I salute the Archbishop as a senior officer , and he acknowledges my competence as the unit commander , " he said .
Archbishop
Hart agreed it was a good outcome .
" It 's a win - win ; Bob is going to do well what he does until he retires on the first of February 2012 , " he said .
A lawyer had hammered out the compromise after Father Bob refused to resign and garnered huge support from the Australian public .
" I 'm just glad that I 'm still the parish priest and South Melbourne can continue our work as another face of Catholicism , " he said .
" I 've agreed to resign in February 2012 but whether the public will want that , I do n't know . "
Archbishop Hart had accused Father Bob of financial mismanagement by selling off church property to fund his charities .
But Father Bob countered by saying the archbishop had to give final approval for any sale .
" I 'll have to find money from other sources to make sure disadvantaged people do n't suffer , " Father Bob said .
The priest , who has headed the South Melbourne parish for 36 years , is well known for his charities and helping feed the homeless in the inner city district .
He appears on triple j's weekly radio program Sunday Night Safran alongside John Safran .

Glenn Beck is becoming the model for the Intentionally Obtuse bloc of America 's right wing nutcases :
At the very moment when it 's becoming virtually unanimous -- even on Fox News -- that all this talk about " death panels " is the biggest load of hooey since black helicopters , he host a segment on his Fox News show with Ron Paul 's son , Rand , proclaiming the threat of government - sponsored euthanasia real , real , real .
Of course , it came with a Beckerwockian caveat :
Beck :
Tell me about – am I wrong in saying , without any inflammatory speech here , do n’t call them “ death panels ” , just let ’s call them what they are – you have a certain amount of money , you have a certain amount of people , you ca n’t -- they do n’t -- you ca n’t give everything to everybody , is n’t it inevitable that you have to make tough choices ?
Paul :
Well , you know , the president says he is n’t going to pull the plug on grandma , but what I think he really means is , he ’s not going to put the plug in in the first place , because you have to decide , some committee ’s going to have to decide , what is the cost - benefit analysis for grandma ?
Grandma is not just your grandmother , she 's a statistic , we have to decide , what is the cost to society to keep her alive ?
And I think she wo n't get plugged in .
Her ventilator wo n't be plugged in if she 's 92 years old , because society may say we do n't have the money to do that .
Sounds like someone has been watching Soylent Green -- or maybe Logan 's Run late at night .
But then , what else should we expect for someone named after one of the world 's worst now - deceased writers in combination with one of the world 's worst living writers ?
If Beck keeps this up , the stream of advertisers deserting him will turn into a flood .
Which is no less than he deserves .

One veteran has made a special journey of his own to mark the 64th anniversary of VJ Day .
Peter Heppell returned to the Burmese jungle , where he fought as part of the Chindits Special Force , to place a memorial .
He described his mission to the BBC's Robert Hall .
When you talk with Rand Paul , it 's impossible to forget that he is his father 's son .
The same kind of warmth , the same kind of genuineness of character , comes shining through .
So also the same issue emphasis comes through , along with his determination not to pull punches .
Like father , like son .
Paul talks about the national debt being the most important issue we face .
He does n't hesitate to say in the next breath that he decided to enter this campaign because he intends to win the Republican primary , and then the general election that follows it .
“ The debt is my main motivating reason for running for office , ” he said to me in his trademark clear and calm tone during a phone interview late yesterday afternoon .
“ It 's anticipated that the debt will reach 13 % of GNP next year , and that government spending will reach 28 % of GNP .
The Federal Reserve doubled the money base last year .
I think we 're going to pay for it with inflation once all this new money leaks into the economy .
I 'm projecting 1979 - style stagflation , possibly in as few as three years . ”
He does n't think the entire outlook is dire , but his attitude remains very cautionary .
He says , “ We 're going to get some growth .
The Dow may hit 10,000 , but it 's going to be joined by significant inflation and high unemployment .
With the fear that the Fed could pull the plug too soon without decent growth , we could see things get out of control . ”
He thinks that Republicans are ready for what he calls his “ tough love . ”
He does n't hesitate to share it with them .
“ As I 've been speaking to crowds across the state of Kentucky , I tell them that hypocrisy is the one , true bipartisan trait .
You 've got Republicans who wear their family values on their sleeves , then they head off to South America to spend time with their mistresses .
On the other side of the aisle , you have Democrats who say , ' Pay your fair share of taxes , ' then when appointed to high office , they do n't pay their fair share . ”
Surprisingly enough , his “ tough love ” seems to resonate with Republican voters , based on the feedback he gets .
A year or two ago , when his father said much the same kind of thing during the presidential election cycle , Republicans most often pooh - poohed and dismissed such notions .
Now , however , Paul thinks they 're receptive and paying attention .
He has good reason to think so .
With Congress 's 20 % approval rating , the fact that only 50 % of eligible voters register to vote , and the fact that 50 % of registered voters consistently vote in elections , it 's no wonder , he points out , that cynicism dominates the political scene these days .
“ The bank bailout was the worst vote of a generation , ” Paul declares .
“ It 's the gift that keeps on taking .
It 's gotten so bad that even minority broadcasters are now asking for TARP money .
The U.S. Treasury has so much discretion under the TARP law that they can use it to buy into any industry they want to within the United States . ”
Then he goes on to say , “ I think Republicans are ready to hear the tough love Rand Paul gives them .
Our party is an empty vessel unless we imbue it with values . ”
Will this combination of libertarian economics and appeals to traditional values work ?
Paul thinks so .
He also thinks he 'll need to raise $ 2 million overall to be a viable player in the primary .
He says so far his campaign has raised a little over $ 210,000 , and he has his money bomb coming up a week from today on August 20th , which could add another million if all goes well .
Like the Peter Schiff money bomb earlier this month , the goal is to get 10,000 donors to give $ 100 each .
So far , a little over 2,000 have pledged to donate that day .
Paul speaks highly of Schiff and notes with gratitude that Schiff donated money to Paul 's campaign .
He tries to return the favor and openly endorses Schiff 's drive for the Republican nomination in Connecticut 's Republican primary for Chris Dodd 's Senate seat next year .
I asked Paul how he plans to win his own race .
He says the three prongs to his campaign will include direct mail , radio and TV advertising , and door - to - door canvassing , particularly in the more densely populated centers of Kentucky : Louisville , Lexington , and Northern Kentucky ( near Cincinnati , OH ) .
“ When my Dad won [ his reelection bid in Texas ] in ' 96 , we got 30 or 40 kids and relatives to go out and canvas neighborhood doors of past primary voters .
We 'll do the same thing here in Kentucky , ” he described confidently .
He already has a small army to help him do just that .
He claims to have on - the - ground access to a few thousand people already expressing willingness to help the movement .
He has the support of Take Back Kentucky , a grassroots coalition dedicated to “ preserv[ing ] the God given rights that were recognized by the constitutions of Kentucky and the United States of America . ”
He also founded Kentucky Taxpayers United in 1994 under the umbrella of Take Back Kentucky .
He says the organization does a taxpayer rating and scorecard of individual representatives in the state legislature .
He also claims the support of Americans for Tax Reform which asks politicians to sign a pledge not to raise taxes if elected to office .
I asked him how his patients in his ophthalmology practice have reacted to his candidacy .
He answered , “ My patients are very supportive : Republicans , Democrats , and libertarians and independents though some are worried about me leaving my practice . ”
Not surprisingly , no one wants to lose a good eye doctor when they have one , although his patients also recognize we need people in government with 20 / 20 vision .
As an aside , I also asked him about his name .
Rumor has spread around the Internet that he was named after Ayn Rand , the late novelist .
He laughs and says , “ No , my given name at birth was Randall , but when I met my wife she thought I was too old to be ' Randy ' any more , so now I 'm just Rand . ”
He does emphasize , however , that he is a fan of Rand 's work , noting that it 's sad that she chose to be so authoritarian in her social circle .
Getting back to the election , Paul says he plans to contact 3,500 physicians from all specialties across the state of Kentucky , asking for their support .
He says his views on health care have initially received a warm reception from physicians .
He also plans to name coordinators for each of the counties in Kentucky in anticipation of ground - level campaigning and get out the vote efforts as primary day approaches , including well - staffed phone banks working toward that goal .
He also says , “ We register new voters everywhere we go and encourage independents and third party folks to re-register for the primary . ”
In other words , Rand Paul is pulling out all the stops and running full speed ahead for the Senate .
If he is able to follow through on his plans and intentions , front runner Trey Greyson better watch out .
He could find himself running from behind .
My name is Fumi , I was born and raised Kanazawa , where I have run my label , Rallye , for seven years .
I deal mostly with western artists , like Au Revoir Simone and Whitest Boy Alive , but I have a few Japanese artists as well .
I do n't mean to release albums only by Western artists , but sadly I do n't think there are any Japanese artists that are any good right now .
The lack of an independent / underground scene in Japan is mostly down to snooty attitudes among people who might be involved in potential scenes ; they 're more interested in trying to be cool than in doing anything original .
Shibuya - kei was the last real movement , 15 years ago – but even this just came from fashion , there was nothing more substantial or political to it .
Most bands do n't express themselves beyond fashion – except a few big artists promoting environmentalism .
This is partly because of the closed - minded nature of our country , something I wish would change .
In Japan , " punk " is not an attitude or a spirit , it is just a fashion .
So Japanese people will think that the Sex Pistols and Avril Lavigne are the same thing , because they are associated with a trend .
The British movie This Is England has just been released here , but young Japanense people in are more interested in the skinheads ' wardrobes than in the historical background .
They definitely enjoy it as a fashionable film , but wo n't consider its political content .
They do n't know what a skinhead really is .
Japanese people have a tendency to think that music is not " art " , but " entertainment " , something to be consumed .
We grow up with J - POP and this is what young bands aspire to : joining a major label and getting famous .
I think the reason why Japanese artists have n't gained international success is because they do n't have the ambition .
Japanese indie bands influenced by western groups tend to sound exactly like the bands they are influenced by – so they do n't appeal to an international audience because they do n't have anything original to offer .
The other reason for a lack of underground scenes developing is that there are not enough environments to support them .
Venue rental fees are costly , and bands have to pay to play : putting on gigs is expensive and not practical .
The Japanese music media is terrible , too : all the articles in music magazines are about bands from rich major labels , who pay for all the advertising .
In other words , if you have money , they will write positively about shitty bands .
The music magazines these days are like catalogues for major labels – there is no such thing as a music critic .
As told to Alex Hoban
For three decades , Rep. Ron Paul has waged a lonely battle in Congress to abolish the Federal Reserve .
But he has more foot soldiers across the nation today , particularly after the financial crisis , who are leading the drive for wider congressional audits of the central bank .
( See today ’s Journal story for more on their movement . )
In his new book — “ End the Fed ” — released today , Rep .
Paul walks through his critique of the central bank and lays out a strategy ( briefly ) for eliminating it .
We sat down with the congressman to hear his views on a money system backed by gold , the Fed ’s challenge of withdrawing its stimulus and his legislation to audit the central bank .
Excerpts of the interview :
What would a world without the Fed look like ?
You ’d go back to the day that if you wanted to borrow money to build a house , somebody would ’ve had to save some money .
You would n’t have zero savings and all the credit in the world .
That ’s just a total distortion of capitalism .
Capital comes from savings .
The part you do n’t use for everyday living which you have left over , you reinvest and you save or you loan it out .
We were living with something absolutely bizarre that had nothing to do with capitalism .
We had no savings whatsoever yet there was all the credit in the world .
So without the Fed , there would n’t be as much credit .
Yeah , it would be different .
If you were selling me a car and the car was worth $ 10,000 and I did n’t want to pay cash , you could take credit from me .
You ’ve got to have something to measure it by .
What is a dollar ?
We do n’t even know what a dollar is .
There ’s no definition for a dollar .
There ’s never been a time in law that said a Federal Reserve note is a dollar .
That ’s the basic flaw .
There ’s no definition for money .
We ’ve built a worldwide economy on a measuring rod that varies every single day .
That ’s why it was fragile , and that ’s why it collapsed .
There was no soundness to it .
So that ’s why you have to have a stable unit of account .
If you live in a primitive society , you ’d trade goods .
And if you wanted to advance , then you would trade a universal good , which would be a coin .
But we ’ve become sophisticated and smart and say , ‘ Oh , you do n’t have to go through that .
We ’ll just print the money .
And we ’ll trust the government not to print too much , and distribute it fairly . ’
That ’s often just a total farce .
People are realizing that it is .
Do n’t you think the Fed has moderated the business cycle over the past century ?
Yes , I think they did smooth things out .
The market ’s always demanding the correction of the malinvestment and the excessive debt .
…
Since Bretton
Woods broke down , I think every recession has been moderated by the Fed .
That ’s why the trust kept being built .
That ’s all a negative .
You have to get rid of the mistakes .
Moderating it means that we have slowed up the correction .
The fact that they have been successful is probably the worst part about it .
They ’re moderating the rapidity of the crash and the correction by holding the mistakes in place .
What if , years from now , we see that the Fed has returned its balance sheet to its old size and pulled that money back from the system ?
Would that not be a validation of its approach ?
There has only been one time that I know of where they have done that significantly , to withdraw anything of significance .
That was after the Civil War .
They withdrew greenbacks to a degree , they quit printing greenbacks , and they balanced the budget .
I do n’t think you can find any other time in our history and probably the history of the world .
Because it ’s an addiction , and the withdrawal is always much more serious than the continuation .
The immediate problem of continuing the inflation is always more acceptable than withdrawal symptoms .
Politically there will be continued inflation until it self - destructs .
So you do n’t think it ’s possible to pull it off ?
They might try a little bit .
With a weak economy , they ’ll say it ’s better for the economy to have low interest rates .
If we did n’t have a Federal Reserve today , interest rates might be market driven .
A lot of people would go bankrupt , but it would benefit the people who save .
Capitalism is supposed to benefit the people who save .
Even though they ’re cheating the people who save , they ’re cheating those on fixed income and the elderly , they will not quit inflating .
The pain will be too great .
They ’re smart enough to know ?
They were n’t smart enough to know when they printed .
They created the bubble .
All of a sudden they ’re going to get smart enough to know when to withdraw this ?
There ’s not one chance in a million that ’s going to happen .
But if the Fed were to pull this off and return its balance sheet to a normal size , where would that leave you ?
If they were able to shrink their assets by 50 % , to a trillion dollars or so … I would say it would challenge a lot of people .
But I think the economic laws are in place .
It ’s only going to be temporary .
It ’s not going to happen .
The only way you could do that is what I ’ve been advocating for these last several years .
You ’ve got to cut spending , you ’ve got to balance the budget , you ’ve got to stop fighting these wars , you ’ve got to bring our troops home , you ’ve got to quit expanding the welfare state here at home …
But I just do n’t think the conditions exist .
In theory you could , but if you do that without shrinking the size of the government and shrinking the deficit , it will be disastrous .
It wo n’t work .
How would an audit lead to ending the Fed ?
It ’s a stepping stone .
I think what ’s going to lead to the next step is the destruction of the dollar , just like economic events moved further ahead than my legislative process .
I was n’t getting anywhere .
But the economic events demanded that we look into it .
So even if this bill passes and we have more information and we ’re talking about monetary policy reform , I do n’t think that ’s the way this system is going to be ended .
I think it ’ll be ended when it ’s a total failure and then it ’ll have to be replaced by something .
It could be replaced with a more authoritarian government , a more socialistic government .
Do you think the Fed will be abolished during your career ?
I always thought the day would come …
This economy is going to get worse and this dollar is going to get a lot worse .
It ’ll take care of itself .
My real goal is educating people to the nature of money so that when this system fails , that they ’ll know what to do and not just say ‘ Well , we need a better manager . ’
Three sourpuss Parks Department agents put the squeeze on a 10 - year - old girl in Riverside Park yesterday , slapping the tyke with a $ 50 ticket for hawking lemonade without a permit .
Clementine Lee , who lives just blocks from the Upper West Side park , had dreamed of opening a lemonade stand since last year and took advantage of yesterday ’s beautiful weather to set up shop .
“ It was such a hot day I figured people would want a cold drink , ” the aspiring juvenile juice mogul told The Post .
Business was booming for Clementine and her photographer dad , Richard , 49 , for the first 20 minutes at the stand on West 73rd Street and Riverside Drive .
The father - daughter team was able to sell 10 glasses of the ice - cold drink for 50 cents each and the dozen chocolate chip cookies they baked .
But their day turned into the pits at 3 p.m. when the heartless pack of city sticklers iced their operation .
“ They approached us nonchalantly but then surrounded us , ” the peeved papa recalled .
“ They were very hostile as soon as they approached , saying ‘ Where ’s your permit ?
Where ’s your permit ? ’ ”
When Richard admitted he did n’t have the right to sell on Parks property , the agents immediately slapped the dad and daughter with a summons for selling food without a license , which carries a maximum fine of $ 200 .
“ You ’ve got to be kidding me , this is outrageous ! ” he told the agents .
Dozens of onlookers rallied to the pair ’s defense , shouting that the Parks officers were violating the Lees ’ civil rights , but the brokenhearted pair packed up and went home .
“ Do n’t these agents have anything better to do ? ” Richard fumed to The Post .
“ They could have at least told us to move but they did n’t give us a chance .
“ There are better ways to raise money for the Parks Department then busting 10 year - olds . ”
His soccer - enthusiast daughter said the ordeal left a bitter taste in her mouth .
“ I was really nervous when these three agents cornered me and my dad , ” said Clementine , who loves classical music and has been playing violin since she was 4 .
“ I think they should let people sell lemonade out here .
We were n’t hurting anyone . ”
But yesterday , after The Post contacted the department , Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe announced that the ticket would be nixed .
“ The agent used extremely poor judgment ” and did n’t properly enforce the rule , Benepe said .
The bumbling Parks enforcement patrol officer will be re-trained on rules and regulations and will be reassigned , he added .
“ We ’re going to make lemonade out of lemons . . .
I look forward to buying lemonade from her if I pass by , ” said the commissioner .
Clementine said she might take him up on the offer .
“ I ’m going to wait a little while , but I ’d love to [ sell lemonade ] again , ” she said .
As for her dad , he was relieved that “ justice was served . ”

People got to choose between two options : making $ 60,000 a year while their neighbor made $ 80,000 , or making $ 50,000 while their neighbor made the same .
Most people chose the latter .
People ( rightfully ) see this as a sign that people measure economic success relatively rather than absolutely .
But what if they got to live next to , say , their favorite author ?
Would n't a lot of them willingly choose to make even less than $ 50,000 a year to do that ?
Would n't a lot of people love to camp out on his / her lawn instead of living in a house ?
I think what this experiment really shows is that people do n't usually respect their neighbors as being better than themselves , which is natural and not to be discouraged .
But I also think that people generally have somebody they look up to .

Since it ’s such big news , I will report on the latest unemployment report by the BLS , but I dislike spending too much time on it because I consider it one of the weaker or murkier sources of data , at least on a monthly basis .
Often it conflicts heavily with other private or more reliable sources of data , which have been collectively telling a grimmer story than today ’s headline news release of an additional loss of 217,000 jobs for August 2009 .
Regardless , here ’s the news , with my analysis :
Unemployment rate jumps to 26 - year high of 9.7 %
By Rex Nutting WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) – The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to a 26 - year high of 9.7 % in August as nonfarm payrolls fell by 216,000 , the 20th consecutive monthly decline , the Labor Department estimated Friday .
Of course , 9.7 % would be dream rate to teenagers who are now suffering their own quiet depression with a 25 % unemployment rate , and for blacks and Hispanics , who are pulling up an uncomfortable second and third behind the teens .
U.S. payrolls have dropped by 6.9 million to 131.2 million since the recession began in December 2007 , the government data showed .
Unemployment has increased by 7.4 million during the recession to 14.9 million .
As you probably know , unemployment is measured in two ways : the percentage rate is derived from the household data , while the actual number of jobs gained or lost is sampled from ‘ establishments , ’ meaning businesses .
In the paragraph above , we might note that there is now a 500,000 job difference ( 7.4 – 6.9 ) between the number of jobs reported lost by households vs. establishments .
The 216,000 decline in payrolls was close to market expectations of a 233,000 drop , but the unemployment rate rose higher than the 9.5 % level expected .
The unemployment rate was 9.4 % in July .
Payroll losses have moderated in most industries in the past two months .
Payrolls declined an upwardly revised 276,000 in July .
In June and July , payroll losses were revised up by 49,000 .
Oops .
A 9.5 % rate expected , but 9.7 % hit .
That ’s a miss .
Also note the large downward revisions , totaling nearly 50 k jobs for June and July .
Downward revisions are a sign of weakness .
Government Jobs
By way of commentary , we might also note in this report that government jobs are now more numerous than the entire goods - producing sector ( construction + manufacturing combined ) , larger than the retail trade , larger than business & professional , larger than education and health services and even leisure and hospitality .
In shorthand , government jobs are now more numerous than every major subcategory and are only outnumbered by “ Service - providing ” as a super - category .
There are now only 4.8 private sector workers for every government worker :
And this ratio may be even more unfavorable , because the number of private contractors working on government projects , which has grown magnificently over the past decades , is not included in the “ government employee ” category .
Sooner or later , we are going to have to come to grips with this enormous imbalance between the producers and the distributors of wealth .
How have we managed to even support this ratio of government - to - private sector workers ?
Easy .
We ’ve borrowed their salaries from the future :
When you do n’t really have to pay for employees , but can effortlessly borrow their salaries with the aid of your friendly thin - air banker , then it ’s quite easy to add them .
If government debt had been held constant ( taxes would have to have been raised to cover the costs ) , you can bet your bottom dollar that the number of government employees would be a lot lower than it currently is .
As always , I am not making any value judgments about these jobs , only pointing out that I think there is a serious misalignment between how many we can afford and how many we ’d like to be able to afford .
My concern here is that we ’re piling up debts that could ruin the country without having a decent conversation over whether 4.8 to 1 is a sustainable ratio or not .
Perhaps we should have that dialogue .
The Birth - Death Model
Of course , as you should know by now , the 217,000 lost jobs were mitigated by the addition of 118,000 jobs by the “ birth - death ” model .
[ Note :
They can not be simply summed , because the 217k is seasonally adjusted , while the B - D numbers are tossed into the “ not - seasonally - adjusted ” bucket , which is then adjusted … but the direction and magnitude of the impact is clear enough ] .
My intellectual concerns about this model stem from the fact that it is supposed to account for both business births and deaths ( that are largely otherwise invisible to the job counters ) , but the model only ever seems to be able to conclude that business births are outnumbering deaths .
This is not really surprising , since the model is drawing from an insurance database that seriously lags the current realities and therefore covers a period of growth , not contraction .
That an extrapolation from old data continues to show a persistent upside bias is not really all that surprising to me .
What is surprising is that extrapolations from this data set are being used today , apparently without any modifications to correct for what is happening these days .
But back to the data , the birth - death addition of 118,000 jobs is a 28 % increase over the number of modeled jobs added last August .
If anyone can provide evidence that would support the economy being 28 % more supportive to new business creation this year than last year , I would love to see the data .
However , as it stands , the credit and retail environment right now are about as hostile to new businesses as any in decades , and it seems a stretch to imagine that business births continue to outpace business deaths by a healthy margin .
As always , collect multiple views drawn from numerous data sources , and then trust yourself .
As conspiracy theories go , this one 's a doozy .
It seems the Obama Administration is secretly trying to turn your computer into a surveillance tool by inducing you to trade in your old car .
If that does n't sound completely loony to you , then you 're probably a fan of Glenn Beck .
In a five - minute segment broadcast last Friday [ video ] , Beck " uncovers " some frightening language on the Cars.gov " cash for clunkers " site .
The site is set up for people who want to claim a tax rebate when they trade in their old gas guzzlers for a fuel - efficient model , and for dealers to get reimbursed the cost of the rebate by Uncle Sam .
[ Also on InfoWorld : " Uncle Sam 's IT dashboard : Your tax dollars at work " | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
The scary language reads in full :

Or as FoxBabe Kimberly Guilfoyle puts it :
" Guess what , they can continue to track you basically forever .
Once they 've tapped into your system the government of course has malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in any time they want .... it 's so broad they can just about do anything with it , saying that it's in the government 's interest .... "
Of course , this " news " has been bouncing around the conservative blogosphere ever since .
( Kudos to Cringe reader M. A. for bringing it to my attention . )
Omlet
A new and improved design of beehive could be used by city dwellers to harvest up to 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) of their own honey each year , according to Natural England , a British government conservation agency .
The hives could also help stem the decline of bee populations .
Natural England will erect the so - called Beehaus on its roof in Victoria , central London , on Friday .
The agency said the device should make it easy for anyone — from amateurs to seasoned apiarists — to help bees find a home in urban gardens .
“ With the help of urban gardeners , bees can have access to a wonderfully diverse source of plants , resulting in fantastic flavorsome honey , ” said James Tuthill , a co-founder of Omlet , the company that made the Beehaus , in a statement .
The risk of city dwellers receiving bee stings would not be increased by the practice , officials said .
Urban beekeeping is already more than just a hobby for gardening enthusiasts or dedicated apiarists .
Fortnum & Mason , a food emporium in London , and the Palais Garnier , the Paris opera house , both have rooftop hives .
In the United States , hives have been planned for the lawn of the White House .
There also is more to the beekeeping campaign than ensuring plentiful supplies of superior honey .
Since 2003 , there have been reports of serious losses of bees from hives in Europe and the United States .
The European Food Safety Authority says the true extent of the losses is hard to estimate but it reports that in Italy alone up to half of bees may have died in 2007 .
The cause of the die - offs , known as colony collapse disorder , is unknown , although numerous factors could be responsible including starvation , viruses , mites , pesticide exposure and climate change , according to the authority .
Some members of the European Parliament have also blamed overly intensive bee production methods , pesticides and the use of genetically modified crops .
Bees play an important role in the pollination of crops including the large majority of vegetables produced in Europe , so a decline in honeybee populations could have a serious impact on agricultural production .
“ We need to recognise that , if we want plants to flourish , we need healthy populations of insects to sustain them , ” said Tom Tew , the chief scientist for Natural England .
Green Economics and how it might work
Green Economics and how it might work
by Tushara Kodikara
In times of the global economic recession and ecological crisis , it is obvious a radical response is needed .
World - renowned economist Herman Daly maintains the future of human civilisation is dependent on a new economic model , based on a dynamic model — known as the steady state economy — preserving the environment we are all dependent upon .
There needs to be a shift away from the current paradigm of the growth economy towards a system that emphasises conserving natural capital and views the economy as a subset of the environment .
Neoclassical economics has ignored the environment .
The current system views environment and economy as intertwined .
Any environmental problem can be solved by the market or by governmental interference .
Traditional economic theory is based on general equilibrium models : a giant system of thousands of simultaneous equations balancing supply and demand .
These determine the price and quantity of goods and services .
It assumes that there is an infinite resource base and also an infinite waste sink with no feedbacks .
Simply put , resources will never run out and pollution will never occur .
This leads to the notion that infinite growth is possible .
However , a litany of environmental problems , including destruction of the ozone layer , climate change , acid rain , deforestation , overpopulation , loss of biodiversity , soil erosion , desertification , floods , famine , overfishing , hazardous wastes , expanding landfills , fresh water depletion and the depletion of nonrenewable resources , to name a few , are symptoms of the shortcomings of the current economic system .
The planet is approximately in a steady state .
Neither the mass nor the surface is growing or shrinking and the flows of energy inwards and outwards are roughly equal .
Energy and matter enter the economy as inputs , are turned into goods and services , and leave as wastes .
This flow is known as throughput .
Steady state economics draws from the work of Nicholas Georgescu - Roegen ’s The Entropy Law and the Economic Process ( 1971 ) .
This explains how the second law of thermodynamics can be applied to the economy .
In a closed system such as the planet , where the energy balance is around zero , the availability of useful energy decreases .
Production of economic goods transforms matter - energy from a state of low entropy to a state of high entropy .
Entropy is a measure of the disorder within a closed system .
The second law implies that matter can only be recycled a number of times and that energy can be recycled .
However it takes more energy to do the recycling than the amount of energy being produced .
The law also implies that creating order by means of producing goods will create greater disorder elsewhere in the environment .
Therefore the entropy law puts a limit on how much we can produce .
Therefore unlimited growth is impossible .
The planet ’s interdependence has its limits too , and in turn limits growth .
The environment provides vital services such as non-renewable resources which excessive economic growth exhausts .
Forests , for example , can be considered as floating lakes .
They hold topsoil in place , preventing erosion ; help absorb rainwater , thereby preventing flooding ; and they also remove carbon dioxide , produce oxygen and many other important ecological services .
Deforestation removes all of these services .
However , in neoclassical economics , this forest can be turned into books on the topic of the ecological services of trees and people can go to the library and learn about the ecological services trees provide .
This economic theory treats factors of production as substitutes ; natural capital can be replaced by human capital or physical capital .
If there is less of one ( such as labour ) it can be replaced by another ( machinery ) and you can still get the same output .
Before the industrial age , when the economy was small compared to the ecosystem , physical capital was the limiting factor .
Fish in the sea were abundant .
The number and capacity of fishing boats determined the catch size .
Today however , Daly argues , the factors ’ roles have changed — the economy has become very large relative to the ecosystem — making natural capital the limiting factor .
The depleted fish stock in the sea will determine the number of fish that can be taken as opposed to the technologically advanced fishing fleet .
Steady state economics argues that different forms of capital are complementary and cannot be substituted .
They have to be used in fixed proportions .
Adding one cannot make up for having less of another .
The ever - decreasing supply of natural capital cannot be replaced by adding more physical capital ( which is made from natural capital in the first place ) .
The basic premise behind the steady - state economy is to maintain constant stocks of wealth and people at levels that will suffice for a long and good life .
The throughput by which these stocks are maintained should be at a low level and within the regenerative and absorption capacities of the ecosystem .
Greenhouse gas emissions should only occur if the planet is able to absorb these gases back into natural sinks , as opposed to being stored into the Earth ’s atmosphere .
The system is therefore sustainable and can continue indefinitely .
The goal of progress in a steady - state economy is not to get bigger but to get better .
Rather than increase monetary wealth for a few , it increases the well - being of the many .
The idea of optimal scale is an important concept in steady - state economics .
As we increase the production of any good , we also increase the costs and the benefits .
Economics teaches that the firm ’s optimal scale of operations is that at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost — the addition to the firm ’s revenue from the last unit of output produced and sold equals the addition to cost .
If the firm grows beyond the optimum , then the costs will go up by more than the benefits .
Consequently , growth will make the firm poorer rather than richer .
Analogously , the economy ’s optimal scale is the output level at which the marginal gain from growth ( additional utility from increasing the man- made capital stock ) equals the marginal cost of growth ( lost services from natural capital , pollution , resource depletion , environmental degradation , and so on ) .
Beyond this point , growth generates more costs than benefits .
Unfortunately , Daly believes , the world economy has already exceeded optimal size .
It is now so large that it is overloading the ecosystem ’s ability to serve as a source and a sink .
Opponents of the steady - state economy with no previous record of concern for the poor attack steady - state advocates as foolish , who are already rich and just want to prevent the poor from becoming wealthy .
However , many proponents of the steady - state economy accept and declare the necessity of limits to inequality in the distribution of wealth .
In reality , many people who have advocated for less inequality in the distribution of wealth on ethical and political grounds are also advocated for environmental protection .
It is often those who are proponents of economic growth who avoid the distribution issue and spout on about the fallacy of the trickledown effect .
Until recently , the world economy had been growing , and yet we still have extreme poverty .
It should be obvious that what actually grows is the reinvested surplus , such as profits and the benefits of growth go to the owners of the surplus , who are not the poor .
Another argument of those who oppose the steady - state economy and think that the current system is the answer is that of technology being able to solve our problems .
We should n’t worry about peak oil , as electric cars will become cheap and viable for everybody .
However , there are a couple of issues here .
There is a limited amount of platinum available in the world .
This is an important component for the vehicle ’s battery .
There is not enough platinum to produce enough cars to replace the current petroleum - based vehicle fleet on the planet .
This blind faith that technology will solve all our problems is just that , blind faith .
These solutions will be far more expensive than the preventive measures available .
These solutions may in fact cause more problems rather than solving the current environment problems .
The most important point is that petroleum is n’t just used for fossil fuels .
It is also an important chemical feedstock used in just about every produced good .
It is literally the lubricant for the world ’s economy .
Under the current economic system , a substitute should be able to replace this vital feedstock .
However , this substitute is not forthcoming .
If the prediction by the International Energy Agency is true , then peak oil is expected to occur around 2030 .
Many predict that it will happen much sooner .
When this happens , the current economic system will not be able to handle this oil shock .
This current recession will be nothing compared to what will happen to the global economy when this happens .
There will be a plethora of environmental problems that will plague the planet in the coming decades .
The current economic model can be found to be the root cause of these problems .
It would be therefore foolish to think that this model will then be able to solve them .
Therefore it is time to replace it with a model that values the environment and society over the importance of the economy .
As Albert Einstein once said :
“ The world will not evolve past its current state of crisis by using the same thinking that created the situation . ”

Official description
Royal Flora Ratchaphruek is one of the grand celebrations being hosted by the Royal Thai Government to celebrate the auspicious occasion of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of HM the King 's accession to the throne in 2006 and HM's 80th birthday in 2007 .
David Chisnall casts a critical eye over the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and asks whether it 's done more harm than good for the Free Software movement .

In 1985 , the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) was formed to promote software freedom , as defined by these four freedoms :
The freedom to run the program , for any purpose .
The freedom to study how the program works , and adapt it to your needs .
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor .
The freedom to improve the program , and release your improvements ( and modified versions in general ) to the public , so that the whole community benefits .
One of the tools used to achieve this goal is the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
Looking back , has the GPL been a help , or a hindrance ?
And will it continue to be a help or hindrance in the future ?
A GPL Success Story
The FSF website points out a specific instance of the GPL forcing a company to open its source .
The company in this example was NeXT ( now Apple ) , and the source code was the Objective - C front end for the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) .
But what really happened ?
When NeXT purchased the rights to Objective - C , it inherited two pieces of technology .
One was a preprocessor a fairly simple program that turned Objective - C into pure C .
The other was a runtime library that handled all of the dynamic lookups , module loading , and other bits required for a complete Objective - C environment .
The preprocessor approach had some limitations , not least of which was difficulty in debugging , so NeXT decided to move the preprocessor into the compiler .
The C compiler in use at the time was GCC , which was released under the GPL .
To avoid the restrictions of this code , NeXT provided its front end as a library that end users would link against GCC , thereby avoiding the GPL ( which only applies to distribution of the software , not how you use it ) .
This little legal maneuver did n't work , however , so NeXT was forced to release the code .
NOTE
Actually , this trick might have worked if NeXT could show that its front end was not a derived work of GCC ( difficult , because it was a derived work ) , or if NeXT was n't distributing GCC ( which it was ) .
Remember that an Objective - C implementation is in two parts : the compiler and the runtime library .
NeXT was only required to release its compiler code , not its runtime library .
As someone who has worked on an Objective - C compiler and two Objective - C runtime libraries , I can say with some certainty that NeXT did n't get the better end of this deal : For Objective - C dialects of that era , the runtime library is much more complex than the compiler .
Rather than admit that it had a worthless bit of code , the GNU Project wrote its own Objective - C runtime and this is where things really started getting interesting .
The GNU runtime was n't quite a drop - in replacement for the NeXT runtime , so GNU needed to modify the compiler to support the new runtime .
The modification involved a lot of #ifdef statements in the Objective - C support file .
Of course , NeXT had no interest in supporting the GNU runtime , and therefore did n't bother to import these changes .
Periodically , NeXT would release a new version of its fork of GCC , and the mainline developers would try to backport their changes to the main branch .
When Apple took over NeXT , the Apple developers continued to work on GCC , adding improvements such as better SIMD support to take advantage of the AltiVec units on the PowerPC chips that Apple was shipping .
The developers also kept adding features to Objective - C. Because the Apple branch only had to support a single runtime library , there was no clear abstraction between the runtime - specific and runtime - agnostic bits , and so the GNU branch quickly fell behind .
The story does n't quite end there , however .
More recently , Apple wanted to integrate the compiler more closely with its IDE .
One of the nice things about Visual Studio is that it uses the same parser and semantic analyzer for syntax highlighting and error reporting as it does for code generation , allowing for much better feedback than you get from editors that completely separate the two .
Unfortunately for Apple , the GPL required either making XCode open source or rewriting GCC .
Apple opted for the latter choice .
Fortunately , Apple did n't have to start from scratch , but instead was able to hire the lead developer of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project , a BSD - licensed compiler infrastructure , and set him to work .
The result was the creation of a new project , clang , to produce a new front end for LLVM that supported C , Objective - C , and C ++.
This front end currently supports the GNU runtime and the two Apple runtimes , and supports several features such as fast enumeration and partial support for declared properties that GCC does n't , even when using the GNU runtime .
clang is n't the only Objective - C front end for LLVM , though ; there 's also one based on GCC .
Unfortunately for people using non-Apple platforms , it 's based on Apple 's branch of GCC , and therefore only supports Objective - C on Darwin .
This front end is covered by the GPL , whereas the one that has better support for the GNU runtime is covered by a BSD - style license .
What do we learn from this story ?
First , we learn that you do n't necessarily get good results from forcing people to do things .
The NeXT Objective - C code was contributed to GCC reluctantly , and was never well maintained .
The Apple code contributed to clang , in contrast , was written with a clean abstraction layer and allows new runtime libraries to be supported easily .
This was n't required by Apple , which started the project and therefore could do anything with it as desired .
Because Apple willingly engaged the community , however , the end result is better for everyone .
The second thing to remember is that sometimes having someone else 's code is n't actually a good thing .
The Objective - C code in GCC is an unreadable , horrible mess .
Objective - C is a small language , and the GCC team could probably have put together its own front end in a couple of weeks at most .
If the team had done this , they probably would have designed it to support multiple runtime libraries from the start , and ended up with something a lot more maintainable at the end .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A complete ban on alcohol advertising should be imposed and a minimum drinks price set to help deter excessive drinking in Britain , medics said on Tuesday .

The British Medical Association ( BMA ) said curtailment of the industry ’s 800 million pound ( $ 1.3 billion ) annual promotional budget should also cover sponsorship of sports and arts events .
It called for alcoholic drinks to be taxed higher than the rate of inflation , and for licensing hours to be cut .
Alcohol consumption has increased rapidly during the past 20 years , causing social problems and increased health care costs , showing self - regulation had failed , the BMA said in its report “ Under the Influence . ”
It said it was time the government imposed measures to deter heavy drinking , similar those introduced against smoking in enclosed public places .
“ We have a perverse situation where the alcohol industry is advising our governments about alcohol reduction policies , ” said Dr Vivienne Nathanson , head of BMA science and ethics .
“ As with tobacco , putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop -- or at least putting him on a par with the farmer -- is a dangerous idea , ” she said .
The BMA said it supported the principle of a minimum price for alcohol , but did not want to put forward a suggested figure .
Instead , it pointed to Scotland which is contemplating a minimum price of 40 pence per unit of alcohol .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown in March rejected a recommendation of 50 pence per unit of alcohol from chief medical officer Liam Donaldson , saying he did not want to punish the majority for the actions of the few .
But the BMA said Britain had developed an “ excessively pro-alcohol social norm , ” of which young people ’s binge - drinking was a predictable manifestation , boosted by cheap prices and targeted sweetened drinks .
Between 1992 and 2006 , household expenditure on alcoholic drinks increased by 81 percent , and the BMA said there was a clear relationship between the price and consumption of alcohol .
The medics rejected selective targeting of young people because it was likely to make alcohol more attractive .
David Poley , chief executive of the Portman Group , which represents drinks manufacturers , said : “ The BMA is ignoring all the evidence that advertising causes brand switching , not harmful drinking . ”
The British Beer and Pub Association ( BBPA ) said alcohol consumption had fallen 6 percent on 2004 .
In fact , I look forward to the day I can return to see it in the wild , although this time from the safety of a Land Rover .
For that is the lesson I will take from this : too often on safari , tourists dismiss rangers ’ warnings and get out of vehicles for a closer look .
“ They assume it ’s safe because the ranger has a gun nearby , ” said Arrie .
“ But they ’re wrong .
The speed and power of the lion is quite phenomenal – they would n’t stand a chance . ”

Bride who can't stop laughing as her groom ' waffles ' his vows becomes YouTube star
It was the moment Andrew Engstrom had been waiting for all his life - exchanging marital vows with his blushing wife Melissa .
But he probably did not envision a scenario where his bride was laughing so hard while at the altar that she could not speak .
When he fluffed his vows - stumbling over the word ' lawfully ' to sputter ' waffle -y ' - his bride ( who clearly has a sense of humour ) could not contain herself .
Scroll down to see video :
[ caption ]
Her hysterical reaction has since become a YouTube hit .
Video shows church guests sitting silently on pews , as the pastor instructs Andrew to ' place the ring on Melissa 's hand and repeat after me ' .
' I , Andrew Paul Daniel Engstrom , " bellows the pastor , as expectant friends and family are hushed to a respectful silence .
However , there is an impending feeling that things are about to go horribly wrong .
' I put it on the wrong way , ' says Andrew , shaking his head and referring to his wife 's ring .
He composes himself and clasps his wife 's hands in his .
The couple stare lovingly in each other 's eyes - but they both start to laugh .
Andrew repeats : ' I Andrew Paul Daniel Engstrom ... Do take Melissa Rene Warren . "
[ caption ]
But the serious ceremony turns into a farce when the pastor asks Andrew to repeat ' to be my lawfully wedded wife ' .
Andrew , who clearly has the jitters , falters and he utters the word ' waffle -y ' instead of ' lawfully ' .
The hilarious gaffe sends his wife - to - be Melissa into a sporadic fit of laughter as the stern - faced pastor presiding over the ceremony looks on bemused .
Luckily , Andrew sees the funny side of his blunder and adds : ' pancake -y ' , which turns Melissa 's knees to jelly .
The bungling bride bursts into a second laughing stupor , which is matched by gales of laughter from the audience .
[ caption ]
By this point , Melissa is struggling to stay on her feet and Andrew has to clutch her two hands to keep her upright as she arches her head back and roars with laughter .
The cackling bride turns to the audience and takes her right hand to her mouth , gesturing as if to eat a pancake .
Goatee - bearded Andrew , still holding on to Melissa , looks at the pastor and admits : ' I 've been scared of this all my life . '
Melissa roars with laughter again as the pastor , as ever the professional , turns to his colleague , gives a wry smile , and says : ' What can they do ? '
But Melissa still cannot compose herself and she cackles : ' My waffle -y wedded wife , ' as Andrew steadies her .
The pastor addresses the audience , joking : ' It 's OK folks , I 've seen this before . '
The camera cuts to the guests , showing a middle - aged blonde woman , who is crumpled over also laughing hysterically .
[ caption ]
Melissa , feeling a bit hot under the collar , starts wafting her face and the couple try to repeat their vows again .
But by this time they both have the giggles .
' I , Andrew Paul Daniel ... ' says the pastor , who is interrupted by the couple having a laughing fit .
The pastor then jokes : ' The court will take a recess . '
The venue for the couple , who appear to be married , is not known , but believed to be somewhere in the U.S .
Video :
The video , called ' Bride can't stop laughing during vows ' was only posted on video - sharing internet site YouTube on September 2 , suggesting the couple have not been married very long .
The clip ends touchingly with a banner saying : ' And thus began a joyful marriage ...'
It has since become a YouTube sensation , scoring more than 25,000 hits .
Bloggers who have viewed the clip , which lasts 2:24 minutes , have posted comments showing their appreciation for the laugh - out - loud moment .
One Blogger - labdarugo - says : ' Cute !
I was laughing with them . '
Another blogger , called Imdbbookaholic , adds : ' That 's one﻿ way to get over the wedding - day nerves ! '
The clip was posted two months after a video showing a second couple creased up with laughter as they took their wedding vows .
The unnamed American groom is in hysterics after his best man 's trousers fall down as he presents the ring .

The story line that dominated media coverage of the second Iranian uranium enrichment facility last week was the official assertion that U.S. intelligence had caught Iran trying to conceal a " secret " nuclear facility .
But an analysis of the transcript of that briefing by senior administration officials that was the sole basis for the news stories and other evidence reveals damaging admissions , conflicts with the facts , and unanswered questions that undermine its credibility .
Iran ’s notification to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the second enrichment facility in a letter on Sept. 21 was buried deep in most of the news stories and explained as a response to being detected by U.S. intelligence .
In reporting the story in that way , journalists were relying entirely on the testimony of " senior administration officials " who briefed them at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh Friday .
U.S. intelligence had " learned that the Iranians learned that the secrecy of the facility was compromised , " one of the officials said , according to the White House transcript .
The Iranians had informed the IAEA , he asserted , because " they came to believe that the value of the facility as a secret facility was no longer valid . "
Later in the briefing , however , the official said " we believe , " rather than " we learned , " in referring to that claim , indicating that it is only an inference rather than being based on hard intelligence .
The official refused to explain how U.S. analysts had arrived at that conclusion , but an analysis by the defense intelligence consulting firm IHS Jane ’s of a satellite photo of the site taken Saturday said there is a surface - to - air missile system located at the site .
Since surface - to - air missiles protect many Iranian military sites , however , their presence at the Qom site does n’t necessarily mean that Iran believed that Washington had just discovered the enrichment plant .
The official said the administration had organized an intelligence briefing on the facility for the IAEA during the summer on the assumption that the Iranians might " choose to disclose the facility themselves . "
But he offered no explanation for the fact that there had been no briefing given to the IAEA or anyone else until Sept. 24  three days after the Iranians disclosed the existence of the facility .
A major question surrounding the official story is why the Barack Obama administration had not done anything  and apparently had no plans to do anything – with its intelligence on the Iranian facility at Qom prior to the Iranian letter to the IAEA .
When asked whether the administration had intended to keep the information in its intelligence briefing secret even after the meeting with the Iranians on Oct.
1 , the senior official answered obliquely but revealingly , " I think it ’s impossible to turn back the clock and say what might have been otherwise . "
In effect , the answer was no , there had been no plan for briefing the IAEA or anyone .
News media played up the statement by the senior administration official that U.S. intelligence had been " aware of this facility for years . "
But what was not reported was that he meant only that the U.S. was aware of a possible nuclear site , not one whose function was known .
The official in question acknowledged the analysts had not been able to identify it as an enrichment facility for a long time .
In the " very early stage of construction , " said the official , " a facility like this could have multiple uses . "
Intelligence analysts had to " wait until the facility had reached the stage of construction where it was undeniably intended for use as a centrifuge facility , " he explained .
The fact that the administration had made no move to brief the IAEA or other governments on the site before Iran revealed its existence suggests that site had not yet reached that stage where the evidence was unambiguous .
A former U.S. official who has seen the summary of the administration ’s intelligence used to brief foreign governments told IPS he doubts the intelligence community had hard evidence that the Qom site was an enrichment plant .
" I think they did n’t have the goods on them , " he said .
Also misleading was the official briefing ’s characterization of the intelligence assessment on the purpose of the enrichment plant .
The briefing concluded that the Qom facility must be for production of weapons - grade enriched uranium , because it will accommodate only 3,000 centrifuges , which would be too few to provide fuel for a nuclear power plant .
According to the former U.S. official who has read the briefing paper on the intelligence assessment , however , the paper says explicitly that the Qom facility is " a possible military facility . "
That language indicates that intelligence analysts have suggested that the facility may be for making low - enriched rather than for high - enriched , bomb - grade uranium .
It also implies that the senior administration official briefing the press was deliberately portraying the new enrichment facility in more menacing terms than the actual intelligence assessment .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s offer the day after the denunciation of the site by U.S. , British , and French leaders to allow IAEA monitoring of the plant will make it far more difficult to argue that it was meant to serve military purposes .
The circumstantial evidence suggests that Iran never intended to keep the Qom facility secret from the IAEA but was waiting to make it public at a moment that served its political - diplomatic objectives .
The Iranian government is well aware of U.S. capabilities for monitoring from satellite photographs any site in Iran that exhibits certain characteristics .
Iran obviously wanted to make the existence of the Qom site public before construction on the site would clearly indicate an enrichment purpose .
But it gave the IAEA no details in its initial announcement , evidently hoping to find out whether and how much the United States already knew about it .
The specific timing of the Iranian letter , however , appears to be related to the upcoming talks between Iran and the P5+1  China , France , Britain , Russia , the United States , and Germany  and an emerging Iranian strategy of smaller back - up nuclear facilities that would assure continuity if Natanz were attacked .
The Iranian announcement of that decision on Sept. 14 coincided with a statement by the head of Iran ’s atomic energy organization , Ali Akbar Salehi , warning against preemptive strikes against the country ’s nuclear facilities .
The day after the United States , Britain , and France denounced the Qom facility as part of a deception , Salehi said , " Considering the threats , our organization decided to do what is necessary to preserve and continue our nuclear activities .
So we decided to build new installations which will guarantee the continuation of our nuclear activities which will never stop at any cost . "
As satellite photos of the site show , the enrichment facility at Qom is being built into the side of a mountain , making it less vulnerable to destruction , even with the latest bunker - busting U.S. bombs .
The pro-administration newspaper Kayhan quoted an " informed official " as saying that Iran had told the IAEA in 2004 that it had to do something about the threat of attack on its nuclear facilities " repeatedly posed by the Western countries . "
The government newspaper called the existence of the second uranium enrichment plan " a winning card " that would increase Iran ’s bargaining power in the talks .
That presumably referred to neutralizing the ultimate coercive threat against Iran by the United States .

VENICE ( Fortune ) --
If anyone has profited from the free - enterprise system in the past 20 years , it 's Michael Moore .
Since 1989 , when his " Roger & Me " pioneered the docu-comedy form of nonfiction film , Moore 's movies , TV shows and best - selling books have given him an eight - figure net worth .
And in all of these , he is the improbable star : a heavyset fellow with a doofus grin , alternately laughing and badgering but always at the center of his own attention .
Why , there he is , at the end of his new movie , " Capitalism : A Love Story , " wrapping the New York Stock Exchange building in yellow tape that reads : CRIME SCENE .
The writer - director - propagandist has earned every penny and Euro of his boodle .
Moore 's last three filmed diatribes -- " Bowling for Columbine , " " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and " Sicko " --h ave amassed more than $ 300 million in theaters worldwide , and loads more on DVD ; and " Fahrenheit " is , by a long stretch , the top - grossing documentary of all time .
Now , there 's no reason a popular entertainer , even one whose subjects are the gun lobby , the march to war in Iraq and the health - care industry , should live like a monk .
It 's just a little ironic that the man who made his career attacking corporate America should be a pretty big business himself .
Moore is doing well abroad ; his last three films have made nearly half their total income in foreign countries .
So it 's fitting " Capitalism : A Love Story " had its world premiere Sunday at the Venice Film Festival .
This follows the Cannes debuts , with headline - making , mostly rapturous receptions , of " Columbine , " " Fahrenheit " and " Sicko . "
Why does has working - class guy from Flint , Mich . , won the hearts of Europeans ?
Perhaps because his movies indulge the continental view of America : that we 're gun-crazy , we invade countries that have n't attacked us and we think medical coverage is a profit - making scam , not a citizen 's basic right .
Europe is a peaceful civilization that knows its place and cares for its people .
We 're armed , dangerous and stupid .
That 's not quite Moore 's view .
He has a dewy respect for the underclass ; each of his films has testimony from working men and women who burst into tears or soar into rage describing injustices done them .
To Moore , it 's the bureaucratic - industrial complex -- the combined might of the West Wing , Wall street and Wal - Mart -- that 's evil .
That view was never clearer than in his broadly entertaining , ceaselessly provocative , wildly ambitious new film .
Not satisfied with outlining and condemning the housing and banking crises of the past year , it expands the story of the financial collapse into an epic of malfeasance : capital crimes on a national scale .
Home are foreclosed on people who could meet their old mortgage payments but not the new , ballooned ones .
( One family does get $ 1,000 for cleaning out the house they 've just been evicted from . )
Corporations take out policies on their workers , then pocket tax - free " dead peasants " insurance by the carload while the victims ' families get nothing .
Two judges in Pennsylvania close down a state detention center , then sentence children to long terms in a private facility that kicks back millions to the judges .
By now , a Michael Moore film is its own genre : a vigorous vaudeville of working - class sob stories , snippets of right - wing power players saying ugly things , longer interviews with experts on the Left , funny old film clips and , at the climax , Moore engaging in some form of populist grandstanding .
This time , he goes to the headquarters of the former AIG , a multibillion - dollar recipient of government largesse , and attempts to make a citizen 's arrest of its chief executives .
He also asks Wall Streeters for advice on healing the nation .
One man 's quick reply : " Do n't make any more movies . "
" Capitalism " has lots of statistics , like the Rasmussen poll that showed only a slight majority of young adults prefer capitalism to socialism .
But this is a lecture from a charismatic comedian of a professor ; he makes his points with gag movie references and quick visual puns .
In " Capitalism , " when the narrator of a 1950s instructional film about ancient Rome 's use of gladiatorial games " to keep the idle citizens entertained , " he tosses in a shot from American Idol .
( Idle , Idol . )
Running a clip from the 1977 " Jesus of Nazareth , " Moore puts new words in the Messiah 's mouth so that Jesus now tells a supplicant , " I am sorry , I cannot heal your preexisting condition . "
Look , if you want fair and balanced , go to Fox News .
But Moore does give a little time to those on the other side .
As a carpenter hammers pasteboard over the facade of a foreclosed home , he observes , " If people pay their bills , they do n't get thrown out . "
Wall Street Journal editorial board member Stephen Moore gets about a minute to explain why capitalism is great and democracy is n't .
Sometimes Moore lavishes attention on adversaries just because they 're so much fun .
Peter Zalewski , founder of Condo Vultures , which buys up defaulted homes on the quick and cheap , tells the filmmaker , " What 's the difference between me and a real vulture ?
I say that 's simple : I do n't vomit on myself . "
Toward the end , Moore shows the jubilation in Chicago 's Grant Park the night Barack Obama was voted President .
Two days before that election , Moore said of Obama , " The Republicans are n't kidding when they say he's the ' most liberal ' member of the Senate .
...
He is our best possible chance to step back from the edge of the cliff . "
Since Jan. 20 , a part of the right may be calling Obama a Communist , but not many liberals are calling him liberal .
The movie seems to be setting up the disappointment many on the Left have felt over the awarding of more billions to giant banks and corporations , among other things , since Jan. 20 .
And Moore does note that Goldman Sachs gave more than $ 1 million to Obama 's campaign .
But he does n't go after this Democratic President as he surely would have if John McCain had been elected .
Instead , he argues for participatory democracy : do - it - yourself do - gooding , through community activism and union organizing .
That 's an optimistic and evasive answer to the financial problem .
Surely what spun out of control because of government indulgence and indolence needs to be repaired by government regulation and ingenuity .
Squatting in your repossessed home wo n't get the trillions back .
In " Capitalism : A Love Story , " Moore has cogently and passionately diagnosed the disease .
But for a cure , instead of emergency surgery , he prescribes Happy Meals .

" I think people get a lot of their information from so - called experts but if a horse is sick , you do n't ask a fish what 's wrong with the horse .
You go right to the horse 's mouth . "
Watch Carly 's story on " 20/20 " Friday at 10 p.m. ET
Her words may never have been found if not for the relentless determination of her family , who never gave up on her .
Carly 's story is how one child found her way out of the dense forest that is autism , and how her experience may unlock the mysteries of this baffling disorder .
Diagnosed with Autism , Carly Lost in Own World
Born in Toronto , Carly was 2 years old when it became clear she was n't keeping up with her twin sister , Taryn .
When her parents , Arthur and Tammy Fleischmann , learned the diagnosis was autism they expected the worst -- that one of their twins would never achieve milestones most take for granted .
" When you 're told your child is going to be developmentally delayed , that they might achieve the developmental level of a 6 - year - old , it 's like being kicked in the gut , " Carly 's father recalls .
" And so for us , we have expectations of one child who 's going to grow up and be independent and accomplish things that she wants in life , and one child , a big mystery , what 's going to become of her . "
In the beginning , Carly 's delays prevented her from walking and sitting up , but as she grew , it became painfully clear that Carly could n't speak .
Like most autistic children , she was lost in her own world , perpetually swimming under water .
Experts told the Fleischmanns that early intervention was critical , and since Carly was 3 , her therapy has been intensive and unrelenting , sometimes working with three to four different therapists daily for up to 60 hours each week .
Her team , nicknamed Carly Inc. , would constantly change therapies that were n't working and streamline the ones that did .
Carly made small gains , but nothing that ever seemed like real progress .
" When you look in Carly 's eyes , you can see an innate intelligence .
So we never gave up , " her father recalls .
But if there was intelligence , Carly 's ceaseless rocking , flailing arms and tantrums hid any trace of it .
Worse , she could n't speak , not one word .
Intensive Therapy Attempts to Find Way for Carly to Communicate
For many years , Nicole Walton - Allen , a clinical psychologist , led Carly 's therapy program .
" Her profile was that of a child who was severely autistic and more than likely moderate mentally retarded , " Walton - Allen told " 20/20 . "
" I did not have any expectation that she would have a fluent form of communication .
She was getting up and running around .
Her hands were constantly in motion , flapping .
She was drooling . "
Raising a child like Carly in a house with two other children was n't easy .
Both parents were trying to make a living and keep the house going .
Many nights
Carly only slept four hours and , unable to control herself , still displayed disruptive behaviors .
The family felt lost .
Friends had suggested that they place Carly in a group home or institution , an idea her parents rejected .
" A 7 - year - old in a group home , it 's horrifying .
The thought of that is horrifying , giving up your child .
I could never do it .
Never do it .
How can you give up your kid ?
No , no .
You just keep persevering , you know , " an emotional father explained .
Most frustrating was Carly 's inability to speak .
Her therapists desperately needed to find some way for Carly to communicate her thoughts .
Thousands of hours over months and years passed , and Carly 's progress was excruciatingly slow .
Breakthrough : Carly Emerges from Silent , Secret World
Therapists introduced picture symbols that would allow her to communicate her needs .
For example , if Carly wanted chips , she would point to the picture of chips .
But then one day , three years ago , when Carly was 11 , she was working with two of her therapists when she started to feel sick .
Unable to communicate what she needed , she ran to a computer and began to type for the first time .
First she typed the word " H - U - R - T " and then " H - E - L - P " and then she threw up .
Her therapists were shocked :
They had never specifically taught her those words , and they wondered where she had learned them .
Carly 's typing showed them that there was a lot more going on inside her head than they had thought .
For the first time she was able to communicate independently .
After nine years of intensive therapy , and not much to show for it , Carly was finally emerging out of her silent , secret world .
When first told of Carly 's breakthrough , the family did n't believe it .
They had every right to be skeptical .
Carly refused to repeat the exercise for her parents and her other therapists .
Because nobody apart from two people had ever seen it , the skeptics were desperate to see proof .
Going forward , the plan was to use tough love to get Carly to type .
If she wanted something , she had to type for it .
And it worked .
Several months later , Carly started to type , and what came through her finger , typing one letter at a time , with fluency that no one could believe , was simply remarkable .
Carly : " I am autistic but that is not who I am .
Take time to know me , before you judge me .
I am cute , funny and like to have fun . "
Typing Unlocks Mystery Behind Her Behavior : ' I Want Something that Will Put Out the Fire '
Through her torrent of words , Carly began to unravel some of the mysteries behind her often wild behavior , like banging her head .
Carly : " Because if I do n't it feels like my body is going to explode .
It 's just like when you shake a can of coke .
If I could stop it I would but it is not like turning a switch off , it does not work that way .
I know what is right and wrong but it 's like I have a fight with my brain over it . "
Carly started to realize that by communicating she had power over her environment , and she was n't shy about expressing her desires and frustrations .
Carly : " I want to be able to go to school with normal kids but not have them getting upset or scarred if I hit a table or scream .
I want to be able to read a book by myself without having to tell myself to sit still .
I want something that will put out the fire . "
For the first time , Carly was able to have conversations with her parents , even instant - messaging her father at his office .
Her family stopped looking at her as a disabled person and instead met the funny , sassy , intelligent girl that had been trapped inside .
They also said they were " horrified " that for most of her life they spoke in front of her as if she was n't there .
Carly : " I want people to know that no one is telling me what to say and I do n't have a hand up my butt like a puppet . "
Despite Progress , Constant Care Still Needed
For all her progress communicating , Carly still needs constant supervision .
A family member or aide is always at her side , directing her through simple daily tasks like brushing her teeth , fixing her hair , even eating .
Nothing is easy .
But like most teens , Carly likes music , boys , clothing and of course going to the mall .
Carly has been very clear that she sees herself as a normal child locked in a body that she has little to no control over .
So in public , everything has to be broken down and planned to control her impulses .
In the past she has wandered off , even stolen goods .

Side by side with her twin sister , Taryn , it would be easy to dismiss Carly as intellectually challenged .
That is , until you ask her a question .
For instance ,
Why do autistic kids cover their ears , flap their hands , hum and rock ?
Carly : " It 's a way for us to drown out all sensory input that over loads us all at once .
We create output to block out input . "
Carly 's brain , unlike most of ours , is overwhelmed by the senses of sight , sound , taste , smell and touch .
She calls it audio filtering .
Carly : " Our brains are wired differently .
We take in many sounds and conversations at once .
I take over a thousand pictures of a person 's face when I look at them .
That 's why we have a hard time looking at people .
I have learnt how to filter through some of the mess . "
To help keep Carly calm -- and keep her impulses in check -- she listens to music , swims and even does yoga , which has helped with her breathing and posture .
Carly 's family and therapists emphasize that no one is physically directing her to type , as some skeptics , they claim , have suggested .
" This is n't some spontaneous event , " Carly 's mother , Tammy , insists .
" This is entirely Carly .
No one is touching Carly 's fingers , no one is moving anything , no one is prompting her or telepathically insinuating what she should type . "
Dr. Nicole Walton - Allen , an early skeptic , concedes : " In retrospect , it is quite clear that Carly obviously had skills that we were not aware of and she needed a vehicle to express herself . "
Sense of Humor , Awareness Baffle Doctors
One of the things that makes Carly so unique is her tremendous sense of humor .
For instance , this exchange with her therapist :
Barb : " How cute are you ? "
Carly : " I 'm so cute blind people stop and stare . "
Her brother Matthew is also a favorite target .
Carly : " Matthew smells so bad skunks run and hide . "
Besides her obvious spunk and tenacity , Carly is empathetic and recognizes the love and sacrifice her family has made for her , something she conveyed to her father on his birthday .
Carly : " Dear Dad , I love when you read to me .
And I love that you believe in me .
I know I am not the easiest kid in the world .
However you are always there for me holding my hand and picking me up .
I love you . "
" I 'll go through many sleepless nights to hear that .
I 'll spend every penny we have to hear that , " Fleischmann says .
He also notes that Carly 's breakthrough was the result of thousands of dollars spent on years of intensive therapy .
It 's the kind of money most families unfortunately could never afford to spend on their autistic children .
A year after we first met Carly , she is happier , calmer and more independent .
She also has her own internet blog and twitters regularly , answering questions from people all over North America about her experience with autism .
And Carly continues to mesmerize people by trying her hand -- that is , her finger -- at writing a novel called " The Elephant Princess . "
But experts we spoke to said Carly 's abilities are extremely rare and that her case should not raise false hope .
The Fleischmanns know that Carly is not out of the woods .
She will likely require considerable support for the rest of her life .
But Carly knows that she now has a voice that can help other kids .
She looks at herself as someone who can make a mark on the world .
Carly : " I think the only thing I can say is do n't give up .
Your inner voice will find its way out .
Mine did . "
For more information on Carly , you can visit her blog , or follow her on Twitter .
Selection from Carly 's Forthcoming Novel " The Elephant Princess " :
" I want you to close your eyes and imagine a girl all alone in the middle of the jungle .
All she can hear are the sounds of the animals .
But what she does not know is that the sounds are n't just random sounds .
In fact , the animals are talking to each other .
People think that a lion 's roar is its way to scare you .
But let me tell you from experience that a roar is not just a roar .
Actually a roar can mean many things depending on the tone .
I think that humankind is just oblivious to things that have been around for many years .
I think humans are so silly .
See us animals are much smarter because we understand what is going on around us .
But that 's another story for another day . "
Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the Fox talkers have been busy proclaiming their utter innocence in the assassination of Dr. George Tiller -- as well as the innocence of the anti-abortion groups that were harassing Tiller prior to his death .
They 've been adamant that only Scott Roeder , the assassin , bears any actual culpability .
Which may be why one of their former guests , Jill Stanek , has been busy playing the anti-abortion version of Radio Rwanda by posting pictures and addresses of the nation 's only two remaining late - term abortion providers .
Emily Douglas of RH Reality Check ( via Jill at Feministe ) has the details :
[ S ] ome anti-choice activists -- even now -- seem only too happy to aid and abet the crazy ones who will resort to violence .
Or else why , three days after the assassination of a medical doctor who provides late - term abortions , did Jill Stanek post on her blog photographs of the clinic of Dr. LeRoy Carhart , another physician who provides late - term abortions and who has said he is willing to take over providing services at Dr. Tiller 's clinic ?
By way of introduction , Stanek writes , " Let 's take a station break to view photos of Carhart 's " nondescript building , " taken in March 2009 on the day it reopened following refurbishment after a fire ( NOT blamed on pro-lifers ) .
It was almost immediately shut down because Carhart reopened without getting an occupancy permit , as I previously reported , and was running his electricity off a generator ... "
She and her readers just want " to take a look . "
Why ?
She wants to prove her point that it 's a dingy building ?
Over Carhart 's safety , and the safety of his staff and patients ?
This is a woman that both Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity have featured on their Fox News programs as an ostensibly credible witness .
Ellen at Newshounds pointed out last year after the Hannity appearance just how dubious a witness Stanek actually is .
Appropriately , The General has written to Stanek 's pastor , suggesting a rifle - blessing ceremony .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama 's accusations that Iran 's nuclear program runs afoul of international agreements are " baseless , " the Islamic republic 's president told CNN's Larry King on Friday .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says President Obama 's accusations are " baseless . "
" We did not expect Mr. Obama within less than 48 hours , to basically violate the commitment that he spoke of at the United Nations , " said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The Iranian leader was referring to Obama 's Wednesday speech to the U.N. General Assembly , where Obama called for international unity in attacking the world 's challenges .
Asked if he was expressing disappointment in the U.S. president , Ahmadinejad responded , " We simply did n't expect him to say something that was ... was baseless . "
Earlier Friday evening Obama said " Iran is on notice " regarding its nuclear efforts , and that the international community is united in its opposition to Tehran 's nuclear program .
" They are going to have to make a choice :
Are they willing to go down the path to greater prosperity and security for Iran , giving up the acquisition of nuclear weapons ... or will they continue down a path that is going to lead to confrontation , " he said at a news conference at the G - 20 meeting in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Obama 's comments came hours after Iran acknowledged the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility and ahead of next week 's planned meeting between Iran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members , plus Germany .
The October 1 meeting will take place in Geneva , Switzerland .
Obama said he would not speculate on any course of action absent a satisfactory response from Iran .
" Even countries who a year ago or six months ago might have been reluctant to even discuss things like sanctions , " are starting to become concerned , Obama said .
Obama said his " preferred course of action is to resolve this in a diplomatic fashion .
It 's up to the Iranians to respond . "
The U.S. president said the conclusions about Iran 's nuclear ambitions came as a result of the work of three intelligence agencies -- those of Britain , France and the United States .
The work , Obama said , was done " to make sure that we were absolutely confident about the situation there . "

The United States has known about the unfinished site since the Bush administration , according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations .
French intelligence officials were also aware of the facility for several months at least , a U.S. diplomatic source said .
It was n't until Monday that Iran wrote a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency , revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base near the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom .
The facility is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges , which is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor but is sufficient to manufacture bomb - making material , according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter .
Iran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site , an agency spokesman said .
Once Iran alerted the IAEA , Obama began sharing U.S. intelligence on the nuclear site with allies , particularly with Russia and China in an effort to get those countries on board with new sanctions against Iran , the officials said .
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Friday that Iran admitted the existence of the " new pilot fuel enrichment plant , " prompting Obama , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to respond at the G - 20 economic summit .
" Iran 's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the nonproliferation regime , " Obama said , with Brown and Sarkozy standing at his side .
Watch world leaders react to Iran »
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did not mention the Qom plant during his visit to New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly sessions .
He reiterated earlier claims that Iran has fully cooperated with nuclear inspectors .
He emphasized this again Friday afternoon at a news conference , where he said Iran complied with IAEA regulations requiring it be informed at least six months before an enrichment facility becomes operational .
" We still have a year left before that six months kicks in , " Ahmadinejad said .
" I thought we were supposed to be encouraged for taking this action , " he said .

Iran 's revelation of a new nuclear site could actually " strengthen their hand " as Tehran heads into next week 's talks , according to Paul Ingram , an analyst who studies Iran and nuclear nonproliferation .
" It will be seen as an indication that they are willing to play by the rules , " said Ingram , the executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London , England .
He said the timing of Iran 's revelation , between the U.N. General Assembly sessions and the October 1 meeting , is deliberate on Iran 's part .
" This will make it more difficult to persuade them to abandon enrichment , " Ingram said .
Iran claims its nuclear enrichment program is intended for peaceful purposes , but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability .

Iran had acknowledged only a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz , which nuclear inspectors visited recently .
Iran also has an unfinished nuclear research reactor in Arak , and U.N. nuclear inspectors were allowed access to that facility this month .
Other important nuclear sites in Iran include its Bushehr nuclear power plant and the Isfahan uranium conversion plant .

Washington became aware of the covert facility near Qom several years ago , but a clearer picture about the facility emerged later , a U.S. counter - proliferation official said .
The enrichment facility would probably not be operational for another year , the official said .
The official said the newly unveiled facility " does n't really change the baseline " conclusion of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate , which concluded that Iran could manufacture a nuclear weapons between 2010 and 2015 .
The official added that there are suspicions about other possible hidden or undeclared nuclear - related facilities .

TAIWAN'S former president , Chen Shui-bian , was sent to prison for life on Friday September 11th after being convicted of various crimes , including embezzlement of government funds , forgery and accepting bribes over a land deal .
It is a harsh sentence for the 58 - year - old who ruled Taiwan from 2000 to 2008 and who had a feisty reputation for promoting independence from China .
Officials suggest that the punishment , which includes a fine of NT $ 200 m ( $ 6.1 m ) , needed to be severe because of damage inflicted on the country .
Mr Chen 's wife , Wu Shu-chen , was also given a life sentence for seven crimes relating to corruption and a fine of NT$ 300 m .
The court punished several others , including former aides and the president 's son and daughter - in - law .
The young democracy is now divided between those who are celebrating the fact that even the most powerful are not immune from the legal process and those who see the prosecution , conviction and harsh sentencing of a former president as evidence that the courts are under the sway of politicians .
Mr Chen 's supporters , naturally , claim the latter .
His office issued a statement calling the verdict “ unconstitutional , illegal and invalid ” and claiming that Taiwan 's justice system is unfair .
He plans to appeal and his office wants his immediate release from prison .
In the streets near the court his noisy supporters let off firecrackers and waved placards , also demanding his freedom .
Lines of police stood guard by barbed - wire barricades .
The opposition Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) and foreign analysts point to irregularities in the judicial process .
Mr Chen himself claims that corruption charges , which were first put to him three years ago , amount to persecution by the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) that , he says , is attempting to appease China .
Mr Chen upset the KMT by bringing to an end its half - century of rule in Taiwan and by tackling the government bureaucracy which was long accustomed to KMT influence .
In his controversial years in office he also provoked China , stoking military tensions and talking of de jure independence for the island .
The KMT returned to government last year , led by President Ma Ying - jeou , whose spokesman now denies all charges of political interference in the trial .
It is generally believed by the Taiwanese public , analysts say , that Mr Chen had been involved in some kind of wrongdoing , although there is also doubt that the former president has been treated fairly by the judiciary .
One problem is that Mr Chen has already been in jail for over nine months , allegedly to prevent him from collaborating with witnesses involved in the trial .
Critics say this is a sign that the courts did not presume his innocence .
A panel of judges which released him from prison briefly in December was mysteriously and secretively replaced with a new panel that ordered him back behind bars after criticism from KMT politicians .
The same trio of judges presided over the trial .
“ To me this is indicative that the legal system in Taiwan has been slow to democratise , ” says Professor Bruce Jacobs , a Taiwan expert at Australia 's Monash University .
He suggests that whatever happened in this case , the judicial system had long been under the influence of the KMT and has been slow to reform .
There is some doubt , too , that the embezzlement charges were appropriate .
The DPP is now in an awkward position .
If it defends the former president fervently then voters may punish it for supporting a politician considered corrupt .
On the other hand the party does not want to risk alienating Mr Chen 's hardcore supporters .
Thus the party produced a careful statement claiming that Taiwan 's judicial system is flawed and supporting Mr Chen 's appeal , but also saying that the ex-president should take responsibility for his actions , for example by remitting large sums of money kept by his family overseas .
1 ) � A modest proposal :
The government announces that they will refinance all debtors .�
Not only that , but they will buy out existing debt at par , and allow people and firms to finance all obligations at the same rate that the government does for whatever term is necessary to assure profitability or the ability to make all payments .�
The US Treasury / Fed will become “ The Bank . ” �
No need for the lesser institutions , The Bank will eat them up and dissolve their losses , taking over and refinancing their obligations .�
Hey , if we want a single - payer plan in healthcare , why not in finance ? �
Being healthy is no good if you ca n’t make your payments . 😉
This scenario extends the US Government ’s behavior to its logical absurd .�
The US Government would never be large enough to achieve this , but what they ca n’t do on the whole , they do in part for political favorites . �
They should never have bailed out anyone , because of the favoritism / unfairness of it .�
Better to have a crash and rebuild on firmer ground , than to muddle through in a Japan - style malaise . �
That is where we are heading at present .�
( That ’s the optimistic scenario . )
2 ) � I have exited junk bonds , and even low investment - grade corporates . �
Consider what Loomis Sayles is doing with junk .�
Yield = Poison , to me right now , which echoes a very early post in this blog . �
There are times when every avenue in bonds is overpriced — that is not quite now , because of senior CMBS , carefully chosen . �
All the same , it makes me bearish on the US Dollar , and bullish on foreign bonds . �
This is a time for capital preservation .
3 ) High real yields are driving the sales of US Government debt .�
Is that a positive or a negative ? �
I ca n’t tell , but there is always a tradeoff for indebted governments , because they can usually reduce interest expense by financing short . �
When their average debt maturity gets too short , they have a crisis rolling over the debt .�
We are not there yet , but we are proceeding on that road .
4 ) � I have a bias in favor of buyside analysts , after all I was one . �
But this research makes me question my bias . �
Perhaps sellside analysts are less constrained than buyside analysts ?
5 ) Debtor - in - possession lending is diminishing , reflecting the likelihood of loss . �
In some cases that may mean more insolvencies go into liquidation .�
Interesting to be seeing this in the midst of a junk bond rally .
6 ) � Short - selling is n’t dead yet .�
Would that they would take my view that a “ hard locate ” is needed ; one ca n’t short unless there is a hard commitment of shares to borrow .
7 ) Should we let managers compete free of the constraints imposed by manager consultants ?�
You bet , it would demonstrate the ability to add value clearly . �
I face that � problem myself , in that I limit myself to anything traded on US equity exchanges .�
As such , I have beaten most US equity managers ( and the indexes ) over the last nine years , but no one wants to consider me because I do n’t fit the paradigms of most manager consultants .
8 ) �
Is there a fallacy in the “ fallacy of composition ? ” �
I think so .�
Yes , if everyone does the same thing same time , the system will be unstable .�
But if society adopts a new baseline for saving / spending , the system will adjust after a number of years , and there will be a new normal to work from . �
That new normal might be higher savings and investment , in this case , leading to a better place eventually than the old normal .
9 ) �
Anyway , as I have said before , stability of a capitalist system is not normal . �
Instability is normal , and is one of the beauties of a capitalist system , because it adjusts to conditions better than anything else .
10 ) � Corporate treasurers are increasingly engaged in a negative arbitrage where they borrow long and hold cash so that the company will be secure .�
How will this work out ?�
Will this turn into buybacks when things are safe ?�
Or will it just be a drag on earnings , waiting for an eventual debt buyback ?
11 ) � Does debt doom the recovery ?�
Maybe . �
I depends on where the debt is held , and how is affects consumption spending .�
Personally , I think that consumers and small businesses are under a lot of stress now , and it wo n’t lift easily .
12 ) �
So things are looking better with junk bond defaults .�
Perhaps it was an overestimate , or that it would not all come in 2009 . �
We will see .
13 ) � Junk bonds do well ; junk stocks do better .�
In a junk rally , everything flies . �
All the more to hope that this is n’t a bear market rally ; if so , the correction will be vicious .
14 ) � Eddy , pal . �
Guys who criticize data - mining are near and dear to me .�
Now the paper in question has a funny definition of exact .�
I do n’t know how to describe it , except that it seems to mean progressively more accurate . �
I did n’t think the paper was serious at first , but given the relaxed meaning of “ exact , ” it data - mines for demographic influences on the stock market . �
Hint : if you have lots of friends when you are nine , ask for stock as a birthday present .
15 ) � I ’m increaisngly skeptical about China , and this does n’t help . �
I sense that the global recession is intesifying , amid the current positive signs in the US .
16 ) �
Do firms with female board members do worse than companies with only male board members ?�
No , but they get lower valuations , according to this study . �
I started a study on female CEOs in the US , and I got the same result , but it is imcomplete at present — perhaps new data will invalidate my earlier findings .�
Why does this happen , if true ? �
Men seem to be better at managing single investments , while women are better at managing portfolios .
17 ) �
Do we have more pain coming from the banks ? �
I think so .�
Residential real estate problems have not reconciled , and Commercial real estate problems are just beginning .�
If we mark loans to market , many large banks are insolvent , and this is not an issue that will easily be healed with time .
18 ) �
As a nation , I like Japan , and would like to visit it someday .�
What I do n’t want is for the US to imitate its economic stagnation , but maybe that could be the best of all possible worlds for the US .
19 ) � I am de-risking my equity and bond portfolios at present .�
I do not think that the present market levels fairly reflect the risks involved .�
I am reducing risk in bonds , and looking for strong sustainable equity yields in equities .
20 ) � Echoing point 17 , we face real problems on bank balance sheets from commercial real estate lending .�
There is more pain to come .�
The time to de-risk is now .

Since thinking , particularly rational thinking , is widely understood as the very touchstone of the human , it 's unsurprising that the idea of " thinking computers " encounters considerable resistance .
Surely there 's " nobody at home " in a computer , and so no " subject " to do the thinking .
In such as yet inconclusive debate , everything depends on what " thinking " is taken to be .
So despite constraints of space affording opportunity only to present it , hardly to argue for it , let me offer my own position on that one .
First , I do n't take thinking to be that which proves my existence .
Almost all professionals in the human sciences now want to distance themselves from Descartes , or at least from his " two substances " : the one ( the body ) material ; the other ( the mind ) non-material .
There are many different versions of how to achieve such distancing .
But for me , what 's critical is to effect a clean break with his famous " I think , therefore I am " .
It is a statement that is just plain wrong .
It purports to be an argument of the form " this is the case , therefore that must be the case " .
But it can't be one : since he posits his " I " at the outset as subject – it is his " I " which " thinks " – he cannot legitimately conclude , with his " therefore " , that he has proved its existence .
He has assumed its existence in the first place so his " therefore " proved nothing .
The existence of thinking in a human does not prove the existence of an " I " , or " self ' , as its subject .
So neither does the non-existence of an " I " , or " self ' , in a computer prove that it cannot think .
But for different reasons , I would still maintain that it can't .
Humans live : computers do n't .
As a life - form , each human is " a distinguishable collection of matter , with – a stable configuration far from thermodynamic equilibrium " .
And as a consequence they have a basic interest from which all others arise : they need to maintain that " far - from - thermodynamic - equilibrium " status .
For when they lose it , they die .
Computers do n't die .
Humans are animals : computers are n't .
As members of the class animalia , each human exhibits three animal characteristics : no photosynthesis ; a blastula stage in embryonic development ; and directed movement .
And as a consequence of their thereby actively structured relationship with their environment , they acquire some further interests : in particular , the interest of maintaining that " directed movement " characteristic for as long as possible .
For when they lose it , again they die .
And again , computers do n't .
Humans speak : computers do n't .
As members of the species Homo sapiens , each human exhibits a very special " directed movement " skill : that of so directing the musculature of their six speech organs that they can produce patterned arrangements of arbitrary sounds to " linguistically represent " their environment .
And as a consequence of their thereby developmentally structured relationship with that which surrounds them , they can acquire more sophisticated interests : in particular , the interest of maintaining and extending that skill .
For when they can't , they cease to flourish .
Computers neither flourish , nor cease to flourish .
In summary , humans live , as animals , which can speak : and computers do n't .
Which is why humans can think : and computers can't .
For each human develops a capacity , this time unique , to internalise the spoken word into non-spoken thought : a capacity which means that they can cease merely to " inhabit " the present biosphere , but come instead to " make " the past - present - future world .
If not quite Watson 's " sub- vocal tremor of the larynx " , thought is non-vocal language .
And I believe that because we have such a linguistically structured relationship with the world around us , we acquire the most sophisticated of all our interests : we can come to love all our own kind .
Computers love nothing .
So : thinking emerged to serve the metabolic , active , developmental , linguistic and loving interests of thinkers .
And it 's because they do n't have such interests – or indeed any interests – that computers can't think .
The problem is n't – as often it 's portrayed – that it's we who have made the computers .
It is that , in doing so , we have made the artificial , not the synthetic .
Artificial non-thinking computers do seem in many ways more useful to us than synthetic thinking copies of ourselves would be because they do things we can't .
But if we were to make the synthetic – and given the ever - increasing number of synthetic amino acids accumulating in laboratory flasks , one day we probably will – then more or less definitionally , it would think .
It would be " just like us " .
It would think " just like us " .
And if Vico was right to say that we only ever really understand that which we make , for humankind that could be a very good day indeed .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- News Corp. NWSA , +0.32 % NWS , +0.79 % Chairman Rupert Murdoch said Wednesday that the company intends to charge for all of its news Web sites .
" Quality journalism is not cheap , and an industry that gives away its content is simply cannibalizing its ability to produce good reporting , " Murdoch said .
News Corp. is the parent of Dow Jones & Co. , which includes The Wall Street Journal , Dow Jones Newswires , Barron's , Factiva and MarketWatch , the publisher of this report .
Bruno Avangera , a 40 - year - old web designer from Tucumán in Argentina , pauses to relight a half - smoked joint of cannabis .
Then he speaks approvingly of " progress and the right decision " by the country 's seven supreme court judges , who decided last week that prosecuting people for the private consumption of small amounts of narcotics was unconstitutional .
" Last year three of my friends were caught smoking a spliff in a park and were treated like traffickers , " he said .
" They went to court , which took six months .
One went to jail alongside murderers .
The others were sent to rehab , where they were treated for an addiction they did n't have , alongside serious heroin and crack users .
It was pointless and destroyed their lives . "
The court 's ruling was based on a case involving several men caught with joints in their pockets .
As a result , judges struck down an existing law stipulating a sentence of up to two years in jail for those caught with any amount of narcotics .
" Each individual adult is responsible for making decisions freely about their desired lifestyle without state interference , " the ruling said .
" Private conduct is allowed unless it constitutes a real danger or causes damage to property or the rights of others . "
Is the " war on drugs " ending ?
The Argentinian ruling does not stand alone .
Across Latin America and Mexico , there is a wave of drug law reform which constitutes a stark rebuff to the United States as it prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of a conflict officially declared by President Richard Nixon and fronted by his wife , Pat , in 1969 .
That " war " has incarcerated an average of a million US citizens a year , as every stratum of American society demonstrates its insatiable need to get high .
And it has also engulfed not only America , but the Americas .
At El Paso at the end of the month , experts from the US and Mexico will gather to take stock and thrash out alternatives .
El Paso stands cheek by jowl with its twin city , Ciudad Juárez , across the Rio Grande .
There , last Wednesday , the day after the Argentinian court ruling , cartel gunmen broke into the El Aliviane drug rehabilitation centre , lined 17 young people against a wall and cut them down with a fusillade of machine - gun fire .
Troops last night captured the suspected killer , Jose Rodolfo Escajeda , considered one of the most brutal hitmen in Chihuahua and one of the leaders of the Juárez cartel .
The executions , coming shortly after the killing of 40 people over three days in Juárez two weeks ago , take the death toll to about 1,400 this year , making it the most dangerous city in the world .
Never have the war on drugs and its flipside , the drug wars , raged so furiously as on this anniversary .
Yet Mexico's is only the latest in a series of murderous conflicts that have scarred the pan-American war on drugs , starting with Operation Condor in the 1970s , whereby the US helped Mexico to obliterate poppy crops , only to give birth to the new cartels and institutionalised corruption .
Meanwhile , there have been catastrophic drug wars and narco - insurgency in Colombia , combining with political struggles to create the biggest internal displacement of people in the western hemisphere .
Drug - related violence has blighted Brazil , Peru , Bolivia , Venezuela and anywhere the Mexican and Colombian cocaine cartels sought their product .
Latin America has also become a factory for synthetic drugs , much of it now under Mexican control .
Latin America is seeking a different route to that of outright interdiction as advocated – and for decades directed – by Washington .
The new thinking is emblematic of a new era in South American politics and statehood , in which the lexicon demands partnership with the US , not the subjugation that hallmarked the presidencies of Nixon , Reagan , the Bushes and Clinton .
Argentina 's president , Cristina Fernández , has openly supported freeing up the courts of cases involving people caught with small amounts of drugs .
In 2008 , she said she complained that in Argentina " an addict is condemned as if he were a criminal " .
The government 's cabinet chief , Aníbal Fernández , said the decision was a move away from " the repressive politics invented by the Nixon administration " and will offer the opportunity for the state to focus on going after major traffickers .
But a line is drawn between marijuana and hard drugs , the decision being seen as a step towards freeing resources for the battle against " paco " cocaine paste , a cheap but toxic and addictive drug that has swept through Argentina 's barrios .
Between 2001 and 2005 , the use of paco increased by more than 200 % .
Brazilian drugs campaigners see decriminalisation as a way of wresting power from heavily armed gangs .
Under Brazilian law , possession of any drug is a crime , and any move to relax drug laws is likely to face fierce opposition from the Brazilian right and the Catholic church .
But " for South American countries , the ' harm ' from drugs comes less from drug use than the war against producers and traffickers " , said Benjamin Lessing , a University of California researcher .
" The bloodshed in Mexico is grabbing headlines , but thousands of people die every year in Rio de Janeiro in clashes between police and traffickers . "
Eduardo Machado , an activist from the PE Body Count group , which documents homicide levels in Recife , one of Brazil 's most violent cities , said the country 's war on drugs had sidelined debate over " the huge public health problem " they caused .
" As long as we look at the problem of drugs in terms of repression , we will carry on failing , " he said .
" As long as the debate about drugs revolves around being more or less repressive , we will continue to lose thousands of young lives each year . "
Even before conventional wisdom began to turn against the war on drugs , some leftwing leaders in Latin America had their own reasons to shun collaboration with the US .
Not only was the policy failing , they said , but it was a pretext for Washington meddling .
Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez , cut ties with the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 2005 , accusing its agents of espionage .
In Bolivia , President Evo Morales , a Chávez ally , expelled American counter - narcotic agents , also claiming they were spies .
He campaigned to rehabilitate the maligned coca leaf as a sacred Inca symbol with medicinal and ceremonial properties .
On one occasion , he brandished a leaf during a speech to the UN general assembly and offered coca tea to visiting dignitaries .
When addressing Aymara Indians , the president is known to shout : " Long live the coca leaf , death to the Yankees ! "
Bolivia 's impoverished highlanders revere Morales as a fellow cocalero – coca grower – and are grateful the era of coca crackdowns and shoot - outs with US - backed drug officials is over .
Morales , however , has promised zero tolerance for cocaine , which he considers a malign perversion of the coca leaf .
Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , another leftwinger , has refused to renew the US military 's lease on its base at Manta which was used for counter - narcotics operations in the Pacific .
Last year the president pardoned 1,500 " mules " who had been sentenced to jail , saying they were impoverished people who had been exploited .
Ecuadorean legislators have signalled they will follow Argentina in decriminalising cannabis .
Despite almost a decade of US - backed counter - insurgency operations , Colombia 's cocaine output has proved remarkably resilient , a tribute to the ruthlessness and inventiveness of coca growers , guerrillas , paramilitaries and smugglers .
Peru , the second - largest cocaine exporter after Colombia , is the odd country out in South America 's shift against the drug war .
It has made no move towards decriminalisation and is braced for confrontation .
Shining Path guerrillas , a near - extinct movement , have roared back in the past 16 months , killing soldiers and police and seizing control of coca- producing valleys .
Mexico is in a curious position : a battlefield in a drugs war that has claimed some 14,000 lives since December 2006 , but also a laboratory for an experiment that goes beyond even Argentina 's – opting no longer to prosecute those carrying small quantities of marijuana , cocaine , heroin or synthetic drugs .
Decriminalisation is openly aimed at redirecting stretched resources against the warmongers and opening prison space to accommodate them rather than petty addicts .
Few serving Mexican politicians have tried to pretend that , without the war , the legislation would not have been considered .
In Tijuana , addicts cannot believe their luck – those arriving at the Narcóticos Anónimos session are amazed that possession of up to four lines of cocaine or 50mg of heroin will be legal .
Juan Morales Magana , 17 , a windscreen - washer and registered methamphetamine and heroin addict , was working out how many hits the legal limit of 40mg of meth would get him , though his counsellor , an evangelical pastor , was ambivalent : " I would n't want anyone to think that , just because it is legal , one should live like this for fun .
Drugs are the scourge of our society .
All this can do would limit killing between small - time cholos [ gangsters ] for street - corner turf , allowing the army to go after kingpins and middle men .
The danger is that kingpins will accelerate the domestic market if possession is legal and smuggling into the US more difficult . "
In barrios such as this , drugs are sold from tienditas controlled by gangs that operate an outsourced tender system for the battling cartels .
" It 's unsure how the legislation will affect actions against the tienditas , " said police officer Elisio Montes , whose two best friends , his former boss and assistant , were murdered by executioners for the cartels .
" Personally , I sometimes wish drugs would be made legal so that the gringos can get high and we can live in peace .
Then I say to myself : no – these drugs are addictive after one single hit .
They 're terrifying – they destroy lives , they destroy our young people .
If they are legal , they will buy more . "
A further reason for scepticism is the prospect of mass drugs tourism from the US .
This is not what Mexican businessmen in the border town of Nogales , Sonora , had in mind last Tuesday when they discussed how to restore the image of cities that until recently enjoyed thriving trade from Americans looking for cheap pharmaceuticals , dental treatment , souvenirs , alcohol and sex .
The prospect of border towns becoming the equivalent of Amsterdam , only with cocaine and heroin freely on sale , was not discussed .
" It 's interesting , ' said hotelier Jesus Antonio Pujol Irastorza .
" I have seen a lot written about this potential problem in the US media , but almost nothing in the Mexican press . "
" For a country that has experienced thousands of deaths from warring drug cartels , " said San Diego police chief William Lansdowne , " it defies logic why they will pass a law that will clearly increase drug use . "
The counter - voices will continue to make themselves heard .
But even in the US , the discourse on drugs is changing .
The prosecutor general in Baja California , Rommel Moreno , said months ago that he found it " very hard " to talk to his American counterparts " about fighting drugs with any means other than interdiction " , but senses " an important shift " .
Officials in the border states talk about legalising marijuana for personal use , while Professor David Shirk , director of the Trans - Border Institute in San Diego , said : " I think it is inevitable that possession of marijuana will be legal in the US within a decade . "
Powerful voices against prohibition will create the underlying theme at the major conference in El Paso this month and there is even a movement of police officers and law enforcement agents urging decriminalisation , unthinkable until recently .
" Today , drugs are illegal , they are out of control , and they are everywhere " , said Kristin Daley , projects director for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
" If they were managed in the way that alcohol is , they would be under control .
Instead of criminals getting richer , violence escalating and drug - related deaths on the rise , we would live under a system of established pricing , peaceful purchase and a regulated labelling system . "
But they remain wary in Tijuana .
Before the drug war , this border city was a capital of vice tourism , which has now disappeared .
Tijuana lies opposite San Diego , from where most of those seeking prostitutes and other distractions came , and where a letter recently appeared in the local Union Tribune newspaper from Omar Firestone , principal cellist in the Orquesta de Baja California .
He warned that the last thing the city needs is " offering sanctuary to American druggies " who will " draw the worst of our society to the streets of Tijuana and increase the flight of those seeking a better life .
I guess the cartels needed a government bailout . "
But on this overcast morning Caral 's celebrity status was hardly in evidence .
As we waited by the empty ticket desk , Alejandra , a tour guide based in Lima , told me I was the first visitor she had brought to Caral in 2008 , and it was already June .
" Everything about Peru is Inca , Inca , " she said .
" Everyone goes to Machu Picchu .
They do n't stay long enough to come up here . "
She was right .
In a week spent among fragments of dead civilisations , haunted by phantasmagoric deities , we met just a handful of tourists .
The shape of the trip was neatly chronological , starting with Caral and ending in the city of Cajamarca where the last Inca king was killed by the Spanish in 1532 – and ancient Peru , in its successive manifestations and outlandish beliefs , was made extinct .

Remembering Uri
Remember Uri Geller ?
It seems that new generations have no idea who he was , or what a " mystifier " is .
Actually , I do n't think anyone knows what a " mystifier " is ...
So while Uri's star may be setting below the horizon , it 's actually important to remember him because his story teaches us lessons .
One man can fool millions into believing he has supernatural powers , unless he 's tested under controlled conditions .
And when a man refuses to be tested under proper conditions , well , that can tell us something too .
In order to help put Uri into perspective , the site www.zem.demon.co.uk has created a bibliography of Uri Geller articles .
This exaustive list can serve as a research tool for anyone wanting to research the Geller " phenomenon , " which in the end turned out to be little more than opportunistic showmanship .

Accounting for Differences in Coverage
Scope and Timing of the Coverage
Response to the Initiative Becomes the Narrative
Faith Traditions Highlighted in 2001 and 2009
An Inside - the - Beltway Story
Methodology
When he took over the White House in January 2009 , President Barack Obama quickly adopted much of the “ faith - based initiative ” put into place by his predecessor , President George W. Bush .
The initiative was designed to expand the role of faith - based and community organizations in the delivery of social services .
But a new study by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life finds that Obama ’s faith - based initiative has so far generated little of the contentious press coverage associated with Bush ’s effort .
And the program is not as closely associated with the current president as it was with the man he succeeded .
The new study examines newspaper coverage of the faith - based initiative during the first six months of the Obama and Bush administrations and finds that the topic received nearly seven times more coverage in the first six months of 2001 than it did during the same period in 2009 .
The faith - based initiative was an early priority of the Bush administration – “ one of the first items on his agenda as president , ” as described by The Washington Post .
1
But the program met resistance from both religious and nonreligious leaders , who voiced concerns that the effort was being politicized and fears that the initiative would undermine church - state boundaries .
The controversial nature of the initiative became the focus of much of the early 2001 press coverage .
But when Obama established his own faith - based initiative , the press coverage focused primarily on procedural matters – including the renaming of the office as the White House Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships ; its new director , Joshua DuBois ; and a new , 25 - member faith - based advisory council – as well as questions about how Obama would address issues that arose during the eight years of Bush ’s faith - based initiative .
The one controversy that generated a relatively significant amount of coverage in the first six months of the Obama administration concerned whether faith - based groups that receive federal funds should be able to consider a potential employee ’s religion when making hiring decisions .
These are some of the key findings of the study , which analyzed 331 newspaper stories from January - June 2001 ( 281 stories ) and January - June 2009 ( 50 stories ) in eight national and regional newspapers .
2
Using Nexis keyword searches , stories addressing the faith - based initiative were identified for analysis .
Additional keyword searches and qualitative textual analysis were used to identify major patterns in the newspaper coverage .
( A more detailed discussion of the methodology is at the end of the report . )
Also among the findings :
Coverage of the faith - based initiative was almost 50 % more likely to be on the front page of newspapers in 2001 than in 2009 .
In the first half of 2001 , 15 % of the stories – 43 stories in total – appeared on the front page .
In the first half of 2009 , that number dropped to 10 % , or only five stories .
Issues related to the separation of church and state were the top concern in the press in 2001 .
Fully 40 % of the newspaper coverage focused on whether the initiative violated this constitutional line .
In 2009 , the top controversy in the coverage analyzed was the unresolved faith - based hiring issue .
More than a third of the stories ( 36 % ) dealt with this debate .
In each year studied , Christianity was referenced nearly as often as Judaism and Islam combined .
In total , the Christian faith was directly referenced in 32 % of the stories .
This was followed by references to Judaism and Islam , at 21 % and 15 % , respectively .
In both years , newspaper coverage of the faith - based initiative was often a Washington - focused story .
Of all the articles analyzed , 56 % carried Washington , D.C. , datelines , while no other single city came close .
Accounting for Differences in Coverage
What accounts for the differences in the coverage of the faith - based initiative during the first six months of the Bush and Obama administrations ?
In 2001 , the faith - based initiative was a new and little - understood program .
It was championed by an evangelical president who had just won a close election in large part thanks to the support of conservative Christians .
The plan to make federal funds more accessible to religious groups became a source of controversy that drove the press coverage .
During Obama ’s first six months in office , by contrast , there were few substantive changes to the initiative .
The Obama administration also took a wait - and - see approach to confronting the initiative ’s thornier legal issues , including faith - based hiring .
This made for a relatively small news event .
Another reason for the differences in coverage relates to the political climate and national agendas of each year studied .
When Bush introduced the faith - based initiative in 2001 , there were fewer major issues competing for public and media attention .
In the first half of 2009 , by contrast , the president , Congress and the public have been occupied with numerous concerns – from the economic recession to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq – which have pushed issues like the faith - based initiative off the radar .
Scope and Timing of the Coverage
Perhaps the most striking difference in the press treatment of the faith - based initiatives of the two presidents is the amount of coverage .
As previously mentioned , the study finds that Bush ’s plan received far more attention initially than Obama ’s has .3
In the coverage studied , the stories dealing with the initiative in 2001 outnumbered those in 2009 by nearly seven to one .
The 2001 coverage was also more prominent ; in the first half of 2001 , 15 % of the stories analyzed , 43 in total , appeared on the front page while in the first half of 2009 , that number dropped to 10 % , or only five .
Overall , Bush has been more closely linked to the initiative than Obama .
While both men were mentioned frequently in news reports from their respective first months in office ( Bush ’s name appeared in 95 % of stories about the initiative from the first half of 2001 , and Obama ’s name appeared in 92 % of stories from the first half of 2009 ) , Bush also was referenced in nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of the stories analyzed from the beginning of Obama ’s term .
For instance , a Boston Globe story described the initiative in 2009 as a “ Bush - era program . ” 4
By contrast , Bush ’s predecessor , President Bill Clinton , appeared in only 32 % of the stories analyzed from 2001.5
One common feature of the coverage during the presidents ’ early months in office is the timing of the press attention .
In both cases , the bulk of the stories analyzed were published in the first full month or two , after which the coverage subsided .
For Bush , the stories clustered around February and March 2001 , following his Jan. 29 signing of two executive orders creating the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives and five satellite centers .
In Obama ’s case , coverage peaked in February 2009 , sparked by his Feb. 5 signing of an executive order renaming the office and announcing the advisory council and other plans for the initiative ’s expansion .
* January analysis did not include the entire month , only from Inauguration Day through the end of the month .
Both presidents had spoken about the initiative while on the campaign trail , creating some anticipation in the religious community about what they might do .
In the 2008 campaign , however , issues like the faith - based initiative were often drowned out in the coverage .
With the exception of the economy and the Iraq war , all of the top 10 media topics were political or horse - race focused , according to a report by the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
Response to the Initiative Becomes the Narrative
Bush received far more press attention than Obama for his faith - based initiative , spurred primarily by concerns raised by religious as well as nonreligious leaders .
The negative response of some evangelical Christians to Bush ’s initiative seemed to surprise many inside and outside the administration .
This made evangelical leaders and the churches they represent a significant part of the 2001 narrative .
A Chicago Tribune story from April noted the irony : “ Many white evangelicals – the very people Bush has been accused of trying to appease with his plan to fund religiously based social services – rejected the idea , saying it would hinder the expression of their beliefs . ”
6
Overall , 48 % of the coverage of Bush ’s initiative touched on at least one of three areas of controversy : the issue of church - state separation , the debates over faith - based hiring practices , and the question of whether faith - based organizations would compromise their religious identity by not being able to share their faith if they accepted government funds .
“ Separation of church and state ” was referenced in 40 % of the stories .
The hiring debate ( 26 % ) and the proselytizing debate ( 15 % ) appeared less frequently .
By 2009 , references to these three controversial areas had dropped off somewhat , from 48 % to 36 % .
This time , the hiring issue appeared more frequently than the others , at 36 % of the stories ; in fact , every story in which at least one of the controversial areas was mentioned included a reference to the hiring issue .
The church - state issue appeared in 28 % of the coverage and proselytizing was mentioned in 20 % .
In many cases , when these controversies were mentioned , it was in reference to controversies remaining from the Bush years .
Covering controversies : 2001
The Bush administration ’s plans to make federal funding more accessible to faith groups ran into opposition early on .
The opposition , often from disparate sources , played out in the headlines .
A Boston Globe story reported , “ Nothing put forth in the first 100 days of his administration has sparked as much passion , discord , and suspicion as President Bush ’s proposal to make it easier for faith - based groups to get federal dollars to deliver social services to the nation ’s needy . ” 7 A Chicago Tribune article characterized Bush as “ embroiled in battles ” over the faith - based initiative .
8
The unanticipated reaction from the Christian community often became a story itself and helped account for much of the coverage .
A Boston Globe headline read , “ Christian leaders pan Bush ’s faith plan . ” 9
A Boston Globe piece described some of the core concerns of these leaders : “ the initiative could fund bigoted groups and foster government interference with churches .
”
10
Some groups , including civil libertarians and public interest watchdog organizations , were concerned that federal funding of religious programs would result in the government subsidizing religion .
The headline of a March New York Times article in the “ A ” section read , “ Bush visit sets off church - state debate .
”
11
The legality of faith - based hiring appeared in much of the 2001 coverage .
In this case , it was often religious leaders who expressed concerns that accepting federal funds might limit their ability to hire only employees who share their moral and religious beliefs .
A January 2001 New York Times article illustrated this concern by citing a Kentucky religious charity that received state funding for its work ; the charity was sued for firing an employee who was photographed at a gay rights parade .
12
Also at issue was whether faith - based organizations would compromise their religious identity by receiving government funds .
Some religious advocates worried that faith - based organizations and churches would be straight - jacketed in their ability to proselytize if they accepted government funds .
As a religion columnist for the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette put it , “ Our cherished freedom of religious expression was bought with blood and should not be threatened by a few dollars .
”
13
Covering controversies : 2009
In early 2009 , the opposition that confronted Bush ’s faith - based initiative was still reflected in the news coverage but to a lesser degree .
References to church - state separation , faith - based hiring and proselytizing dipped from 48 % in 2001 to 36 % of the stories analyzed in 2009 .
The hiring issue was the main controversy addressed by the press in 2009 , and it appeared more often in Obama ’s coverage ( 36 % of the stories in 2009 ) than it did in Bush ’s ( 26 % in 2001 ) .
News stories indicated that Obama was expected to address this legal knot by directly challenging the Bush administration ’s faith - based hiring position , as he indicated he would do during the campaign .
But the president announced plans to work with the White House legal counsel and the Department of Justice to fully explore the hiring issue and make decisions on a case - by - case basis rather than adopting a blanket policy change .
This somewhat defused the issue , though it still received wide coverage .
A Chicago Tribune article said , “ Critics of Bush ’s faith - based initiative thought Obama had promised to end religious discrimination among social service groups taking federal money .
But Obama , in announcing his own faith - based program , said only that the discrimination issue might be reviewed .
” 14 The New York Times called the hiring issue the “ biggest question ” surrounding faith - based initiatives , and one that Obama “ did not settle .
” 15
Faith Traditions Highlighted in 2001 and 2009
Of all the religious traditions referenced in the newspaper coverage of the faith - based initiative , Christianity received the most attention in both 2001 and 2009 .
Christianity was referenced in nearly one - third of the stories each year ( 32 % in both 2001 and in 2009 ) .
In each year , Christianity was referenced nearly as often as Judaism and Islam combined .
A significant focus of the 2001 coverage was on black Protestants , specifically the Bush administration ’s attempts to reach out to black voters and black churches with the promise of faith - based funding .
There was a sense in Washington after the 2000 election that Bush had work to do when it came to building trust among black voters .
In the press , this sometimes translated to the view that his faith - based initiative was a means of increasing this trust .
A Boston Globe story said : “ The White House , fearful that African - American voters will cost Republicans control of Congress in 2002 , is executing a carefully choreographed plan that uses the new Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives to engage black clergy and build support for the party in their congregations and neighborhoods .
” 16 Another Globe piece , titled “ Bush looking for black votes , but not earning them , ” echoes this theme : “ Bush , with his direct appeal to black ministers in recent weeks , apparently is making a concerted effort to change the negative perception that the vast majority of black voters have of him . ” 17 News reports characterized the response of black churches to the initiative as generally positive .
A Los Angeles Times article reported that “ many African American churches and advocates of urban areas have expressed their support , seeing in it a new source of funding for their social initiatives .
” 18
Other religious traditions – some lesser known , some with few U.S. adherents – were scattered throughout the newspaper coverage in both 2001 and 2009 .
Of these , Scientology received the most mentions with 23 , followed by Hare Krishna ( 15 ) , Buddhism ( 8 ) , the Worldwide Unification Church ( 5 ) and Wicca ( 1 ) .
In some cases , these traditions appeared in news analysis about the debate over whether some groups should be eligible for faith - based funding .
When non-Christian faiths were mentioned in 2009 , it was often in the context of Obama ’s new advisory council .
A Los Angeles Times article described the council as “ featuring Christian , Muslim and Jewish representatives .
” 19 The press picked up on the White House line about interfaith cooperation : “ The office will also cooperate with the National Security Council to foster an ‘ interfaith dialogue ’ worldwide , particularly with Islam , ” reported USA Today.20
An Inside - the - Beltway Story
In both 2001 and 2009 , newspapers often covered the initiative from Washington and with a largely political perspective rather than from the angle of cities and citizens across America who might be affected by the policies .
This was evident both in the location of the journalists filing the stories and in the focus of the reports .
Geographic perspective
In both the 2001 and 2009 coverage , more than half of the stories were reported from Washington , D.C. , with an inside - the - beltway perspective .
In the remaining coverage , though , the press in 2001 offered a broader geographic range .
Though a slight majority of the 2001 stories were filed in Washington ( 56 % ) , the rest were reported in a wide array of cities – 29 different locations , according to the datelines .
Apart from the stories filed in the cities of origin for the newspapers studied , Detroit and Philadelphia appeared most frequently .
In Detroit ( 2 % of total 2001 datelines ) , Bush promoted the faith - based initiative at the annual Conference of Mayors held there in June 2001 .
Stories were also written from Philadelphia ( 2 % ) , the hometown of John DiIulio , the first director of the Bush administration ’s Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives .
In 2009 , Obama ’s faith - based initiative coverage was about as Washington - centric as in 2001 .
Of all this year ’s stories analyzed , 56 % had Washington datelines .
But in the remainder of the stories analyzed , not one contained a dateline from a city apart from the paper ’s hometown .
Washington - centric
The faith - based initiative has , at its core , significant implications for local communities , yet few of the stories looked at current or proposed local faith - based funding .
In 2001 , only 19 out of 281 stories focused on individual neighborhoods , towns or cities where specific faith - based programs make use of government money to accomplish their goals .
Some of these profiles illustrated the potential benefits of the faith - based initiative .
One case was described in the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette .
Then - Governor Mike Huckabee had introduced a provision into state law that released religious groups from the demand that they hide or mask their religious décor while using government funds .
21
Often , though , these profile pieces brought to light the nettlesome issues that can arise when religious institutions and the government form partnerships .
One story described a Newton , Iowa , prison program that helps inmates turn their lives around by turning to God .
The New York Times piece described it as an evangelical prison ministry that illustrates “ the promise and the challenges ” of the faith - based initiative .
22
The Obama administration ’s faith - based initiative was covered by the press as a beltway story , with not a single in - depth story profiling a local program .
For coverage of this nature , news consumers would need to turn to magazines , blogs and other niche media .
As noted earlier , many of the stories dealt with process , some simply noting Obama ’s expansion of the faith - based initiative : “ The Obama administration is expected today to unveil a council of religious and secular advisors that will guide decisions on faith - based programs for a broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues , ” according to the Los Angeles Times in February 2009 .
USA Today reported in the same week that “ President Obama revamped the White House headquarters for faith - based initiatives Thursday . ”
23
Future news coverage of the faith - based initiative may depend on what is happening on the national and global stage as well as the extent to which the Obama administration decides to make major substantive changes to the initiative .
Methodology
This analysis examines U.S. newspaper coverage of the faith - based initiative in the early months of the Bush and Obama administrations .
The time periods examined were from Jan. 20 , 2001 – Inauguration Day – until June 30 , 2001 , and from Jan. 20 , 2009 until June 30 , 2009 .
In total , the analysis period comprised 10 months and 24 days of coverage .
The Sample
The selection criteria for newspapers began with national and regional papers that are archived in the LexisNexis database .
From this list , newspapers were chosen from among the top 50 U.S. newspapers by circulation , according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations , and for a geographic mix of regions around the country .
Those included were the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , The Boston Globe , Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times , Minneapolis Star Tribune , The New York Times , USA Today and The Washington Post .
Story Selection
The goal of the study was to examine coverage of the faith - based initiative .
To identify stories that addressed the faith - based initiative , keyword searches were conducted using Boolean search logic in the Nexis database .
For the 2001 coverage , the following search terms were used : “ White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives ” OR “ faith - based initiative . ”
For the 2009 coverage , the terms were altered slightly to reflect the office ’s new name : “ White House Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships ” OR “ faith - based initiative . ”
In total , these search terms rendered 331 stories that in some way addressed the faith - based initiative ( 281 in 2001 and 50 in 2009 ) .
At this point , a qualitative textual analysis was conducted .
This analysis consisted of a close reading of all the newspaper stories identified in the sample .
This reading enabled the key themes , controversies , and patterns of press coverage to emerge .
It also served two other specific purposes .
First , was to identify certain frames in the stories .
Newspaper stories devoted to profiling a community affected by the faith - based initiative were noted and tallied .
If the majority of the story was focused on the community angle , it was considered a profile piece .
This other main purpose was to inform the second level of keyword searches .
Additional search terms were used within this sample to quantify specific patterns in the coverage , as well as the appearances of key figures and groups in the coverage .
Names were searched using the following keywords : “ Bush , ” “ Clinton , ” “ DiIulio , ” “ DuBois ” and “ Obama . ”
Stories were checked to ensure the intended subjects were the ones that appeared in the search .
Individual religious traditions were also searched , using the following terms : “ African - American church ” OR “ black church , ” “ Baptist , ” “ Buddhist OR Buddhism , ” “ Catholic , ” “ Christian OR Christianity , ” “ evangelical , ” “ Hare Krishna , ” “ Jew OR Judaism OR Jewish , ” “ Muslim OR Islam OR Moslem , ” “ scientology OR scientologist ” and “ Wicca ” OR “ Wiccan . ”
Finally , keyword searches were used to identify the presence of controversial topics that emerged during the time periods studied .
The terms used were “ ( hiring ) AND ( discrimination OR discriminate OR discriminatory ) , ” “ proselytize OR proselytizing OR proselytization ” and “ separation of church and state ” OR “ church - state . ”
Following the second level of keyword searches , a second reading of all the stories in the sample was conducted to ensure that no significant patterns or storylines had been missed in the analysis .

2 The following newspapers were used in the analysis : Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , The Boston Globe , Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times , Minneapolis Star Tribune , The New York Times , USA Today and The Washington Post .
3 In the eight years between the periods studied , much has changed in religion coverage .
More and more reporting has migrated to magazines , blogs and other niche media .
This could be one factor in the decline of newspaper attention to the faith - based initiative in 2009 .

The " Club Med " of southern European Union countries came under attack from environmentalists today for defying the campaign to ban trade in bluefin tuna , Japan 's highly prized sushi fish , whose stocks are dwindling dangerously low .
A fortnight ago the European commission agreed , after weeks of argument , to back a proposal from Monaco to ban trade in bluefin tuna .
If the EU had voted for the ban at an international forum next March , fishing for bluefin tuna would have been effectively outlawed , at least temporarily .
Despite optimism that the ban , supported by 21 EU governments , would go ahead , the move was blocked at a Brussels meeting late yesterday by Malta , Cyprus , Spain , Italy , France , and Greece .
" Deplorable , " said Xavier Pastor , head of the Oceana fisheries conservation lobby group in Europe .
" They are pushing tuna to the point of no return . "
" Enough is enough , " said Aaron McLoughlin , head of the WWF European marine programme .
" It is once again large - scale Mediterranean fishing interests trying to gang up against the long - term survival of Atlantic bluefin tuna . "
French opposition was a particular surprise as President Nicolas Sarkozy made a speech in Brittany in July calling for the tuna ban , which is backed by Britain , Germany and most EU states who support Monaco , the first country to ban trading in bluefin tuna because it is endangered .
Stocks of the fish in the Mediterranean have hit almost extinction level , according to experts , with bluefin tuna thought to be below 18 % of the total in 1970 .
" As a result of both legal and illegal catches , over the past decades the species has experienced a sharp decline and its conservation status is now very poor , " the European commission has said .
• This article was amended on Wednesday 23 September 2009 .
We mistakenly listed Portugal among the countries who opposed the ban on trade in bluefin tuna , and omitted Greece .
This has been corrected .
Born June 2nd , these critically endangered male Amur Tiger cubs are now on public display at Utah 's Hogle Zoo .
Mother Basha has been busily attending to the three playful little brothers and they have been growing steadily for the past three months .
Amur Tigers are the largest of all cat species , reaching 11 feet and up to 650 lbs. in adulthood .
TINY TIGER TRIO MAKES GRAND ENTRANCE AT HOGLE ZOO'S ASIAN HIGHLANDS
( Salt Lake City , UT ) - Utah 's Hogle Zoo is thrilled to announce that three
critically endangered male Amur tiger cubs have been born in Asian Highlands
to parents Basha and Kazek .
Since the June 02 , 2009 birth , the three tiny
cubs have been out of visitors ' view while they were getting stronger and
bonding with their mother .
Media opportunities for interviews , photos and
footage will be available today ( August 25 ) from 9:30 until 11 am .
The cubs
will also be on public display as of today .
For the past couple of months these tiger brothers have become increasingly
active and Basha is kept busy nursing and caring for her three active and
playful cubs .
Although this is first litter for her , she is proving to be an
excellent mother .
" With first - time moms we prepare ourselves to deal with
the unknown .
But Basha took on the three cubs like she was a natural ; she
was an extremely caring , protective , great mom from day one , " says Hogle Zoo
feline keeper Jill VanMilligen .
She adds , " Basha was one of three cubs born
at Hogle Zoo in 2003 and now watching her become a mom herself is
incredible . "
This is the first time that Kazek , who arrived at Hogle Zoo in
2006 from the Buffalo Zoo , has sired a litter .
The Zoo's Amur tigers , formerly known as Siberian tigers , are part of the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums ' ( AZA ) Tiger Species Survival Plan ( SSP ) .
The Tiger SSP is responsible for maintaining a genetically healthy
population of tigers in North American zoos .
There are approximately 130
Amur tigers in AZA - accredited zoos and about 500 living in small populations
of far eastern Russia and northeast China .
Loss of habitat due to logging
activities , human encroachment and poaching are the main threats to their
survival in the wild .
Zoo tigers are extremely important ambassadors for their counterparts in the
wild .
In fact when these cubs were born in June , Hogle Zoo was the only AZA
institution this year to effectively breed and have successful rearing by
the mother .
According Hogle Zoo Assistant Director - Programs Kimberly
Davidson , " This birth is a testament not only to Hogle Zoo 's excellence in
animal care but also our commitment to preserving Amur tigers . "
In zoos ,
visitors can connect with big cats like Amur tigers and become inspired to
learn about and help preserve their future in the wild .
Amur Tiger Facts :
The Amur tiger , formerly known as the Siberian tiger , is
listed as a critically endangered species .
Amur tigers are the largest of
all the cat species , with the males weighing in between 400 and 650 pounds
and measuring up to 11 feet in length .
In the wild , they are found living in
the snow - covered forests of eastern Russia and northeast China .
By linking the electrical currents of two superconductors large enough to be seen with the naked eye , researchers have extended the domain of observable quantum effects .
Billions of flowing electrons in the superconductors can collectively exhibit a weird quantum property called entanglement , usually confined to the realm of tiny particles , scientists report in the September 24 Nature .
" It 's an exciting piece of work , " comments physicist Steven Girvin of Yale University .
" People are interested in pushing the boundaries of quantum mechanics . "
Entanglement is one of the strangest consequences of quantum mechanics .
After interacting in a certain way , objects become mysteriously linked , or entangled , so that what happens to one seems to affect the fate of the other .
For the most part , researchers have only found signs of entanglement between tiny particles , such as ions , atoms and photons .
John Martinis and colleagues at the University of California , Santa Barbara looked for entanglement between two superconductors , each less than a millimeter across .
These superconducting circuits , made of aluminum , were separated by a few millimeters on an electronic chip .
At low temperatures , electrons in the superconductors flow collectively , unfettered by resistance .
Despite each superconductor 's relatively large size , the electrons within move together in a naturally coherent way .
" There are very few moving parts , so to speak , " Girvin says , which helped the scientists spot evidence of entanglement .
" It 's a general fact that the larger an object is , the more classical it is in its behavior , and the more difficult it is to see quantum mechanical effects . "
In the new study , researchers used a microwave pulse to attempt to entangle the electrical currents of the two superconductors .
If the currents were quantum - mechanically linked , one current would flow clockwise at the time of measurement ( assigned a value of 0 ) , while the other would flow counterclockwise when measured ( assigned a value of 1 ) , Martinis says .
On the other hand , the currents ' directions would be completely independent of each other if everyday , classical physics were at work .
After attempting to entangle the superconducting circuits , Martinis and his team measured the directions of the currents 34.1 million times .
When one current flowed clockwise ( measured as a 0 ) , the team found , the other flowed counterclockwise ( measured as a 1 ) with very high probability .
So the two were linked in a way that only quantum mechanics could explain .
" It has to be in this weird quantum state for you to get those particular probabilities that we measure , " Martinis says .
" The percentages of those different things are not something that you can classically predict . "
Finding entanglement between superconductors is " a fairly important milestone , " comments Anthony Leggett of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
The new study " does seem to be rather unambiguous evidence for entanglement . "
Such entangled superconductors might be used as a component in a powerful quantum computer , Leggett says .
" People are very interested in the possibility of building a quantum computer , " and these kinds of systems may be quite good for that , he says .
Martinis says that the technology for building advanced electrical circuits may be used to build quantum circuits , too .
" The hope is that since we know how to put together integrated circuits in complex ways , that maybe we can make very complex quantum circuits in the same way , " he says .
He cautions , though , that a good quantum computer is a long way off .
Researchers still need to find a way to make entangled superconducting circuits last longer .
And a good quantum computer would need more than two circuits .
Martinis says his group will try to entangle three and four such circuits next .
In addition to providing technological advances , the new results add to the debate over where to draw the line between quantum mechanics and the everyday physics that governs large - scale phenomena .
Researchers want to know how far quantum weirdness can go .
" It 's interesting to test quantum mechanics on a large scale , " Girvin says .
" Do things look classical on large scales because there 's something wrong with quantum mechanics ?
Personally , I think that 's wrong , but one never knows . "

In the latest inexplicable move to extricate the U.S. banking system from crisis , the FDIC is reportedly close to asking the very banks it regulates for a loan to top up its balances .
The plan is “ strongly supported by bankers and their lobbyists ” according to the New York Times .
Are you kidding me ?
This is the most preposterous thing I have heard yet .
How is the FDIC suppose to adequately regulate banks when it owes them money ?
If your looking for a textbook route to regulatory capture , I present you Exhibit A .
What ’s more is banks are restricting lending right now .
How is this going to help that situation ?
The New York Times , like the even - handed mainstream media outlet it is supposed to be , reports this story like it is something truly reasonable .
Tired of the government bailing out banks ?
Get ready for this : officials may soon ask banks to bail out the government .
Senior regulators say they are seriously considering a plan to have the nation ’s healthy banks lend billions of dollars to rescue the insurance fund that protects bank depositors .
That would enable the fund , which is rapidly running out of money because of a wave of bank failures , to continue to rescue the sickest banks .
The plan , strongly supported by bankers and their lobbyists , would be a major reversal of fortune .
A hallmark of the financial crisis has been the decision by successive administrations over the last year to lend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to large and small banks .
“ It ’s a nice irony , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics , a consulting company .
“ Like so much of this crisis , this is an issue that involves the least worst options . ”
Bankers and their lobbyists like the idea because it is more attractive than the alternatives : yet another across - the - board emergency assessment on them , or tapping an existing $ 100 billion credit line to the Treasury .
No , bankers like this idea because it makes the regulator beholden to the regulated .
Am I wrong or is this the worst idea you have heard since this crisis began ?

SEPTEMBER 22 --A postal worker who stole more than 3000 DVDs mailed by Netflix to its customers pleaded guilty yesterday to federal theft charges .
Myles Weathers , who worked at a mail processing and distribution center in Springfield , Massachusetts , was nabbed last year for the video heist after Netflix officials became suspicious about the frequency with which DVDs were being pinched .
Weathers , 49 , was subsequently arrested after surveillance footage showed him removing DVDs from Netflix envelopes and placing the discs into his backpack .
This criminal information filed yesterday in U.S. District Court does not disclose whether Weathers was building an impressive home video library or planning to sell the hot titles .
A plea agreement , an excerpt of which you 'll find here , valued the recovered 3012 DVDs at $ 36,471 .
Weathers , now a former government employee , is scheduled to be sentenced on December 23 .
While his felony plea carries a maximum of five years in prison , sentencing guidelines call for a term of about a year in custody .

Oops , he did it again .
CNN ’s John Roberts , co-host of the cable news network ’s American Morning program , continues to decide what the appropriate spin is for a story in his intros to interviews .
He did it earlier this week with correspondent Christiane Amanpour , who stuck to facts instead .
This morning , Mr. Roberts did it again while introducing Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times .
Said Mr. Roberts :
Joining us now is New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof .
His article , “ Tear Down This Cyber Wall ” focuses on Iran and the technology war of information .
So many people are saying that this could be the very first Internet revolution .
How much of a part do you think the Internet is playing in what ’s going on inside Iran versus what we ’re learning about what ’s going on ?
[ emphasis added ]
Mr. Roberts has a penchant for advancing a premise based on the apparent testimony of a teeming slew of unidentified sources .
He told Mr. Kristof : “ So many people are saying that this … ” Earlier this week , he used similar language while introducing Ms. Amanpour : “ some people might say … ” Well , says who ?
Who are these people to whom Mr. Roberts refers ?
Mr. Kristof politely rejected Mr. Roberts ’ conjecture with a tad more insight :
I would n’t call it an Internet revolution .
I mean , fundamentally , people are protesting because they ’re upset about the government , and that ’s been happening for hundreds and hundreds of years .
Mr. Kristof explained , from his point of view , the role of the Internet during Iranian unrest without labeling that role as a “ revolution . ”
Television news , as we know , places a premium on brevity .
( How ironic for a 24 - hour cable news operation , eh ? )
Anchors and reporters need to summarize ( in what print journalists might call a “ nut ” or background graf ) salient information prior to a video report or interview .
Mr. Roberts could have done that in the same amount of time .
Rather than offering an opinion masked as a leading question for his witness , he could have not said “ So many people are saying that this ” and just asked :
Mr. Kristof , would you tell our viewers your perceptions of the use of the Internet during the unrest in Iran ?
Instead , he used a meme — Internet revolution — that places more emphasis and focus on the Internet itself rather than the actual unrest and violence it has transmitted .
Broadcast anchors used to know the difference between a fair summation of necessary background and a hurriedly contrived spin from the anchor ’s point of view .
( Or , perhaps , the producer ’s .
I do not know if Mr. Roberts ’ intros are scripted by someone else . )
Then again , the ratings have not been kind to CNN in the first quarter of 2009 .
Perhaps that explains the increased use of conjecture by one of CNN ’s principal on - air anchors .

Here 's an interesting clip from a National Geographic documentary that compares the way humans and chimpanzees learn .
When asked to perform a series of motions in order to get a treat out of a box , the human child will copy the adult 's motions exactly .
The ape copies the motions as well , until the box is replaced with a translucent version .
Once it is , the ape realizes that half of the motions are pointless and takes a shortcut to get the treat ; children , on the other hand , continue to do the meaningless motions that they were taught .
According to the filmmakers , this illustrates how both humans and chimps learn through copying , but children are " better " at it .
That very well may be .
But should n't the chimps should be given props for problem - solving here ?
Experiments like this always drive me a bit crazy because the social setup is n't exactly parallel .
Children are being asked to copy other humans , whereas the apes are expected to follow a different species .
Would children be as good at copying ( or obeying ) if chimps were the ones giving instructions ?
Of course , even if chimps were asked to imitate older chimps , they probably would n't copy as precisely as the children , and that 's ultimately the filmmakers ' point .
The children are able to see rote repetition as the point of a game whereas the chimp might only be able to grasp " getting the treat . "
Corporations will soon face fines of up to $ 2.2 million for water theft from the Murray .
The South Australian Government is increasing the penalties for water theft .
Fines of $ 700,000 for individuals will be 20 times higher than before and the fine for corporations jumps from a current maximum of $ 70,000 .
SA Environment Minister Jay Weatherill says the penalties will be the nation 's toughest .
He says the SA Government will push for a national standard at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting .
" South Australia is being unreasonably depleted by the behaviour of the upstream states , " he said .
" We take 7 per cent of the waters of the River Murray , 93 per cent of it disappears upstream and that 's exacerbated by water theft that we 're receiving reports about in the upstream states .
" We want to send this very clear message , not only to our water users in South Australia but any water users of the rivers of this nation . "
Blow to head ?
Drink up !:
You could probably figure out the topic despite the medicalese in the title : " Positive Serum Ethanol Level and Mortality in Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury . "
The study is a retrospective one , based on identifying a set of patients in trauma centers who had been diagnosed with severe brain injuries .
Not surprisingly , a number of them had been drinking .
The surprise was that the folks with alcohol in the bloodstream had a better survival rate than those who had n't had a drink , even after correcting for some potential confounding factors .
As always , further studies are suggested before we start dispensing vodka shots in the ER .
Balancing the checkbook as a diagnostic tool :
Here 's another potential medical tool , this one diagnostic .
Many elderly adults suffer from mild cognitive impairment , but only some of them progress to full - blown dementia .
A year - long longitudinal study suggests a potential diagnostic indicator : basic financial competence .
Anyone suffering from mild impairment wound up performing below controls in a test called the Financial Capacity Instrument , but those who were diagnosed as suffering from dementia at the end of the year did much worse , and had problems with financial concepts , cash transactions , bank statement management , and bill payment .
The mythos of poor purchase decisions :
Apparently , we mythologize the items we buy in order to make ourselves feel better about things that might otherwise seem like character flaws .
That 's the conclusion of some researchers that checked in with owners of an item that might otherwise be pretty hard to justify : the Hummer H2 , which represents conspicuous consumption and environmental rapaciousness at a time where both of those seem badly off - key .
The paper 's authors even point out there 's a website called fuh2.com , dedicated to photos of people giving the vehicle the finger .
So , how do H2 owners live with themselves ?
Quite easily , it turns out , as they latch onto the American mythology of a rugged frontier , and decide that their Hummer purchase is a defense of that .
In fact , they revel in feeling under siege , and view themselves as " moral protagonists , " according to the authors , who go on to write , " consumers use this mythic structure to transform their ideological beliefs into dramatic narratives of identity . "
Our era just is n't what it used to be :
In fact , it 's quite a bit bigger , 800,000 years bigger , to be exact .
We 're living in the Quaternary portion of the Cenezoic , which had been given a start date of 1.8 million years ago .
Unfortunately , that did n't seem to line up with any major geological or biological event , leaving it seeming a bit arbitrary and difficult to pin down .
Now , the International Union of Geological Sciences has decided to shift it to 2.58 million years ago , to correspond roughly with the emergence of humans on the planet .
To an extent , all this really indicates is that the natural world does n't fit nicely into binary categories , leaving humans struggling to put labels on it ( parallels with the status of Pluto should be obvious ) .
You can forget words , but not the language : Children learn languages much more readily than adults , but if contact with the language is lost , knowledge will completely fade .
But it turns out the capacity to recognize it wo n't .
Hindi and Zulu have some basic phonetic components that do n't appear in English , making it difficult for English speakers to recognize some words .
Researchers tested some people in the UK that had contact with these languages when young , but had n't seen it in so long , they flunked basic vocabulary tests .
It turns out they could still pick up the phonetic differences that their peers would miss .

The House Administration Committee has unanimously approved a resolution directing the Architect of the Capitol to engrave the National Motto — “ In God We Trust ” – and the Pledge of Allegiance inside the new Capitol Visitor Center ( CVC ) . … Last September , [ Senator ]
DeMint criticized the visitor center , which he said “ generally ignores ” the role of faith in the founding – and life – of the nation .
“ There are a few articles in the CVC that reflect elements of faith — two Bibles , a picture of the congressional nondenominational faith space , and the oath of office — but I believe they grossly understate the prominent role of faith and Judeo Christian values in the history of this great building ” he said in a statement , ” he said .
I ’ve never understood how a person could argue that using “ In God We Trust ” as a national motto is constitutional .
It rather bluntly establishes that the government acknowledges the existence of God , and believes that such a God is worthy of trust .
The best excuse ( and quite bad , at that ) is that such expressions are ceremonial deism – which Supreme Court Justice Brennan wrote in a dissent are “ protected from Establishment Clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content . ”
He continued by saying :
Moreover , these references are uniquely suited to serve such wholly secular purposes as solemnizing public occasions , or inspiring commitment to meet some national challenge in a manner that simply could not be fully served in our culture if government were limited to purely nonreligious phrases .
That ’s simply ridiculous .
I ’ve been to enough Ethical Culture platforms to know that life can be significant and solemn on its own without invoking the supernatural .
We do n’t even have to go back very far for examples – our original national motto was the brilliant “ E Pluribus Unum ” .
Personally , I ’m pushing for “ So Say We All ” to become a common ceremonial expression .
…
Hemant adds : I had written something up after this was posted , so I ’m deleting my posting and just adding on to Jesse ’s post .
Sorry for any confusion !
Take a look at H. Con. Res. 131 :
Directing the Architect of the Capitol to engrave the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag and the National Motto of “ In God We Trust ” in the Capitol Visitor Center .
In other words , they ’re Christianizing the Capitol .
While Republican Rep. Daniel Lungren is the sponsor of the bill , keep it mind it was unanimously approved by the House Administration Committee , made up of six Democrats and three Republicans .
“ While the Capitol Visitor Center did a good job in incorporating many elements , I believe there are two important ( items ) that were absent — the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ‘ In God We Trust , ’ ” Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - Calif . ) said Wednesday .
“ I am pleased that this resolution remedies this oversight and incorporates those important parts of our national heritage into the CVC , ” Lungren added .
Here ’s what I would n’t mind seeing engraved :
The original , though unofficial , motto of the U.S. : E pluribus unum ( “ Out of many , One ” ) and the original “ Pledge of Allegiance ” ( sans “ Under God ” ) .
The resolution still has to pass through the House and the Senate … but it already has 89 co-sponsors — every single one of whom is Republican .
Let ’s hope the Democrats can take a stand and keep the Capitol building religiously neutral .

The jaw - dropping front - row spectacle of wildfire devouring Canadian mountains
Advertisement
When nature has unleashed its worst , sometimes there 's nothing you can do but sit back and watch .
And that 's exactly what this group of helicopter pilots did - pulling up chairs to fully take in the fury of a forest fire devouring large swathes of the Canadian province of British Columbia .
The pilots were watching as a controlled fire burned on Mount McLean in the Canadian province of British Columbia in a desperate attempt to reduce the amount of fuel for a wildfire burning on the mountain in the town of Lillooet .
Pull up a pew : Helicopter pilots watch helplessly as a controlled fire burns on Mount McLean in British Columbia yesterday

Over 2,500 people were forced from their homes as a fire raged less than a mile ( 1.6 kilometres ) away .
Another 120 in nearby Brooksmere were also evacuated .
In all , 3,000 people have been evacuated since Sunday and 85 per cent of British Columbia remains on high alert as lighting strikes and tinder - dry forests continue to fuel the wildfires on Canada 's Pacific coast .
British Columbia Forest Service spokeswoman Alyson Couch said Monday conditions remain hot and dry .
She said extra fire - fighters from across Canada , and some from Australia , are joining those already in the forests .

Couch said people have been asked to stay out of the back country to cut the risk of human - caused blazes .
Authorities have banned campfires and open burning across British Columbia .
The fires caused a drop in tourist numbers two weeks ago but tourism had been returning to normal , said Catherine Frechette , a tourism spokeswoman in the worst hit region .
Since April , 2,200 fires have torched 170,171 acres ( 68,867 hectares ) compared to 1,066 that burned 27,170 acres ( 11,000 hectares ) last year .
Provincial Premier Gordon Campbell said the wildfire risk is at the highest level in recent memory .
The province has endured a heat wave for several weeks .

Most fires are being caused by lightning strikes , Couch said .
It could be at least Wednesday before fire - fighters can expect any reprieve from the weather with some rain forecast .
On Monday , there were 33 ' wildfires of note ' burning throughout the province .
Many of them left nearby residents on evacuation alerts .
The evacuations of Lillooet and Brooksmere came two weeks after 11,000 were forced to flee their homes near West Kelowna .
In 2003 , lightning strikes near Kelowna triggered a fire that scorched 96 square miles ( 248 sq. kilometres ) , destroyed more than 200 homes and caused millions of dollars in property damage .

His newest , ( Sundays at 8:30 P.M. on Fox ) , aspin - off about the black neighbors , premieres September 27 .
After showing up late for a Sunday brunch at Nate 'n Al 's deli in Beverly Hills , MacFarlane ordered an American - cheese omelet and chocolate - chip pancakes .
ESQUIRE : You 're an hour late .
I hope you have a good excuse .
SETH MACFARLANE : Sorry , I drank too much and I overslept .
I 'm a 35 - year - old man .
It 's a horrible excuse .
ESQ : I drank too much last night , too , but I managed to get here on time .
So tell me about The Cleveland Show .
SM : [ Snoring noises . ]
ESQ : Wake up .
SM : Well , The Cleveland Show is a spin- off .
ESQ : Like The Jeffersons ?
SM : Yes , it 's our Jeffersons .
The show is meant to be sort of a showcase for [ Family Guy writer and voice actor and white person ]
Mike Henry , whom I 've known since college .
He cocreated it .
His comedy is very unique .
ESQ : How so ?
SM : He grew up in Virginia , so he 's got that background .
He really understands the , uh , the nature of the , uh —
ESQ : Stupid hick ?
Speaking of which , I see you 've recently become rather vocal about your atheism .
Is n't it antithetical to make public proclamations about secularism ?
SM : We have to .
Because of all the mysticism and stuff that 's gotten so popular .
ESQ : But when you wave banners , how does it differ from religion ?
SM : It 's like the civil - rights movement .
There have to be people who are vocal about the advancement of knowledge over faith .
ESQ : Right , but I think I 'll still try The Secret .
Oprah raves about it .
SM : I can't make any distinction in my mind between her and Dr. Phil .
ESQ : Why would you ?
I distrust all television doctors .
SM : Dr. Drew is the one guy —
ESQ : Dr. Drew is the most dangerous man in America .
SM : I think he 's the real deal .
He lacks an arrogance that the others have .
I think his conscience is intact .
ESQ : You do n't think Dr. Drew sits in production meetings all day long and talks about how best to advance the Jeff Conaway story arc ?
You think that 's in the Hippocratic oath somewhere ?
SM : I 've never seen that show .
I do Loveline a lot , and I see his dedication to his practice .
He 's such a nice guy .
ESQ : Oh , well , never mind .
He 's nice to you when you do Loveline .
SM : I 'll tell you what I think is not okay .
Have you ever seen that show on MSNBC , Lockup ?
It 's a reality show that takes place inside a prison .
Do the prisoners have to sign release forms ?
Or do they have to be on it whether they like it or not ?
ESQ : They probably sign releases , but they sign them in feces .
SM : That 's good .
You should use that .
ESQ : Maybe they think they might get a spin - off .
Anyway , what 's your favorite color ?
SM : Aw , come on , really ?
ESQ : Really .
I want to know .
SM : There 's no such thing as colors .
It 's just which parts of the spectrum are reflected against our retinas .
ESQ : I 'll just put " blue . "
Is it rude to call animation cartoons ?
SM : Only if you 're insecure .
ESQ : How much do you weigh ?
SM [ laughing ] : I hover somewhere between 180 and 185 .
ESQ : What 's your middle name ?
SM : Woodbury .
ESQ : How New England .
SM : That 's what we thought .
A lot of the men on my mother 's side of the family had the middle name Woodbury , and about ten years ago we asked my grandfather where it came from , and he said that when he was born in Gardiner , Maine , in 1904 , his mother thought that the town drunk was the funniest guy she 'd ever met , and his name was Woodbury , so we 're all named after not just a drunk , but a jolly turn - of - the - century drunk .
ESQ : Would you say that you 're a jolly turn - of - the - century drunk ?
SM : Hey !
Way to bring that one around !
ESQ : Thanks .
What 's your sign ?
SM : Well , that 's a complex question .
If you want to pretend for a moment that astrology is n't complete bullshit , when astrology was conceived , something like 2,000 years ago — I learned this from Carl Sagan —
ESQ : Noted atheist .
SM : Noted atheist , optimist , and essential popularizer of science , and we need another one of them .
ESQ : Your beloved Dr. Drew ?
SM : Maybe .
When astrology was conceived , all of the celestial bodies were in different places .
So if you 're a Sagittarius now , I guess you would have been a Capricorn 2,000 years ago .
ESQ : You 're the first person I 've ever asked that of , so you must feel honored .
SM [ laughing ] :
Because you 're grasping at straws ?
ESQ : At least I was on time .
SM : I know .
I 'm just being a dick .
ESQ : But what a jolly one .

Such buildings , by the way , are not the only structures that could house vertical farms .
Farms of various dimensions and crop yields could be built into a variety of urban settings  from schools , restaurants and hospitals to the upper floors of apartment complexes .
By supplying a continuous quantity of fresh vegetables and fruits to city dwellers , these farms would help combat health problems , like Type II diabetes and obesity , that arise in part from the lack of quality produce in our diet .
The list of benefits is long .
Vertical farms would produce crops year - round that contain no agro-chemicals .
Fish and poultry could also be raised indoors .
The farms would greatly reduce fossil - fuel use and greenhouse - gas emissions , since they would eliminate the need for heavy farm machinery and trucks that deliver food from farm to fork .
( Would n’t it be great if everything on your plate came from around the corner , rather than from hundreds to thousands of miles away ? )
Vertical farming could finally put an end to agricultural runoff , a major source of water pollution .
Crops would never again be destroyed by floods or droughts .
New employment opportunities for vertical farm managers and workers would abound , and abandoned city properties would become productive once again .
Vertical farms would also make cities more pleasant places to live .
The structures themselves would be things of beauty and grace .
In order to allow plants to capture passive sunlight , walls and ceilings would be completely transparent .
So from a distance , it would look as if there were gardens suspended in space .
City dwellers would also be able to breathe easier  quite literally .
Vertical farms would bring a great concentration of plants into cities .
These plants would absorb carbon dioxide produced by automobile emissions and give off oxygen in return .
So imagine you wanted to build the first vertical farm and put it in New York City .
What would it take ?
We have the technology  now we need money , political will and , of course , proof that this concept can work .
That ’s why a prototype would be a good place to start .
I estimate that constructing a five - story farm , taking up one - eighth of a square city block , would cost $ 20 million to $ 30 million .
Part of the financing should come from the city government , as a vertical farm would go a long way toward achieving Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s goal of a green New York City by 2030 .
Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer has already expressed interest in having a vertical farm in the city .
City officials should be interested .
If a farm is located where the public can easily visit it , the iconic building could generate significant tourist dollars , on top of revenue from the sales of its produce .
But most of the financing should come from private sources , including groups controlling venture - capital funds .
The real money would flow once entrepreneurs and clean - tech investors realize how much profit there is to be made in urban farming .
Imagine a farm in which crop production is not limited by seasons or adverse weather events .
Sales could be made in advance because crop-production levels could be guaranteed , thanks to the predictable nature of indoor agriculture .
An actual indoor farm developed at Cornell University growing hydroponic lettuce was able to produce as many as 68 heads per square foot per year .
At a retail price in New York of up to $ 2.50 a head for hydroponic lettuce , you can easily do the math and project profitability for other similar crops .
When people ask me why the world still does not have a single vertical farm , I just raise my eyebrows and shrug my shoulders .
Perhaps people just need to see proof that farms can grow several stories high .
As soon as the first city takes that leap of faith , the world ’s first vertical farm could be less than a year away from coming to the aid of a hungry , thirsty world .
Not a moment too soon .

Ofsted inspectors in England have been told by ministers to show " common sense " in interpreting laws on friends helping each other with childcare .
Two mothers had been told it was illegal to look after each others ' children without being registered .
The reciprocal arrangement had been seen as providing a " reward " .
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said childcare rules were not intended to " interfere in informal arrangements " .
Ministers are trying to clear up confusion over the regulations in England covering parents who help each other with childcare and babysitting .
But so far there is no new guidance on the regulations introduced in 2006 - which appear to require compulsory registration for parents who have a regular after - school arrangement for looking after each others ' children .
' Shocked '
In Buckinghamshire two mothers , both police officers , were told by children 's services watchdog Ofsted that they were breaking the law by caring for each others ' children without undergoing registration and checks .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme
The two detective constables , Leanne Shepherd , from Milton Keynes , and Lucy Jarrett , from Buckingham , told the BBC how Ofsted insisted they end their arrangement .
Ms Shepherd said : " A lady came to the front door and she identified herself as being from Ofsted .
She said a complaint had been made that I was illegally childminding .
" I was just shocked - I thought they were a bit confused about the arrangement between us .
" So I invited her in and told her situation - the arrangement between Lucy and I - and I was shocked when she told me I was breaking the law . "
' Reward '
The accusation was that the reciprocal arrangement represented a " reward " - and as such the mothers would have to be formally registered as providers of child care .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families has been arguing that this is not how the Childcare Act introduced three years ago should be interpreted .
In particular , it wants a different view of what represents a " reward " .
The law makes no distinction between the financial reward gained by someone paid to look after children and the reward in time and convenience gained by families who have private arrangements to help each other with childcare .
" Reward is not just a case of money changing hands .
The supply of services or goods and in some circumstances reciprocal arrangements can also constitute reward , " says Ofsted .
A spokesman for the children 's department said it was now " working with Ofsted on their interpretation of the word ' reward ' . "
" We must ensure a common sense and measured approach which does not penalise informal arrangements but retains a balance between over - regulation and protecting children . "
' Bureaucracy gone mad '
Ofsted only operates in England , so this interpretation of the law on childcare for " reward " applies to England rather than elsewhere in the UK .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This case highlights a total disconnect between the lawmakers of this country and what is custom and practice nationwide David Campbell , Cheshire Under the complex childcare rules , it is illegal for an unregistered parent to collect someone else 's child from school and look after them for more than two hours , if this is a reciprocal arrangement and so providing a " reward " .
This would mean that after - school play - dates - where families helped each other by taking home each others ' children on different days - would not be permissible without registration and inspections .
There are exemptions for this - allowing relatives to look after children in their family and the restrictions do no apply if children are in their own home or between the hours of 6 pm and 2 am .
The suggestion that it would be illegal for friends to help each other with childcare has provoked an angry response .
Michele Elliott , director of children 's charity Kidscape , said the decision defied common sense and would impose extra childcare costs on families .
She described the rules as " bureaucracy gone mad " .
Siobhan Freegard , who founded the parents ' networking website Netmums , said that hard - pressed parents would think " this is the last straw " .
This dispute over child care regulations follows recent controversy when it emerged that a forthcoming child protection vetting scheme will mean more than 11 million adults in England will have to undergo checks .
There was widespread hostility to the extent of the plan - and Children 's Secretary Ed Balls announced a review .

Erfolgsmodell Wahl - O- Mat : " Stimme nicht zu "
Dieses Wochende wird der neue Wahl - O - Mat entwickelt .
Jugendlichen gibt er oft eine Wahlempfehlung .
Das soll er gar nicht - sondern bloß Lust machen auf Politik .
BERLIN taz | Bei Charlottes erstem Kreuzchen half eine virtuelle orange Kiste .
Bevor die 18 - jährige Schülerin aus Berlin - Tempelhof bei der Europawahl für eine Partei stimmte , befragte sie mit ihren Freundinnen den Wahl - O - Mat im Internet .
Am Ende entschied sich Charlotte für die Partei , die dabei am besten abgeschnitten hatte .
Dabei soll der Wahl - O - Mat eigentlich keine Wahlempfehlung abgeben .
Stattdessen will er " Lust auf Politik und Wahlen machen " .
Um dies auch für die Bundestagswahl zu erreichen , trifft sich dieses Wochenende in Bonn eine Redaktion , um die politischen Aussagen für den 27 .
September zu formulieren .
Anfang September , so der Plan , geht der neue Wahl - O - Mat dann online .
Doch wer steht hinter dem Projekt , das bei der letzten Bundestagswahl bereits über 5 Millionen Mal genutzt wurde - und offenbar vor allem Jugendliche bei der Wahlentscheidung beeinflusst ?
" Es ist ein Projekt von Jugendlichen für Jugendliche " , sagt Stefan Trinius , der den Wahl - O - Mat für die Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung ( BpB ) betreut .
" Es geht uns ja darum , Politikinhalte verständlich zu formulieren . "
22 Erst - und Zweitwähler helfen mit , betreut werden sie von fünf Wissenschaftlern , die bei Fragen zu den Parteiprogrammen zur Verfügung stehen .
Die Thesen , etwa " Atomkraftwerke abschaffen " oder " Wahlrecht ab 16 " gehen an die Parteien .
Gemäß deren Positionen kann man im Wahl - O - Mat dann " stimme zu " , " stimme nicht zu " oder " neutral " anklicken .
Vorrangiges Ziel des Wahl - O - Mat sei es , Interesse zu wecken und die Quote der Nichtwähler zu verringern .
Glaubt man Trinius , gelingt dies .
Etwa 10 Prozent der potenziellen Nichtwähler überlegen sich nach der Nutzung , doch ihre Stimme abzugeben .
Und " 70 Prozent erkennen durch das Programm , welche Themen im Wahlkampf wichtig sind " , sagt Trinius .
Trotzdem nutzen viele Jugendliche den Wahl - O - Mat zur direkten Wahlentscheidung .
Dies sei eine Schwäche des Programms , sagt auch die Studentin Lisi Maier , die bereits zum vierten Mal ehrenamtlich in der Redaktion mitarbeitet .
" Vielleicht sollte man noch stärker betonen , dass es keine Empfehlung ist " , sagt die 24 - Jährige .
Für den Politikwissenschaftler Stefan Marschall von der Universität Siegen ist der Wahl - O - Mat ein Erfolgsmodell .
Eine Schwierigkeit sei es , komplexe
Thesen zu vereinfachen .
" Man muss aufpassen und populistische Thesen verhindern . "
Deshalb landen am Ende auch nur die Thesen im Wahl - O - Mat , bei denen sich die Antworten der Parteien klar unterscheiden .
Ganz kann damit Unehrlichkeit nicht ausgeschlossen werden , gibt Lisi Maier zu : " Wir können nicht wissen , ob die Parteien ihr Programm umsetzen , wenn sie an der Regierung sind . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner blasted top U.S. regulators in an expletive - laden tirade amid frustration over President Barack Obama ’s faltering plan to overhaul financial regulation , the Wall Street Journal said on Monday , citing people familiar with the meeting .
Geithner told regulators that “ enough is enough , ” the newspaper said , citing one person familiar with the meeting last Friday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair .
The Treasury Secretary said regulators had been given a chance to air their concerns , but that it was time to stop , the newspaper said , citing the person .
A Treasury Department representative had no immediate comment .
The Fed , the SEC and the FDIC did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
Obama in June unveiled a financial regulatory overhaul , sometimes called the biggest since the 1930s .
Among other things , the plan would give the Fed added powers , award the government more power to break up troubled companies , and create a new agency to oversee consumer finance .
Many major banks and industry trade groups however have criticized the plan , as have some regulators wary that any redistribution of power would reduce their own .
According to the newspaper , Friday ’s roughly hour - long meeting was unusual because of Geithner ’s repeated obscenities and his aggressive posture toward regulators generally deemed independent of the White House .
The newspaper said Geithner told attendees that the administration and Congress set policy .
It also said the Treasury Secretary , without singling out officials , raised concerns about regulators who have questioned the wisdom of giving the Fed more power .
Schapiro and Bair have argued that more authority should be shared among a council of regulators .

El Castillo ’s musical steps ( Image : Mark Harris / Stone / Getty )
SIT on the steps of Mexico ’s El Castillo pyramid in Chichen Itza and you may hear a confusing sound .
As other visitors climb the colossal staircase their footsteps begin to sound like raindrops falling into a bucket of water as they near the top .
Were the Mayan temple builders trying to communicate with their gods ?
The discovery of the raindrop “ music ” in another pyramid suggests that at least some of Mexico ’s pyramids were deliberately built for this purpose .
Some of the structures consist of a combination of steps and platforms , while others , like El Castillo , resemble the more even - stepped Egyptian pyramids . …

A DOD whistleblower detail an attempt by a covert U. S. team to plant weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
The team was later killed by friendly fire due to CIA incompetence .
Pentagon Whistleblower Reveals CIA / DoD Fiascos
http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2003/06/266752.shtml
20.06.2003 [ 08:07 ]
In a world exclusive , Al Martin Raw .
com has published a news story about a Department of Defense whistleblower who has revealed that a US covert operations team had planted " Weapons of Mass Destruction " ( WMDs ) in Iraq – then " lost " them when the team was killed by so - called " friendly fire . "
The Pentagon whistleblower , Nelda Rogers , is a 28 - year veteran debriefer for the Defense Department .
She has become so concerned for her safety that she decided to tell the story about this latest CIA - military fiasco in Iraq .
According to Al Martin Raw. com , " Ms. Rogers is number two in the chain of command within this DoD special intelligence office .
This is a ten - person debriefing unit within the central debriefing office for the Department of Defense .
The information that is being leaked out is information " obtained while she was in Germany heading up the debriefing of returning service personnel , involved in intelligence work in Iraq for the Department of Defense and / or the Central Intelligence Agency .
" According to Ms. Rogers , there was a covert military operation that took place both preceding and during the hostilities in Iraq , " reports Al Martin Raw .
com , an online subscriber - based news / analysis service which provides " Political , Economic and Financial Intelligence . "
Al Martin is a retired Lt. Commander ( US Navy ) , the author of a memoir called " The Conspirators : Secrets of an Iran Contra Insider , " and he is considered one of America 's foremost experts on corporate and government fraud .
Ms. Rogers reports that this particular covert operation team was manned by ex-military personnel and that " the unit was paid through the Department of Agriculture in order to hide it , which is also very commonplace . "
According to Al Martin Raw. com , " the Ag Department has often been used as a paymaster on behalf of the CIA , DIA , and NSA and others . "
Accordng to the Al Martin Raw . com story , another aspect of Ms. Rogers ' report concerns a covert operation which was to locate the assets of Saddam Hussein and his family , including cash , gold bullion , jewelry and assorted valuable antiquities .
The problem became evident when " the operation in Iraq involved 100 people , all of whom apparently are now dead , having succumbed to so - called `friendly fire . '
The scope of this operation included the penetration of the Central Bank of Iraq , other large commercial banks in Baghdad , the Iraqi National Museum and certain presidential palaces where monies and bullion were secreted . "
" They identified about $ 2 billion of cash in US dollars , another $ 150 million in Euros , in physical banknotes , and about another $ 100 million in sundry foreign currencies ranging from Yen to British Pounds , " reports Al Martin .
" These people died , mostly in the same place in Baghdad , supposedly from a stray cruise missile or a combination of missiles and bombs that went astray , " Martin continues .
" There were supposedly 76 who died there and the other 24 died through a variety of ' friendly fire , ' ' mistaken identity , ' and some of them – their whereabouts are simply unknown . "
Ms. Rogers ' story sound like an updated 21st Century version of Treasure Island meets Ali Baba and the Bush Cabal Thieves , writes Martin .
" This was a contingent of CIA / DoD operatives , but it was really the CIA that bungled it , Ms. Rogers said .
They were relying on the CIA 's ability to organize an effort to seize these assets and to be able to extract these assets because the CIA claimed it had resources on the ground within the Iraqi army and the Iraqi government who had been paid .
That turned out to be completely bogus .
As usual . "
" CIA people were supposed to be handling it , " Martin continues .
" They had a special `black ( unmarked ) aircraft to fly it out .
But none of that happened because the regular US Army showed up , stumbled onto it and everyone involved had to scramble
These new Iraqi " Asset Seizures " go directly to the New US Ruling Junta .
The US Viceroy in Iraq Paul Bremer is reportedly drinking Saddam Hussein's $ 2000 a bottle Napoleon era brandy , smoking his expensive Davidoff cigars and he has even furnished his Baghdad office with Saddam 's Napolean era antique furniture
The Iraq Debacle Du Jour has evidently been extensively documented by the DIA debriefing teams with " extensive tape recordings of interviews with the Iraqi returnees , the covert operatives ( as well as their affidavits ) . "
Al Martin Raw . com has dubbed this " Operation Skim Iraq . "
One of the core goals of the MVC architecture is to separate the presentation of a model from its implementation and semantics .
And yet Rails , out of the box , takes the representation of models — even the names of tables and columns in the database — right through to the user .
The default behavior , for form labels and other places where models and attributes are referred to , is simply to use the name of the model or attribute .
Does this mean Rails ' implementation of MVC is broken ?
Not at all !
My favorite definition of " architecture " in software is " the set of decisions that will be hard to change later . "
And the best architectures are the ones that keep that set small , allowing developers to move quickly without fear of being boxed - in later in the project .
Rails uses its default behavior to let you move quickly , but leaves your options open for changing that behavior later .
I think Rails ' defaults work really well in most cases .
After all , we should be working with a domain language that we share with customers and domain experts , so it 's likely that our schema and models will use names that are appropriate for presentation .
Nevertheless , it 's common to reach a point where the user interface needs to use different terms for some of the domain concepts .
So let 's see how Rails can help .
Assume we 've developed the " canonical " Rails application , a blogging engine .
The primary model is called Post , and each post has a title and body .
And then , the customer decides that the users will prefer writing " articles " rather than " posts " , and " headlines " instead of " titles " .
What can we do ?
Breaking the Link : The Obvious Ways
The most obvious , brute - force solution is to avoid the defaults , instead supplying literal names in all of our views .
While there are places where it will be appropriate to supply literal labels , this option should be reserved for specific places where the context requires a different label .
Using this approach to change labels throughout the application would be way too much work , and create a maintenance nightmare .
You could actually change your model — rename the table , or column , along with every place that name appears in your Ruby code .
But that approach would be tedious and error - prone if the name were central to your model .
More importantly , it would be a mistake to change the domain model understood by those involved in the project just to satisfy presentation constraints .
It 's at this point that the MVC architecture needs to pull its weight by helping you deal with this problem .
Digging a little deeper , you realize that the places in ActionView that use model and attribute names ( e.g. , the label helper ) transform them to " human " form first , removing underscores , adding spaces , and capitalizing appropriately .
They do that by calling the human_name method ( for model names ) and human_attribute_name ( for attributes ) .
Every ActiveRecord model inherits those methods from ActiveRecord : : Base .
So one answer is to override those methods .
That 's much better than either of the other options , but it 's still not very good .
If you solve your problem this way , the model will be actively involved in presentation issues .
We want to work with the MVC architecture , not against it .
Breaking the Link : The Right Way
The answer to our problem can be found in the documentation for ActiveRecord : : Base#human_attribute_name :
This used to be depricated in favor of humanize , but is now preferred , because it automatically uses the I18n module now .
We can use Rails ' internationalization support to supply the new names we want to present to users .
Think about your current problem as specifying the English localization for your application .
If it 's not already there , create the file config / locales / en.yml , with the following contents :
en : activerecord : models : post : " Article " attributes : post : title : " Headline "
Under the en.activerecord key there are two sections that define presentation names for the locale : models contains names for models , and attributes contains names for … well , I think you get the idea .
So in our example , the new name for a post is " Article " , and the new name for a post 's title is " Headline " .
Note that you specify attribute names in the context of a model class , so if there were another title attribute in your system on a different model class , it would not be affected .
Suddenly , throughout your application , those changes will take effect .
You can still supply different labels in particular contexts as needed , but the default is to use the names in the locale file .
Update :
As commenter Tim Watson pointed out , it 's not currently automatic everywhere .
It does automatically happen in error messages , but not in labels ( making labels handle this automatically is planned for an upcoming Rails point release ) .
You can supply the proper label text on your own ( using the human_attribute_name method ) .
If you 're using custom FormBuilders , you can easily encapsulate this change ; otherwise , see commenter Priit Tamboom 's solution for doing a quick monkeypatch of the label helper until Rails handles it properly .
As you may have gathered from the documentation excerpt above , you should use Post.human_attribute_name ( ' title ' ) instead of calling humanize on an attribute name when writing views .
Likewise , you should use post.class.human_name rather than post.class.name.humanize or the literal ' Post ' for model class names .
Also , associations are treated as attributes , rather than inheriting the new name of their target model .
So if some model had an association to multiple posts , you would need to define an attribute renaming in the appropriate model ; it would not automatically be called " Articles " .
Finally , this approach does n't deal with controller names in URLs ; for that , you should modify the routes in config / routes.rb .
More To Come
There 's more to this story , because there 's another place where your models peek through into the user interface in undesirable ways .
I 'll address that in a follow - up post .
Cash For Clunkers is an economically unsound program that will only make the American economic situation worse .
It transfers wealth from one group of people to another while simultaneously destroying real wealth and misallocating scarce capital away from its best use .
To understand why this is , you need only understand the Broken Window Fallacy .
Frederic Bastiat originally formulated the Broken Window Fallacy in his landmark book That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen .
Henry Hazlitt then expounded and reformulated it for a more modern audience in his classic work , Economics in One Lesson ( which was one of our 31 top resources for small business owners and employees ) .
In Chapter 2 , entitled “ The Broken Window , ” Hazlitt wrote :
A young hoodlum , say , heaves a brick through the window of a baker ’s shop .
The shopkeeper runs out furious , but the boy is gone .
A crowd gathers , and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies .
After a while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection .
And several of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that , after all , the misfortune has its bright side .
It will make business for some glazier .
As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon it .
How much does a new plate glass window cost ?
Two hundred and fifty dollars ?
That will be quite a sun .
After all , if windows were never broken , what would happen to the glass business ?
Then , of course , the thing is endless .
The glazier will have $ 250 more to spend with other merchants , and these in turn will have $ 250 more to spend with still other merchants , and so ad infinitum .
The smashed window will go on providing money and employment in ever - widening circles .
The logical conclusion from all this would be , if the crowd drew it , that the little hoodlum who threw the brick , far from being a public menace , was a public benefactor .
Now let us take another look .
The crowd is at least right in its first conclusion .
This little act of vandalism will in the first instance mean more business for some glazier .
The glazier will be no more unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death .
But the shopkeeper will be out $ 250 that he was planning to spend for a new suit .
Because he has had to replace the window , he will have to go without the suit ( or some equivalent need or luxury ) .
Instead of having a window and $ 250 he now has merely a window .
Or , as he was planning to buy the suit that very afternoon , instead of having both a window and a suit he must be content with the window and no suit .
If we think of him as part of the community , the community has lost a new suit that might otherwise have come into being , and is just that much poorer .
The glazier ’s gain of business , in short , is merely the tailor ’s loss of business .
No new “ employment ” has been added .
The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction , the baker and the glazier .
They had forgotten the potential third party involved , the tailor .
They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene .
They will see the new window in the next day or two .
They will never see the extra suit , precisely because it will never be made .
They see only what is immediately visible to the eye .
The Fallacy of the Broken Window exposes the lie that , as one Austrian Economist put it , “ the … destruction of wealth fuels its creation . ”
He then goes on to summarize the Fallacy and concludes :
You can see the absurdity of the position … when you take it to absurd extremes .
If the broken window really produces wealth , why not break all windows up and down the whole city block ?
Indeed , why not break doors and walls ?
Why not tear down all houses so that they can be rebuilt ?
Why not bomb whole cities so construction firms can get busy rebuilding ?
It is not a good thing to destroy wealth .
Bastiat puts it this way : “ Society loses the value of things which are uselessly destroyed . ”
But Big Government frequently peppers hammers us with the message that we must create new wealth by destroying old wealth !
And that ’s where Cars For Clunkers comes in .
Here ’s a quick summary of the program and where it goes wrong .
The Federal Government takes tax - dollars , or borrowed dollars ( to be paid back later through taxes ) , and offers to hand that money to people who will trade in pre - selected older cars ; the money is to be used toward buying a new car ; then the government takes the traded - in car off the road , and junks it , often by destroying the engine ; the “ subsidy ” given toward buying the new car ( for each trade - in ) is $ 3,500 - 4,500
If the value of the trade - in car is less than the $ 3,500 - 4,500 handed in trade value the government has overpaid for the car , despite that the government is about to junk it , thus ensuring that no value will be received in return .
If the value of the trade - in car is more than the $ 3,500 - 4,500 handed , the government still derives no value from the trade because it ’s not reselling it ; it ’s junking it and stripping it for salvageable parts ( which are minimal )
The net number of cars on the road remains the same ; maybe net emissions drop or maybe fuel - usage drops ( because of better fuel efficiency ) in the aggregate , but maybe not !
( more on that below )
So , in this new version of the Broken Window Fallacy , our modern - day Window Breakers are destroying drivable cars , then handing out confiscated or borrowed money to the people who are allowing their “ windows cars to be broken ” because other people are paying for these windows cars to be replaced with newer , better , sexier models !
They do this in the name of saving the environment from pollution , or saving on “ waste ” through fuel - efficiency , or preventing global - warming through reducing emissions , or whatever .
It really does n’t matter what justification they ’re using , it ’s wrong on several levels .
It destroys wealth by not letting these cars be used up over their useful life .
It destroys wealth by routing scarce resources into activities – in this case , car building – that would n’t otherwise take place , denying other industries access to those resources .
It destroys wealth by taking on liabilities , through borrowing , that have to be paid back later by taxpayers ( reducing their purchasing power in the future ) or by taxing them immediately ( reducing their purchasing power today ) .
Also , building the new cars emits all kinds things into the atmosphere and gobbles up energy in the production process !
So any gains in emission and efficiency are offset by that , too !
Guess what else proponents of this destruction are missing ?
They are oblivious to how the incentives will change future behavior .
These people traded in a car they ’ve been likely to drive less .
We can safely assume these cars did n’t get as good gas mileage or were older , “ clunkers ” , because they were targeted for these reasons .
These cars also may not have been driven at all , or driven rarely .
However , they ’ve been used to help people get a vehicle that they ’re now more likely to drive more frequently !!!
More driving means more emissions , even if the emission per unit of travel is less .
More driving means more fuel consumption , even if the fuel consumption per unit of travel is less .
See , when you change the incentives , you change the behavior .
The people who owned these traded in cars were incentivized to drive them less by having to pay more for a unit of travel , and by having to conserve the remaining life in the car , which may have been approaching the end of its life over the next 5 - 10 years .
Now ?
Not so much .
In fact , the New York Times reports , “ Michael Gerrard , director of Columbia Law School ’s Center for Climate Change Law , said in a statement that the cash - for - clunker program is not a cost - effective way to reduce fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions .
Any energy savings , he said , could take several years to realize , considering the time it takes the fuel savings from a new car to exceed the energy cost used to make it .
Who are the favored parties ?
The subsidized consumers , of course .
But also the favored industries , who have had their goods favored at the expense of other industries .
The government is n’t handing out money to go buy [ fill in the blank ] , yet they ’re siphoning off money and resources from a finite supply and putting it into one area , at the expense of other areas .
Think the Auto - Dealers liked it ?
Look at this :
“ It was an absolute success , ” said Michael J. Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation Inc. , the U.S. ’s largest chain of auto dealerships .
“ There ’s a very compelling case the government should put more money into it .
It ’s a great stimulus to the economy . ”
Of course !
The “ government ” should put more money into it .
Let me fix that quote to show you what it should say if it were telling the truth .
“ It was great for us , though a miserable failure for taxpayers and other industries , ” said Michael J. Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation Inc. , the U.S. ’s largest chain of auto dealerships .
“ There ’s really no case to be made that the government should confiscate or borrow more money to put into it .
But it ’s a great stimulus to my bank account , so I do n’t care what happens to the people picking up the tab ! ”
Who were the losers ?
Everyone else , especially the taxpayers .
And other businesses and industries , especially ones directly impacted by trading these cars in instead of servicing them , auto - parts sellers , mechanics , etc .
The funny thing is that down the road even the dealers will suffer , because this program created false demand and just kicked the can down the road so that the dealers could put off their day - of - reckoning a little longer .
Want to feel some outrage ?
Read this story and watch the video , especially watch the video at the 2 minute mark on where they discuss how the cars are junked , and how otherwise re-saleable parts are destroyed in the process .
Perfectly usable cars being destroyed !
And , as an added bonus , Big Government makes a complete mess in administering the program ( but do n’t worry , they ’ll run nationalized health care flawlessly ) .
We ’re not being fooled .
The majority of American people understand that this program is corrupt and just 35 in 100 Americans are in favor of it .
But since we ’re living in the age of Big Government , so let ’s go all the way with this !
Why stop at cars ?
In fact , the Wall Street Journal today asked , Why not a “ Cash for Everything ” program ?
Let ’s blow up buildings and rebuild them with subsidies to stimulate commercial building .
Let ’s burn down homes and rebuild them with taxpayer funds to stimulate the homebuilding industry !
Let ’s break up all our fine - china and buy everyone a new set !
Or maybe not .
Let ’s just point out one last thing about the way Cash For Clunkers was run , and how it exposes Big Government hypocrisy .
Very poor people , the car - less among us , who do n’t have any private transportation of their own , and who Big Government always profess to help , could have really used those cars .
They could ’ve been given to people in need .
This summer I donated my “ clunker ” to the Kars 4 Kids charity , which then sold it and used the money to help poor children .
I ’ll bet you my shiniest nickle that this government program has caused material hurt to charities like Kars 4 Kids .
And not just this year , but also in future years since many cars that may have been later donated to charity had their end - life pushed up to the present day and therefore wo n’t be available for donation in the future .
Just another sad instance of the Bastiat ’s “ unseens ” or , in words we like to use , “ what - might - have - beens . ”
The program should probably be called “ Cash From Clunkers ” since this bunch of Big Government phonies are possessed of such little brain - power that they can only themselves be referred to as Clunkers .
Then again , referring to it as “ Cash From Clunkers ” also obscures the fact that though they are delivering the money , it ’s not their money .
It ’s our money .
Or China ’s money that they ’ve borrowed and we will have to pay back someday .
Anyone suspect that this whole program might just be one ruse to prop up Government Run Motors or as a payback to the Automobile Unions ?
Whatever .
It ’s corrupt .
Another example – in a long and growing list – of corruption and Big Government going together .

UPDATES – Below by Date – how did our predictions go relative to what really happened ?
Read the results and decide for yourself .
( N0 , we ’re not prophets , we just have common sense and an understanding of basic human behavior , mysterious commodities that appear to be absent in politicians . )
UPDATE : October 4 , 2009 – Cash for Clunkers Fails to Help Economy and Environment
Last week U.S. automakers reported that new car sales for September , the first month since the clunker program expired , sank by 25 % from a year earlier .
Sales at GM and Chrysler fell by 45 % and 42 % , respectively .
Ford was down about 5 % .
Some 700,000 cars were sold in the summer under the program as buyers received up to $ 4,500 to buy a new car they would probably have purchased anyway , so all the program seems to have done is steal those sales from the future .
Exactly as critics predicted .
Cash for clunkers had two objectives : help the environment by increasing fuel efficiency , and boost car sales to help Detroit and the economy .
It achieved neither .
According to Hudson Institute economist Irwin Stelzer , at best “ the reduction in gasoline consumption will cut our oil consumption by 0.2 percent per year , or less than a single day ’s gasoline use . ”
Burton Abrams and George Parsons of the University of Delaware added up the total benefits from reduced gas consumption , environmental improvements and the benefit to car buyers and companies , minus the overall cost of cash for clunkers , and found a net cost of roughly $ 2,000 per vehicle .
Rather than stimulating the economy , the program made the nation as a whole $ 1.4 billion poorer .
UPDATE : October 23 , 2009 – Dealers say Cash for Clunkers has made cheap , used vehicles harder to find
In his 20 years in the business , salesman Mark Sauer has never had a tougher time finding inexpensive used cars .
“ It ’s never been this bad , ” said Sauer , buyer and sales manager of Vaccaro ’s Auto Buyers of Reading , 805 Hiesters Lane .
“ Customers used to be able to find a good car for their son or daughter to take to college for $ 2,000 or $ 3,000 , but now that same car may cost $ 5,000 , ” Tabakelis said .
“ It ’s sad . ”
He , too , blames cash for clunkers , which has led to fewer vehicles being available at used - car auctions , and the recession .
“ You used to be able to find a decent car for $ 2,500 , and you ca n’t anymore , especially in the past two months , ” said Arie Garcia , the association ’s office manager .
Another problem is that used - vehicle prices have quickly risen above their book values , making it tougher for customers to secure financing , Garcia said .
“ Cash for clunkers really hurt the used - car industry , ” she said .
“ I think it hurt more people than it helped . ”
UPDATE : October 29 , 2009 – Taxpayers paid $ 24,000 per car
The Cash for Clunkers program gave car buyers rebates of up to $ 4,500 if they traded in less fuel - efficient vehicles for new vehicles that met certain fuel economy requirements .
A total of $ 3 billion was allotted for those rebates .
The average rebate was $ 4,000 .
But the overwhelming majority of sales would have taken place anyway at some time in the last half of 2009 , according to Edmunds.com .
That means the government ended up spending about $ 24,000 each for those 125,000 additional vehicle sales .
UPDATE : October 29 , 2009 – Cash for Clunkers Massively Distorted GDP
If anyone mentions the just - released 3.5 % U.S. third quarter GDP growth , just throw this chart in their face .
Cash for Clunkers clearly distorted the U.S. economic figures in an unsustainable fashion .
Next quarter , we wo n’t just be returning to business as usual for auto output .
Do n’t forget that Cash for Clunkers pulled future auto demand , ie .
some of Q4 demand , into Q3 .
Thus Q4 is likely to be very weak since many people who planned to buy a car in Q4 probably took advantage of Clunkers and bought in Q3 .
Next quarter , not only are we unlikely to get Q3 ’s boost , but motor vehicle output data could subtract from GDP as well .
So watch out for the cliff …

We ’ll warn you about future programs that promise to help but inevitably harm .
A short time later , he was on the air with talk host Michael Smerconish and “ guaranteed ” health care reform :
I have no control over what the other side decides to use as a political strategy .
All I can tell you is that we ’ll get this done , one way or the other .
Contrary to popular wisdom , the president has been extraordinarily consistent on this point .
He asked Congress to deliver a bill that would do three things : ( 1 ) Reduce costs ( 2 ) Guarantee choice ( 3 ) Ensure quality care for every American .
So far , he has a house bill ( H.R. 3200 ) that does all this this with a public option , and in the Senate …he has the Gang of Six .
Here ’s John Kyl on Faux Noise :
“ The president … believes we should have choice and competition for people entering the private insurance market , in order to hold down costs and provide quality of the coverage , we have to have choice and competition , ” Gibbs said .
“ The president ’s preferred way is a public option .
If there are others that have additional viewpoints or other ideas in policy … we are ready to hear it . ” ( Emphasis mine )
Aha , say the Oh Noes .
See , his support for the public option is soft !
But wait a minute , here ’s Robert Gibbs on Wednesday :
But here ’s what the Oh Noes might not understand : eighty percent of Americans have health insurance .
For those people , a public option is largely irrelevant .
At yesterday ’s DFA town hall , Obama explained that the overwhelming majority of choices in the insurance exchange system will be still be private insurance options .
The public option , he said , can help keep insurers honest through competition , but it is clearly just one option of many .
The progressive blogosphere has been full of oh noes for weeks now:etc.
Democrats ’ approval of their party has plummeted in the face of conflicting messages .
Sunday , it was Kathleen Sebelius saying the public option is n’t “ the essential element ” of reform .
Obama is selling out , he ’s going to give up the public option ,
to which the industry has already agreed
In particular , the Arizona Republican signaled that he opposes requiring insurance companies nationwide to provide coverage without regard to pre-existing conditions ; requiring them to charge everyone the same rate regardless of health status ; and requiring all Americans to carry health insurance .
“ One of the concerns I have about the approach of the Democrats … is an assumption that there has to be a national mandate on all insurers to do various things . ” ( Emphasis mine )
Kyl also told ABC
News that he wo n’t even say yes to insurance reforms
Kyl is in favor of the status quo , which everyone else admits is unsustainable .
As Obama told the DFA town hall yesterday , “ If you like what what you have now , unless we make some changes you ’re not going to have it much longer . ”
With insurance premiums and out - of - pocket costs rising faster than inflation , Americans — and American businesses — are going broke to provide health coverage .
The rapid rise in Medicare costs is going to eat the entire federal discretionary budget .
SOMETHING has to change ; the question is what .
Here ’s Olympia Snowe talking to Andrea Mitchell , as reported by John Amato at C&L :
Mitchell :
So bottom lines , Nancy Pelosi says that they will not produce anything that does not include a public option .
Do you see any way that the gang of six will come out of the Finance Committee with a public option ?
Snowe :
No , I do n’t .
We have not had the public option on the table .
It ’s been co ops and addressing affordability and availability and plans through the exchange and those are the challenges we ’re wrestling with to insure that there are basic plans to offer Americans .
Unlike Kyl , Snowe at least thinks a plan is possible .
But co-ops are an experiment that has been tried and failed .
Even Blue Dog Kent Conrad , the most vocal supporter of co-ops , admits they would not cut costs .
The Gang of Six is hardly representative of the Senate as a whole , and has n’t produced a bill because they can’t contain costs without a public option .
Instead of looking for ways to reduce overall health care spending , they keep trying to hold down the cost of the bill .
If there are others that have additional viewpoints or other ideas in policy … we are ready to hear it .
When Congress reconvenes , the GOP has nothing to offer .
Blue Dogs and Olympia Snowe have something to offer , but it does n’t amount to much and certainly does n’t meet any of Obama ’s three policy goals .
Remember : Obama only needs the Gang of Six to produce a bill — any bill .
The Senate Finance Committee version can go straight to the circular file , if necessary , and the real sausage - making can begin in the negotiations between House and Senate .
House Democrats are pushing hard for the public option .
Nancy Pelosi says she will not push a bill that lacks the public option .
A progressive bloc of House Democrats say they will not vote for any bill that does n’t include a public option .
And Obama ’s criteria for a bill pretty much guarantee a public option , because the opponents of reform ca n’t offer anything better .
Repeating myself : rumors of the public option ’s death have been greatly exaggerated .
Taryn
Thomas is n't shy about anything , which makes for an unnerving lunch .
On a breezy Friday afternoon on the patio at Zipps Sports Grill in Scottsdale , she 's chain - smoking between coughs and eating fried chicken strips with her fingers .
She 's talking loudly and enthusiastically about her sexual experiences , using lots of graphic detail and four - letter words .
The people trying to eat on the patio around her have all fallen silent , conversing only through wrinkled brows and grimaces .
Restaurant management 's been trying to drown out Thomas for the past 30 minutes — they 've gradually turned up the music coming from the patio speakers until it 's absolutely blaring .
Every time they turn up the volume , Thomas talks louder .
By the time she gets to the part about how she got into porn , people on the patio have to shout their orders at the waitress .
Thomas is oblivious until somebody in her party remarks on the loud volume .
" Oh , is it because I 'm talking about fucking ? " she asks , wide - eyed .
" I can't help it .
I talk loud . "
At 26 , Thomas is already a seasoned veteran of the adult industry .
Four years ago , she was making bank as one of the most in - demand hardcore performers in the business — and business was booming .
Then she drifted to the dark side , almost killing herself with drugs and rough sex and going broke in the process .
She left porn three years ago and now is returning with her own production company , Taryn It Up Entertainment .
The adult business is n't what it used to be , especially in the San Fernando Valley outside Los Angeles , the long - reigning capital of porn in America .
But luckily for Thomas , her new company 's based in a place considered the next big hotspot for pornography : metropolitan Phoenix .
Some of the most successful adult sites in cyberspace are grounded here .
In fact , Taryn It Up Entertainment leads a pack of profitable , Phoenix - based adult - entertainment businesses that , like it or not , just might make the Valley of the Sun the next porn capital .
" It 's kind of strange .
Arizona 's become like the small mecca , the little porn capital already , " says Buzz Aziani , owner of Phoenix - based adult site Aziani.com .
" The San Fernando Valley is definitely still the porn capital , but it feels like we 're second , especially with Web companies .
There 's a ton of Web companies out here . "
Before Jenna Jameson retired from the industry to have babies in California with mixed - martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz , she was Scottsdale 's most famous resident porn star , and her Club Jenna ( acquired by Playboy in 2006 ) was the best - known Arizona - based brand of adult entertainment .
But those in the industry — both in L.A. and in Phoenix — say Thomas ' company has the potential to enjoy even more long - term success .
She 's already filmed her first movie for Taryn
It Up and procured distribution through the same company that handled Club Jenna .
And she 's building a Web presence that could bring in substantial income .
She 's been able to lure big - name porn stars here to work with her company — including Ron Jeremy , Poppy Morgan , and Veronica Jett — but she 's most interested in bringing in local talent to work in her videos .
It has n't been hard for her to find people willing to work in Scottsdale , either , since Thomas says her company pays more than many companies in the San Fernando Valley — about $ 2,000 for a boy - girl scene , whereas talent in L.A. might get half that in the current economy .
There have been a couple of business disputes , including a costly one with former frequent Howard Stern Show guest Lee " Crazy Cabbie " Mroszak over who has rights to hardcore footage from the Stern studio .
But they have n't damaged her company .
Fortunately for her , she 's not venturing into this territory alone .
Thomas has the support of her family and friends , as well as some key people in the adult industry .
And she has her fiancé and the co-owner of Taryn It Up — New Jersey porn businessman Brett T. — by her side to fend off bullies and handle the finances .
" We plan on being together forever , " Thomas says .
" Really , he 's my soul mate . "
Thomas talks with her hands a lot , so it does n't take long to notice the words tattooed in black on the inside of her wrists : " Love " on the left , and " Lust " on the right .
She says they 're recent tattoos she 'd wanted to get for a long time .
She considers the fresh tattoos a step toward burying her demons and reclaiming her place in an industry where women are easily replaced and quickly forgotten .
" I 'd say 97 percent of porn stars are psycho , " Thomas says .
" Everybody wants to paint their life as the perfect fairy tale , and it 's not .
A lot of people do n't like my honesty .
And , honestly , I 'm still getting my own head back to normal . "
When a girl 's thinking about getting into the porn business , every agent tells her the same thing :
Your family will find out .
" It does n't matter if you use a stage name and your parents do n't have e-mail , or they do n't even know how to use a computer , " says Mark Spiegler of L.A. 's Spiegler Girls agency , which has represented many successful adult stars , including Belladonna and Taryn Thomas .
" Somewhere , someday , somebody 's brother 's roommate 's friend is going to see you , and that 's it . "
Thomas swears she 's the exception , that her grandparents back east still think she 's a real estate agent .
For that reason , she says , she does n't want her real name on record .
But Thomas ' secrecy applies only to extended family .
Her immediate family is very aware of her career , to the point where her dad — a U.S. Postal Service employee for the past 25 years — sells signed pictures of her to co-workers , and her younger brother Vince — a part - time porn actor and aspiring Marine — makes deposits for her company when she 's out of town .
Not that everyone in the Thomas clan is thrilled about Taryn's occupation .
Thomas says she and her younger sister do n't speak very often .
Her mother , Anna , says she keeps her daughter 's career a secret , and only a few of her closest friends know the real story .
" I was shocked when I really found out about it , " Anna says .
" And , of course , it 's a risky business . "
Anna says she also was n't happy when Taryn paid Vince to perform in a couple of adult movies .
" Now she 's dragging him into it , " their mom says .
" Well , I can't say she 's dragging him into it , but it 's just that I have one , and then another one — what 's my family going to say ? "
Vince , 22 , says he plans to enlist in the Marines and just wants to be able to brag to the guys that he's had sex with a couple of porn stars .
The family must get the same inquiries over and over , because they answer some questions before they 're asked .
No , neither of her parents has seen one of her films .
" I do n't really watch porn , and I do n't watch Taryn , " her father , Henry , says .
" I told her , ' I know you 've been fucking since you were 13 , but I do n't need to see it . ' "
And , no , Taryn was never in the room when Vince was performing .
" I just think that would be a little weird , " Vince says .
Thomas ' career may be profane , but her childhood was G-rated .
She was born into a large Italian family in New Jersey , the oldest of four children .
She was raised Roman Catholic and went through communion and confirmation .
By all accounts , she was athletic , playing softball and basketball and winning a Presidential Fitness Award in sixth grade .
Her dad says she was shy .
Her mom says she was a good kid .
The family moved to Phoenix when Thomas was 12 .
By the time she was a teenager , she was frequenting desert parties and drinking with classmates from Desert Mountain High School .
She cut classes a lot .
Her parents were at odds over how to handle her .
Her mother says she was the stricter parent : " [ Taryn ] went wild .
Her father let her do anything she wanted to do . "
Henry admits he let his kids " go out and explore life on their own and stuff .
" I basically told them , ' Go out and try everything you want , everything you can , ' " Henry says .
" So we had a clash of personalities , me and [ Anna ] . "
Her parents divorced when she was 15 , an event that left Thomas feeling " torn apart . "
She went to live with her father — most of the time .
" She ran away a lot , " Henry says .
" She ran away about five or six times .
But the father of one of the girls she ran away with was a U.S. Marshal , so they never got far . "
When she was 15 , Thomas stole a Cadillac from an acquaintance and drove across the U.S. border with some friends .
She did n't get farther than a motel room in Nogales before one of her companions called her dad to check in .
They were tracked down by Nogales police and detained in the local jail until their parents retrieved them .
By the time she was 16 , she was doing a variety of drugs recreationally , including Xanax and cocaine .
When she was 17 , her parents sent her to live with an aunt in Georgia .
The two months she spent there , Thomas says , were like rehab .
Very disciplined .
" I did n't have sex at all , " she says .
" I was n't even really allowed to go out of the house . "
Ultimately , Thomas returned to Phoenix but never finished high school .
She says she stayed clean when she got back from Georgia , but it would n't be the last time she would take off to escape her " demons . "
She got into the adult industry as soon as she turned 18 , in May 2001 .
Her father says it was a longtime goal :
" She 'd been trying to do that since she was 16 .
She worked at Hooters when she was 16 , as a hostess .
I think the first thing I can remember was her and these two other girls , they went some place in Scottsdale to pose topless .
I told her , ' Make the guy sign a contract to make sure he pays you , or he 's gonna rip you off . ' "
And that 's exactly what happened .
It would n't be the last ( or the worst ) time Thomas got ripped off .
Her first paying gig was a sorority girl - themed photo shoot for Glendale - based Lightspeed Media Corporation , which operates several Internet sites featuring soft - core porn .
LMC owner Steve Lightspeed says the first thing that struck him about Thomas was her natural , fiery orange hair , which she now regularly dyes black .
" We called her Daphne , " he says , comparing the shade to that of the Scooby - Doo character .
" She had the most beautiful , bright - red hair . "
Thomas was 21 and making about $ 200 per photo shoot here when she decided to move to L.A. in late 2004 and make the leap to hardcore , where she could make up to $ 2,000 per scene .
She hired agent Mark Spiegler , who 's represented such porn stars as Katsuni , Sasha Grey , and Kylie Ireland .
Spiegler says Thomas was a welcome addition to his stable : " She was cute .
She did good scenes .
She had a nice personality .
Everybody liked her . "
Thomas ' first photo shoot in L.A. was for Hustler ; her first DVD was titled 12 on 1 # 12 , for a company called Lethal Hardcore .
She moved into one of Spiegler 's homes with a few other female performers and quickly ascended to porn stardom .
" Over the course of five or six months , she became one of the top girls in the business , " Spiegler says .
" She could make easily $ 20,000 a month . "
In 2005 and 2006 , Thomas worked constantly , appearing in more than 100 films .
She became known for her dirty talk during scenes , and for her willingness to go all - out sexually .
Her performances got her a " Dirtiest Girl in Porn " award from Fans of Adult Media and Entertainment in 2006 , and a nomination for a Best New Starlet award from Adult Video Newsletter that same year .
Although that award went to McKenzie Lee , Thomas made quite an impression , says AVN editor Dan Miller .
" The intensity of Taryn 's sex scenes was probably the biggest factor in her nomination , " he says .
" She got booked a lot for many different companies , so she was prolific enough for us to take notice . "
But back at Spiegler 's house , all was not well .
Thomas was raking in the cash , but she was blowing through it even faster .
Spiegler , who describes himself as " like a Jewish mother , " says drugs were not allowed in his home , and he tried to help Thomas control her spending by setting up a trust fund for her that she could n't touch .
" I told her if a bus ran me over , then she could get the money , " Spiegler says .
" I put money away for four or five months , and I gave her $ 1,000 a week , which to a regular person is a lot of money . "
It was n't a lot of money to Thomas .
In addition to her occupational expenses — STD tests , manicures , tanning salons , clothes , sex toys — she was putting a lot of money up her nose .
Coke had started as a party favor to enjoy with fellow performers , but her use intensified beyond recreational .
" My first year at the AVN awards , I was all fucked up and trying to sign stuff , " Thomas recalls .
It was n't long before Thomas ' relapse started to affect her career .
She started showing up late for jobs , or not showing up at all .
But Spiegler continued booking steady work for Thomas , and she kept pushing her bodily boundaries .
Her self - described reputation as " the skinny girl who did anal intercourse " and the nullification of her senses and conscience with drugs eventually led to an injury on a movie set that required surgery .
She subsequently had a massive breakdown and , in March 2006 , she abruptly left the adult industry and came home to Phoenix , metaphorical bridges burning behind her .
When Taryn Thomas told Mark Spiegler she was leaving Southern California to go back to the desert , he gave her the $ 50,000 in her trust fund .
He also issued a warning :
" I said , ' Listen , mark this moment , because you 've got all this momentum going , and when you stop , if you ever want to come back , it 's not going to be the same .
You do n't get a second chance at being new . '
And she said , ' I do n't care . ' "
Thomas says she regrets that Spiegler felt abandoned .
" He was like my dad .
But I had to take that break to save myself . "
Back in Phoenix , Thomas kicked cocaine but gained 45 pounds .
She took gigs dancing at strip clubs around the Valley while desperately trying to lose weight .
At 5 - foot - 4 and 160 pounds , she would n't have been able to return to adult films even if she 'd wanted to .
And , eventually , she wanted to .
Thomas tried different jobs — she says she worked as a pharmacy technician at Advance PCS ( now Caremark ) and attended real estate school , but she never got her license .
She had no money left from her film career ; she 'd spent the 50 grand from her trust fund in six weeks .
Her return to porn seemed inevitable , but she knew she could n't go back to Spiegler .
By May 2007 , Thomas had lost a few pounds and sent some photos to L.A. Direct Models , a large agency with names like Penny Flame , Brianna Love , and Eva Angelina on its roster .
It agreed to sign Thomas to a two - year contract , with some stipulations .
First , Thomas had to get back down to her former weight of 115 .
The agency hired a personal trainer , and Thomas worked out at a gym three hours a night .
It also hired a nutritionist to put her on a diet , gave her a place to live in L.A. , and made her submit to regular drug tests , with the agreement that it 'd send her home if she failed .
L.A. Direct 's Scott Stone described why the agency took a chance on Thomas : " She 's great .
She 's a great performer , not just on film , but she 's great onstage with feature dancing .
We 've gotten inquiries from as far as London about her feature dancing . "
One of Thomas ' first movies upon returning to porn was Please Pay My Tuition .
It was on the set of that film , in the fall of 2007 , that she met and filmed a scene with her fiancé , Brett T .
Ten years older than Thomas , Brett 's stocky with dark , slicked - back hair .
He was already a successful businessman when he met Thomas .
He made money on - camera as a performer and off - camera as a director and producer , and he also owned a massive arcade on the Jersey shore .
Brett talks enthusiastically about stocks , the way a lot of guys talk about sports .
" I get off watching my bank account numbers go up , " he says with a smile .
" Sometimes , I lay awake at night and just think of more ways to make more money . "
As soon as they started dating , Brett made Thomas change her priorities .
" Think about all these girls that blew all this porn money , " he says .
" If they would have put a little bit of that money [ away ] and kept working , they would have had a nice , tangible asset that , in six or seven years , would be worth [ millions ] .
But hindsight is 20 / 20 .
You can't tell a young girl what to do .
Young people know it all . "
Thomas admits that 's the way she felt : " I knew everything at 18 , but a fancy Chanel purse is n't going to pay your rent . "
She and Brett bought a 5,400 - square - foot house in Scottsdale last year , and they also own a home in their native New Jersey .
They 've poured a lot of money into their recently incorporated Taryn It Up Entertainment .
Though Brett could n't provide an exact figure , he broke down various costs for props , video equipment , Web design , editing , special effects , makeup artists , and talent .
" It 's more than six figures , " he says .
" It 's substantial . "
Launching a new production company is a challenge because the sluggish economy affects the adult industry , too , and the technological advances of the Digital Age are n't helping .
There are more performers than ever , and while amateur Internet porn sites are growing , paychecks from DVD - production companies are dwindling .
Just like the digital shift in the music industry , the traditional business model of the adult industry has been changed by easier and more direct user access to the product .
Selling sex has become a tricky business , but Taryn Thomas has some new tricks up her skirt .
A lot has changed since Thomas started her career in porn eight years ago .
The adult industry , once viewed as recession - proof , has suffered profit losses for the first time in its history .
With estimated yearly revenues of $ 12 billion , the porn industry has traditionally made more money annually than the NFL and the NBA combined ( the NFL and NBA reported $ 6 billion and $ 3.2 billion in revenue for 2008 , respectively ) .
And though the January request by porn moguls Larry Flynt and Joe Francis for a $ 5 billion federal bailout of the industry was largely viewed as a publicity stunt , the economic squeeze has indeed affected every sector of the industry — especially in its L.A. hub .
A recent article in the LA Daily News listed the 2007 combined revenue of more than 200 San Fernando Valley - based companies at $ 1 billion , a figure that 's not even a tenth of the industry 's former annual average .
According to Adult Video Newsletter , sales and rentals of adult DVDs have fallen more than 30 percent since 2005 .
The DVD market is disappearing as more people download online pornography — and for free , most of the time .
The result is that production companies are shooting less new content and performers are offered smaller paychecks for more extreme scenes .
Thomas says her flat rates were $ 500 for a solo scene and $ 1,000 for a girl - girl scene ( her rates for a boy - girl scene varied ) .
When she re-entered the business , she was asked to shoot an anal sex scene for $ 1,000 .
" Even with the economy the way it is , I 'm not going to do that for just $ 1,000 , " she says .
" I could make $ 1,000 being an escort for one night . "
Such budget squeezing has pushed some performers to the edge , like one actress who accepted $ 15,000 for a " 55 - guy " orgy video , Thomas says .
Most male talent wo n't work with that woman anymore , she says .
Dr. Sharon Mitchell is the founder and director of the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation , a non-profit organization based in Southern California that provides HIV and STD testing , counseling , and group support for performers in the adult industry .
Before her current profession , Mitchell was a performer and director in the adult industry for more than 20 years , beginning in 1977 , and she 's seen the ways the industry 's changed over time .
" You were able to make a career out of this at one time , " Mitchell says .
" Now , I do n't think it 's that easy to do .
And the sex is very risky .
A lot of it is very rough and extreme .
Today , I would n't join the porn business as a young actress . "
Ironically , though the demands have become more difficult and the rates have gotten lower , the pool of porn - star wanna - bes keeps growing .
Mitchell says AIM receives between 500 and 600 inquiries every month from potential new talent about AIM 's instructional videos , " Porn 101 " and " Porn 102 . "
Thomas ' former agent , Mark Spiegler , says " more women than ever before are trying to get into the business , " even though companies are shooting less .
" It 's gone from people falling into the business to girls who aspire to be porn stars and plan to get into the business itself , " Spiegler says .
" There are a lot more of them , even though the industry has down - turned . "
The reality is , with a few exceptions , there are no real " porn stars " anymore .
" The average career in the industry now is between six months and three years , " Mitchell says .
" Nowadays , girls come in and , six months later , they 're overexposed because they 've been shot by every company .
People want to see new faces . "
But though some companies in the San Fernando Valley are scaling back , other adult businesses are booming — especially in the Phoenix area and on the Web .
In addition to popular Phoenix - based amateur sites like amateurallure.com , which features videos of " real amateurs " having sex , and First Time Video ( www.ftvgirls.com), which specializes in videos and photos of young - looking models , the Valley 's also home to Lightspeed Media Corporation and Aziani , two thriving adult - content online companies .
The Valley 's also the corporate headquarters of CCBill , one of the largest online billing companies for e-merchants — particularly adult sites — in the world .
Business information corporation Dun & Bradstreet estimates CCBill 's annual sales at $ 4.8 million .
The owners of Lightspeed Media Corporation and Aziani declined to give their exact revenue figures , but both say their companies are doing very well and turning profits .
Lightspeed Media was founded in Glendale in 1999 .
By 2006 , it was notable enough for the Wall Street Journal to profile its founder , Steve Lightspeed .
" We make more than a penny and less than a hundred million , " Lightspeed says with a laugh .
" We 're doing well enough to continue doing what we 're doing . "
Buzz Aziani created Aziani.com with his wife , adult actress Rachel Aziani , in 1999 .
The site features solo glamour shots of well - known adult performers .
Like Thomas and her fiancé , Brett , the Azianis alternate between flying talent to Phoenix and working in L.A .
Dr. Mitchell says many of the resources for the adult industry are still in the San Fernando Valley .
But with the Internet , location does n't matter so much .
" We 're all connected now by computers , " she says .
One thing successful adult - business owners agree on is that the only way to survive and thrive right now is to offer something that no one else offers , or to have an established brand with a loyal fan base .
Taryn Thomas believes her business features both .
The home Taryn Thomas shares with Brett T. is technically in Scottsdale , but it's in the middle of nowhere , about 10 minutes south of Cave Creek .
To get there from northeast Phoenix , you drive for 45 minutes past numerous horse ranches and down a long dirt road that cuts through the desert and leads to a brand - new development .
The homes here are all recently built and mostly unoccupied .
The secluded location and scarcity of neighbors were the main reasons the couple bought the sprawling , ranch - style house with the circular driveway .
They can shoot nude photos or sex scenes in their backyard without worrying about prying eyes .
Much of their money has gone into their company , so the massive house is barely furnished .
There are two large , solid - oak dining tables with matching leather chairs , a couple of brown leather couches , and a large flat - screen TV .
Beyond that , the house is mostly yawning white walls and open space — until you get to the studio room .
The studio's décor is eclectic — each wall a different color , with deep blue nestled between soft pink and royal purple .
A school chalkboard hangs on the north wall , above an old classroom desk and an American flag on a brass pole .
Across from these props is an industrial dungeon - type setup , with several long , thick chains dangling from a wall of shiny sheet metal .
And stacked against the west wall , going unused thus far , is expensive DJ equipment Thomas purchased last year .
Any room in the house is game for a porn shoot , but most of the action for the company has been shot in the studio or the master bedroom .
On a sunny Wednesday , it 's the master bedroom where Thomas is filming a vigorous sex scene with British porn sensation Poppy Morgan .
A slender brunette who 's spent most of the day walking around in nothing but a bath towel , Morgan has also signed on to be one of the directors for Taryn It Up Entertainment .
While the two women go at each other on the couch , Brett hovers over them carefully , video recorder in hand .
At one point , he leans in to get a close - up , and Thomas , whose head is out of camera shot for the moment , cranes her neck to peek at the LCD screen while Brett 's filming .
Once the camera 's off , Thomas and Morgan head to the patio for a smoke .
The mood is as casual as if two office workers were chatting by the water cooler .
Inside the house , legendary porn star Ron Jeremy is watching The Oprah Winfrey Show .
Brett 's known Jeremy for years and will be shooting him in a scene the following day for the company 's video library .
Jeremy landed in Phoenix an hour ago , and he looks tired .
Every so often , he pulls a harmonica out of the pocket of his sweatpants and blows a few bars .
At the other end of the living room , the heavy and heavily tattooed Lee Mroszak , better known as " Crazy Cabbie " to listeners of Howard Stern 's show when it was on WXRK , is showing off his joke business cards to Thomas ' little brother , Vince .
They 're hit - man cards , he says , and people really have called the number on them with assassination assignments .
Thomas says she does n't really know Mroszak , that he 's a longtime friend of Brett's .
He 's here because of " the Stern video , " a.k.a .
The Howard Stern Porno DVD , which consists of footage Mroszak shot of people — including Ron Jeremy — wearing Howard Stern masks and having sex in Stern 's studio chair .
Mroszak had been shopping the film around since 2007 , right after he finished directing Please Pay My Tuition — the film in which Thomas and Brett met .
The couple agreed to release The Howard Stern Porno through Taryn It Up Entertainment , and the DVD release party is tonight .
Ron Jeremy 's along for the ride — and the $ 4,000 appearance fee he makes for showing up at a club , according to Brett .
For the moment , though , Jeremy 's dozed off , and Brett goes running for a giant dildo to wave over Ron 's mouth while Vince snaps a picture .
Just as Brett comes snickering around the corner of the couch , dildo in hand , Jeremy 's eyes snap open .
" Damn , " Brett says .
" That would have been funny . "
Later that night , everybody heads to Pink Cabaret for the DVD release party .
Thomas is wearing a tight black dress , short enough to show off her hot pink G - string underneath .
Morgan 's donned an expensive , form - fitting denim dress .
Jeremy 's also dressed up some , having changed from sweats into a black shirt and pants .
After posing for several flesh - flashing photos with the dancers at Pink , he dozes off yet again .
Thomas and Morgan head upstairs to escape the growing mob of ogling drunk men , one of whom has already fallen out of his chair trying to talk to Morgan .
Mroszak has pretty much disappeared , hiding out at the DJ booth and on the club 's second floor most of the night .
In less than two months , he 'll have a major falling out with Brett and Thomas , and The Howard Stern Porno will remain unreleased .
Thomas and Brett claim they invested big bucks in promotional costs for the Stern video , money they lost when Mroszak , who owns 50 percent of the footage , decided not to let them release the film after all .
Mroszak 's side of the story is that Brett " maintained control over the film , and I was n't allowed to make any decisions on what was going to happen . "
Mroszak also explains that releasing the footage " would probably ruin my friendship with Howard . "
Thomas and Brett say they do n't care anymore whether or not the movie comes out .
They just hope they never lay eyes on Mroszak again .
Taryn
It Up Entertainment recently finished shooting its first feature film , Vogue Nasty , and it has a handful of other projects in the works .
One is a racy spoof on IndyCar driver and GoDaddy.com spokeswoman Danica Patrick , wherein Thomas plays a lusty lass who drives a race car and has a sponsorship through a company called " HoDaddy.com . "
Another film in the works is Jon Minus Nine , a spoof on Jon and Kate Gosselin of the Jon & Kate Plus 8 reality show .
Thomas and Brett are hoping to make money in the flailing DVD market .
In fact , Taryn
It Up is the only local adult company that 's shooting videos for DVD ; every other Phoenix - based porn company focuses on either still photography or exclusive Web video .
Thomas says the movies she 's filming could prosper because she 's already known in the business and because she 's shooting original content , which is becoming scarce in the adult industry .
" The majority of the movies being released right now are all compilation DVDs from different movies .
The fans are getting bored , " says Morgan , who co-directed Vogue Nasty with Thomas .
" They 'll e-mail and say , ' Hey , I got this new movie , but I 've already seen this part . '
It 's because of the economy .
Companies are finding it hard to shoot , so they just grab stuff from various movies and put it on one disc .
" Taryn's got the ability to shoot fresh , new stuff with awesome talent , " Morgan oozes .
" I think it 's going to be really big because no one else is doing it . "
Antigua Pictures is now distributing Thomas ' work .
The 20 - year - old company has represented some of the biggest names in the industry : Vivid Video , Club Jenna , and Tera Vision .
Antigua national sales manager David Peskin says , " We 've been very aware of what a big name Taryn Thomas was in the industry .
She has a loyal fan base , and her DVDs sell very well . "
Most of the performers in Thomas ' new films are established names : Ron Jeremy , Bobbi Starr , and Veronica Jett , who came out of retirement to star in Vogue Nasty .
But Thomas and Brett emphasize that they want to work with new local talent .
" We 'd rather use local talent , all day , every day , " Thomas says .
" We get new faces , and that 's what we want . "
New local talent also is cheaper .
Thomas and Brett can pay newbies a fraction of what big names from L.A. demand .
Finding attractive young females to work with in the Valley has n't been difficult .
Thomas and Brett pay $ 50 an hour for photo shoots and have already shot several local models for their future Web site , ­totallytaryn.com .
Thomas also plans to recruit exotic dancers from clubs around town .
" I 'm from Phoenix , and if I can help the girls out , I will , " she says .
" They 're not making any money dancing these days .
And it keeps my talent fresh . "
There 's no shortage of potential adult performers here , especially in the bad economy , says Steve Lightspeed of LMC .
" I like to work with new girls who have n't worked for anybody yet and have n't picked up any bad habits , " he says .
" In L.A. , girls get passed around like $ 2 whores .
Here , everybody knows each other and is friendly . "
Perhaps loads of friendly people who'll work cheap are driving the success of XXX - rated businesses here .
It could be one component of a business plan that helps Taryn Thomas and her porn colleagues turn the Valley of the Sun into an industry town .
Professor Emeritus Martin Hellman began his work on the threat of nuclear destruction in the 1980s .
What are the chances of a nuclear world war ?
What is the risk of a nuclear attack on United States soil ?
The risk of a child born today suffering an early death due to nuclear war is at least 10 percent , according to Martin Hellman , a tall , thin and talkative Stanford Professor Emeritus in Engineering .
Nuclear tensions in Iran and North Korea are increasing the need to take a long look at how the United States handles weapons of mass destruction , Hellman said .
Auto manufacturers assess the risk of injury to drivers , and engineers assess potential risks of a new nuclear power plant .
So why have n’t we assessed the risk of nuclear conflict based on our current arms strategy ?
Hellman and a group of defense experts , Nobel laureates and Stanford professors are calling for an in - depth analysis .
With more than 25,000 nuclear weapons in existence and the ability to build many times more , the choice is between creating a safer world and having no world at all , Hellman wrote in his paper “ Risk Analysis of Nuclear Deterrence . ”
Weapons from the Cold War still remain , but public concern for nuclear strategy has dissipated , Hellman said .
Many of those who do think about it , such as political leaders , say the fantasy of nuclear disarmament is too risky for national defense , he explained .
“ People who are saying change is too risky are implicitly assuming that the current approach is risk free , but no one really knows what the risk is if we do n’t change , ” Hellman said .
Hellman ’s story
Hellman first became concerned about nuclear war in the 1980s when Ronald Reagan became president .
Reagan brought the nuclear threat into clearer focus by being honest about fighting plans , Hellman said .
Also , a fellow Stanford professor , Harry Rathbun , started a group to convince people that nuclear weapons represented more than just scientific progress , but a real threat of global destruction .
Hellman credited his wife , Dorothie , for getting him to join the group : “ I never would have gotten involved if it was n’t for her . ”
In 1982 , Hellman took an 18 - month , unpaid leave from Stanford to work as a volunteer for the group started by Rathbun .
During this time , Hellman became convinced that nuclear destruction not only could happen , but would happen unless we changed some of our fundamental beliefs about national security and war .
Hellman ’s numbers
About fifteen years after Hellman became convinced of impending destruction , he began punching numbers to calculate the probability of such a catastrophe based on events focused around the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .
According to Hellman ’s numbers , the risk of a person not living out his or her natural life because of nuclear war is at least 10 percent .
Hellman gives another analogy : “ The risk that each one of us dies as a result of failed deterrence is thousands of times greater than the risk you would bear if a nuclear power plant were built right next to your home . ”
Determining such a risk seems a little like predicting the future , but Hellman is confident about his numbers .
He justifies his probability by breaking down a catastrophe into a sequence of smaller failures , incorporating expert opinions , examining history and estimating within a range of numbers .
Hellman ’s path to risk assessment
Before returning to Stanford from his volunteer leave , Hellman started a project with the Soviet Academy of Sciences through a committee led by Evgeny Velikhov , who later became Mikhail Gorbachev ’s science advisor .
In 1984 , Hellman and his wife traveled to the Soviet Union to create dialog and build relationships with the Soviet scientists .
Soviet restrictions on free speech prevented totally open discussion , but by 1986 , Gorbachev lifted censorship , and the project became possible , Hellman explained .
The fruit of their labor came a year later in the form of a book called Breakthrough : Emerging New Thinking .
It had the radical thesis that either humanity would end war or war would end humanity .
But the cold war faded , along with public support , and Hellman focused his work on easing ethnic tension on campus ( for which he won three awards ) before retiring in 1995 .
After a few years of attending to family responsibilities , he returned to his work on risk assessment .
Hellman ’s method
Hellman used a risk analysis approach , which breaks down a catastrophic event into a sequence of smaller failures .
He further simplified the analysis by only considering failures triggered by a crisis involving Cuba .
He began by evaluating three events that could have initiated a conflict : deploying American missiles in Turkey ( which began in 1961 ) , re-imposing a naval blockade around Cuba ( which was threatened in the 1980s ) and installing a missile defense system in eastern Europe , a current project that has drawn objections from Russia .
Based on the outcomes of these events , Hellman estimated these numbers :
• Rate of initiating events : six percent per year
• Probability that an initiating event leads to a major crisis : 33 percent
• Probability that a major crisis leads to the use of a nuclear weapon : 10 to 50 percent
The third probability is hardest to estimate because we have yet to drop a bomb on Russia ( or vice versa ) .
Hellman used the 10 to 50 percent range based on studying what transpired in the Cuban Missile Crisis and on statements by the participants .
People can make irrational decisions when under the gun , he explained .
Once a major crisis erupts , it becomes a question of who will back down first ; like a game of nuclear chicken , he said .
Iran and North Korea
Iran ’s nuclear program and North Korea ’s nuclear testing add complexity to the assessment , Hellman explained .
Nuclear terrorism was not included in the preliminary analysis , which makes Hellman ’s probability more conservative .
Factoring in nuclear terrorism adds a scary new dimension with additional risk , he said .
A country with nuclear weapons and a terrorist presence could trigger a nuclear war , especially if the terrorist hostility is directed at a United States or Russian city , Hellman explained .
“ If New York or Moscow went up in smoke , as horrendous as that would be , it could be a catalyst for an even worse catastrophe . ”
Conflict could arise as United States and Russian troops meet in the terrorist country to secure any remaining weapons , he explained .
According to Hellman , solving the conflict with Russia is the first key step to addressing issues with Iran or North Korea .
“ Let ’s work on the United States and Russia first because that ’s where the most weapons are , it ’s the easiest one to solve , and it will make a more fertile ground for solving later crises , ” he said .
“ If we behave more rationally toward Russia , it might help Iran and North Korea see us as more trustworthy . ”
Is disarmament the answer ?
Moving toward a solution starts with taking small steps , such as recognizing the problem and analyzing the risk , Hellman explained .
“ When people think about nuclear disarmament - if they do - they tend to think nothing will change except that we get rid of nuclear weapons .
That ’s not going to happen .
Before we can even determine if nuclear disarmament is possible , we need to get beyond the simple good - guy / bad - guy view of the world and recognize that things are much more complex . ”
While many might brand him as foolish for tackling such a seemingly insoluble problem , Hellman takes that as an unintended compliment , noting that his award - winning work in cryptography was seen in a similar light - until it paid off .
He looks to events in the past that give humanity hope for the future .
If America had rejected seemingly impossible tasks , we ’d still have slavery and women would n’t be able to vote ; history has proven that people can change , he said .

The grandson of Joseph Stalin has launched a libel suit against one of Russia 's leading liberal newspapers , accusing it of lying in an article which stated Stalin had killed Soviet citizens .
As the Russian Prime Minister , Vladimir Putin , defended the reputation of the wartime leader in Poland , Yevgeny Dzhugashvili , the dictator 's grandson , began his quest to claim nearly £ 200,000 from Novaya Gazeta .
" Half a century of lies have been poured over Stalin 's reputation and he cannot defend himself from the grave , so this case is essential to put the record straight , " Mr Dzhugashvili 's lawyer , Leonid Zhura , told Reuters .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Liberal critics say that the drive to rehabilitate Stalin has official backing , with the Kremlin keen to glorify Russia 's Soviet past and make Russians proud of their history , while glossing over Stalin 's crimes .
Dzhugashvili is Stalin 's real surname , and Yevgeny Dzhugashvili is the son of Stalin 's son , Yakov , who was killed during the Second World War .
It is believed that the Nazis offered to trade Yakov for a captured German field marshal , but Stalin refused the offer .
Yevgeny Dzhugashvili , however , remains an enthusiastic Stalinist .
His anger was raised by a Novaya Gazeta publication which referred to declassified secret documents ordering the execution of Soviet citizens and which are said to bear Stalin 's personal signature .
The lawsuit also accuses the human rights organisation Memorial of libel .
It has collected testimony about victims of Stalin 's terror and the article appeared in a pamphlet that it published jointly with the newspaper .
The court case is part of an increasingly bitter conflict between liberals and Russian officials over control of Stalin 's legacy .
Over the past decade , the Kremlin has sought to portray Russia 's victory in the Second World War as the most significant historical event of the 20th century .
Attention has been focused on Stalin 's supposedly heroic wartime leadership , and away from his crimes and repressions .
Last week , a Moscow metro station reopened after renovations , and horrified liberals found that an inscription lauding Stalin , which had been removed from the station after his death in the 1950s , had been restored .
" Stalin raised us to be loyal to the nation , inspired us to labour and great deeds , " says the inscription , which is taken from an early version of the Soviet national anthem .
Sergei Mitrokhin , the leader of the liberal Yabloko Party , called the inscription " scandalous " and said that Stalin had perpetrated a " monstrous genocide " .

However Mr Zhura , Mr Dzhugashvili's lawyer , came to Stalin 's defence " He turned populations into peoples , he presided over a golden era in literature and the arts ; he was a real leader .
We want to rehabilitate Stalin . "
Such views find wide support among Russia 's population , who are fed a diet of propagandistic television programmes and history textbooks about Stalin's war leadership and " effective management " .
Last year , in a competition to find the greatest Russian in history , the moustachioed dictator – who was actually an ethnic Georgian – came third .
The Stalin case is not the only bizarre lawsuit that Memorial has had to defend this week .
Preliminary hearings also took place into another case linked to the kidnapping and execution of one of the group 's leading activists , Natalya Estemirova .
In July , Ms Estemirova was snatched outside her home in Chechnya and killed .
She had been investigating human rights abuses perpetrated under the pro-Kremlin Chechen ruler , Ramzan Kadyrov .
Oleg Orlov , the head of Memorial , voiced what many were thinking after her death and said that Mr Kadyrov was responsible , at the very least because he presided over a country where such crimes could occur with impunity .
Several of Mr Kadyrov 's enemies and critics have met nasty ends over the past year but the chances of Mr Kadyrov being put on trial or questioned over any of the murders are infinitesimal .
On Monday , the same day the Stalin case began , hearings took place in a different courtroom into a lawsuit between Mr Kadyrov and Mr Orlov .
Instead of it being a chance to put the Chechen leader – who has been accused of gruesome crimes – in the dock , the court heard a libel action by Mr Kadyrov against the Memorial head .
Mr Kadyrov accuses Mr Orlov of " insulting his honour and dignity " by saying he was responsible for Ms Estemirova 's murder and demands compensation to the tune of £ 200,000 .
Due out in Japan next month , Nintendo has just announced a spring 2010 release target for the North American and European remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver for the DS .

Johto - I 'm still in Johto .
Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver , two of the most ridiculous names we 've ever come across , are remakes of the original Pokémon Gold and Silver , with updated graphics and sound , touch screen features , and " a host of surprises . "
The announcement of the Western release was made during the opening of the 2009 Pokémon World Championships , which one would imagine is a pretty big deal to Pokémon fans .
" Announcing these much - anticipated game launches at The Pokémon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokémon , " said J.C. Smith , The Pokémon Company International 's director of marketing , who made the announcement on stage to kick off the 2009 Pokémon World Championships .
" We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first . "

I generally pick up any Pokémon title Nintendo tosses my way reflexively , but they may have lost me here .
I cannot buy anything with the words HeartGold or SoulSilver on it .

From the L.A. Times -- Former Interior Secretary Gale Norton is focus of corruption probe :
Reporting from Washington - The Justice Department is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton illegally used her position to benefit Royal Dutch Shell PLC , the company that later hired her , according to officials in federal law enforcement and the Interior Department .
The Justice Department investigation centers on a 2006 decision to award oil shale leases in Colorado to a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary .
Months later , the oil giant hired Norton as a legal counsel .
Could we finally see the Justice Department coming down on a member of Bush administration ?
Maddow : Ken Salazar inherited responsibility for about 500 million acres of the Earth when President Obama appointed him secretary of the interior .
Yesterday , as we reported , he announced that he would shut down the Interior Department office known during the Bush administration as the place where department staffers snorted meth off of toaster ovens .
The inspector general reported that in addition to the toaster oven meth - snorting , employees of one middle management office had sex with , did drugs with , and took embarrassingly small bribes from people in the oil and gas industry they were supposed to be regulating .
Now , the secretary of the interior during the time of the toaster oven , meth - snorting , what ‘s known as the department ‘s orgy era , was a person named Gale Norton .
During the orgy era at her department , Gale — at her department — Gale Norton awarded Shell Oil a bunch of extremely lucrative leases to squeeze some oil out of federal lands .
Two months after the big present for Shell Oil was announced , Gale Norton quit the Department of the Interior .
Where did she go to work after that ?
You guessed it .
Shell Oil .
Dear Miss Norton , thank you for submitting your resume .
If then - Interior Secretary Gale Norton discussed her future employment with Shell while she was making the decision to award the company those lucrative leases , she will have broken the law .
An internal investigation was launched of this while George W. Bush was still in office .
And “ The Los Angeles Times ” reports today that it has now been turned over to the Justice Department in a formal criminal referral .
That makes Gale Norton the first Bush cabinet secretary to be the subject of a formal corruption investigation .
She , of course , is also the first to have multiple results show up when you goggle her name along with the words meth , toaster oven and snorting .

It is money ( qua medium of exchange ) and only money , that makes Say 's Law wrong .
And those Keynesians who reject Say's Law but who also reject the uniqueness of money are as wrong as those who accept Say 's Law .
Say 's Law is wrong , and the fact that it is wrong is really important for macroeconomics .
But it 's not obvious why Say 's Law is wrong .
And you have to get right inside the minds of those who think Say's Law is right if you want to change their minds .
That 's what I 'm trying to do here .
For a whole economy , does planned expenditure on newly - produced goods necessarily equal planned income from the sale of newly - produced goods ?
That 's what I mean by " Say 's Law " in this context .
Let me start out by " proving " Say 's Law .
There are n goods , and each individual has a budget constraint which says his planned purchases of goods must have the same value as his planned sales of goods , summed over all n goods .
If we add up all the individuals ' budget constraints we see that the value of the excess demands must equal the value of the excess supplies ( aka Walras Law ) .
( So far , things are not looking good for Say 's Law , because there could be an excess supply of newly - produced goods matched by an equal excess demand for , say , bonds , if everyone wants to save part of their income rather than spend it on newly - produced goods .
But wait a minute . )
What determines the actual quantity traded in a market where there is excess demand or excess supply ?
The standard assumption is that the short side of the market determines quantity traded , since you can't force people to buy more than they want to , or sell more than they want to .
Exchange is voluntary .
For goods in excess demand , quantity traded is determined by supply .
For goods in excess supply , quantity traded is determined by demand .
With some markets not clearing , people are forced to revise their plans , since for some goods they cannot sell all they want ; and for other goods they can not buy all they want .
These revised plans must also be consistent with the individuals ' budget constraints , which means a constraint on an individual 's purchases or sales for one good must spillover to affect his planned purchases and / or sales of some other goods .
For example , suppose people were initially planning an excess demand of $ 100 worth of bonds financed by an excess supply of $ 100 worth of newly - produced goods .
But if you realise you can't actually sell an excess supply of $ 100 worth of newly - produced goods ( and you can't , given the short - side rule ) you realise you can't finance an excess demand of bonds with the proceeds .
Equivalently , if you realise you can't actually buy an excess demand of $ 100 worth of bonds ( and you can 't ) you realise that selling an excess supply of $ 100 worth of newly - produced goods would violate your budget constraint .
Therefore there cannot be an excess supply of $ 100 worth of newly - produced goods .
Say 's Law is right .
In aggregate , people must plan to buy newly - produced goods of a value exactly equal in value to what they expect to sell and earn as income .
They would violate their budget constraints otherwise .
( Just translate the above into math , and write " QED " underneath . )
What 's wrong with the above " proof " of Say 's Law ?
( Apart from the fact that it " proves " that no market can have an excess demand or supply ? )
In a word : money .
Money , qua medium of exchange , is weird .
Every other good has one market , which is either in excess demand or in excess supply .
But money is in every market .
For every other good , an individual is either a buyer , or a seller , but not both .
An individual is either on the short side , or the long side , but not both .
But for money , every individual is both a buyer and a seller .
Suppose initially there is an excess supply of newly - produced goods matched by an equal excess demand for money .
If money were like bonds , people wanting to buy money would be on the long side of the money market , and would be unable to buy more money and so would stop trying to sell more goods .
But money is not like bonds .
Every individual is on the long side of the money market when he tries to earn income by selling newly - produced goods , but on the short side of the money market when he tries to spend income by buying newly - produced goods .
If you can't get more money by selling more newly - produced goods , you can still get more money by buying less newly - produced goods .
( And if newly - produced goods are initially in excess demand , and money in excess supply , you can't get rid of money by buying more goods , but you can still get rid of money by selling less goods ) .
If there are n goods including money , there are n- 1 excess demands or supplies for the n - 1 non-money goods , and also n- 1 excess demands or supplies for money , giving 2 ( n - 1 ) excess demands or supplies in total .
Any " proof " of Say's Law that counts only n excess demands or supplies must be wrong ( except when n=2 , but then money would be redundant anyway , if there were only one non-money good ) .
The most we can say is that in each of the n - 1 markets , the excess demand or supply of the non-money good in that market must equal the excess supply or demand for money in that market .
( And a true barter economy where everything can be traded for anything else has ( n - 1 ) n / 2 markets , not the n markets of my " proof " ) .
Brad DeLong interprets John Cochrane as implicitly assuming that velocity is fixed .
I interpret John Cochrane as implicitly assuming a non-monetary economy .
Both interpretations make sense .
But I think ( hope ? ) mine is more fruitful .
It is not obvious that my " proof " of Say 's Law is wrong , and that it is only the weirdness of money that makes Say 's Law wrong .
I do n't think there 's anything very original in what I have written above .
Take a bit of Clower and Yeager and stir .
Keynesians take disequilibrium seriously , and monetarists take money seriously .
This post belongs in the somewhat narrow intersection of those two sets .
Perhaps what 's wrong with macroeconomics is that fundamental issues like Say 's Law need to be debated in blogs .
Does it get debated anywhere else nowadays ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The top U.S. communications regulator plans to unveil proposals Monday for ensuring Web traffic is not slowed or blocked based on its content , sources familiar with the contents of the speech said on Friday .

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski will announce plans to ask his fellow commissioners to adopt as a rule net neutrality and four existing principles on Internet access issued by the agency in 2005 , one of the sources said .
Net neutrality pits open Internet companies like Google Inc against broadband service providers like AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp , which oppose new rules governing network management .
Advocates of net neutrality say Internet service providers must be barred from blocking or slowing traffic based on its content .
But service providers say the increasing volume of bandwidth - hogging services , like video sharing , requires active management of their networks and some argue that net neutrality could stifle innovation .
“ He is going to announce rulemaking , ” said one source familiar with the speech due to be delivered at the Brookings Institution , a public policy think tank .
The rule proposal will also try to seek greater clarity into what constitutes “ reasonable ” network management by Internet providers .
The FCC could formally propose the rule aimed at both wireless and landline Internet platforms at an open meeting in October .
Because of the implications for applications such as Internet phone calling services , like those provided by eBay Inc ’s Skype and Google , agency staff are expected to propose setting a lengthy public comment period before any final action .
The Monday speech coincides with a deadline for the FCC to file a court brief in a case against Comcast , which is challenging whether the agency has the authority to regulate actions involving the Internet .
The FCC is expected to defend its position by arguing that the agency has broad authority under the 1996 Telecommunications Act .
Public interest groups praised Genachowski for moving forward with a rule that would protect speech and commerce , predicting the policy move would be a big win for consumers .
“ It will be a big win for consumers if the FCC delivers strong net neutrality rules that apply across all technologies , ” Ben Scott , policy director at Free Press , said in a statement .
California has a new endangered species on its hands in the San Joaquin Valley — farmers .
Thanks to environmental regulations designed to protect the likes of the three - inch long delta smelt , one of America 's premier agricultural regions is suffering in a drought made worse by federal regulations .
The result has already been devastating for the state 's farm economy .
In the inland areas affected by the court - ordered water restrictions , the jobless rate has hit 14.3 % , with some farming towns like Mendota seeing unemployment numbers near 40 % .
Statewide , the rate reached 11.6 % in July , higher than it has been in 30 years .
In August , 50 mayors from the San Joaquin Valley signed a letter asking President Obama to observe the impact of the draconian water rules firsthand .

Maddow :
This is what these groups do .
They 're experts at fake grass roots campaigns that promote corporate interests .
Americans for Prosperity is the group that ginned up anti-stimulus rallies earlier this year .
They also organized what they called the " Hot Air Tour " to campaign against the whole idea of global warming .
They were the ones who sent Joe the Plumber around the country to rail against the Employee Free Choice Act , which is pro-labor legislation .
This oil industry and Republican operative billionaires club is according to the Republican party spokesman today , just average middle class Americans .
Just regular American folks sitting around the kitchen table thinking about whether they can get away with saying that the government , continuing its long standing policy of encouraging living wills , is really a secret plot to kill old people .
One other thing about Americans for Prosperity , their most visible spokesman , is a man named Tim Phillips .
He is the President of the organization and we 've asked him to come on the show to talk with us about the group .
Tim Phillips got his start in fake grass roots with a firm called Century Strategies , run by Ralph Reed .
Century Strategies is famous for having duped Christian groups into lobbying for energy deregulation .
You know , like the Bible said .
They were doing that at the behest of Century Strategies ' client , Enron .
Tim Phillips and Ralph Reed were later made even more famous in the Jack Abramoff scandal , for duping Christian groups into lobbying against gambling .
But only in areas where these guys happened to have competing gambling interests as clients .
These guys are the pros .
This is an industry .
Americans are showing up at these events to shout down the discussion , to chase their Congressmen , and they are enraged .
And they 're enraged at least in part because they 're being riled up by over the top , fabricated conspiracy theories about health care .
And they 're being directed and orchestrated by the corporate interests that do this for a living and do it very well .
RecessRally.com is not some organic outgrowth of American anger .
This is how corporate America creates the illusion of a grass roots movement to support their own interests .
This is what they do .
They are professionals .
This is an industry .
To talk about these town hall events as some organic outpouring of average American folks who have concerns about health care is to be willfully blind to what is really going on , which is professional P.R. operatives generating exploitative , manufactured , strategically deployed outrage in order to line their own pocket .
These P.R. spin misters get paid a lot of money for doing it .
The corporations they work for get to kill legislation that would hurt their profits .
And the real people who they launch into these town hall settings after they 're told that health care reform is a secret commie plot to kill old people and to mandate sex changes , those real people get more , and more , and more and more angry , and more , and more , and more alienated , and ultimately they get left , like the rest of us , with a health care system that is broken and does n't work in the interest of the American people , but does work in the interest of the corporations that profit from the way the system is now .
This is professional , corporate funded Republican staffed P.R. , and it should be reported as such .
Amen sister .
I think this is one of the best segments I 've seen her do on this astroturf movement yet .
If we had a few more Rachel Maddows on the air I think we'd have a few less tea baggers , deathers and birthers out there .
There have been international calls for Ms Suu Kyi's release Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to 18 months of house arrest , after a court found her guilty of violating security laws .
Ms Suu Kyi , a 64 - year - old Nobel peace laureate , was on trial for allowing a US national into her lakeside home after he swam there .
Critics of Burma 's military regime say the verdict is designed to prevent her from taking part in elections in 2010 .
Ms Suu Kyi has spent nearly 14 of the past 20 years in detention .
Her American visitor , John Yettaw , was jailed for seven years including four years of hard labour .
Ms Suu Kyi was taken straight back to her home after the end of the trial , officials said .
ANALYSIS Kate McGeown , BBC News website
Asia -Pacific editor
The fact that the Burmese generals have decided to give Aung San Suu Kyi less than the maximum sentence shows they are willing to bow , at least to some extent , to the will of the international community .
But at the same time they still have what they really wanted - Aung San Suu Kyi will now be safely out of the way as they prepare for next year 's elections .
She had always denied the charge but said she expected to be convicted .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was " saddened and angry " by the verdict and described the trial as a " sham " .
In a strongly - worded statement , Mr Brown said it was " a purely political sentence " .
A statement from the office of Nicolas Sarkozy said the French president was calling on the European Union to impose new sanctions on Burma .
The EU presidency said it would impose " additional targeted measures against those responsible for the verdict " .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Aung San Suu Kyi should not have been convicted , and she also called for the release of American citizen John Yettaw .

" We are concerned about the harsh sentence imposed on him , especially in light of his medical condition , " she told reporters .
Mr Yettaw is believed to have epilepsy , diabetes and post - traumatic stress disorder , and has been treated at a Rangoon hospital .
Myint Myint Aye , of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party - the country 's main opposition , said the party did not accept the verdict , adding : " We demand her immediate unconditional release and we will keep on pressing . "
Tight security Journalists had unexpectedly been allowed to enter the court in Rangoon 's Insein prison shortly before the sentence was announced .
The courtroom was initially told that Ms Suu Kyi was sentenced to three years in prison with hard labour .
But after a five - minute recess , Burma 's home minister entered the courtroom and read out a special order from the country 's military ruler Than Shwe that reduced the sentence to 18 months and said it could be served under house arrest .
I am disappointed that they have found her guilty
Anifah Aman ,
Malaysian Foreign Minister
Burmese reaction International reaction Profile : John Yettaw Putting pressure on Burma Than Shwe said he reduced the sentence to " maintain peace and tranquillity " and because Ms Suu Kyi was the daughter of Aung San , a national hero who helped to win Burma 's independence from Britain .
Ms Suu Kyi looked alert but tired during the 90 - minute court appearance .
She stood as the verdict was read out and then thanked foreign diplomats for attending .
" I hope we can all work for peace and prosperity of the country , " she said quietly to diplomats seated nearby .
She then was led out of the courtroom .
There was tight security around the prison , with security forces sealing off the area .
The trial has brought international condemnation , and many analysts say the main reason it was held was to give Burma 's military government an excuse to keep Ms Suu Kyi out of next year 's planned multi-party elections .
Her previous period of house arrest expired on 27 May , and this new term will mean she is still in detention during the polls , which are expected to happen in about May 2010 .
The NLD won the last elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
Mr Yettaw , 54 , swam to Ms Suu Kyi's lakeside house in Rangoon uninvited and stayed there for two nights in May .
Hundreds of police were deployed at Insein prison for the end of the trial
As a result , Ms Suu Kyi was accused of breaching the terms of her house arrest and faced up to five years in prison .
Ms Suu Kyi's two female house companions were also arrested with her .
At the trial they also received the commuted sentence of 18 months house arrest .
Mr Yettaw , of Falcon , Missouri , was sentenced to three years in prison for breaching Ms Suu Kyi's house arrest , three years with hard labour for an immigration offence and another one - year term with hard labour for swimming in a restricted zone .
It was not clear if the prison terms would be served concurrently .
Reports say he was discharged from hospital on Monday night after a week of treatment for epileptic seizures .
But according to the editor of the BBC's Burmese Service , Tin Htar Swe , the regime has no real reason to keep him so his sentence may well be commuted at a later date .

The literature about dogs is not quite the same as the literature about , say , Norwegian rats .
Dogs get the literary respect : there are brilliant memoirs about dogs like J. R. Ackerley ’s “ My Dog Tulip ” and Elizabeth von Arnim ’s “ All the Dogs of My Life ” ; there ’s James Thurber and Virginia Woolf and Jack London ; there ’s Lassie and Clifford and , of course , Marley .
White rats , on the other hand , get most of the scientific attention .
Alexandra Horowitz ’s “ Inside of a Dog : What Dogs See , Smell , and Know ” attempts to rectify that situation , exploring what science tells us about dogs without relegating our pets , emotionally , to lab rats .
As a psychologist with a Ph.D. in cognitive science , as well as an ardent dogophile , Horowitz aims “ to take an informed imaginative leap inside of a dog — to see what it is like to be a dog ; what the world is like from a dog ’s point of view . ”
Her work draws on that of an early - 20th - ­century German biologist , Jakob von Uexküll , who proposed that “ anyone who wants to understand the life of an animal must begin by considering what he called their umwelt . . . : their subjective or ‘ self - world . ’ ” Hard as we may try , a dog ’s - eye view is not immediately accessible to us , however , for we reside within our own umwelt , our own self - world bubble , which clouds our vision .
Consider one of Horowitz ’s examples : a rose .
A human being experiences a rose as a lovely , familiar shape , a bright , beautiful color and a sublime scent .
That is the very definition of a rose .
But to a dog ?
Beauty has nothing to do with it ; the color is irrelevant , barely visible , the flowery scent ignored .
Only when it is adorned with some other important perfume — a recent spray of urine , perhaps — does the rose come alive for a dog .
How about a more practical object ?
Say , a hammer ?
“ To a dog , ” Horowitz points out , “ a hammer does n’t exist .
A dog does n’t act with or on a hammer , and so it has no significance to a dog .
At least , not unless it overlaps with some other , meaningful object : it is wielded by a loved person ; it is urinated on by the cute dog down the street ; its dense wooden handle can be chewed like a stick . ”
Dogs , it seems , are Aristotelians , but with their own doggy teleology .
Their goals are not only radically different from ours ; they are often invisible to us .
To get a better view , Horowitz proposes that we humans get down intellectually on all fours and start sniffing .
Dogs , as anyone who has ever met one knows , sniff a lot .
They are , says Horo­witz , “ creatures of the nose . ”
To help us grasp the magnitude of the difference between the human and the canine olfactory umwelts , she details not only the physical makeup of a dog nose ( a beagle nose has 300 million receptor sites , for example , compared with a human being ’s six million ) , but also the mechanics of the canine snout .
People have to exhale before we can inhale new air .
Dogs do not .
They breath in , then their nostrils quiver and pull the air deeper into the nose as well as out through side slits .
Specialized photography reveals that the breeze generated by dog exhalation helps to pull more new scent in .
In this way , dogs not only hold more scent in at once than we can , but also continuously refresh what they smell , without interruption , the way humans can keep “ shifting their gaze to get another look . ”
Obama administration to seek extension of Patriot Act spy powers
By Patrick Martin
17 September 2009
In a letter from the Justice Department to the Senate Judiciary Committee , the Obama administration has gone on record for the first time supporting the extension of key provisions of the USA Patriot Act , including the notorious provision that gives the federal government the power to subpoena library records of any individual .
Several provisions of the Patriot Act , legislation adopted in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks that grants sweeping surveillance powers to US intelligence agencies , are scheduled to expire December 31 , unless renewed by Congress .
The House and Senate judiciary committees have scheduled hearings next week on the proposed reauthorizations .
In a letter to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont , chairman of the Senate panel , sent Monday and reported in the press Wednesday , Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich argues for reauthorization of three expiring sections of the Patriot Act :
Section 206 , which provides for roving surveillance of targets who take evasive measures like using throw - away cell phones .
In such cases , US intelligence agencies can monitor any telecommunications device that might be used by the suspect , without being compelled to specify the number in advance or get a warrant .
Section 215 , dubbed by civil liberties groups the “ library provision , ” which allows federal agents to obtain business , medical , library and other records simply by presenting a written demand , called a national security letter , to the organization maintaining the records .
This provision has been used 220 times over the past eight years , Justice Department officials said , but it is not clear whether a single letter to a large corporation , like AT&T or Verizon , could be used to make repeated demands for information .
The national security letters must be approved by a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , which almost never rejects such surveillance requests .
The third section has been nickname the “ Lone Wolf ” provision , since it authorizes intelligence gathering against any non-citizen , regardless of whether the individual is suspected of being linked to a foreign government or terrorist organization .
The Obama administration claims that the provision has never been actually used , but that the power needs to be held in reserve in case of need .
Assistant Attorney General Weich claims in his letter to Leahy that the roving wiretap provision has been used only 20 times .
But last March , in testimony before Congress , FBI Director Robert S. Mueller said that his agency alone had used roving wiretaps in terrorism investigations a total of 147 times since 2001 .
The discrepancy only underscores the lack of credibility of all declarations from the spy agencies about their secret surveillance tactics .
In practice , the US intelligence apparatus ( as well as the Pentagon ) conduct their operations without any oversight or accountability , with the complicity of their supposed watchdogs in the congressional intelligence committees .
Section 215 is the most expansive of the three sections , since it allows the FBI and other agencies to demand electronic records of any business , as well as “ any tangible things ” like bank and credit card statements , as well as medical and mental health records , on any individual .
The Obama administration letter explicitly defends the record of the Bush administration in exercising surveillance powers under Section 215 .
Weich writes :
“ At the time of the USA PATRIOT Act , there was concern that the FBI would exploit the broad scope of the business records authority to collect sensitive personal information on constitutionally protected activities , such as the use of public libraries .
This simply has not occurred , even in the environment of heightened terrorist threat activity . ”
The assistant attorney general then argues that the good behavior of the Bush administration justifies an extension of the “ library ” provision :
“ Based upon this operational experience , we believe that the FISA business records authority should be reauthorized .
There will continue to be instances in which FBI investigators need to obtain transactional information that does not fall within the scope of authorities relating to national security letters and are operating in an environment that precludes the use of less secure criminal authorities . ”
The reaction of congressional Democrats to the proposed extension of Patriot Act powers has been overwhelmingly favorable .
In a statement issued Wednesday , Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy said , “ I am pleased that the Justice Department has signaled its willingness to work with Congress in addressing the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act .
It is important that Congress and the executive branch work together to ensure that we protect both our national security and our civil liberties . ”
Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin of Illinois and liberal Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin issued a joint statement favorably contrasting the Obama administration ’s willingness to consult with Congress to the Bush administration ’s simple assertion of executive powers .
The two Democrats are introducing a bill to provide a fig leaf for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act by supposedly tightening the legal standard for obtaining national security letters , including requiring the government to show some “ nexus ” to terrorism .
The two introduced similar legislation previously , with the support of then - Senator Barack Obama .
The Durbin - Feingold bill would repeal the legal immunity given to telecommunications companies that collaborated with illegal government spying .
Obama voted last year in favor of the legislation that granted the telecoms immunity , and his administration strongly opposes any repeal .
The American Civil Liberties Union took essentially the same position as the Senate liberals , calling the administration position on Patriot Act reauthorization “ a mixed bag , ” while hailing its willingness to work with Congress as “ definitely a sea change from what we ’ve seen in the past . ”
On the same day as the Justice Department letter on the Patriot Act , the Obama administration filed an 85 - page legal document with the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia arguing that prisoners at the US - run prison at Bagram , near Kabul , Afghanistan , should not have access to US courts .
A lower federal court ruled that prisoners seized in other countries and taken to Afghanistan by the US government can challenge their detention in US courts through habeas corpus , like the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay .
While Obama has publicly vowed to close Guantánamo Bay by next January , only a handful of the nearly 250 prisoners have been moved to other facilities or released , and the CIA and military are building up Bagram as an even larger facility for interrogation and imprisonment without trial .
There are an estimated 600 detainees now at Bagram , an unknown number of them non-Afghans brought into the country on CIA and military planes .
The Justice Department is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton illegally used her position to benefit Royal Dutch Shell PLC , the company that later hired her , according to officials in federal law enforcement and the Interior Department .
The criminal investigation centers on the Interior Department ’s 2006 decision to award three lucrative oil shale leases on federal land in Colorado to a Shell subsidiary .
Over the years it would take to extract the oil , according to calculations from Shell and a Rand Corp.
expert , the deal could net the company hundreds of billions of dollars .
The investigation ’s main focus is whether Norton violated a law that prohibits federal employees from discussing employment with a company if they are involved in dealings with the government that could benefit the firm , law enforcement and Interior officials said .
They said investigators also were trying to determine if Norton broke a broader federal “ denial of honest services ” law , which says a government official can be prosecuted for violating the public trust by , for example , steering government business to favored firms or friends .

The Interior Department ’s Office of Inspector General began the investigation during the waning months of the George W. Bush administration and more recently made a formal criminal referral to the Justice Department .
Norton is the first Bush official at the Cabinet secretary level to be the subject of a formal political corruption investigation .
Shell spokeswoman Kelly C. op de Weegh declined to comment on behalf of both the company and Norton , who did not respond to numerous calls .
“ Shell has not received an official notification with regard to a government investigation .
Consequently , we are not in a position to comment at this time , ” she said .
The Justice and Interior departments also would not comment .
Interior Department investigators referred the case to the Justice Department after concluding that there was sufficient evidence of potential illegal conduct , according to federal law enforcement and Interior officials .
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive and confidential nature of the case .

Those officials said the referral was based on an already comprehensive Interior Department investigation that included interviews with numerous Interior employees .
The Justice Department has assigned prosecutors from its public integrity section and the U.S. attorney ’s office in Washington to the case .
Norton , 55 , was President Bush ’s first Interior secretary .
She had worked as an Interior Department attorney before being elected Colorado ’s attorney general .
Later , as a private lawyer , she represented mining , timber and oil companies .
As Interior secretary , she embraced an industry - friendly approach to environmental regulation that she called “ cooperative conservation ” and pushed the department to open more public land for energy production .
Norton also backed commercial development of the oil shale reserves buried in the rocks of the Mountain West .
Known as “ the rock that burns , ” oil shale refers to rocks that release liquid petroleum when heated to extreme temperatures .
The highly controversial process promises immense fuel production , but environmentalists argue that it contaminates rugged landscapes and drains precious water .

In early 2006 -- following the recommendations of a team representing several federal agencies and states -- the department announced that it planned to award Shell three oil shale leases .
Norton resigned two months later , saying that she had no job lined up .
In December of that year , Shell announced it had hired Norton as in - house counsel to its unconventional fuels division , which includes oil shale .
The Justice Department , working with Interior Department investigators , is looking into whether Shell received a competitive advantage or other preferential treatment from the Interior Department in the awarding of the leases .
“ If [ Norton ] had feelers out , or was in discussions with Shell in any way , she is absolutely forbidden from participating in any way from doing anything with Shell , ” a law enforcement official said .
The federal government long has sought a cost - effective way to extract the abundant oil resources from Western shale rock .
Advertisement
Then - Vice President Dick Cheney ’s energy task force recommended aggressive steps to encourage private industry to develop such technology .
In response , the Bureau of Land Management issued six oil shale “ research , development and demonstration ” leases .
The leases , five in Colorado and one in Utah , granted access to up to 160 acres of federal land apiece to develop shale programs -- with an option to increase that to 5,000 acres once a technique proved commercially viable .
On average , each of those 5,000 - acre lease tracts holds an estimated $ 700 - billion worth of recoverable oil ( at today ’s $ 70 - per- barrel price ) , said James T. Bartis , a shale expert at Rand .
Shell has estimated the costs of recovering the oil at $ 30 per barrel , leaving a potential profit of about $ 1 trillion after royalties if all the oil is extracted .
Shell was the only company to receive more than one tract .
“ Shell got some of the best lands ” that the government made available , Bartis said .
Advertisement
At the time , critics accused the Interior Department of undermining a central goal of the leases by awarding three of them to Shell .
The leases were meant to allow companies to test distinct methods for extracting shale from rock .
But each of Shell ’s tracts was granted for a variation of the same process .
Critics also raised questions about the fairness of the process , given that Shell filed its first lease application just a day after the department issued its call for proposals in June 2005 .
That August , Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which included a provision that changed federal law to allow companies to hold multiple oil shale leases .
Interior Department officials said they did not notify potential bidders that the law had changed .
Shell , which had lobbied Congress to allow companies to hold more than one lease , quickly filed two more applications , BLM records show .
No other company applied for more than one lease .
Advertisement
The lease proposals were evaluated in the fall of 2005 by the interdisciplinary team that included representatives of several Western governors and from the Energy and Defense departments .
The team ’s recommendations included awarding three leases to Shell .
The Interior Department investigation initially focused on whether agency officials had improperly assisted Shell and other private - sector companies .
Three of the interviewed BLM employees -- who all spoke on condition of anonymity because an investigation was ongoing -- said the questions investigators posed focused on Norton and her role in the lease process .

When I first started hearing about FEMEN , a Ukrainian women ’s organization , I got the impression of a curious hybrid between short skirts and progressive politics – an aggressively visual movement whose members are n’t afraid to , say , dress in next to nothing to highlight their opposition to sex tourism in Ukraine .
But in a way that goes above spectacle , FEMEN ’s young leader , Anna Gutsol , already has a reputation for being an ideologically advanced social activist with strong , if scandalous , convictions .
I recently sat down with Gutsol in a cafe by Kyiv ’s Independence Square , to talk about everything from her organization ’s tactics of harassing sex tourists to the endless debate about women and housework .
Natalia : Before we get into the meat of things , I have to ask – do you ever get scared ?
You must piss off plenty of people .
Anna : Everyone ’s been asking me this question lately .
At this point , I ’m wondering : should I be scared ?
But the thing is , I refuse to .
I believe in what I ’m doing .
And there are plenty of people in Ukraine who are sympathetic to our cause .
Natalia : I ’ve read a lot about FEMEN recently , but I ’d like to hear you describe your organization firsthand .
Anna : FEMEN is based on the idea that girls need to be active participants in society .
And by “ active , ” I do n’t just mean “ active enough to land themselves husbands . ”
We want more women to develop a social consciousness .
We ’re also against the idea of sex tourism and the sex industry in general in Ukraine .
And we want to package our message in a way that ’s going to be appealing to young Ukrainian women .
Look around you , nobody wants to be a Girl Scout here .
Natalia : Your image is definitely not Girl Scout - esque .
Do you get criticized for your provocative social protests ?
Anna :
Of course .
People sneer at us all the time : “ You ’re against the sex industry , but you are all dressing like sex - workers . ”
But Ukrainian sex - workers by and large do n’t own their own bodies .
That ’s not how it works with us .
When one of our girls went topless on Independence Square , she was doing it as a radical act .
And it gets people talking .
Our sexy image causes debate .
You need to have debate if you are ever to move forward .
So many activists have no idea how to engage the media and the public .
They ’re dour , uninteresting .
FEMEN is the opposite of that .
Natalia : Would you describe yourselves as a feminist organization ?
Anna : No .
We use eroticism in our approach and our dress .
That ’s not sanctioned by feminism .
Natalia : Personally , I ’m a feminist and I ’m down with eroticism and revealing clothing .
I bristle when some of my Western compatriots criticize me .
I tell them that this is how every woman in my family looks , and I ’m not about to switch from dresses to burlap sacks because of someone else ’s perverted reaction to the dresses .
Anna : Exactly .
Look , this is part of our culture .
To deliberately make yourself unattractive in Ukraine is to consign yourself to the margins .
That ’s not what we want .
Natalia :
Our culture , of course , has its dark side .
Anna :
Yes , because we conceive of beauty as something that ’s there to be demeaned .
Look at our night clubs .
This is where our young girls go to get groomed to trade on their looks as if it ’s their main function in life .
Showing off your boobs and getting a free drink is promoted as the pinnacle of womanly achievement .
Natalia :
Which brings us to the sex industry .
Why do you so strongly disapprove of it ?
Anna : Ukraine is a very patriarchal society .
Our sex industry is fueled by poverty and , let ’s face it , ignorance .
It ’s a completely immoral , exploitative business .
Natalia :
What do you think of harm reduction and decriminalization in regards to sex - work ?
Anna :
I ’m not going to stand on the street and beat prostitutes over the head with my purse and ask them to reflect upon their deeds .
I think harm reduction is important .
These women should be working without additional risks to their lives .
But let ’s get real about Ukrainian society .
If we decide that prostitution is suddenly OK , all hell will break loose .
Around here , people do n’t think about purchasing sex , they think of it as purchasing a human being .
That ’s very different from , say , a legal brothel in a nation where , perhaps , attitudes are different .
You know , I even heard that in foreign brothels , nobody wants to entertain Russian or Ukrainian clients , because these men have a reputation for serious abuse .
Natalia :
Why do you think this is the case in Ukraine ?
Anna :
We never had a sexual revolution to speak of .
In the Soviet days , we were all repressed .
We ’re still reaping the consequences of that .
You know the old saying : “ there ’s no sex in the Soviet Union . ”
On one level , that was true .
Sex was largely unacknowledged .
I do n’t think that things have improved so much in recent years .
We do n’t have decent sex education in this country .
And we ’re still very sexist .
Natalia : I ’ve read some accounts of what prostitutes around here go through on a regular basis , and have spoken to several , and some of the stories are hair - raisingly horrifying .
Even the people who are supposed to be protecting these women often get in on the act .
Anna : I ’m telling you , the sex industry here is merciless .
So when people talk about decriminalization , or legalization , I have to ask them to stop and think about the implications .
I think our sex - workers need help , but I also worry about the young girls who are set to become sex -workers .
What they ’re getting into is a nightmare .
Natalia : FEMEN has also been actively involved in confronting foreign men who come to this country to get laid .
Why do you choose these methods ?
Anna :
Because foreign men are confronting us !
I ’ve lost count of how many times I ’ve spoken to a girl who was treated like trash by some sex tourist who has decided that Ukraine is his personal playground .
These men come here with attitudes of utter entitlement , and that needs to change .
There is a strong anti-trafficking effort going on now , which is great , but people forget that sex tourism and trafficking can be linked .
How many girls were wooed by some charming foreigner to end up being sold into a brothel abroad ?
The Euro 2012 Football Championship is coming up as well .
Can you imagine how brutal it ’s going to be around here when drunken football fans descend on this country ?
Can you imagine how our women are going to be treated by them ?
Natalia : Flying in and out of this country , I sometimes get stuck next to a really sleazy American or Brit .
Once he ascertains that I want nothing to do with him , he ’ll start pressing me to introduce him to my friends and relatives .
Anna :
Oh , it gets much worse than that .
It can degenerate into street harassment .
Now , I ’m not talking about foreigners who come here to work or study or whatever , I ’m talking about those people who are deliberately here to take advantage of women .
We have groups of young Turkish men literally shouting at women in the street .
I asked a Turkish journalist recently : “ What would happen if groups of Ukrainian men shouted at women like that in , say , Istanbul ? ”
He had a hard time even imagining such a scenario .
Why should it be any different in Ukraine ?
Natalia : Stereotypes about us are pretty cemented .
In the Middle East , I made the mistake of disclosing my ethnic background to a taxi driver once .
He instantly decided I was sexually available .
After that , I ’d just tell people I ’m American .
Of course , they ’d take a good look at me in the rear view mirror and say , “ But you look so Russian ! ”
The way they stared at me when they said it , it was frightening .
Anna : I have a friend who works as a bartender in Germany , and she looks like you – a typical Slav .
She tells everyone she ’s from Finland .
She used to be more honest with people , but then they ’d offer her money to have sex with them .
Pitifully small amounts of money too !
Not only do they think you ’re a whore , they think you ’re a cheap whore , someone whose desperation can exploit .
It is frightening .
And these people do n’t have a clue about the economic and social circumstances that lead so many of our women into this trade .
Or else they are happy to overlook them .
Well , we ’re here to remind them that no , actually , you do n’t get to overlook that .
Natalia : I once sat next to an American at a dinner here in Kiev , and he spent the entire evening talking about how Ukrainian women are disgusting bimbos because so many of us do n’t exactly like to cover up .
Maybe if I had been a FEMEN girl , I ’d have thrown a pie at his face .
Anna :
It ’s strange , is n’t it ?
Foreigners come here and have a completely bizarre reaction to our women .
I say , they need to respect our traditions .
There ’s nothing wrong with women who dress provocatively .
It ’s our style .
Get over it .
The other day , I saw this family on the street : a mother , a father , and a little kid .
The woman was wearing incredibly tiny shorts and had an amazing body .
There was nothing wrong or unnatural about it .
Her husband looked happy to be next to her .
They looked content and in love .
Who the hell has a right to criticize that ?
Natalia : Speaking of love , is it hard for a politically active Ukrainian woman to find it ?
Anna : Sure .
I work in concert organizing , but consider FEMEN to be my actual career .
There ’s a phrase I use a lot right now : “ another one has run away . ”
For me , it ’s hard to find a man who understands me and takes what I do seriously .
But it ’s not impossible either .
There are plenty of men out there who are kind .
Kindness , I think , is what ’s important .
Plus , it ’s not like you have to start out a relationship with talking about politics .
You have to click first .
Natalia :
Do you think Ukrainian men are generally threatened by strong women ?
Anna : I think many Ukrainian men find strong women inconvenient .
Think about your typical Soviet set - up , which is still around nowadays : both partners work , but when the wife comes home at 6 p.m. , she launches herself into housework , while the husband relaxes .
A strong woman may not stand for that .
I ’m not saying this is a problem in every household , but it exists .
It ’s prominent .
Natalia : I ’m struck by how Western women often talk about there being a clear choice between career and home .
I do n’t think Soviet women entertained that notion .
Anna :
A career is something you do devote yourself to immensely .
You make sacrifices .
It ’s not that those sacrifices are necessarily incompatible with having a family , but it can be much harder .
In terms of plain old work – you are right .
Our women did both .
And continue to do both .
And it ’s often very thankless .
Natalia :
So how do you go about changing that mentality wherein a woman is exploited but does n’t do anything about it ?
Anna : I believe that women must be educated about their rights , which is what FEMEN is all about .
Just to give you an example : so many girls do n’t even have a clue that if they ’re being sexually harassed , they have the right to appeal to a police officer for help .
Obviously , not all police officers might care , but we ’ve had positive experiences .
There are good cops out there .
There is good out there in general .
We can change things here .
People tell me , “ hey , Ukraine ’s not so bad , at least child prostitution here is n’t as bad as in Thailand . ”
And I say – oh yeah ?
So should we wait around until it ’s worse than in Thailand ?
No .
We need to be active right now .
That ’s the ultimate goal : helping women get to that stage where more and more of us refuse to be docile , or to be treated as objects , as original sin in the flesh .
I overhead one of our cops say something great to a street harasser the other day ; he said , “ hey , if it ’s not yours , do not touch . ”
If that ’s not wisdom , I do n’t know what is .

Mr. Moussavi said little in his statement about the mission and activities of the new movement , perhaps to avoid giving pretexts for a further crackdown and to keep its potential membership as broad as possible .
In recent weeks , outrage about the abuse of jailed protesters  including some who died in custody  has spread from opposition members to many conservatives .
The controversy has grown even more volatile in the past week , since the reformist cleric and presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi first raised accusations that some male and female prisoners had been raped .
Hard - line clerics and the speaker of Parliament have vehemently denied the claim , and there have been calls for Mr. Karroubi to be arrested , too .
A third session of the mass political trial was set to begin Sunday morning , with 25 new defendants , Press TV reported .
Previous sessions have included confessions by prominent reformists whose friends and relatives said they had been coerced through torture .
Last week , a French researcher and an Iranian employee of the British Embassy in Tehran were forced to take the stand and apologize for their efforts to report on Iran ’s turmoil , prompting angry protests from Britain and France .
In his announcement , Mr. Moussavi countered efforts to portray him as a tool of secular foreigners , affirming his support for institutions like the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij militia , despite the fact that they are widely believed to be in charge of the current crackdown .
But he also lashed out at the recent threats aimed at him and his supporters , saying , “ Instead of accusing this millions - strong group , you should look to those who have created a poisonous propaganda war that served the interests of the enemy . ”
Also on Saturday , Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appointed Sadeq Larijani as the new chief of the judiciary , replacing Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , a conservative .
Mr. Larijani , another conservative and member of Iran ’s powerful Guardian Council , is a brother of Ali Larijani , the Parliament speaker .
The appointment came as Ayatollah Shahroudi ’s term ended and does not appear to be related to the recent controversy over prison abuse and prosecutions of protesters .
When Zin , former girlfriend of a Thai mob boss , falls for Masashi , a Japanese gangster in Thailand , the boss banishes them : Masashi to Japan , and Zin , with her small daughter Zen , to live next to a martial arts school .
Zen is autistic , with uncanny swift reflexes .
She watches the students next door and Muay Thai movies , absorbing every technique .
She 's now a teen , and her mother needs chemotherapy .
Zin has taken in a chubby kid , Moom , who watches over Zen .
Moom finds a ledger listing business men who owe Zin money ; he goes to them one at a time to collect in order to pay for Zin 's treatment .
Zen , with her martial skills , becomes his enforcer .

Mayor Boris Johnson has ordered the River Thames to be reinstated on the London Underground map .
The historic landmark dividing north and south London was removed from the new version by transport bosses who deemed it too cluttered .
Mr Johnson was said to be " furious " after learning about the design change on his return from a trip to New York .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The redesign of the famous Tube map also leaves out the zones which show how much passengers will pay for journeys , and the grid system for finding stations .
Sources suggested the move was met with " a howl of derision " by Mr Johnson and he spoke to Transport for London to make his feelings known .
A spokesman for the mayor 's office said : " The mayor has ordered the river to be reinstated as soon as possible without Transport for London incurring additional costs .
" Transport for London revises its map every few months .
The next change is in December and the map will be revised at that point . "
Transport for London confirmed the new design would change again at the end of the year after listening to Londoners .
A TfL spokesman said : " The overwhelming public reaction is that the Tube and Thames should be reunited , so that 's exactly what we will do .
" New maps showing the Thames will be reintroduced from December , the date of the next scheduled revision of the map .
" We are also looking again at the provision of zonal information to ensure that it is widely available to customers and aim to reach a conclusion on that , also by December , when the new Circle Line service needs to be reflected .

" Over the next few months , we will also see what more can be done to respond to the feedback that we have been receiving on the map becoming too cluttered to be useful . "
Draughtsman Harry Beck based his original Tube map design , including a stylised River Thames , on an electrical circuit .
The map was first handed out to commuters in 1933 .
Passengers had complained that the existing geographical map was too crowded , confusing and hard to read .
The design has since inspired maps for underground networks from New York to Sydney .
Do n’t Let the Notes Get in the Way of the Music
I went to my grandson ’s piano recital last weekend .
He ’s just seven ( almost eight ) and he ’s really good for his age .
His part of the recital was only a few minutes , but the entire recital lasted two hours so we listened to a lot of other kids before and after my grandson .
What struck me in listening to all of these kids is how few of them actually produce something that feels like music .
They can put the notes together in a way that sounds like music , but there ’s no feeling involved .
Most of them are in the early stages of learning and they ’re still focused on getting the notes right .
If they trip over a note , they just back up and play it again , sometimes two or three times .
There is music to enjoy somewhere underneath the notes they ’re trying to play , but only a few of the kids actually convey the spirit of the piece they ’re playing .
I see the same thing happening in many business organizations — both in IT and outside of IT .
We have a tendency to get so caught up in our day - to - day activities that we ( a ) stop enjoying what we ’re doing and ( b ) lose track of our overall objectives .
And I think the two things are related : when we lose our focus we lose our enjoyment .
Stephen Covey has written about this problem in his books .
He says that we tend to confuse what ’s urgent with what ’s important .
The ringing phone is urgent , the boss asking you a question is urgent , but creating a new business process for your company is important .
Turning in a revised budget on time is urgent , filling out a performance appraisal is urgent , but hiring and developing the right employees is important .
Getting a paycheck is urgent , getting a promotion is urgent , but spending time with your family is important .
Things You Can Do to Help Your Focus
It takes conscious effort every minute of every day to focus ourselves on what ’s important .
And since we often get distracted , we need to take steps to keep our focus .
Here are a few things I ’ve learned over the years :
Schedule a small block of time every day or every week .
Explicitly book the time in your calendar so nothing will be scheduled on top of it .
Use the block of time to think about how you can better focus what you ’re doing on what ’s important .
Set a periodic alarm on your PC ( here ‘s some free software I use ) or on your iPhone or PDA or even your watch .
When the alarm goes off , think to yourself , “ Is what I was just doing the most important use of my time ? ”
Do this for a while and you can gradually decrease the frequency of your reminders .
Keep a log of how you ’re spending your time .
Then after a week or so take a look at the log and see if you think you ’re spending your time on the most important things .
If you have trouble keeping a log , then combine this with the periodic alarm idea .
Whenever the alarm goes off , write down a few words to say what you were doing since the last alarm .
Or if you want to simplify this process , make up a log page in advance for each day ( Use spreadsheet software , then print it out ) .
Have each row correspond to the time interval for your log ( start with an interval of 15 or 30 minutes ) , and have each column correspond to a list of common things you do ( e.g. , talking to customers , generating new ideas , teaching employees , answering email , budgeting , twittering , etc. ) .
Then when the alarm goes off , put a check mark in the correct column for the row corresponding to the current time .
The last two items will take some extra effort on your part , but they ’re primarily learning exercises .
Once you ’ve done the exercises for a few weeks and you have a pretty good idea what you ’re doing wrong , you can discontinue those periodic alarms and just schedule daily , weekly or monthly “ self - focus sessions ” on your calendar .
Conclusion
Life is full of urgent tasks , but to get the most out of our lives we have to focus on what ’s important .
In music it ’s the feel of the song that ’s important — the way it affects your emotions .
Do n’t let the notes get in the way of the music , and do n’t let the urgent get in the way of the important .
Hull City have completed the £ 3 million signing of Seyi Olofinjana and agreed a loan deal for Jozy Altidore .
Olofinjana arrives from Stoke and Altidore on loan from Villarreal
Hull City have completed the £ 3 million signing of Seyi Olofinjana from Stoke City and agreed a loan deal for Jozy Altidore .
Olofinjana has opted to sign a four - year contract at the KC Stadium after turning down the chance to join French outfit Monaco .
He only joined the Potters last summer from Wolves , but struggled to command a first - team spot in Tony Pulis ' side in the second half of last season .
Pulis admitted on Wednesday that he would be strengthening a Premier League rival by selling Olofinjana to Hull , but he did not want to hinder the Nigerian 's career .
Tigers boss Phil Brown has also continued his recruitment drive by bringing in Altidore , subject to the United States international receiving a work permit .
Altidore joins on loan for the season from Villarreal with the option for the striker to secure a permanent deal with the Tigers .
Hegel 's Philosophy of Right
First Part : Abstract Right
i Property
A : Possession - B : Use - C : Alienation
§ 41
A person must translate his freedom into an external sphere in order to exist as Idea .
Personality is the first , still wholly abstract , determination of the absolute and infinite will , and therefore this sphere distinct from the person , the sphere capable of embodying his freedom , is likewise determined as what is immediately different and separable from him .
Addition :
The rationale of property is to be found not in the satisfaction of needs but in the supersession of the pure subjectivity of personality .
In his property a person exists for the first time as reason .
Even if my freedom is here realised first of all in an external thing , and so falsely realised , nevertheless abstract personality in its immediacy can have no other embodiment save one characterised by immediacy .
§ 42
What is immediately different from free mind is that which , both for mind and in itself , is the external pure and simple , a thing , something not free , not personal , without rights .
0 P >
Remark : ' Thing ' , like ' the objective ' , has two opposed meanings .
If we say ' that 's the thing ' or ' the thing is what matters , not the person ' , ' thing ' means what is substantive .
On the other hand , when ' thing ' is contrasted with ' Person ' as such , not with the particular subject , it means the opposite of what is substantive , i.e. that whose determinate character lies in its pure externality .
From the point of view of free mind , which must , of course , be distinguished from mere consciousness , the external is external absolutely , and it is for this reason that the determinate character assigned to nature by the concept is inherent externality .
Addition : Since a thing lacks subjectivity , it is external not merely to the subject but to itself .
Space and time are external in this way .
As sentient , I am myself external , spatial , and temporal .
As receptive of sensuous intuitions , I receive them from something which is external to itself .
An animal can intuit , but the soul of an animal has for its object not its soul , itself , but something external .
§ 43
As the concept in its immediacy , and so as in essence a unit , a person has a natural existence partly within himself and partly of such a kind that he is related to it as to an external world .
It is only these things in their immediacy as things , not what they are capable of becoming through the mediation of the will , i.e. things with determinate characteristics , which are in question here where the topic under discussion is personality , itself at this point still in its most elementary immediacy .
Remark : Mental aptitudes , erudition , artistic skill , even things ecclesiastical ( like sermons , masses , prayers , consecration of votive objects ) , inventions , and so forth , become subjects of a contract , brought on to a parity , through being bought and sold , with things recognised as things .
It may be asked whether the artist , scholar , &c. , is from the legal point of view in possession of his art , erudition , ability to preach a sermon , sing a mass , &c. , that is , whether such attainments are ' things ' .
We may hesitate to call such abilities , attainments , aptitudes , &c. , ' things ' , for while possession of these may be the subject of business dealings and contracts , as if they were things , there is also something inward and mental about it , and for this reason the Understanding may be in perplexity about how to describe such possession in legal terms , because its field of vision is as limited to the dilemma that this is ' either a thing or not a thing ' as to the dilemma ' either finite or infinite ' .
Attainments , erudition , talents , and so forth , are , of course , owned by free mind and are some thing internal and not external to it , but even so , by expressing them it may embody them in something external and alienate them ( see below ) , and in this way they are put into the category of ' things ' .
Therefore the are not immediate at the start but only acquire this character through the mediation of mind which reduces its inner possessions to immediacy and externality .
It was an unjustifiable and unethical proviso of Roman law that children were from their father 's point of view ' things ' .
Hence he was legally the owner of his children , although , of course , he still also stood to them in the ethical relation of love ( though this relation must have been much weakened by the injustice of his legal position ) .
Here , then , the two qualities ' being a thing ' and ' not being a thing ' were united , though quite wrongly .
In the sphere of abstract right , we are concerned only with the person as person , and therefore with the particular ( which is indispensable if the person 's freedom is to have scope and reality ) only in so far as it is something separable from the person and immediately different from him , no matter whether this separability constitutes the essential nature of the particular , or whether the particular receives it only through the mediation of the subjective will .
Hence in this sphere we are concerned with mental aptitudes , erudition , &c. , only in so far as they are possessions in a legal sense ; we have not to treat here the possession of our body and mind which we can achieve through education , study , habit , &c. , and which exists as an inward property of mind .
But it is not until we come to deal with alienations that we need begin to speak of the transition of such mental property into the external world where it falls under the category of property in the legal sense .
§ 44
A person has as his substantive end the right of putting his will into any and every thing and thereby making it his , because it has no such end in itself and derives its destiny and soul from his will .
This is the absolute right of appropriation which man has over all ' things ' .
Remark :
The so - called ' philosophy ' which attributes reality in the sense of self - subsistence and genuine independent self - enclosed existence to unmediated single things , to the non-personal , is directly contradicted by the free will 's attitude to these things .
The same is true of the other philosophy which assures us that mind cannot apprehend the truth or know the nature of the thing - in - itself .
While so - called ' external ' things have a show of self - subsistence for consciousness , intuition , and representative thinking , the free will idealises that type of actuality and so is its truth .
Addition :
All things may become man 's property , because man is free will and consequently is absolute , while what stands over against him lacks this quality .
Thus everyone has the right to make his will the thing or to make the thing his will , or in other words to destroy the thing and transform it into his own ; for the thing , as externality , has no end in itself ; it is not infinite self - relation but something external to itself .
A living thing too ( an animal ) is external to itself in this way and is so far itself a thing .
Only the will is the infinite , absolute in contrast with everything other than itself , while that other is on its side only relative .
Thus ' to appropriate ' means at bottom only to manifest the pre-eminence of my will over the thing and to prove that it is not absolute , is not an end in itself .
This is made manifest when I endow the thing with some purpose not directly its own .
When the living thing becomes my property , I give to it a soul other than the one it had before , I give to it my soul .
The free will , therefore , is the idealism which does not take things as they are to be absolute , while realism pronounces them to be absolute , even if they only exist in the form of finitude .
Even an animal has gone beyond this realist philosophy since it devours things and so proves that they are not absolutely self - subsistent .
§ 45
To have power over a thing ab extra constitutes possession .
The particular aspect of the matter , the fact that I make something my own as a result of my natural need , impulse , and caprice , is the particular interest satisfied by possession .
But I as free will am an object to myself in what I possess and thereby also for the first time am an actual will , and this is the aspect which constitutes the category of property , the true and right factor in possession .
Remark :
If emphasis is placed on my needs , then the possession of property appears as a means to their satisfaction , but the true position is that , from the standpoint of freedom , property is the first embodiment of freedom and so is in itself a substantive end .
§ 46
Since my will , as the will of a person , and so as a single will , becomes objective to me in property , property acquires the character of private property ; and common property of such a nature that it may be owned by separate persons acquires the character of an inherently dissoluble partnership in which the retention of my share is explicitly a matter of my arbitrary preference .
Remark :
The nature of the elements makes it impossible for the use of them to become so particularised as to be the private possession of anyone .
In the Roman agrarian laws there was a clash between public and private ownership of land .
The latter is the more rational and therefore had to be given preference even at the expense of other rights .
One factor in family testamentary trusts contravenes the right of personality and so the right of private property .
But the specific characteristics pertaining to private property may have to be subordinated to a higher sphere of right ( e.g. to a society or the state ) , as happens , for instance , when private property is put into the hands of a so - called ' artificial ' person and into mortmain .
Still , such exceptions to private property cannot be grounded in chance , in private caprice , or private advantage , but only in the rational organism of the state .
The general principle that underlies Plato 's ideal state violates the right of personality by forbidding the holding of private property .
The idea of a pious or friendly and even a compulsory brotherhood of men holding their goods in common and rejecting the principle of private property may readily present itself to the disposition which mistakes the true nature of the freedom of mind and right and fails to apprehend it in its determinate moments .
As for the moral or religious view behind this idea , when Epicurus 's friends proposed to form such an association holding goods in common , he forbade them , precisely on the ground that their proposal betrayed distrust and that those who distrusted each other were not friends .
Addition :
In property my will is the will of a person ; but a person is a unit and so property becomes the personality of this unitary will .
Since property is the means whereby I give my will an embodiment , property must also have the character of being ' this ' or ' mine ' .
This is the important doctrine of the necessity of private property .
While the state may cancel private ownership in exceptional cases , it is nevertheless only the state that can do this ; but frequently , especially in our day , private property has been re-introduced by the state .
For example , many states have dissolved the monasteries , and rightly , for in the last resort no community has so good a right to property as a person has .
§ 47
As a person , I am myself an immediate individual ; if we give further precision to this expression , it means in the first instance that I am alive in this bodily organism which is my external existence ) universal in content and undivided , the real pre-condition of every further determined mode of existences
But , all the same , as person , I possess my life and my body , like other things , only in so far as my will is in them .
Remark :
The fact that , considered as existing not as the concept explicit but only as the concept in its immediacy , I am alive and have a bodily organism , depends on the concept of life and on the concept of mind as soul — on moments which are taken over here from the Philosophy of Nature and from Anthropology .
I possess the members of my body , my life , only so long as I will to possess them .
An animal cannot maim or destroy itself , but a man can .
Addition : Animals are in possession of themselves ; their soul is in possession of their body .
But they have no right to their life , because they do not will it .
§ 48
In so far as the body is an immediate existent , it is not in conformity with mind .
If it is to be the willing organ and soul - endowed instruments of mind , it must first be taken into possession by mind ( see § 57 ) .
But from the point of view of others , I am in essence a free entity in my body while my possession of it is still immediate .
Remark :
It is only because I am alive as a free entity in my body that this living existent ought not to be misused by being made a beast of burden .
While I am alive , my soul ( the concept and , to use a higher term , the free entity ) and my body are not separated ; my body is the embodiment of my freedom and it is with my body that I feel .
It is therefore only abstract sophistical reasoning which can so distinguish body and soul as to hold that the ' thing - in - itself ' , the soul , is not touched or attacked if the body is maltreated and the existent embodiment of personality is subjected to the power of another .
I can withdraw into myself out of my bodily existence and make my body something external to myself ; particular feelings I can regard as something outside me and in chains I can still be free .
But this is my will ; so far as others are concerned , I am in my body .
To be free from the point of view of others is identical with being free in my determinate existence .
If another does violence to my body , he does violence to me .
If my body is touched or suffers violence , then , because I feel , I am touched myself actually , here and now .
This creates the distinction between personal injury and damage to my external property , for in such property my will is not actually present in this direct fashion .
§ 49
In relation to external things , the rational aspect is that I possess property , but the particular aspect comprises subjective aims , needs , arbitrariness , abilities , external circumstances , and so forth ( see § 45 ) .
On these mere possession as such depends , but this particular aspect has in this sphere of abstract personality not yet been established as identical with freedom .
What and how much I possess , therefore , is a matter of indifference so far as rights are concerned .
Remark :
If at this stage we may speak of more persons than one , although no such distinction has yet been made , then we may say that in respect of their personality persons are equal .
But this is an empty tautology , for the person , as something abstract , has not yet been particularised or established as distinct in some specific way .
' Equality ' is the abstract identity of the Understanding ; reflective thought and all kinds of intellectual mediocrity stumble on it at once when they are confronted by the relation of unity to a difference .
At this point , equality could only be the equality of abstract persons as such , and therefore the whole field of possession , this terrain of inequality , falls outside it .
The demand sometimes made for an equal division of land , and other available resources too , is an intellectualism all the more empty and superficial in that at the heart of particular differences there lies not only the external contingency of nature but also the whole compass of mind , endlessly particularised and differentiated , and the rationality of mind developed into an organism .
We may not speak of the injustice of nature in the unequal distribution of possessions and resources , since nature is not free and therefore is neither just nor unjust .
That every one ought to have subsistence enough for his needs is a moral wish and thus vaguely expressed is well enough meant , but like anything that is only well meant it lacks objectivity .
On the other hand , subsistence is not the same as possession and belongs to another sphere , i.e. to civil society .
Addition :
The equality which might be set up , e.g. in connection with the distribution of goods , would all the same soon be destroyed again , because wealth depends on diligence .
But if a project cannot be executed , it ought not to be executed .
Of course men are equal , but only qua persons , that is , with respect only to the source from which possession springs ; the inference from this is that everyone must have property .
Hence , if you wish to talk of equality , it is this equality which you must have in view .
But this equality is something apart from the fixing of particular amounts , from the question of how much I own .
From this point of view it is false to maintain that justice requires everyone 's property to be equal , since it requires only that everyone shall own property .
The truth is that particularity is just the sphere where there is room for inequality and where equality would be wrong .
True enough , men often lust after the goods of others , but that is just doing wrong , since right is that which remains indifferent to particularity .
§ 50
The principle that a thing belongs to the person who happens to be the first in time to take it into his possession is immediately self - explanatory and superfluous , because a second person cannot take into his possession what is already the property of another .
Addition :
The points made so far have been mainly concerned with the proposition that personality must be embodied in property .
Now the fact that the first person to take possession of a thing should also be its owner is an inference from what has been said .
The first is the rightful owner , however , not because he is the first but because he is a free will , for it is only by another 's succeeding him that he becomes the first .
§ 51
Since property is the embodiment of personality , my inward idea and will that something is to be mine is not enough to make it my property ; to secure this end occupancy is requisite .
The embodiment which my willing thereby attains involves its recognisability by others .
The fact that a thing of which I can take possession is a res nullius is ( see § 50 ) a self - explanatory negative condition of occupancy , or rather it has a bearing on the anticipated relation to others .
Addition : A person puts his will into a thing - that is just the concept of property , and the next step is the realisation of this concept .
The inner act of will which consists in saying that something is mine must also become recognisable by others .
If I make a thing mine , I give to it a predicate , ' mine ' , which must appear in it in an external form and must not simply remain in my inner will .
It often happens that children lay stress on their prior willing in preference to the seizure of a thing by others .
But for adults this willing is not sufficient , since the form of subjectivity must be removed and must work its way beyond the subjective to objectivity .
§ 52
Occupancy makes the matter of the thing my property , since matter in itself does not belong to itself .
Remark : Matter offers resistance to me — and matter is nothing except the resistance it offers to me — that is , it presents itself to my mind as something abstractly independent only when my mind is taken abstractly as sensations ( Sense - perception perversely takes mind as sensation for the concrete and mind as reason for the abstract . )
In relation to the will and property , however , this independence of matter has no truth .
Occupancy , as an external activity whereby we actualise our universal right of appropriating natural objects , comes to be conditioned by physical strength , cunning , dexterity , the means of one kind or another whereby we take physical possession of things .
Owing to the qualitative differences between natural objects , mastery and occupancy of these has an infinite variety of meanings and involves a restriction and contingency that is just as infinite .
Apart from that , a ' kind ' of thing , or an element as such , is not the correlative object of an individual person .
Before it can become such and be appropriated , it must first be individualised into single parts , into a breath of air or a drink of water .
In the fact that it is impossible to take possession of an external ' kind ' of thing as such , or of an element , it is not the external physical impossibility which must be looked on as ultimate , but the fact that a person , as will , is characterised as individual , while as person he is at the same time immediate individuality ; hence as person he is related to the external world as to single things ( see Remark to § 13 and § 43 ) .
Thus the mastery and external possession of things becomes , in ways that again are infinite , more or less indeterminate and incomplete .
Yet matter is never without an essential form of its own and only because it has one is it anything .
The more I appropriate this form , the more do I enter into actual possession of the thing .
The consumption of food is an out and out alteration of its qualitative character , the character on the strength of which it was what it was before it was eaten .
The training of my body in dexterity , like the training of my mind , is likewise a more or less complete occupancy and penetration of it .
It is my mind which of all things I can make most completely my own .
Yet this actual occupancy is different from property as such because property is complete as the work of the free will alone .
In face of the free will , the thing retains no property in itself even though there still remains in possession , as an external relation to an object , something external .
The empty abstraction of a matter without properties which , when a thing is my property , is supposed to remain outside me and the property of the thing , is one which thought must master .
Addition : In Science of Rights , § 19 A , maintains that the farmer has no right to his land as such but only to its products , to its ' accidents ' , not to its ' substance ' ; he may not prevent others from grazing cattle on it after harvest , unless , in addition to cultivation rights , he has grazing rights for cattle of his own .
Thus , Fichte has raised the question whether the matter too belongs to me if I impose a form on it .
On his argument , after I had made a golden cup , it would have to be open to someone else to take the gold provided that in so doing he did no damage to my work .
However separable the matter may be in thought , still in reality this distinction is an empty subtlety , because , if I take possession of a field and plough it , it is not only the furrow that is my property , but the rest as well , the furrowed earth .
That is to say , I will to take this matter , the whole thing , into my possession ; the matter therefore does not remain a res nullius nor does it remain I its own property .
Further , even if the matter remains external to the form which I have given to the object , the form is precisely a sign that I claim the thing as mine .
The thing therefore does not remain external to my will or outside what I have willed .
Hence there is nothing left to be taken into possession by someone else .
§ 53
Property has its modifications determined in the course of the will 's relation to the thing .
This relation is
( A ) taking possession of the thing directly ( here it is in the thing qua something positive that the will has its embodiment ) ;
( B ) use ( the thing is negative in contrast with the will and so it is in the thing as something to be negated that the will has its embodiment ) ;
( C ) alienation , the reflection of the will back from the thing into itself .
These three are respectively the positive , negative , and infinite judgments of the will on the thing .
A. Taking Possession
§ 54
We take possession of a thing [ a ] by directly grasping it physically , [ b ] by forming it , and [ c ] by merely marking it as ours .
Addition :
These modes of taking possession involve the advance from the category of singularity to that of universality .
It is only of a single thing that we can take possession physically , while marking a thing as mine is taking possession of it in idea .
In the latter case I have an idea of the thing and mean that the thing as a whole is mine , not simply the part which I can take into my possession physically .
§ 55
[ a ]
From the point of view of sensation , to grasp a thing physically is the most complete of these modes , because then I am directly present in this possession , and therefore my will is recognisable in it .
But at bottom this mode is only subjective , temporary , and seriously restricted in scope , as well as by the qualitative nature of the things grasped .
—
As a result of the connection which I may effect between something and things which have already become my property in other ways , or into which something may otherwise be accidentally brought , the scope of this method is somewhat enlarged , and the same result is produced by other means also .
Remark : Mechanical forces , weapons , tools , extend the range of my power .
Connections between my property and something else may be regarded as making it more easily possible for me than for another owner , or sometimes possible for me alone , to take possession of something or to make use of it .
Instances of such connections are that my land may be on the seashore , or on a river bank ; or my estate may march with hunting country or pasture or land useful for some other purposes stone or other mineral deposits may be under my fields ; there may be treasure in or under my ground , and so on .
The same is true of connections made by chance and subsequent to possession , like some of what are called ' natural accessions ' , such as alluvial deposits , &c. , and jetsam .
( Fetura is an accession to my wealth too , but the connection here is an organic one , it is not a case of a thing being added ab extra to another thing already in my possession ; and therefore fetura is of a type quite different from the other accessions . )
Alternatively , the addition to my property may be looked upon as a non-self - subsistent accident of the thing to which it has been added .
In every case , however , these are external conjunctions whose bond of connection is neither life nor the concept .
It devolves , therefore , on the Understanding to adduce and weigh their pros and cons , and on positive legislation to make decisions about them in accordance with the extent to which the relation between the things conjoined has or has not any essentiality .
Addition : Taking possession is always piece - meal in type ; I take into possession no more than what I touch with my body .
But here comes the second point : external objects extend further than I can grasp .
Therefore , whatever I have in my grasp is linked with something else .
It is with my hand that I manage to take possession of a thing , but its reach can be extended .
What I hold in my hand - that magnificent tool which no animal possesses - can itself be a means to gripping something else .
If I am in possession of something , the intellect immediately draws the inference that it is not only the immediate object in my grasp which is mine but also what is connected with it .
At this point positive law must enact its statutes since nothing further on this topic can be deduced from the concept .
§ 56
[ b ]
When I impose a form on something , the thing 's determinant character as mine acquires an independent externality and ceases to be restricted to my presence here and now and to the direct presence of my awareness and will .
Remark :
To impose a form on a thing is the mode of taking possession most in conformity with the Idea to this extent , that it implies a union of subject and object , although it varies endlessly with the qualitative character of the objects and the variety of subjective aims .
Under this head there also falls the formation of the organic .
What I do to the organic does not remain external to it but is assimilated by it .
Examples are the tilling of the soil , the cultivation of plants , the taming in and feeding of animals , the preservation of game , as well as contrivances for utilising raw materials or the forces of nature and processes for making one material produce effects on another , and so forth .
Addition :
This forming of an object may in practice assume the most various guises .
In farming land I impose a form on it .
Where inorganic objects are concerned , the imposition of a form is not always direct .
For example , if I build a windmill , I have not imposed a form on the air , but I have formed something for utilising the air , though I am not on that account at liberty to call the air mine , since I have not formed the air itself .
Further , the preserving of game may be regarded as a way of forming game , for we preserve it with a view to maintaining the species .
[ The same is true of ] the taming of animals , only of course that is a more direct way of forming them and it depends on me to a greater extent .
§ 57 .
Man , pursuant to his immediate existence within himself , is something natural , external to his concept .
It is only through the development of his own body and mind , essentially through his self - consciousness 's apprehension of itself as free , that he takes possession of himself and becomes his own property and no one else's .
Remark :
This taking possession of oneself , looked at from the opposite point view , is the translation into actuality of what one is according to one 's concept , i.e. a potentiality , capacity , potency .
In that translation one 's self - consciousness for the first time becomes established as one 's own , as one 's object also and distinct from self - consciousness pure and simple , and thereby capable of taking the form of a ' thing ' ( compare Remark to § 43 ) .
The alleged justification of slavery ( by reference to all its proximate beginnings through physical force , capture in war , saving and preservation of life , upkeep , education , philanthropy , the slave 's own acquiescence , and so forth ) , as well as the justification of a slave - ownership as simple lordship in general , and all historical views of the justice of slavery and lordship , depend on regarding man as a natural entity pure and simple , as an existent not in conformity with its concept ( an existent also to which arbitrariness is appropriate ) .
The argument for the absolute injustice of slavery , on the other hand , adheres to the concept of man as mind , as something inherently free .
This view is one - sided in regarding man as free by nature , or in other words it takes the concept as such in its immediacy , not the Idea , as the truth .
This antinomy rests , like all others , on the abstract thinking which asserts both the moments of an Idea in separation from one another and clings to each of them in its independence and so in its inadequacy to the Idea and in its falsity .
Free mind consists precisely ( see § 21 ) in its being no longer implicit or as concept alone , but in its transcending this formal stage of its being , and eo ipso its immediate natural existence , until the existence which it gives to itself is one which is solely its own and free .
The side of the antinomy which asserts the concept of freedom therefore has the merit of implying the absolute starting - point , though only the starting - point , for the discovery of truth , while the other side goes no further than existence without the concept and therefore excludes the outlook of rationality and right altogether .
The position of the free will , with which right and the science of right begin , is already in advance of the false position at which man , as a natural entity and only the concept implicit , is for that reason capable of being enslaved .
This false , comparatively primitive , phenomenon of slavery is one which befalls mind when mind is only at the level of consciousness .
The dialectic of the concept and of the purely immediate consciousness of freedom brings about at that point the fight for recognition and the relationship of master and slave .
But that objective mind , the content of the right , should no longer be apprehended in its subjective concept alone , and consequently that man 's absolute unfitness for slavery should no longer be apprehended as a mere ' ought to be ' , is something which does not come home to our minds until we recognise that the Idea of freedom is genuinely actual only as the state .
Addition :
To adhere to man 's absolute freedom - one aspect of the matter - is eo ipso to condemn slavery .
Yet if a man is a slave , his own will is responsible for his slavery , just as it is its will which is responsible if a people is subjugated .
Hence the wrong of slavery lies at the door , not simply of enslavers or conquerors , but of the slaves and the conquered themselves .
Slavery occurs in man 's transition from the state of nature to genuinely ethical conditions ; it occurs in a world where a wrong is still right .
At that stage wrong has validity and so is necessarily in place .
§ 58
[ c ]
The mode of taking possession which in itself is not actual but is only representative of my will is to mark the thing , and the meaning of the mark is supposed to be that I have put my will into the thing .
In its objective scope and its meaning , this mode of taking possession is very indeterminate .
Addition :
To take possession by marking a thing is of all sorts of taking possession the most complete , since the mark is implicitly at work to some extent in the other sorts too .
When I grasp a thing or form it , this also means in the last resort that I mark it , and mark it for others , in order to exclude them and show that I have put my will into the thing .
The notion of the mark , that is to say , is that the thing does not count as the thing which it is but as what it is supposed to signify .
A cockade , for instance , signifies citizenship of a state , though the colour has no connection with the nation and represents not itself but the nation .
By being able to give a mark to things and thereby to acquire them , man just shows his mastery over things .
B. Use of the Thing
§ 59
By being taken into possession , the thing acquires the predicate ' mine ' and my will is related to it positively .
Within this identity , the thing is equally established as something negative , and my will in this situation is a particular will , i.e. need , inclination , and so forth .
Yet my need , as the particular aspect of a single will , is the positive element which finds satisfaction , and the thing , as something negative in itself , exists only for my need and is at its service . —
The use of the thing is my need being externally realised through the change , destruction , and consumption of the thing .
The thing thereby stands revealed as naturally self - less and so fulfils its destiny .
Remark :
The fact that property is realised and actualised only in use floats before the minds of those who look upon property as derelict and a res nullius if it is not being put to any use , and who excuse its unlawful occupancy on the ground that it has not been used by its owner .
But the owner 's will , in accordance with which a thing is his , is the primary substantive basis of property ; use is a further modification of property , secondary to that universal basis , and is only its manifestation and particular mode .
Addition :
While in marking a thing I am taking possession in a universal way of the thing as such , the use of it implies a still more universal relation to the thing , because , when it is used , the thing in its particularity is not recognised but is negated by the user .
When I mark a thing as mine , I attribute to it the universal predicate ' mine ' and ' recognise ' its particular characteristics in the sense that I do not interfere with them .
But when I use it I ' negate ' its particular characteristics in the sense that I change them to suit my purpose .
To mark land as mine by fencing it does not change its character , but to use it , e.g. by planting it , does .
The thing is reduced to a means to the satisfaction of my need .
When I and the thing meet , an identity is established and therefore one or other must lose its qualitative character .
But I am alive , a being who wills and is truly affirmative ; the thing on the other hand is something physical .
Therefore the thing must b destroyed while I preserve myself .
This , in general terms , is the prerogative and the principle of the organic .
§ 60
To use a thing by grasping it directly is in itself to take possession of a single thing here and now .
But if my use of it is grounded on a persistent need , and if I make repeated use of a product which continually renews itself , restricting my use if necessary to safeguard that renewal , then these and other circumstances transform the direct single grasp of the thing into a mark , intended to signify that I am taking it into my possession in a universal way , and thereby taking possession of the elemental or organic basis of such products , or of anything else that conditions them .
§ 61
Since the substance of the thing which is my property is , if we take the thing by itself , its externality , i.e. its non-substantiality — in contrast with me it is not an end in itself ( see § 42 ) and since in my use or employment of it this externality is realised , it follows that my full use or employment of a thing is the thing in its entirety , so that if I have the full use of the thing I am its owner .
Over and above the entirety of its use , there is nothing left of the thing which could be the property of another .
Addition :
The relation of use to property is the same as that of substance to accident , inner to outer , force to its manifestation .
Just as force exists only in manifesting itself , so arable land is amble land only in bearing crops .
Thus he who has the use of arable land is the owner of the whole , and it is an empty abstraction to recognise still another property in the object itself .
§ 62
My merely partial or temporary use of a thing , like my partial or temporary possession of it ( a possession which itself is simply the partial or temporary possibility of using it ) is therefore to be distinguished from ownership of the thing itself .
If the whole and entire use of a thing were mine , while the abstract ownership was supposed to be someone else 's , then the thing as mine would be penetrated through and through by my will ( see §s 52 and 61 ) , and at the same time there would remain in the thing something impenetrable by me , namely the will , the empty will , of another .
As a positive will , I would be at one and the same time objective and not objective to myself in the thing — an absolute contradiction .
Ownership therefore is in essence free and complete .
Remark :
To distinguish between the right to the whole and entire use of a thing and ownership in the abstract is the work of the empty Understanding for which the Idea — i.e. in this instance the unity of ( a ) ownership ( or even the person 's will as such ) and ( b ) its realisation — is not the truth , but for which these two moments in their separation from one another pass as something which is true .
This distinction , then , as a relation in the world of fact , is that of an overlord to nothing , and this might be called an ' insanity of personality '( if we may mean by ' insanity ' not merely the presence of a direct contradiction between a man 's purely subjective ideas and the actual facts of his life ) , because ' mine ' as applied to a single object would have to mean the direct presence in it of both my single exclusive will and also the single exclusive will of someone else .
In the Institutes we read : 'usufruct is the right of using another 's property , of enjoying its fruits short of waste of its substance ...
Nevertheless , in order that properties should not remain wholly unused through the entire cessation of usufruct , the law has been pleased to ordain that in certain circumstances the right of usufruct shall be annulled and that the owner proper shall resume the land . '
Placuit !
As if it were in the first instance a whim or a fiat to make this proviso and thereby give some sense to that empty distinction !
A proprietas SEMPER abscedente usufructu would not merely be ututilis , it would be no Proprietas at all .
To examine other distinctions in property itself , e.g. between res mancipi and nec mancipi , dominium quiritarium and bonitarium , &C. , is inappropriate here since they have no bearing on any of the modifications of property determined by the concept and are merely tit - bits culled from the history of the right of property .
The empty distinction discussed above , however , is in a way contained in the relations of dominium directum and dominium utile , in the contractus emphyteuticus , in the further relations involved in estates in fee with the ground rents and other rents , dues , villeinage , &c. , entailed in their sundry modifications , in cases where such burdens are irredeemable .
But from another point of view , these relations preclude that distinction .
They preclude it in so far as burdens are entailed in dominium utile , with the result that dominium directum becomes at the same time a dominium utile .
Were there nothing in these two relationships except that distinction in its rigid abstraction , then in them we would not have two overlords ( domini ) in the strict sense , but an owner on the one hand and an overlord who was the overlord of nothing on the other .
But on the score of the burdens imposed there are two owners standing in relation to each other .
Although their relation is not that of being common owners of a property , still the transition from it to common ownership is very easy — a transition which has already begun in dominium directum when the yield of the property is calculated and looked upon as the essential thing , while that incalculable factor in the overlordship of a property , the factor which has perhaps been regarded as the honourable thing about property , is subordinated to the utile which here is the rational factor .
It is about a millennium and a half since the freedom of personality began through the spread of Christianity to blossom and gain recognition as a universal principle from a part , though still a small part , of the human race .
But it was only yesterday , we might say , that the principle , of the freedom of property became recognised in some places .
This example from history may serve to rebuke the impatience of opinion and to show the length of time that mind requires for progress in its self - consciousness .
§ 63
A thing in use is a single thing determined quantitatively and qualitatively and related to a specific need .
But its specific utility , being quantitatively determinate , is at the same time comparable with [ the specific utility of ] other things of like utility .
Similarly , the specific need which it satisfies is at the same time need in general and thus is comparable on its particular side with other needs , while the thing in virtue of the same considerations is comparable with things meeting other needs .
This , the thing 's universality , whose simple determinate character arises from the particularity of the thing , so that it is eo ipso abstracted from the thing 's specific quality , is the thing 's value , wherein its genuine substantiality becomes determinate and an object of consciousness .
As full owner of the thing , I am eo ipso owner of its value as well as of its use .
Remark :
The distinctive character of the property of a feudal tenant is that he is supposed to be the owner of the use only , not of the value of the thing .
Addition :
The qualitative disappears here in the form of the quantitative ; that is to say , when I speak of ' need ' , I use a term under which the most various things may be brought ; they share it in common and so become commensurable .
The advance of thought here therefore is from a thing 's specific quality to a character which is indifferent to quality , i.e. quantity .
A similar thing occurs in mathematics .
The definition of a circle , an ellipse , and a parabola reveals their specific difference .
But in spite of this , the distinction between these different curves is determined purely quantitatively , i.e. in such a way that the only important thing is a purely quantitative difference which rests on their coefficients alone , on purely empirical magnitudes .
In property , the quantitative character which emerges from the qualitative is value .
Here the qualitative provides the quantity with its quantum and in consequence is as much preserved in the quantity as superseded by it .
If we consider the concept of value , we must look on the thing itself only as a symbol ; it counts not as itself but as what it is worth .
A bill of exchange , for instance , does not represent what it really is - paper ; it is only a symbol of another universal - value .
The value of a thing may be very heterogeneous ; it depends on need .
But if you want to express the value of a thing not in a specific case but in the abstract , then it is money which expresses this .
Money represents any and every thing , though since it does not portray the need itself but is only a symbol of it , it is itself controlled by the specific value [ of the commodity ] .
Money , as an abstraction , merely expresses this value .
It is possible in principle to be the owner of a thing without at the same time being the owner of its value .
If a family can neither sell nor pawn its goods , it is not the owner of their value .
But since this form of property is not in accordance with the concept of property , such restrictions on ownership ( feudal tenure , testamentary trusts ) are mostly in course of disappearing .
§ 64
The form given to a possession and its mark are themselves externalities but for the subjective presence of the will which alone constitutes the meaning and value of externalities .
This presence , however , which is use , employment , or some other mode in which the will expresses itself , is an event in time , and what is objective in time is the continuance of this expression of the will .
Without this the thing becomes a res nullius , because it has been deprived of the actuality of the will and possession .
Therefore I gain or lose possession of property through prescription .
Remark : Prescription , therefore , has not been introduced into law solely from an external consideration running counter to right in the strict sense , i.e. with a view to truncating the disputes and confusions which old claims would introduce into the security of property .
On the contrary , prescription rests at bottom on the specific character of property as ' real ' , on the fact that the will to possess something must express itself .
Public memorials are national property , or , more precisely , like works of art in general so far as their enjoyment is concerned , they have life and count as ends in themselves so long as they enshrine the spirit of remembrance and honour .
If they lose this spirit , they become in this respect res nullius in the eyes of a nation and the private possession of the first comer , like e.g. the Greek and Egyptian works of art in Turkey .
The right of private property which the family of an author has in his publications dies out for a similar reason ; such publications become res nullius in the sense that like public memorials , though in an opposite way , they become public property , and , by having their special handling of their topic copied , the private property of anyone .
Vacant land consecrated for a burial ground , or even to lie unused in perpetuity , embodies an empty absent arbitrary will .
If such a will is infringed , nothing actual is infringed , and hence respect for it can not be guaranteed .
Addition : Prescription rests on the presumption that I have ceased to regard the thing as mine .
If a thing is to remain mine , my will must continue in it , and using it or keeping it safe shows this continuance .
That public memorials may lose their value was frequently shown during the Reformation in the case of foundations , endowments , &c. , for the Mass .
The spirit of the old faith , i.e. of these foundations , had fled . , and consequently they could be seized as private property .
C. Alienation of Property
§ 65
The reason I can alienate my property is that it is mine only in so far as I put my will into it .
Hence I may abandon ( derelinquere ) as a res nullius anything that I have or yield it to the will of another and so into his possession , provided always that the thing in question is a thing external by nature .
Addition :
While prescription is an alienation with no direct expression of the will to alienate , alienation proper is an expression of my will , of my will no longer to regard the thing as mine .
The whole matter may also be so viewed that alienation is seen to be a true mode of taking possession .
To take possession of the thing directly is the first moment in property .
Use is likewise a way of acquiring property .
The third moment then is the unity of these two , taking possession of the thing by alienating it .
[ Taking possession is positive acquisition .
Use is the negation of a thing 's Particular characteristics ( see § 59 ) .
Alienation is the synthesis of Positive and negative ; it is negative in that it involves spurning the thing altogether ; it is positive because it is only a thing completely mine which I can so spurn . ]
§ 66
Therefore those goods , or rather substantive characteristics , which constitute my own private personality and the universal essence of my self - consciousness are inalienable and my right to them is imprescriptible .
Such characteristics are my personality as such , my universal freedom of will , my ethical life , my religion .
Remark :
The fact that what mind is in accordance with its concept or implicitly it also should be explicitly and existentially ( the fact that thus mind should be a person , be capable of holding property , should have an ethical life , a religion ) is the Idea which is itself the concept of mind .
As causqa sui , i.e as free causality , mind is that cuius natura non potest concipi nisi existens .
It is just in this concept of mind as that which is what it is only through its own free causality and through its endless return into itself out of the natural immediacy of its existence , that there lies the possibility of a clash : i.e. what it is potentially it may not be actually ( see § 57 ) , and vice versa what it is actually ( e.g. evil , in the case of the will ) may be other than what it is potentially .
Herein lies the possibility of the alienation of personality and its substantive being , whether this alienation occurs unconsciously or intentionally .
Examples of the alienation of personality are slavery , serfdom , disqualification from holding property , encumbrances on property , and so forth .
Alienation of intelligence and rationality , of morality , ethical life , and religion , is exemplified in superstition , in ceding to someone else full power and authority to fix and prescribe what actions are to be done ( as when an individual binds himself expressly to steal or to murder , & c. , or to a course of action that may involve crime ) , or what duties are binding on one 's conscience or what religious truth is , &c .
The right to what is in essence inalienable is imprescriptible , since the act whereby I take possession of my personality , of my substantive essence , and make myself a responsible being , capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life , takes away from these characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else .
When I have thus annulled their externality , I cannot lose them through lapse of time or from any other reason drawn from my prior consent or willingness to alienate them .
This return of mine into myself , whereby I make myself existent as Idea , as a person with rights and moral principles , annuls the previous position and the wrong done to my concept and my reason by others and myself when the infinite embodiment of self - consciousness has been treated as something external , and that with my consent .
This return into myself makes clear the contradiction in supposing that I have given into another 's possession my capacity for rights , my ethical life and religious feeling ; for either I have given up what I myself did not possess , or I am giving up what , so soon as I possess it , exists in essence as mine alone and not as something external .
Addition :
It is in the nature of the case that a slave has an absolute right to free himself and that if anyone has prostituted his ethical life by hiring himself to thieve and murder , this is an absolute nullity and everyone has a warrant to repudiate this contract .
The same is the case if I hire my religious feeling to a priest who is my confessor , for such an inward matter a man has to settle with himself alone .
A religious feeling which is partly in control of someone else is no proper religious feeling at all .
The spirit is always one and single and should dwell in me .
I am entitled to the union of my potential and my actual being .
§ 67
Single products of my particular physical and mental skill and of my power to act I can alienate to someone else and I can give him the use of my abilities for a restricted period , because , on the strength of this restriction , my abilities acquire an external relation to the totality and universality of my being .
By alienating the whole of my time , as crystallised in my work , and everything I produced , I would be making into another 's property the substance of my being , my universal activity and actuality , my personality .
Remark :
The relation here between myself and the exercise of my abilities is the same as that between the substance of a thing and its use ( see § 61 ) .
It is only when use is restricted that a distinction between use and substance arises .
So here , the use of my powers differs from my powers and therefore from myself , only in so far as it is quantitatively restricted .
Force is the totality of its manifestations , substance of its accidents , the universal of its particulars .
Addition :
The distinction here explained is that between a slave and a modern domestic servant or day - labourer .
The Athenian slave perhaps had an easier occupation and more intellectual work than is usually the case with our servants , but he was still a slave , because he had alienated to his master the whole range of his activity .
§ 68
What is peculiarly mine in a product of my mind may , owing to the method whereby it is expressed , turn at once into something external like a ' thing ' which eo ipso may then be produced by other people .
The result is that by taking possession of a thing of this kind , its new owner may make his own the thoughts communicated in it or the mechanical invention which it contains , and it is ability to do this which sometimes ( i.e. in the case of books ) constitutes the value of these things and the only purpose of possessing them .
But besides this , the new owner at the same time comes into possession of the universal methods of so expressing himself and producing numerous other things of the same sort .
Remark :
In the case of works of art , the form — the portrayal of thought in an external medium — is , regarded as a thing , so peculiarly the property of the individual artist that a copy of a work of art is essentially a product of the copyist 's own mental and technical ability .
In the case of a literary work , the form in virtue of which it is an external thing is of a mechanical kind , and the same is true of the invention of a machine ; for in the first case the thought is presented not en bloc , as a statue is , but in a series of separable abstract symbols , while in the second case the thought has a mechanical content throughout .
The ways and means of producing things of that mechanical kind as things are commonplace accomplishments .
But between the work of art at one extreme and the mere journeyman production at the other there are transitional stages which to a greater or less degree partake of the character of one or other of the extremes .
§ 69
Since the owner of such a product , in owning a copy of it , is in possession of the entire use and value of that copy qua a single thing , he has complete and free ownership of that copy qua a single thing , even if the author of the book or the inventor of the machine remains the owner of the universal ways and means of multiplying such books and machines , &c .
Qua universal ways and means of expression , he has not necessarily alienated them , but may reserve them to himself as means of expression which belong to him .
Remark :
The substance of an author 's or an inventor 's right cannot in the first instance be found in the supposition that when he disposes of a single copy of his work , he arbitrarily makes it a condition that the power to produce facsimiles as things , a power which thereupon passes into another 's possession , should not become the property of the other but should remain his own .
The first question is whether such a separation between ownership of the thing and the power to produce facsimiles which is given with the thing is compatible with the concept of property , or whether it does not cancel the complete and free ownership ( see § 62 ) on which there originally depends the option of the original producer of intellectual work to reserve to himself the power to reproduce , or to part with this power as a thing of value , or to attach no value to it at all and surrender it together with the single exemplar of his work .
I reply that this power to reproduce has a special character , viz .
it is that in virtue of which the thing is not merely a possession but a capital asset ( see §§ 170 ff. ) ; the fact that it is such an asset depends on the particular external kind of way in which the thing is used , a way distinct and separable from the use to which the thing is directly destined ( the asset here is not , as has been said , an acessio naturalis like fetura ) .
Since then this distinction falls into the sphere of that whose nature entails its divisibility , into the sphere of external use , the retention of part of a thing 's [ external ] use and the alienation of another part is not the retention of a proprietorship without utile .
The purely negative , though the primary , means of advancing the sciences and arts is to guarantee scientists and artists against theft and to enable them to benefit from the protection of their property , just as it was the primary and most important means of advancing trade and industry to guarantee it against highway robbery .
Moreover , the purpose of a product of mind is that people other than its author should understand it and make it the possession of their ideas , memory , thinking , &c .
Their mode of expression , whereby in turn they make what they have learnt ( for ' learning ' means more than ' learning things by heart ' , ' memorising them ' ; the thoughts of others can be apprehended only by thinking , and this re-thinking the thoughts of learning too ) into a ' thing ' which they can alienate , very likely has some special form of its own in every case .
The result is that they may regard as their own property the capital asset accruing from their claim for themselves the right to reproduce their learning in books of their own .
Those engaged in the propagation of knowledge of all kinds , in particular those whose appointed task is teaching , have as their specific function and duty ( above all in the case of the positive sciences , the doctrine of a church , the study of positive law , & c. ) the repetition of well - established thoughts , taken up ab extra and all of them given expression already .
The same is true of writings devised for teaching purposes and the spread and propagation of the sciences .
Now to what extent does the new form which turns up when something is expressed again and again transform the available stock of knowledge , and in particular the thoughts of others who still retain external property in those intellectual productions of theirs , into a private mental property of the individual reproducer and thereby give him or fail to give him the right to make them his external property as well ?
To what extent is such repetition of another 's material in one 's book a plagiarism ?
There is no precise principle of determination available to answer these questions , and therefore they cannot be finally settled either in principle or by positive legislation .
Hence plagiarism would have to be a matter of honour and be held in check by honour .
Thus copyright legislation attains its end of securing the property rights of author and publisher only to a very restricted extent , though it does attain it within limits .
The ease with which we may deliberately change something in the form of what we are expounding or invent a trifling modification in a large body of knowledge or a comprehensive theory which is another 's work , and even the impossibility of sticking to the author 's words in expounding something we have learnt , all lead of themselves ( quite apart from the particular purposes for which such repetitions are required ) to an endless multiplicity of alterations which more or less superficially stamp someone else 's property as our own .
For instance , the hundreds and hundreds of compendia , selections , anthologies , &c. , arithmetics , geometries , religious tracts , &c. , show how every new idea in a review or annual or encyclopaedia , &c. , can be forthwith repeated over and over again under the same or a different title , and yet may be claimed as something peculiarly the writer 's own .
The result of this may easily be that the profit promised to the author , or the projector of the original undertaking , by his work or his original idea becomes negligible or reduced for both parties or lost to all concerned .
But as for the effectiveness of honour in checking plagiarism , what has happened is that nowadays we scarcely hear the word ' plagiarism ' , nor are scholars accused of stealing each other 's results .
It may be that honour has been effective in abolishing plagiarism , or perhaps plagiarism has ceased to be dishonourable and feeling against it is a thing of the past ; or possibly an ingenious and trivial idea , and a change in external form , is rated so highly as originality and a product of independent thinking that the thought of plagiarism becomes wholly insufferable .
§ 70
The comprehensive sum of external activity , i.e. life , is not external to personality as that which itself is , immediate and a this .
The surrender or the sacrifice of life is not the existence of this personality but the very opposite .
There is therefore no unqualified right to sacrifice one 's life .
To such a sacrifice nothing is entitled except an ethical Idea as that in which this immediately single personality has vanished and to whose power it is actually subjected .
Just as life as such is immediate , so death is its immediate negation and hence must come from without , either by natural causes , or else , in the service of the Idea , by the hand of a foreigner .
Addition : A single person , I need hardly say , is something subordinate , and as such he must dedicate himself to the ethical whole .
Hence if the state claims life , the individual must surrender it .
But may a man take his own life ?
Suicide may at a first glance be regarded as an act of courage , but only the false courage of tailors and servant girls .
Or again it may be looked upon as a misfortune , since it is inward distraction which leads to it .
But the fundamental question is :
Have I a right to take my life ?
The answer will be that I , as this individual , am not master of my life , because life , as the comprehensive sum of , my activity , is nothing external to personality , which itself is this immediate personality .
Thus when a person is said to have a right over his life , the words are a contradiction , because they mean that a person has a right over himself .
But he has no such right , since he does not stand over himself and he cannot pass judgement on himself .
When Hercules destroyed himself by fire and when Brutus fell on his sword , this was the conduct of a hero against his personality .
But as for an unqualified right to suicide , we must simply say that there is no such thing , even for heroes .
Transition from Property to Contract
§ 71
Existence as determinate being is in essence being for another ( see Remark to § 48 ) .
One aspect of property is that it is an existent as an external thing , and in this respect property exists for other external things and is connected with their necessity and contingency .
But it is also an existent as an embodiment of the will , and from this point of view the ' other ' for which it exists can only be the will of another person .
This relation of will to will is the true and proper ground in which freedom is existent . —
The sphere of contract is made up of this mediation whereby I hold property not merely by means of a thing and my subjective will , but by means of another person 's will as well and so hold it in virtue of my participation in a common will .
Remark : Reason makes it just as necessary for men to enter into contractual relationship — gift , exchange , trade , &c. — as to possess property ( see Remark to § 45 ) —
While all they are conscious of is that they are led to make contracts by need in general , by benevolence , advantage , &c. , the fact remains that they are led to do this by reason implicit within them , i.e. by the Idea of the real existence of free personality , ' real ' here meaning ' present in the will alone ' .
Contract presupposes that the parties entering it recognise each other n persons and property owners .
It is a relationship at the level of mind objective , and so contains and presupposes from the start the moment of recognition ( compare Remarks to §§ 35 and 57 ) .
Addition :
In a contract I hold property on the strength of a common will ; that is to say , it is the interest of reason that the subjective will should become universal and raise itself to this degree of actualisation .
Thus in contract my will still has the character ' this ' , though it has it in community with another will .
The universal will , however , still appears here only in the form and guise of community .

If you just enjoy programming or are exploring Scala then you will find Nathan Hamblen 's Scala version of Processing a pure delight .
He has created an IDE where you can write Scala programs that access the incredible power of the Processing Projects graphics library .
In a few lines you can create appealing images , visual simulations , art work or presentations .
Processing is an award winning open source project initiated by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry , both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab .
It is " a programming language and integrated development environment ( IDE ) built for the electronic arts and visual design communities " ,
You can learn more about the original Open Source project on Wapedia .
About a year ago , Nathan created his first version of the Scala Processing Development Environment ( SPDE ) which integrates the Scala compiler with the simple to use Processing IDE .
Now you can type in a Scala program , hit run and see the results .
To find out more about this Scala version of Processing and how to download it here or visit the site about SPDE to learn how he did it .
More detail technical implementation notes on the SPDE project can be found here .
Setting up the SPDE is a simple task .
You must first download and install the Java JRE and the Java JDK which you can find on the Sun Java Site .
Then , after unzipping and installing SPDE , the Scala Processing Development Environment , you will need to modify the SPDE batch file to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable .
Inserting something like " set JAVA_HOME=c: \Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16 " as the first line does this nicely on a Windows system .
Nathan has provided a nice set of examples with the SPDE .
You can see some of them demonstrated on this site .
Many people find the simulation of bird flocking fascinating .
You will find an ' Exhibition ' of what other people have produced using the Java Processing environment on the Processing Site .
Some are just really amazing .
SPDE is just one of Nathan 's many contributions to the community .
Check out his blog ' Codespiel ' to see what other projects he is into .
For those of you who are mathematically minded or interested in self similar systems and fractals , Anthony Bagwell has provided us with the following code examples .
The first is a concise way to create a representation of the popular Sierpinski gasket .
The second provides a Turtle like draw class that will display L-systems .
You can copy and paste the code examples into the SPDE window to see them run and produce similar results to the screen .
// Sierpinski Gasket Example for SPDE val d= 200 size ( d * 2 , d*2 ) background ( 0 , 10 , 20 ) var a=List ( List ( d/2,0,255,0,0 ) , List ( d , d,0,255,0 ) , List ( 0, d,0,0,255 ) ) var p=List ( d,0,255,0,0 ) def draw ( ) { for ( i < - 1 to 10 ) { p=p zip a.random map{case ( x , y ) = > x / 2+y} stroke ( p ( 2 ) , p( 3 ) , p( 4 ) ) point ( p ( 0 ) , p ( 1 ) ) } }
L -Systems are based on using a set of replacement rules that are applied as productions on an initial string ( or axiom ) .
The resultant strings can then be interpreted as directions for a " Turtle " .
For example , to produce the flake the initial string is " F++ F++ F " then on each iteration the replacement rule is simple , for each F replace it with " F - F++F - F "
The resulting string can now be interpreted as Turtle movements .
F means step turtle forward , - means turtle turn left by given angle and + means turn right by given angle .
In the example SPDE Scala program you can choose which of several popular L - systems you would like to see or create your own .
The production rules are nicely implemented by means of a partial function and case algebraic pattern matching features of Scala .
Folds are used to apply the production rules and then create the list of turtle movements .
Use wikipedia to find more information about L - Systems .
Running the Koch Snowflake , Hilbert Space Filling Curves and Sierpinski Gaskets will give the following results .
// L-System Example for SPDE size ( 900,700 ) smooth val chs=5 // choose 0 to 5 var cur=List ( spier1 , spier2 , flake , pentigree , hilbert1 , hilbert2 ) ( chs ) def spier1 = new L_Sys ( " F+F+F " , PI*2/3,1.0 , { case ' F '= > " F+F- F - F+F " } ) def spier2 = new L_Sys ( " X " , PI / 3,1.0 , { case ' X ' => " + Y - X - Y + " case ' Y ' => " - X+Y+X - " } ) def flake = new L_Sys ( " F++F++F " , PI /3,1.0 , { case ' F '= > " F - F++F- F " } ) def pentigree = new L_Sys ( " F - F - F - F - F " , PI * 2/5,1.0 , { case ' F'= >" F - F++F+F-F-F " } ) def hilbert1 = new L_Sys ( " x F " , PI /2,0.5 , { case ' x ' => " + yF - x Fx - Fy + " case 'y ' => " - xF+yFy + Fx - " } ) def hilbert2 = new L_Sys ( " XF " , PI/2,0.45 , { case ' X ' => " + YFG - XFX - GFY + " case ' Y ' => " - XFG+YFY +GFX - " case ' F ' => " HHH " case ' G ' = > " " } ) var points=cur.points background ( 255 ) // Initial String , turtle turn angle ( rads ) , sizing ratio , Production Rules class L_Sys ( b: String , a: double , r: double , f:( char ) = > String ) { var s=b var step=1.0 var angle=a var start =( .0,0.0,0.0 ) var ratio=1.0 // Run couple of trial iterations to calculate step scaling to use // so that each iteration just fills window var d1=br._2-tl._2 next next var d2=br._2-tl._2 ratio=sqrt(d1/d2 ) step=height /d1 start=((- tl._1*( ratio*ratio) +width-br._1*ratio*ratio)/2,-tl._2*( ratio*ratio ) ,.0 ) s=b ratio=if ( r !=1.0 ) r else ratio def tl( ) ={ points .

What a knight : Bolt blitzes his 200 m record and says - I 'd love to be Sir Usain
By Neil Wilson for MailOnline
Can you believe it !
Four days after Usain Bolt shattered the world 100 metres record , he destroyed his own 200 m record last night in the same Olympic Stadium by the same margin of 0.11 seconds .
One year to the day since he first claimed the record from Michael Johnson in Beijing 's Bird Nest Stadium - and hours before he celebrates his 23rd birthday - Bolt reduced the record to 19.19sec .
Cruise control : Bolt eases to a world record in the 200 m as the also - rans strain for the line
And he was running into a slight headwind !
We have come to expect the incredible from this giant Jamaican , but the shock was still palpable among the sell - out crowd of 56,000 .
Bolt said : ' The world record - I did not really have it on my mind .
I definitely showed people that my world records in Beijing were not a joke .
I am ready now for another record for our relay .
VIDEO : Jamaica goes crazy ...
' I do all this for my country .
They are crazy for me and proud of me .
I am honoured .
If Queen Elizabeth knighthooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt , it would sound very nice . '
From the sound of the gun , there was one man going for gold .
The others were in a race of their own in another world .
The clock was his only opponent .
Incredible scenes : Bolt smashes the 200 m world record
He had made up the staggered start on Alonso Edward , the Panamanian outside him , before they had run 20 metres .
He had overhauled the two others beyond him before the bend was run .
He won by six metres from Edward , a distance on the clock of 0.62sec .
It is the widest winning margin in the event in the 26 years of these championships .
No sprinter has ever before held Olympic and world titles at 100 and 200 m while also holding both world records .
Now he is talking of testing himself at 400 m next year .
Bolt will take his birthday off today while four of his Jamaican team - mates do the work of qualifying Jamaica for the final of the 4 x 100 m relay .
He will then return to action for tomorrow 's final , a third gold inevitable .
Bolt is resurrecting interest in the sport so badly damaged by the doping crimes of previous generations .
More than 10 million Germans watched his 100 m world record on television , more than watched the last World Cup final .
Sign of the times :
The electronic board shows Bolt 's new record
The man at the centre of the maelstrom remains as cool as an iced rum and Coke , able to perform for the cameras up to the moment he is invited to go to his blocks .
Last night , to the delight of his German hosts , he walked into the stadium wearing a Jamaican T - shirt inscribed with the words ' Ich Bin Ein Berlino ' , recalling President Kennedy 's remark in his famous address to the city during the Cold War .
The locals excused him his single spelling mistake .
A shock hardly registering on the Richter scale of performances beside Bolt 's was the performance of Britain 's Will Sharman in the 110 m hurdles .
Sharman won his semi-final after Dayron Robles , Cuba 's Olympic champion and world record - holder , pulled up injured in the lane next to him .
Cruise control : Bolt eases to 200 m world record as the also - rans strain for the line
That gave the Nottingham man a career best time of 13.38sec , and in the final he improved again to 13.30sec to finish fourth in a race won by Barbadian Ryan Brathwaite in 13.14 .
It was a good day for Britain with six more qualifiers for finals .
Pole vaulter Steve Lewis made it with a vault of 5.65 and Mo Farah qualified in the 5,000m .
Long jumpers Greg Rutherford and Chris Tomlinson will each appear in tomorrow evening 's final , while Huddersfield 's Emily Freeman will contest her first global final in the 200 m at the age of 28 .
[ Hunter Davis ] keeps rolling out the hacks for the Zipit .
In the past he showed us how to run DOSbox , and then how to get NES emulation working on this tiny device .
Now he ’s got Linux kernel 2.6.29 running Fluxbox with mouse ( newly added ) , audio , and WiFi functionality .
Follow his step - by - step flashing instructions to load the kernel into the Zipit .
Once flashed , a partitioned microSD card servers as the filesystem and swap .
Who needs a 10.1 inch screen or an Atom processor when you can get this 2.8 ″ QVGA beauty with an XScale processor for around $ 40 ?
[ Thanks Matt ]
Description :
Hacking the Wiimote and Wii Fit to Help the Disabled
Talk Abstract :
Speaker Bios :
Grungy or Josh Marks
Rob ' roB3AR ' Rehrig
Larry Aiello
This talk titled " " was given by Josh Marks , Rob Rehrig and Larry Aiello at Defcon 17 this year .
People like Johnny Chung Lee have shown us that the Wiimote can be used as a bluetooth IR camera that tracks the spatial location of up to four IR LEDs .
Applying this work to a new application , we have adapted the Wiimote and the Wii Fit into a low cost system to help disabled individuals to interface with a computer .
By combining the movement of head mounted LEDs and measurement of weight distribution of the lower body ( ie " butt - movement " ) , users are able to provide input gestures .
The system uses the gesture recognition engine originally designed by makers of the iPhone .
Our setup can also be used by normal individuals for a heightened gaming experience .
This talk will feature a live demonstration of the interface and uses of the hardware .
The only question that remains is " Would you like to play a game ?. , for official purposes , is a Junior Electrical Engineer at the University of Delaware .
He has had experience doing research and has recently presented at Schmoocon V about low cost systems engineering .
However , he is a rather confused Electrical Engineer who can be found breaking various electronics around the lab while trying to hack them together or creating flashy new light displays , but secretly dreaming about steam boilers , reactors , and biology at night .
Someday he wishes to combine Electrical Engineering and power generation methods to develop efficient and interesting applications for current and future technological energy needs .is an electrical engineering student at the University of Delaware .
He wants to go to grad school after he graduates from UD and take more of a focus on acoustical engineering so that one day he will be able to start his own sound equipment company .
Rob has been interested in acoustics ever since he got his first tape player when he was little .
Other interests of his are drawing , graphic design , running , and messing around on his computer .
Rob has had previous experience working with infrared communication last winter when he helped develop a low cost personal security system with his classmates .
Rob and his classmates presented their results at Shmoocon V.is a computer engineering student at the University of Delaware .
He became interested in computers when he built his own during high school to save money and still uses and upgrades it to this day .
He plans to go to graduate school to earn his Masters .
Other hobbies of his include weight training , skiing , and playing lots of video games .
Like Josh and Rob , Larry was also on the team creating a low cost security system last winter , where he designed an algorithm that uses an infrared lighting trip system to detect if people were moving into or out of an area .

Interview With Carl Sagan
Author , Astronomer NOVA : Speculate for a moment on the parts of human nature , the commonality of believing in abductions , or aliens anyway , and the part of human nature that wants to search for other life forms in the universe .
SAGAN : I personally have been captured by the notion of extraterrestrial life , and especially extraterrestrial intelligence from childhood .
It swept me up , and I 've been involved in sending space craft to nearby planets to look for life and in the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence ...
It would be an absolutely transforming event in human history .
But , the stakes are so high on whether it 's true or false , that we must demand the more rigorous standards of evidence .
Precisely because it 's so exciting .
That 's the circumstance in which our hopes may dominate our skeptical scrutiny of the data .
So , we have to be very careful .
There have been a few instances in the [ past ] .
We thought we found something , and it always turned out to be explicable ...
So , a kind of skepticism is routinely applied to the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence by its most fervent proponents .
I do not see [ in ] the alien abduction situation a similar rigorous application of scientific skepticism by its proponents .
Instead , I see enormous acceptance at face value - and leading the witness and all sorts of suggestions .
Plus , the contamination by the general culture of this idea .
It seems to me there is a big difference between the two approaches to extraterrestrial intelligence , although I 'm frequently written to [ to ] say how could I search for extraterrestrial intelligence and disbelieve that we 're being visited .
I do n't see any contradiction at all .
It 's a wonderful prospect , but requires the most severe and rigorous standards of evidence .
NOVA : Could you please comment on the part of the quality of the evidence that is put forward by these so - called " abduction proponents . "
SAGAN : Well , it 's almost entirely anecdote .
Someone says something happened to them ... And , people can say anything .
The fact that someone says something does n't mean it 's true .
Does n't mean they 're lying , but it does n't mean it 's true .
To be taken seriously , you need physical evidence that can be examined at leisure by skeptical scientists : a scraping of the whole ship , and the discovery that it contains isotopic ratios that are n't present on earth , chemical elements form the so - called island of stability , very heavy elements that do n't exist on earth .
Or material of absolutely bizarre properties of many sorts — electrical conductivity or ductility .
There are many things like that that would instantly give serious credence to an account .
But there 's no scrapings , no interior photographs , no filched page from the captain 's log book .
All there are are stories .
There are instances of disturbed soil , but I can disturb soil with a shovel .
There are instances of people claiming to flash lights at UFOs and the UFOs flash back .
But , pilots of airplanes can also flash back , especially if they think it would be a good joke to play on the UFO enthusiast .
So , that does not constitute good evidence .
And , a very interesting example of this sort of thing is the so - called crop circles in England in which wheat and rye and other grains — these beautiful immense circles appeared and then — this was in the 70's and 80's — and then over progressive years , more and more complex geometries .
And there were lots of people who said that these were made by UFOs that were landing and that it was too complex or too highly mathematical to be a hoax .
And it turns out that two blokes in Southern England , at their regular bar one night , thought it would be a good idea to make a kind of hoax to see if they could lure in UFO enthusiasts .
And they succeeded every time — every time an explanation was proferred : a peculiar kind of wind , they then made another one which contradicted that hypothesis .
And they were very pleased when it was said that no human intelligence could do this .
That gave them great satisfaction .
And for 15 years , they succeeded in these nocturnal expeditions using rope and board — all the technology they needed .
And in their 60's , they finally confessed to the press with a demonstration of how it was done .
And , of course , the confession received very little play in the media .
And the claims of alien influence had received prominent exposure .
NOVA : I want you to comment on John Mack .
SAGAN : Many of the principle advocates of UFO abduction seem to want the validation of science without submitting to its rigorous standards of evidence .
When John Mack talks about parallel universes or other dimensions , he 's using scientific ideas .
Those have long been in play in the Physics and Astronomy community .
But , there is no evidence for them .
He also criticizes the current paradigm that is the skeptical scientific method .
But , this is n't validated .
We do n't believe it just out of prejudice ; we believe it because it works .
NOVA : In the absence of hard physical evidence about alien abductions , what does science tell us about the plausibility of what these aliens are supposed to do ?
SAGAN : Well , if you look at the advantages in human technology in just the last few hundred years , the Voyager spacecraft on its way to the stars , compared to what we knew in the time of Charlemagne , let 's say , that 's less than a thousand years .
And the progress is simply stunning .
So , if you postulate the existence of highly technical civilizations , thousands , much less millions of years in our future , unless the hypothesis strongly contradicts known laws of physics , I think you have to say it 's possible .
So , travel at very high speeds between the stars , that 's by no means out of the question .
Walking through walls is a little tough for me .
I do n't see how it could be done .
And the basic reading program idea of the alien abduction , the paradigm , they seem strangely backward in biology for all their advances in physics , if you take it seriously .
Why are they doing breeding one on one at such a slow pace ?
Why not steal a few humans , sequence our DNA , look at variations and make whatever genetic engineering changes they want .
We almost have the ability to do that .
It seems naive in terms of molecular biology .
... Precisely because of human fallibility , extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
Now , I know that Budd Hopkins responds that extraordinary claims require extraordinary investigations .
And I have two kinds of responses to that .
There is a claim that a brontosaurus is tramping through the jungles today in the republic of Congo .
Should a massive expedition be mounted with government funds to find it , or it is so implausible as not to be worth serious sustained systematic attention ?
And my second point is that to the extent that extraordinary claims require extraordinary investigations , those investigations must be true to the spirit of science .
And that means highly skeptical , demanding , rigorous standards of evidence .
And it 's not a hint of that from alien abduction enthusiasts ...
I think that the alien abduction enthusiasts understand the need for physical evidence .
It 's the pathway to some degree of respectability .
And for 40 years , they 've been telling us that real evidence is just around the corner , it 's about to be released , it 's being studied at this moment - and nothing ever comes of it .
NOVA : Well , now we 've run into this alleged alien abduction footage .
Have you heard about this ?
What do you make of the film footage of this alleged animal autopsy ?
SAGAN : I have n't myself seen it , but I have talked in some detail with those who have , and I 've read an analysis in the Times of London .
There are several things to notice .
One is that the creature in question has a strong resemblance to the alien abduction paradigm , although with six fingers on each hand .
It is dissected in a movie taken with lots of blocking of the body and numerous out of focus excursions by the camera .
And the humans involved in the autopsy are all dressed in these 1950 's radiation suits which are covered head to toe and there 's just a little rectangular window to look out , which means that nobody can be identified .
The key piece of evidence that it's not a fake is said to be a leader from the beginning of one of the rolls that was — you know , and they 're all encoded , and it was submitted to Kodak , the manufacturer .
And Kodak came back and said this was shot in 1947 or some year close to that .
And that demonstrates that its not a fake .
But , an important proviso is that Kodak was not given a reel that had the autopsy on it .
They were just given a snippet , give to Kodak , and then alleged that it came from the beginning of the autopsy film .
So , I think that it 's a clever fake , if it 's a fake .
But , it 's certainly not compelling .
NOVA : According to Hopkins and others , the main evidence for these stories — in the absence of other evidence — is the similarity of details .
In your opinion , what other explanations might account for the similarity and the details of the stories or hallucinations of these abductees ?
SAGAN : The culture contaminates movies , television programs , books , haunting pages of aliens , and television interviews with passionate abductees - all communicate to the widest possible community the alien abduction paradigm .
So , it 's not as if each abductee has been hermetically sealed from the outside world and has no input about what others are saying .
It 's all cross contaminated and it has been for decades .
I think that 's the clearest evidence for it not being good evidence — that many people tell the same story .
NOVA : If you could speak directly to the multitudes of people who believe they 're going to bed and perhaps being abducted by aliens , what is it you would like to say to them ?
SAGAN : If I were speaking to a group of abductees , I think the first thing I would do would be to tell them that I 'm sure to many of them the pain that is expressed is genuine , that they 're not just making this up .
And it 's very important to be compassionate .
At the same time , I would stress that hallucinations are a human common place , and not a sign that you are crazy .
And that absolutely clear hallucinations have occured to normal people and it has a compelling feeling of reality , but it 's generated in the head .
And that being the case , I would ask them to try to be as objective as they can and see if anything like that might , in fact , explain what they said happened to them .
And I 'd remind them that children , universally , have terrible nightmares , especially around 7 to 11 , and wake up from sleep absolutely terrified about a monster , a witch , a goblin , a demon , and why should n't some of us retain that ?
I mean , there 's no question that those monsters do n't exist and they 're hiding in the closet or under the bed .
That 's something generated in the mind .
Why should it all go away when we grow up ?
We should retain some of that .
And could not something like that be an explanation ?
I would try to simply ask them to adopt the scientific method of multiple working hypothesis .
Right now , they have only one hypothesis and their minds are , in many cases , closed to the alternative .
I would ask them to do a serious consideration of the alternative , see if it makes sense .
NOVA : Can you tell us how you feel if someone came to you with good evidence that there was , in fact , alien life trying to communicate with us ?
How would that make you feel as a scientist ?
SAGAN : If someone came to me with compelling , bona fide evidence that we 're being visited , my reaction would be " Whoopee ! "
And I 'd want to play a role in analyzing the evidence .
I would try very hard to bring in the absolute best scientists in the world to study it , depending on what the evidence is like .
And I do n't doubt that there would be a lot of cooperation from the scientific community .
I do n't think that scientists are prejudiced to begin with .
Prejudice means pre-judging .
They 're post - judice .
After examining the evidence they decide there 's nothing to it .
There 's a big difference between prejudice and post - judice .

Five British soldiers were killed yesterday in a devastating roadside bombing , the largest number to die in one single attack , bringing to eight the number killed in the most deadly 24 hours of the Afghan campaign .
With it another bleak and poignant milestone was reached and passed : the lethal toll in forces ' lives lost in the conflict is now more than that in the whole of the Iraq war .
The sombre unfolding statistics reflect the rising ferocity of this defining war between the West and fundamentalist Islam .
Fifteen British soldiers died this week alone as UK and US forces launched a massive operation against the Taliban in Helmand .
The latest deaths took the number killed in Afghanistan to 184 , five more than Iraq .

Five bodies were flown in to RAF Lyneham yesterday , with crowds watching in silence as hearses carrying the coffins passed through the town of Wootton Bassett .
Amid the accusations and recriminations of the conduct of the campaign , there was agreement among the military , politicians and diplomats on one fact – that Britain must brace itself for more casualties to come as long as the Afghan mission continues .
The deaths cast a shadow over Gordon Brown 's final day at the G8 summit in Italy .
The Prime Minister held talks with Barack Obama on Afghanistan and , on returning to the UK , he went straight to the military 's Permanent Joint Headquarters at Northwood to be briefed on the crisis .
Bracing the country for further losses , Mr Brown acknowledged : " This is a very hard summer and it is not over . "
He sought to justify the conflict , stressing : " We knew from the start that beating the insurgency in Helmand would be hard and dangerous but it is vital .
People in Britain are safer because of the courageous sacrifice of British soldiers . "
The latest round of killings began with a member of the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment dying in a firefight at Lashkar Gah , the Helmand capital , on Thursday evening .
The soldier was attached to the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards , whose commanding officer , Lt - Col Rupert Thorneloe was killed earlier this week to become the most senior British Army officer to fall in combat since the Falklands War .
Two hours earlier another soldier from the 4th Battalion The Rifles died in a roadside bombing while on patrol in the Nad- e - Ali where British forces had been clearing out pockets of the Taliban .
There was a second death in the same area yesterday morning when a soldier from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment was killed in another blast while on an operation to track down the insurgents who had killed his comrade .
But the most devastating attack was a sophisticated roadside bomb .
Soldiers from 2 Rifles on patrol outside the town of Sangin had just alighted from their armoured vehicle when a bomb detonated .
The initial blast was not particularly damaging , but a second one killed five members of the patrol , gouging a massive crater into the ground .
Last night bereaved families of the men were being told about what had happened .
The sustained losses over such a short period were the worst experienced in combat by British forces in Afghanistan .
In 2006 an RAF Nimrod crashed in the south of the country , killing 14 service personnel .
It was , however , an accident caused by technical problems and not enemy action .
Last night , General Sir Mike Jackson , the former head of the British Army , told The Independent : " This is very sad and obviously a terrible loss for the families and friends of these fine men .
But a very big operation had been going on in Afghanistan and I am afraid that losses such as these do occur in these circumstances . "
The Government will , however , face questions about the way it has responded to the call from military commanders to send reinforcements to Afghanistan .
The senior command had wanted to send about 2,500 extra troops , but Gordon Brown refused the request , agreeing to the temporary deployment of 700 just for the period of the Afghan elections scheduled for August .
One of the senior officers intimately involved in drawing up the reinforcement plan said last night : " What has happened has shown the sheer danger our forces face out there day in , day out .
We know the force levels needed for safety .
This was not a spurious request and there is sincere hope the Government will think again . "
Not just a window to the soul , the eye has a few tricks of its own .
Newly discovered eye cells can warn us that an object is coming nearer , and do so without the brain ’s help .
This ability may have evolved to speed escape from predators .
Neurons that fire in response to horizontal and vertical movements had already been found in the retinas of mammals , but the only cells known to be sensitive to approaching objects were in the brain .
While investigating mouse eye cells , Botond Roska at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel , Switzerland , and colleagues noticed that one type behaved unusually in response to movement .
Further analysis of this one kind of retinal cell revealed that it fired only when an object approached .
The researchers suspect that people have similar cells , which alert us to approaching objects faster than our brain cells can .
“ It ’s an alarm system that ’s as close to the front end of the organism as possible , ” says Roska .
“ If you left it to the brain to respond , it might be too late . ”

Next , Roska plans to discover how the approach - sensitive cells evoke a reaction in the brain .
“ This is exciting work , ” says Russell Foster , a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford .
“ How the nerve cells of the visual system work out that an object is approaching represents a very old question in neuroscience . ”

The general 's report will not carry a direct call for extra troops A top US general in Afghanistan has called for a revised military strategy , suggesting the current one is failing .
In a strategic assessment , Gen Stanley McChrystal said that , while the Afghan situation was serious , success was still achievable .
The report has not yet been published , but sources say Gen McChrystal sees protecting the Afghan people against the Taliban as the top priority .
The report does not carry a direct call for increasing troop numbers .
" The situation in Afghanistan is serious , but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy , commitment and resolve , and increased unity of effort , " Gen McChrystal said in the assessment .
Copies of the document have been sent to Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and US Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE

More from BBC World Service Mr Gates said that although he had not yet seen the report he expected it to show that there were " challenges that remain before us ... and areas where we can do better " in Afghanistan .
" There is no question that we have a tough fight ahead of us , but by the same token a lot of positive things have been happening , " Mr Gates said .
He highlighted the increase in US and other troops and Afghanistan 's recent presidential election , despite continuing violence in the country , but warned that casualties were going to rise as troops tackled the Taliban .
The report came as further results from last week 's presidential election were released , with ballots now counted from almost 48 % of polling stations .
President Hamid Karzai is leading so far , with 45.8 % of the votes counted .
The independent Electoral Complaints Commission says that of more than 2,100 allegations of wrongdoing during voting and vote - counting , 618 have been deemed serious enough to affect the election 's outcome , if proven .
Crisis of confidence Gen McChrystal 's blunt assessment will say that the Afghan people are undergoing a crisis of confidence because the war against the Taliban has not made their lives better , says BBC North America editor Mark Mardell .
The general says the aim should be for Afghan forces to take the lead - but their army will not be ready to do that for three years and it will take much longer for the police .
And he will warn that villages have to be taken from the Taliban and held , not merely taken .
What what we need to do is to correct some of the ways we operated in the past
General Stanley McChrystal
( In recent BBC interview )
Afghan president leading in vote Nato's new approach Responding to Gen McChrystal 's review , Afghanistan 's deputy minister of rural rehabilitation , Wais Barmak , said Afghans should have been consulted about military strategy from the start .
" We would have had better achievements , better results , if the Afghans were consulted right from the beginning , " he told the BBC's Newshour programme .
He said the government and development agencies should provide services for the people in the aftermath of the military operation .
" That is one way to engage with the people on the ground and re-establish the trust and confidence of the people in their government . "
Gen McChrystal also wants more engagement with the Taliban fighters and believes that 60 % of the problem would go away if they could be found jobs .
More than 30,000 extra US troops have been sent to Afghanistan since President Barack Obama ordered reinforcements in May - almost doubling his country 's contingent and increasing the Western total to about 100,000 .
This report does not mention increasing troop numbers - that is for another report later in the year - but the hints are all there , our correspondent says .
But when Gen McChrystal 's report lands on Mr Obama 's desk he will have to ponder the implications of increasing a commitment to a conflict which opinion polls suggest is losing support among the American people .
The latest Washington Post - ABC news poll suggests that only 49 % of Americans now think the fight in Afghanistan is worth it .
In a recent BBC interview , Gen McChrystal said that he was changing the whole approach to the conflict in Afghanistan - from what he described as a focus on " body count " , to enabling the Afghans to get rid of the Taliban themselves .
Nato partners
On Saturday , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised more support for UK troops in Afghanistan , during a surprise visit to the country .
During the visit he met Gen McChrystal .
Correspondents say the pair discussed the need to speed up the pace of training of Afghan troops .
The British Ministry of Defence said it would look closely at any recommendations from Gen McChrystal .
" The UK conducted a review of policy earlier this year and the prime minister set out a new strategy on Afghanistan and Pakistan on 29 April .
" General McChrystal 's work will be an important input to further planning , and we will work closely with him and our Nato partners moving forward , " an MoD spokesman added .
•
An earlier version of this article suggested that General McChrystal 's report was expected to liken the American military in Afghanistan to a bull charging at a matador [ the Taliban ] - slightly weakened each time it is " cut " .
In fact this remark was part of a more general commentary on US counterinsurgency policy , made by Gen McChrystal in his Counterinsurgency Guidance to units in the field , issued last week .

He was the man they called the mullah with a human face , the internet mullah , or the Rudolph Hess of the Taliban .
Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil was the Taliban 's foreign minister .
It was he who in October 2001 , a month after 9/11 and weeks before the US - led invasion of Afghanistan , broke ranks with the hardline clerical leadership and tried to broker a peace deal with Washington .
Eight years on , as the West struggles to form a coherent policy on Afghanistan amid mounting domestic opposition to the war , Mullah Muttawakil has claimed that the West has repeatedly squandered chances for peace .
" We have seen a lot of fighting since then , a lot of blood has been spilt , all for what ? " he asked .
" They are saying now that they will talk to some of the Taliban .
That is what I said to them just after the war .
I offered to put them in touch with the relevant people .
Their answer was to put me in jail . "

The policy of talking to the Taliban , now adopted by the US and Britain as part of their eventual exit strategy , ought to have been implemented eight years ago , when the Taliban were at their lowest ebb , he said .
Now , he warns that they have tasted military success in the field against Western forces and will be harder to defeat .
They also know that Western forces ' involvement in Afghanistan is becoming unpopular in Europe and America .
" They ignored the Taliban who just got stronger in Pakistan .
This was the result of not negotiating but depending on military means , " he says .
Mr Muttawakil , who rose to prominence as a close adviser of Mullah Omar , fled to Pakistan along with the one - eyed leader after the US and opposition Northern Alliance seized control of Kabul .
He returned after assurances by Hamid Karzai , he says , that he was not on any wanted list .
But he was arrested by the Americans and spent the next 18 months in custody , first at Kandahar and then at the Bagram military base .
The former foreign minister was eventually freed without charge , and then asked by Mr Karzai to open dialogue with factions of the Taliban .
Ironically , when he ran in the election in 2005 ( he lost ) , the former minister was viewed as a force for moderation in the Pashtun south .
Recently he was among a group who travelled to Mecca to hold Saudi - sponsored talks with representatives of the Taliban .
" One of the main reasons I came back to Afghanistan was to say to the new government , ' Look , we are all Afghans , there are people in the Taliban who want to put the past behind them and join the political process . '
I tried to say the same to the Americans , but they were not interested .
All they wanted to know at the time was where Mullah Omar was , where Osama bin Laden was .
I did not know .
Would they tell me , someone returning to Afghanistan , where they were hiding ?
I still do n't know where they are . "
Mr Muttawakil says he was not physically mistreated , " but there was mental abuse .
I was not allowed to sleep , I was not given enough water , I was threatened .
But conditions improved and I was given books .
After my release I was encouraged to talk to some of the Taliban leaders .
You can bring a few in the Taliban over , but that is not going to stop the war .
For that you need to talk to the leadership .
" But Mr Karzai and Nato want them to declare they will no longer fight , and the Taliban want all foreign troops to leave first .
So there has to be compromise .
If you do not speak to the Taliban there will be no solution . "
As a high - ranking member of the Taliban regime , Mullah Muttawakil espoused the views of a medieval fundamentalist .
" We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1,400 years ago , " he once told an interviewer .
Now he blames international isolation for the lack of reform .
" We really only had relations with Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and a few other countries .
Things could have been different if the rest of the world was open to us . "

Did isolation justify the brutal oppression of women , the general suppression of human rights , and the destruction of the treasured Buddha shrine at Bamiyan ?
The mullah looks uncomfortable .
" There were mistakes made , I think we have to accept that , " he said .
" We were trying to relax some laws , but there was opposition from some of our religious scholars on things like women 's issues .
I was against what was done to the Buddha statue , and so was the minister of cullture .
We were for just scratching the face [ of the statues ] but that had already been done .
The matter went to the supreme court and they decided that the faces can be destroyed .
There was nothing I could about it . "
There are new worries that reconciliation with Taliban figures will compromise human rights gains .
Mr Muttawakil insists that everything can be negotiated .
" It is up to the Afghan people to decide what they want .
They should be able to do that without interference from outsiders .
And that includes al - Qa'ida .
We must make sure that al - Qa'ida does not become an obstacle to peace . "
Taliban 2001 : Where are they now ?
Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi , translator to Muttawakil in 2001 , joined the Taliban at age 16 and after its defeat moved to Quetta , Pakistan to finish his high school education .
Then in 2006 , at the prompting of an American friend , he applied to study at Yale University in the US and was accepted , provoking the fury of some conservatives .
The career of Abdul Salaam Alizai exemplifies the way Afghan tribal leaders can change their allegiances .
After fighting the Soviets , this Pashtun leader of the southern Alizai tribe , joined the Taliban and was said to be close to Mullah Omar .
But in 2006 , he switched sides , abandoning the Taliban , who last year killed several of his bodyguards in an attempt on his life .
After the 9/11 attacks , Abdul Salam Zaeef , the regime 's ambassador to Pakistan , was the Taliban 's public face , but in 2002 he was sent to Guantanamo Bay .
In a book published in 2006 describing his ordeal he said the " confession " he signed on his release ran : " I am a Talib , I remain a Talib .
I have no connections with al - Qa'ida . "
The big story this morning , aside from Mad Men and Michael Vick , is the death of the public health insurance option .
On TV , on newspaper front pages , and on blogs , various stages of the public option ’s demise are being reported .
The basis for all of this pessimistic reporting ?
Statements , this weekend , by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the public option is not a deal - breaker .
Ex -sueeze me ?
That ’s the big news ?
This is one of those questions that come up so often at White House briefings , we can all recite the answer like a well - dressed Rocky Horror audience .
“ The President strongly supports a public health insurance option , but the main goal is to provide health care reform that results in quality , affordable care for every American . ” ( throw toast at Gibbs )
The media has stood ready to stick a fork in the public option since this debate began .
Off the top of my head , there was this July report that Rahm Emanuel had “ caved ” on the public option by answering this very question .
That story was quickly walked back by the President later that day .
The White House ’s strategy seems to have been to “ rope - a - dope ” on the public option , putting it out there and letting opponents punch themselves out at it .
In the end , the White House does n’t need the Republicans , or many of the Blue Dogs , to push this through .
The question is whether or not they realize what ’s at stake .
An even bigger question is , why is the media so ready to eulogize the public option ?
While recent polls have reflected slipping support for health care reform as it is being debated , those same polls either show overwhelming support for the public option , or they simply do n’t ask .
There are two obvious answers .
First , corporate influence over the mass media that drives news coverage is always a popular go - to bogeyman , and not necessarily in the tinfoil -y , paranoid sense .
A media culture that intersects so strongly with a corporate culture is bound to reflect those values disproportionately .
There ’s also the voracious nature of the 24 - hour , 1440 - minute news cycle that grants outsized importance to mundanities and inanities , particularly in the entertainment - starved dog days .
The answer is a combination of the two , abetted by desperate and dishonest opponents of the public option and their squeaky wheels .
Look for the White House to spend the day , and the week , pushing back against this .
Have a tip we should know ?

That 's one tube of glue this guy never thought he'd see .
A married man who planned to rendezvous with one of his handful of lovers at an eastern Wisconsin motel instead got his penis glued to his stomach , according to court documents .
Four women , including his wife , showed up to bind and blindfold the man , plus place the adhesive on his package , all in a bizarre plot to punish him for a lover 's quadrangle gone bad , says the Calumet County docs .
Now it 's the women who face punishment , perhaps six years in prison , and at least one said Monday the story has gotten twisted and she 's embarrassed .
" I am disturbed .
I am upset .
I am having a hard time handling life ; an emotional wreck , " Wendy Sewell , 43 , of Kaukauna , said in a telephone interview from her home .
" I am ashamed . "
Sewell , Therese Ziemann , 48 , of Menasha , Michelle Belliveau , 43 , of Neenah , and the man 's wife are charged with being party to false imprisonment , a felony .
Ziemann also is charged with fourth - degree sexual assault .
The women are free on $ 200 cash bails .
Investigators say all the women but Belliveau were romantically involved with the man .
Online court records did n't list defense attorneys for any of the women Monday .
The women 's plot for revenge unfolded last Thursday at the Lakeview Motel about 30 miles southwest of Green Bay in the tiny village of Stockbridge near the scenic shores of Lake Winnebago .
Criminal complaints filed Friday allege the man agreed to be bound with " sheer sheets ' ' and blindfolded with a pillowcase for a " rub down ' ' by Ziemann .
She instead cut off his underwear with a scissors and summoned the others to the room with a text message .
Ziemann struck the man in the face , and used Krazy Glue to attach his penis to his stomach when the other women arrived , according to the complaints .
The man told investigators he also was threatened with a gun .
Ziemann told investigators she did n't have a gun but may have told the victim , " Do you know how much I want to shoot you ? ' '
He started screaming and the women rushed off fearful that he could get loose and hurt them but allegedly took his wallet , vehicle and cell phone .
Ziemann told investigators she met the man online through Craigslist , fell in love and paid for his use of a room at the motel for the past two months .
She said she gave him about $ 3,000 .
Then last Wednesday , she learned from the man 's wife that he was married , had other girlfriends and was " using them for money . ''
She expected the money to be repaid , according to the documents .
During Thursday 's confrontation with the man , Ziemann told investigators Sewell asked him , " Which one do you love more ? '' and the man 's wife made a derisive remark about him being scared .
The man got free from the bed by chewing through one of his bindings , went outside and borrowed a telephone from the motel owner to call police .
Ziemann and Belliveau are sisters and Belliveau did n't do anything wrong , Sewell said Monday .
" She was just there for moral support .
She was n't even dating the guy .
She stood at the door the whole time and did n't participate or nothing . ''
Ziemann 's husband answered the telephone at their home and declined comment .
There was no telephone listing for Belliveau .
The man had no telephone listing in Fond du Lac .
There are lots of dry lake beds in California , and to the untrained eye , Owens Dry Lake is just like the rest .
But there is one key difference : while most of the state 's stark , white alkali flats have been dry for thousands of years , Owens was an enormous , gem - blue lake stretching more than a hundred miles square -- and an important habitat for millions of migratory birds -- as recently as 1917 .
That 's when the City of Los Angeles stole it , diverting the streams that fed Owens Lake into an aqueduct that watered the booming metropolis 200 miles to the south .
As the lake slowly dried up , so did the once - thriving town of Keeler , which had been both a mining town and something of a lakeside resort .
Nowadays , the " lakeside " town of Keeler is more than a mile from the " shoreline " of Owens Lake -- little more than a collection of marshy mudpits surrounded by an endless expanse of salt flat , the surface of which can reach 150 degrees on hot summer days .
A sarcastic sign near what used to be Keeler 's shoreline .
Losing the lake was one thing .
But it was n't the disappearance of the waterfowl , or a place to swim or fish or go boating , that drove people out of Keeler -- it was the dust storms .
When the lake finally evaporated some years after its streams had been diverted , it left behind a three - foot layer of fine - grained salt , sulfates and old mining chemicals .
The Owens Valley had long been famous for its whipping winds , and all it took to kick up gargantuan clouds of dust was a stiff breeze .
The result : frequent , choking dust storms that made it hard to see , hard to breathe -- and for many , hard to justify staying in Keeler .
A wider view of " the beach " --
Brief surges in mining operations kept people in Keeler through the end of the fifties , but all such activity ceased in 1960 , and the train tracks which once carried valuable ore out of town were ripped out a year later .
The lake did n't dry up all at once -- it took years to evaporate , dying a slow and measurable death .
The dust storms started to get bad in the 60s and 70s , and the population began to drop .
By the 1980s , Keeler had become like many ghost towns in the making : most of those left behind were elderly or disabled .
Many suffered from respiratory problems , and deaths from lung cancer and related disorders were n't uncommon .
These days , the Owens Valley ranks as the dustiest place in North America -- second in the world only to the Aral Sea , Kazakhstan 's infamous ecological nightmare .
Owens Lake from the air .
The wet bits are lawsuit - mandated pools created by the Los Angeles Water Dept. designed to mitigate the dust storms , a technique that 's enjoyed only limited success .

From a 20 - year - old article about Keeler in the Los Angeles Times :
" It was god- awful , " recalled Roberta Ushman , who retired in Keeler from Torrance with her husband , Mike .
" You could n't see across the street .
We had new windows put in , hoping that would slow it down , but it just comes in . "
Jeanne Lopez , the former
Inyo county clerk , said the dust has eroded the paint from her 1985 Dodge and left her with a prolonged sore throat .
" When you 're right in it , it 's frightening .
It blots out the sun , it covers everything , " Lopez said .
" You just feel if it 's coming in your house , if it 's in your bed , it must be getting in your lungs , too . "
Mike Ushman , a painting contractor , blames the dust for the town 's dwindling population .
Four Keeler residents have died recently of lung cancer or other pulmonary troubles , he said .
His two tenants decided to move away after the Feb. 3 storm , and Riley is n't the only man on oxygen , Ushman said .
" There 's too many people dying in this town of lung disorders , " Ushman said .
On my way to the Owens Valley , I saw this salt - and - dust storm rising over the horizon .
I 'm probably 20 miles away , and those are the Eastern Sierras behind it .
That 's a lot of salt .
There 's almost no one left in Keeler now .
The population has dwindled to less than fifty , and in the two hours I spent wandering its streets , I did n't see a single person .
Still , the town had a sort of eerie , silent beauty .
Junked cars and empty shacks , weatherbeaten from years of sun and salt , are being slowly reclaimed by wild grasses .
A tiny beach resort , long ago stripped of paint and nowhere near the retreated water 's edge .
Inside , grass grows in a vacant swimming pool , which gradually fills with wind - blown dirt .
I walked for more than a mile , but never found the lake -- only sand dunes .
This gas station closed more than 30 years ago , eliminating the last reason travelers had to stop in Keeler .
As a resident of LA , I could n't help but feel a little guilty ; there is a direct and tragic relationship between the green lawns of my town and the brown decay of Keeler .
But those , I guess , are the breaks .

In lieu of Joe ’s open thread , I want to talk a little bit about something that happened late yesterday .
FOX ’s Glenn Beck , whose criticism got a top Obama aide fired this week , has also been agitating about ACORN and its involvement with the 2010 census .
The Obama administration has just announced that it is severing its ties with ACORN , and they admitted that they made the move because of the conservative criticism .
The Census Bureau on Friday severed its ties with Acorn , a community organization that Republicans have accused of voter - registration fraud .
In splitting with Acorn , Mr. Groves sought to tamp down negative publicity that the partnership would taint the 2010 census .
Acorn , which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , is one of 80,000 groups of unpaid volunteers working with the bureau to raise awareness of the effort .
“ It is clear that Acorn ’s affiliation with the 2010 census promotion has caused sufficient concern in the general public , has indeed become a distraction from our mission , and may even become a discouragement to public cooperation , negatively impacting 2010 census efforts , ” Mr. Groves wrote .
I think it ’s dangerous to pander to people like Glenn Beck .
Having said that , I personally believed that it was impossible for Van Jones to continue in his job after it was revealed that he had ties to the “ 9/11 truth ” folks .
Politically , that is indefensible , regardless of your personal views .
And ACORN screwed up badly one too many times .
But …
It ’s possible to defend each of the recent administration actions individually ( e.g. , severing ties with ACORN , getting rid of Van Jones , changing the immigration language in the health care bill to address Joe Wilson ’s concerns , even dropping the public option after conservatives angrily disrupt Democratic Townhall meetings ( I do n’t defend dropping it , but I can imagine arguments made for dropping it ( to save the bill , etc. ) ) .
Each action can be justified by the argument that by severing ties with ACORN , or getting rid of Van Jones , the administration has effectively stifled the criticism by nipping the problem in the bud , and thus removed a potential threat to their larger goals .
This is perhaps true – I say perhaps because I do n’t necessarily agree with each action .
But , for arguments sake , let ’s say we do agree .
The problem is that at some point , individual actions , in the aggregate , send a larger , and wrong , message .
The ACORN action , on the heels of Van Jones and Joe Wilson ( not to mention failing to follow through aggressively on campaign promises regarding the public option and gay rights , among other issues ) – and then admitting that these actions were taken to appease some of the administration ’s most vocal conservative critics , does not assuage those critics .
It inspires them to cause even more trouble .
It is not a negotiating tactic to give something for nothing .
If you constantly give your opponent what he demands , and ask for nothing in return , he will demand even more in the future , and likely in a more aggressive manner .
There is a very real danger that these actions , in the aggregate , are helping to revitalize a once disparate , and disillusioned , conservative base and Republican party .
So that not only has the enemy been given more reason to attack , but the attacks will become more lethal as well .
This is why Joe and I have written much in the past several months of the administration ’s desire to assuage its conservative critics , while asking for little to nothing in return ( e.g. , giving the Republicans 40 % of the stimulus bill in the form of ineffective tax cuts in order to win only 3 Republican votes , and then have the Republican party as a whole spend the next six months savaging Obama for passing the bill ) .
The Republicans are in essence being told to keep up the fight and never negotiate , and eventually President Obama and the Democrats in Congress will cave to their demands , while asking nothing in return .
It ’s not the message I would choose .
And I think it ’s going to make it very difficult for the administration and Congress to get anything done in the future .
Quando si dice " mettere il cappello " : Lorenzo Campani nota che al cartello della Croce Rossa e della Provincia di Trento sulla costruzione delle casette di Onna , è stato recentemente aggiunto qualcosina .
Del resto , continua Lorenzo , le casette che oggi inaugurano Berlusconi e Vespa non c'entrano molto con il governo , visto che le ha finanziate la Croce Rossa Italiana e le ha progettate e costruite la Provincia di Trento .
Onna infatti non figurava nell 'elenco , pubblicato dalla Protezione Civile , delle aree interessate dal progetto governativo C.A.S.E nè in quelle del progetto M.A.P. ( moduli abitativi provvisori ) .
Insomma , le casette in questione non erano nel piano del governo ..
Secondo voi lo dirà Bruno Vespa ?

Migrating MacPorts after a major operating system upgrade or from one computer to another
A MacPorts installation is designed to work with a particular operating system and a particular hardware architecture .
This migration procedure ensures a smooth transition after major system changes , such as :
major operating system upgrades ( e.g. , from 10.9 Mavericks to 10.10 Yosemite ) .
architecture migrations ( e.g. , from PowerPC to Intel ) .
migrations from one computer to another
If you do n't want to migrate , you can always ​uninstall MacPorts entirely before manually reinstalling ports .
Note :
If you move from one Mac to another Mac using ​ Migration Assistant , you have to do it first .
Migration procedure
Install the latest version of Xcode and the Xcode command - line tools
Update the development tools by ​installing Xcode .
Open the Xcode application once after installation and follow any prompts .
Install the command line tools package as well ( run xcode - select -- install ) .
Reinstall MacPorts base system
To reinstall , simply install the base MacPorts system for your new platform .
Update your macports.conf ( if not default )
If your macports.conf ( typically at /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf ) contains uncommented settings for universal_archs or build_arch , you will likely want to update them , since unlike earlier OS versions , the compiler on Snow Leopard and later will build for x86_64 by default on systems that support it .
Default values are fine for most users , so unless you know you need something different , just comment out these two lines .
Several other settings in macports .conf have changed their defaults over the years .
Take a moment to compare each line of your macports .conf with the corresponding line in macports.conf.default in the same directory .
Unless you know a reason why a line in your settings file should be different from the defaults , adopt the line from the defaults file .
Reinstall your ports
Save the list of installed ports : port - qv installed > myports.txt ( optional )
Save the list of requested ports : port echo requested | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > requested . txt Uninstall all installed ports : sudo port -f uninstall installed Clean any partially - completed builds : sudo rm - rf /opt/local/ var/ macports / build / *
Download and execute the ​ restore_ports script .
( If you installed MacPorts from source and used a custom prefix , then you 'll need to use the -p option when you run restore_ports.tcl ; see ./restore_ports.tcl -h . ) curl -- location -- remote - name https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/raw/master/restore_ports/restore_ports.tcl chmod +x restore_ports.tcl xattr -d com.apple.quarantine restore_ports.tcl sudo ./restore_ports.tcl myports.txt
Note : ports that are not available on your new platform will be skipped , with only a warning message .
( optional ) Restore requested status :
If you saved the list of requested ports , you can now restore the requested flags for your newly installed ports to their former states .
sudo port unsetrequested installed xargs sudo port setrequested < requested .
txt Warning : if a port in requested .
txt was not installed in the previous step , the iterative setrequested will terminate , leaving some ports still marked as not -requested .
Edit requested .
txt to remove any ports that were not installed and repeat this step .
Double - check your desired ports are set as requested with port echo requested .
Troubleshooting
Though it is now quite well - tested , the restore_ports script may fail in some cases .
One known issue is that the script will fail if there are conflicting ports in the list .
It 's possible to have conflicting ports installed provided at most one of the conflicting set is active .
If the script fails , for this reason , you can delete one of the conflicting ports from myports.
txt and then simply run the script again .
You may need to do this multiple times if there are multiple conflicting ports listed .
In the worst case , you can reinstall your ports manually by browsing myports.
txt and installing the ports one by one , remembering to specify the appropriate variants :
sudo port install portname + variant1 +variant2 …
Note that if you have specified variants which are not the default , you may need to install ports in an order other than the alphabetical order recorded in myports .
txt .
You may skip explicitly installing ports that you did not request as long as they are not using non -default variants since they will be installed as dependencies of other ports .
If you see an " infinite loop " error message , such as this :
Error : we appear to be stuck , exiting ... infinite loop while executing " sort_ports $ portList " invoked from within " set operationList [ sort_ports $ portList ] " ( file " ./restore_ports.tcl " line 285 )
it indicates that the script has a list of ports to install , and it can't figure out which of the ports to install next .
Each port has some obstacle that prevents it from being the next to install .
One cause of this problem is a " dependency cycle " : port A depends directly or indirectly on port B , while port B depends on port A . A workaround is to reduce your list of ports to install , until it no longer has a dependency cycle .
If things go really wrong , do n't forget that you can always ​uninstall MacPorts entirely before manually reinstalling ports .
Another potential problem is that the restore_ports.tcl command may fail with a Too many open files error message .
Under macOS Sierra , the default shell has a default ulimit of 256 open files .
The solution is to restore the ports with a slightly modified command :
sudo bash -c " ulimit -n 4096 ; ./restore_ports.tcl myports.txt "
Shakilus Townsend was ambushed by the six - strong gang A girl must serve at least 10 years in prison for the murder of a 16 - year - old boy who was lured to his death in south London in a " honey trap plot " .
Samantha Joseph , 17 , lured Shakilus Townsend to a waiting gang , which included her ex-boyfriend Danny McLean .
Shakilus , from Deptford , south - east London , was stabbed in Thornton Heath in July 2008 , the Old Bailey heard .
Six other teenagers , including McLean , were found guilty of the murder and jailed for life on Friday .
They were ordered to serve a minimum of between 12 and 15 years .
Joseph was given a minimum tariff of 10 years .
Brothers Tyrell Ellis , 19 , and Don-Carlos Ellis , 18 , from Thornton Heath , were convicted of murder , together with Andrew Johnson - Haynes , 18 , from Croydon , south London , Andre Thompson , 17 , from Norwood , south east London , and Michael Akinfenwa , 18 , from Norwood .
I have been robbed of a very rare and precious gem
Nicola Dyer
Shakilus Townsend 's mother
Honey - trap ' lies ' McLean , 18 , from Thornton Heath , was ordered to serve a minimum 15 years ' detention while Thompson was given a minimum term of 14 years .
Meanwhile the Ellis brothers and Akinfenwa were given minimum 12 - year sentences .
Johnson - Haynes , a former public schoolboy and London Irish rugby player , was also ordered to serve a minimum 12 - year term .
Shakilus , who was " smitten " by Joseph and saw her as his " future wife " , was taken to the cul - de - sac where he was attacked with a baseball bat and stabbed several times , including in the chest and liver .
Brian Altman QC , prosecuting , said Joseph , then aged 16 , " set up the hapless Shakilus Townsend in a honey trap with a lethal and tragic twist " .
Samantha Joseph led Shakilus to the gang , who were masked and hooded Judge Richard Hawkins told the gang : " You left him to die a lonely death , crying for his mother . "
In a victim impact statement , Shakilus 's mother Nicola Dyer , 34 , said : " My feelings about Shaki 's death are a mixture of ever - changing emotions that neither words nor tears can explain .
" I have been robbed of a very rare and precious gem .
He was loved , cherished and needed . "
She added : " I am unable to understand why these youngsters felt that they needed to use the brutality they did , which , in turn , resulted in my son 's life coming to a tragic and abrupt end . "
Ms Dyer said she was " consumed in anger " by seeing the defendants " laughing among themselves " .
She added : " The reality that these young people with no souls had such a disregard for life that they deliberately conspired to use manipulation to cause nothing short of destruction is absolutely soul - destroying for me .
" I may forgive them one day , but not today . "

An increasing number of British musicians are making their opinions known on the issue of illicit file - sharing .
Despite Peter Mandelson 's proposals which ostensibly support the music industry , musicians are divided .
Today it 's the turn of James Blunt , who feels the proposed " disconnection " legislation is critical to the industry 's survival .
“ Sir , I want to put my hand up in support of Lily Allen .
She ’s asking British musicians to galvanise over a serious crime : the death of a great British industry — our music business .
The world over , people are stealing music in its millions in the form of illegal file - sharing .
It ’s easy to do , and has become accepted by many , but people need to know that it is destroying people ’s livelihoods and suffocating emerging British artists . ”
These are the words of singer songwriter James Blunt in The Times today , in response to the opinions of Lily Allen published and republished a thousand times last week .
Allen had taken a swipe at Radiohead ’s Ed O’Brien and Nick Mason , the Pink Floyd drummer , after they came out and said that file - sharing is beneficial for artists .
Both O’Brien and Mason are members of the Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) , which opposes plans by Peter Mandelson to disconnect persistent file - sharers , but they are becoming quite a problem for the rest of the industry .
The major labels , who hold the opposite opinion on the issue of unauthorized downloading , have been in intensive talks with FAC over the last week , trying to reach some sort of consensus on the way ahead .
Somehow the music industry needs to show a united front to the government , but at the moment that seems very unlikely .
Yesterday FAC said that so far they have failed to find a way forward with the rest of the industry .
“ [ The ] power to demand suspensions of accounts is only achievable through a wide - scale invasion of personal privacy which we believe would result in a dangerous reduction in the rights to protection of the individual .
Putting this power in place would reduce the civil liberties of every one of us in the country in order to afford a disincentive threat to a small minority of ‘ egregious offenders ’ .
We believe this would be both disproportionate and unenforceable , ” said FAC in a statement .
FAC said that while it negotiated with the labels all last week , they cannot be moved from their insistence that file - sharers should be disconnected from the Internet .
FAC says it is steadfast in its opposition to this route .
In an attempt to soften their edges and appear less aggressive , UK Music , yet another music industry umbrella organization , has removed the actual word “ disconnection ” from its press releases and statements .
However , even a cursory glance at their current wording shows that this omission is purely cosmetic , instead stating : “ ….. Ofcom should be granted appropriate and proportionate powers as directed by the secretary of state . ”
Of course , Ofcom are the people that are being proposed to have the power to disconnect file - sharers .
So as FAC and the British public stand on one side , Peter Mandelson , the record labels and the likes of Lily Allen and now James Blunt stand on the other .
“ At long last the Government is looking to legislate to protect the industry , ” writes Blunt , while completely forgetting that the UK has some perfectly good copyright laws to deal with , surprisingly , copyright infringement .
“ Peter Mandelson is looking to engage the internet service providers who , in my opinion , handle stolen goods , and should take much more responsibility , ” Blunt continues , while forgetting that as a carrier , under the law ISPs have no responsibility for the traffic they carry or the actions of their subscribers .
“ How this legislation pans out , and if it goes through at all , is critical to the survival of the British music business ; critical to thousands of jobs ; and critical to our ability to nurture and develop great musicians and the songs and albums that we would hope to listen to in the future , ” Blunt concludes .
Bringing in draconian laws to scare the public into buying music is not the answer .
Taking away people ’s Internet is definitely not the solution .
The labels need to realize this and instead provide some high quality all - you - can - eat music services at a price that everyone can afford .
And as UK ISP Virgin Media sends its message to the government that a “ heavy - handed , punitive regime will simply alienate consumers ” and that “ persuasion not coercion ” is the key to solving this illicit file - sharing ‘ problem ’ , I ’ll end with a few lines from martial artist and best - selling author Geoff Thompson ’s book Watch My Back , as he writes about a gang trying to impose their will on others ;
This crew had gained respect in the city , but it was respect born through fear ; stolen not given .
Respect is worthless unless it ’s earned .
Any half - wit can point a loaded gun and demand respect but it brings hate with it .
Real respect encourages co-operation and understanding

Absurd immigration rules force foreign spouses of Americans to immigrate to the United States .
Love happened to me while traveling .
I went to Algeria in 2008 to work on a theater project .
I was determined not to have a single man hit on me .
I bought fake wedding rings and made up a story of a handsome American husband named Luke ( inspired by my mom ’s Labrador ) .
In my imagination he was blond , brown eyes and very athletic .
Then I went to a theater festival in Algiers and met Mohamed , an actor and director .
He used to be a cyclist for the Algerian International team .
He loved camping in the desert .
He was an avid reader .
He wrote plays .
The story of my American husband named Luke evaporated .
Mohamed and I were married in Algeria in January of 2009 .
We thought he could come and visit Minnesota , the summer after our wedding , while I worked with a theater company in Minneapolis .
So Mohamed filled out a tourist visa application online .
He bought a round trip train ticket from Oran to Algiers and took a hotel room .
He arrived at the U.S consulate with $ 131 in hand thinking he had this in the bag .
After all he is married to an American citizen .
Turns out that foreign nationals of countries such as Algeria , Taiwan , Argentina and Qatar are forced to immigrate to the United States if they want to meet their in - laws .
Who knew that the U.S sometimes requires people to immigrate !
According to the Immigration and Nationality Act law 214b :
Every alien shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer , at the time of application for admission , that he is entitled to a non-immigrant status … ( www.uscis.gov)
The U.S consulates around the world , in non-visa waiver countries , assume all spouses of American citizens to be ineligible of non-immigrant status .
( A visa waiver country is any country that is part of the visa - waiver program .
This program allows citizens of certain countries to enter the U.S without a visa . )
Our foreign spouses , the unfortunate citizens of countries that do n’t have a special “ in ” with the U.S , are not even allowed the opportunity to prove to U.S consular officers that they have strong ties to their home country and that they will indeed return at the end of their stay .
Law 214b , as it is currently interpreted and put into practice , denies our foreign born spouses the right to visit the U.S .
In Mohamed ’s case , a consular officer at the U.S Embassy in Algiers informed him that the reason for his immediate visa denial , without review of his supporting documents , is simply the law .
Since his American wife can file a petition for him to immigrate he is not allowed to enter the U.S as a tourist .
“ But I do not want to immigrate , ” he said to the officer behind the window .
“ You must immigrate , ” she said .
“ But I do n’t want to immigrate !
I want to visit . ”
Perhaps some might be overjoyed at hearing those words from an official of the U.S.
You must immigrate !
They might not care they had lost nearly $ 300 .
They might think no sum is too large to get to the U.S .
However , in a situation like ours when you are living abroad and do n’t have immediate plans to move to the U.S this is incredibly difficult .
The interview at the consulate in these cases causes humiliation , loss of hard earned money , and animosity towards our country already facing strong criticism from abroad .
The U.S government arrogantly assumes that everyone intends to immigrate .
How absurd , with all the talk of illegal immigration and undesired immigrants that Mohamed will be forced to immigrate in order to meet the majority of my friends and family .
He has never been denied a visa to Europe .
An established actor in Algeria , teenage girls giggle at him when they cross him on the street .
Why would he want to leave permanently ?
Furthermore , to our chagrin , the consulate in Algiers does not state this fact on their website .
The state department should inform American citizens married to foreign nationals of non-visa waiver states that our spouses are automatically ineligible simply because they are married to us .
Falling in love , marrying , and residing with an American in their home country is a major strike against them .
Twisted is the only word that comes to mind .
Undertaking the immigration petition costs as much as the average monthly salary of most Algerian workers .
Compounding this expense is the validity of the Green Card .
Once a foreign spouse holds the Green Card they must return to the U.S every year .
We live in North Africa and would rather be spending our time and money exploring the sites of the Mediterranean .
Simply put , forcing our spouses to immigrate just to visit and spend time with their family is preposterous .

12 years ago today , Steve Jobs delivered a keynote in Boston where he announced a number of new initiatives with its ole ’ rival Microsoft and an end to the legal battle over Apple ’s allegations that Microsoft illegally copied the “ look and feel ” of the Mac OS .
In the video below , a non-turtleneck clad Jobs announced that Microsoft and Apple had reached a cross licensing agreement whereby each would be free to license each others existing patents and any future patents filed for the next 5 years .
In addition , Jobs noted that Apple would make Internet Explorer the default browser on the Mac ( which resulted in a hilarious round of “ boos ” from the audience ) , and in return , Microsoft would pledge to release versions of Microsoft Office for the Mac for the next 5 years , and that it would also purchase $ 150 million in Apple Stock and not sell it for at least 3 years .
What ’s amusing about the video below is just how anti-Microsoft the crowd is , and it really takes you back to a time when hatred for Microsoft was a lot more common amongst Apple fans than it is today .
About 4:45 seconds into the video , Bill Gates appears via satellite to discuss Microsoft ’s new initiatives with Apple and the crowd reacts as if they ’ve seen the devil himself .
Man , what a time to be a Mac fan !
Soon thereafter , Jobs said what can arguably be probably be classified as one of the most salient and important statements in Apple ’s history .
And if we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again , we have to let go a few things , here .
We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win , Microsoft has to lose .
We have to embrace the notion that for Apple to win , Apple has to do a really good job … the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I ’m concerned .
For anyone too young to remember , the anti-Microsoft sentiment in the 90’s was palpable for Apple fans , and for many , their love of Apple was only rivaled by their hatred for all things Microsoft .
Steve Jobs was keenly aware that Apple could n’t keep on chasing Microsoft Windows forever .
He correctly pointed out that Microsoft had already won the OS wars .
And with that mindset , Jobs helped steer Apple into new directions over the next few years as he oversaw development of the iMac , iPod , and eventually the iPhone .

The Benefits of B Vitamins
Follow 2 Simple Rules and Create aHealthier Happier You !
In todays world , who could n't use a HAPPY Vitamin ?
The Benefits of B Vitamins are amazing and truly can make you " Happy " .
Benefits of B Vitamins include :
converting food to energy
forming healthy red blood cells
reducing the risk of heart disease
reduce or even eliminate PMS symptoms
reduce or eliminate anemia
Minimize and even eliminates depression .
preventing birth defects
Not sure if you should be supplementing your diet with a good b- complex vitamin .
Check the list to see if you have any of these symptoms :
Mood changes
irritability
nervousness
fatigue
depression
headaches
dizziness
trembling
loss of appetite
insomnia
and sugar cravings
One of the biggest complaints I hear if I ask someone whats wrong is " I 'm tired " , " I have no energy " , or " I 'm depressed " .
Before I started taking vitamins I had some of those same complaints .
Your body is telling you its missing something .
It 's missing an important ingredient .
You need supplements like B vitamins to keep you energetic and healthy .
If you give your body what it needs , it will stay healthy and even heal itself .
Your body is an amazing machine .
Give it a good supply of raw materials and do some daily upkeep and you too can live a Healthy Life .
B -Vitamins are one of those very important raw materials .
B vitamins are called the “ happy ” vitamins .
They bring balance to the many systems running your body .
The big question is not " Should I take a B complex supplement ? " , but " Which B complex do I take ? "
Follow these 2 simple rules and improve your health by taking a good , healthy B vitamin .
RULE 1 : Look at whats in it .
There are eight known B vitamins .
Good products have all eight in a balanced form .
The eight ( 8 ) are :
Thiamine ( B - 1 )
Riboflavin ( B - 2 )
Panothenic acid
Niacin
B - 6
Biotin
Folacin
B - 12 All 8 are essential for human metabolism , growth , reproduction , general health , appetite , the normal functioning of the digestive tract , nervous stability and blood cell formation .
B vitamins are competitive in the body .
B vitamins must be taken together in a balanced , complex form in order for your body to use them correctly .
Taking 1 or 2 of the B supplements alone can throw off your metabolism .
Some B - complex components are expensive to produce .
Others are cheap .
Guess which ones are left out of discount vitamins .
Trust me , not all vitamins are the same .
It is worth your time and money to compare vitamins .
Look at the back of the vitamin bottle .
Do you see 6000 % of the recommended daily allowance of one B , ( the less expensive one ) and 20 % of the expensive one ?
Ask yourself if the company making that product is looking out for you health or it bottom line .
B vitamins are like a sports team .
There is no " I in TEAM " .
Everyone must work together to achieve a winning combination .
I can still here my coach , " You are only as strong as your weakest link . "
" Win one for the Gipper " --- but wait –-- I think I am getting off track ....
Vitamin companies are not required to do research on their products .
Most companies do n't do any .
It costs a lot of money .
The old saying of " you get what you pay for " really does hold true for vitamins and supplements .
It is worth the effort to find a company that does the clinical research and can back up their nutritional claims .
RULE 2 : Make sure it gets into your body .
What happens to a vitamin tablet once you swallow it ?
Does it pass through your body unused ?
All you are doing is making expensive urine or ( excuse my language ) " pissing money down the drain " .
OR , Does it get into your body where it can do the job it is meant to do ?
The right blend of all eight B complex vitamins must be included for the tablet to be absorbed correctly .
For example , Folic acid is very difficult to get into the blood stream .
A large part of a pill made of just folic acid would pass right through you and never get absorbed .
But if the pill was made in a correctly balanced form , folic acid could reduce hospital charges for women of child bearing age up to an estimated 20 billion dollars per year .
B vitamins have many positive affects on our bodies .
B Vitamins are so important they are one of the few nutrients the federal government mandates to be added to foods .
The problem :
You can not rely on food for enough B vitamin .
Intense heat , slow cooking , light , baking soda and baking powder all destroy B vitamins .
When was the last time you went through a day without sugar , processed foods , alcohol , caffeine or STRESS .
Everyone of these depletes your body 's supply of vitamin B .
Everytime you eat carbs B - 1 , B - 2 , B - 3 , B - 5 , B - 6 , phosphorous , and magnesium are required to metabolize them .
The last 4 are not replaced by " enrichment " of foods so the body must use its own reserves .
Pantothenic Acid , ( B5 ) gets taken from the nerve and muscle tissue ; Pyridoxine ( B6 ) is taken from the Brain ; Phosphorous and Magnesium are taken from the heart and bones .
Deplete the body of these compounds and you weaken the nerve and muscle tissue which could result in nerve problems and loss of muscle tone .
The loss of brain tissue will affect your memory .
Phosphorous depletion will weaken muscle and rhythm function , affecting the rhythm of the heart .
Processed food removes these B vitamins and enrichment does not add them in a way that our body can use .
I am not trying to scare you but maybe its time to start doing something to help your body .
Do something to boost your health .
It is like insurance for your body .
Give your body what it needs .
Take a small step and make the choice to eat natural foods when possible and supplement your diet with a good B complex vitamin .
Here 's to your health !
B Vitamins are great but your body needs more than just B. Learn about a vitamin pack backed up by 12 clinical trials , 14 patents and a 100 % Guarantee !
Boost your Vitality Today !
‘ Birther ’ Movement Dogs Republicans
Created : July 17 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Kris Kobach campaigns in Wichita , Kans . ( You Tube : WichitaLiberty )
Kris Kobach is a law professor with degrees from Harvard , Yale and Oxford , and a veteran of George W. Bush ’s administration who , after Sept. 11 , helped craft the policy on domestic registration of foreign visitors to the United States .
In May , he announced a run for Kansas secretary of state , campaigning for photo ID requirements at the voting booth .
He ’s considered a clear front - runner for the job .
But over the weekend , Kobach spoke at a Republican Party barbecue and committed a minor gaffe .
According to the Lawrence Journal - World , Kobach “ asked what President Obama and God had in common , with the punchline being neither has a birth certificate . ”
Image by : Matt Mahurin
Kansas Democrats pounced .
“ While Kris Kobach has in the past associated himself with extremists who frequently show poor taste , ” said state Democratic Party Executive Director Kenny Johnston , “ his latest attempt at humor has gone too far . ”
Kobach told the Democrats to “ lighten up ” before walking back the comment , explaining that “ until a court says otherwise , I believe Barack Obama is a natural - born citizen . ”
Kobach could have offered another defense .
The joke was not his .
One month earlier , Rush Limbaugh made the same remark on his radio show .
“ Barack Obama has one thing in common with God , ” Limbaugh said .
“ Know what it is ?
God does not have a birth certificate either . ”
And Limbaugh may not have been writing his own material , either .
At Patriot Depot , a conservative web site that sells books by Glenn Beck and signs designed for anti-tax Tea Parties , buyers can pay $ 10 to get two bumper stickers that read : “ Obama & God Have ONLY ONE THING in Common : NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE !
The Difference Is God Does n’t Think He ’s Obama !
” According to a salesman for Patriot Depot , the company has sold “ hundreds ” of this and another birth certificate sticker since advertising them with the conservative opinion sites GOPUSA.com and Townhall.com .
Six months into Obama ’s presidency , after scores of embarrassing legal defeats , and even after tussles between the attoneys who ’ve turned frivolous lawsuits about the president ’s citizenship into full - time jobs , the cottage industry of conspiracy theories about the president ’s birth shows no signs of disappearing .
The theories have found a home in talk radio and on conservative web sites such as Free Republic and WorldNetDaily .
Conspiracy theorists are increasingly sending letters to their local papers , embarrassing members of Congress at town hall meetings , and hounding Hill staffers about challenges to the president ’s citizenship .
“ I would n’t consider what Kris Kobach said a ‘ gaffe , ’ although it was n’t a prudent comment , ” said William B. Lacy , director of the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas .
“ It ’s not at the root of the complaint that conservative [ Republicans ] have with this administration .
In essence , what any Republican is doing by raising that issue is creating his or her own red herring .
Kobach is probably okay here , but there ’s a certain danger , I think , if it becomes something you repeat on a continuous basis . ”
There ’s no indication that the White House is worried about all of this .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs has occasionally called on Lester Kinsolving , a radio host and correspondent for WorldNetDaily , to air the latest theories about the president ’s citizenship as a way of defusing tense press briefings .
While “ birthers ” claim that the president ’s lawyers have spent “ hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars ” fighting their lawsuits , they ’ve never provided evidence for that claim .
Indeed , most of the suits have been tossed out of court on technicalities .
Ironically , the ‘ birther ’ movement began in response to Obama ’s own efforts to debunk rumors .
One year ago this week , the presidential campaign of then - Sen .
Barack Obama launched FightTheSmears.com , a web site designed to push back against false rumors about the first African - American presidential nominee .
To push back against rumors that he was not born in Hawaii , the campaign reproduced a Certificate of Live Birth from the state ’s Health Department .
Instead of terminating the conspiracy theories , that inspired new theories — that the certificate had been forged or that even if it had n’t been forged it was the sort of certificate that could be given to someone born outside of the United States .
But the certificate is specific about Obama ’s birth in Honolulu , down to the 7:24 p.m. time .
“ It ’s crazy , ” said Janice Okubo , director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health .
“ I do n’t think anything is ever going to satisfy them . ”
Okubo , who said that she gets weekly questions from Obama ‘ Birthers ’ that are “ more like threats , ” explained that the certificate of live birth reproduced by Obama ’s campaign should have debunked the conspiracy theories .
“ If you were born in Bali , for example , ” Okubo explained , “ you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali .
You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu .
The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate .
But it ’s become very clear that it does n’t matter what I say .
The people who are questioning this bring up all these implausible scenarios .
What if the physician lied ?
What if the state lied ?
It ’s just become an urban legend at this point . ”
The urban legend has become too pervasive for Republicans to avoid .
In February , Rep. Bill Posey ( R - Fla . ) introduced a much - mocked bill that would require presidential campaigns to provide “ a copy of the candidate ’s birth certificate . ”
While Posey initially said that he disbelieved conspiracy theories about the president ’s birth , he told the host of an Internet radio show that he ’d discussed the possibility of Obama being removed from office over “ the eligibility issue ” with “ high - ranking members of our Judiciary Committee . ”
As of July 15 , nine fellow Republican members of Congress were backing the bill .
While Rep. Randy Neugebauer ( R - Texas ) has said that he supports the bill because he did n’t know whether Obama was a citizen , other sponsors say that they weighed in to pour cold water on the conspiracy theories .
“ It ’s a good idea , ” said John Donnelly , a spokesman for Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind. ) , who became one of the bill ’s co-sponsors this month .
“ If candidates provided that information to the Federal Election Commission you would n’t have all this hullaballoo .
You do n’t want to needlessly expose presidents to crazy conspiracy theories . ”
At the state level , “ birther ” conspiracy theorists have made headway in getting Republican lawmakers interested in legislation like Posey ’s .
At least four Republican members of Missouri ’s state legislature have looked into introducing a similar bill .
State Sen. Randy Brogdon ( R - Okla . ) who is running for governor of Oklahoma in 2010 , said that he ’d co-sponsor birth certificate legislation if it made it out of the state senate and would “ definitely ” sign the bill if he won the governorship .
“ You bet I ’d sign it , ” said Brodgon .
“ I know I ’d have no problem showing my birth certificate . ”
The Republicans who appear to be willing to listen to “ birthers , ” even to debunk them , have to walk a tightrope .
In April , freshman Rep. Cynthia Lummis ( R - Wyo. ) held a town hall meeting at her old high school in Cheyenne , Wyo. , and got a question about the president ’s citizenship .
Lummis challenged the skeptic to “ please send ” evidence that the president was not a natural - born citizen .
“ I ’m not questioning your concern , ” Lummis said .
“ I am questioning whether there is credible evidence . ”
In early July , a small group of “ birthers ” walked the halls of Congress handing “ grand jury presentments ” over to the confused front desk assistants of members of Congress ; the activists rushed online to report the latest member who had been “ handed ” the information .
After “ birthers ” provided some of their papers to Michael Schwartz , the chief of staff to Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , they rushed online to report that Schwartz had been won over to the cause and was about to get in touch with Orly Taitz , a California lawyer who has filed several unsuccessful challenges to the president ’s citizenship .
“ It is possible to mistake politeness for agreement , ” Schwartz told TWI , “ and I make every effort to be polite . ”
He did have a “ brief conversation with Dr. Taitz , ” but challenged the way online “ birthers ” had hyped their contact with Coburn ’s office .
“ An observer would not report it quite like this , ” said Schwartz .
Taitz ’s lawsuits and the pressure of conservative talkers like Limbaugh have made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to avoid the “ birthers . ”
On June 16 , after Limbaugh joked about the president ’s citizenship , WorldNetDaily editor - in- chief Joseph Farah appeared on the Web - based Recharge Radio to thank the host for spreading the “ birther ” message .
“ What that did is beyond Rush ’s impact , ” said Farah .
“ It also gives other talk show hosts license to talk about this issue … Rush is kind of the standard of talk show hosts .
A lot of people emulate what he does .
He crossed the Rubicon on that show , and I ’m very proud of him for doing it . ”
Farah ’s instincts have been borne out by conservative media .
This week , Taitz represented Maj. Stefan F. Cook , a reservist who volunteered for duty in Afghanistan , then demanded to be released from the commitment unless the president proved that he was a U.S. citizen .
“ I did not volunteer with the intent of becoming a conscientious objector , ” Cook told TWI in an email .
On Wednesday Cook ’s deployment was cancelled , and a spokesman for Centcom took issue with Taitz ’s claim , made in a WorldNetDaily story , that this decision verified conspiracy theories about the president ’s birth .
Later that night , Sean Hannity cited the story on his Fox News show and used Taitz ’s version of the facts , not Centcom’s .
“ Major Cook and his lawyer expressed joy at this outcome , ” said Hannity .
“ And they took it as an admission on the part of the military that the president is not in fact a legitimate citizen by birth . ”

After a few days spent camping with SafeGround in their tent village or in the forest near the river , my heart had melded in alliance with their cause .
I never feared arrest by the police - - not only because I knew my case would be handled differently -- but a few days in the life outside helped me appreciate the bone - numbing exhaustion the homeless have to endure in order to keep moving along .
Stay in one spot too long and the police will pick you up .
Even when staying in the SafeGround tent village , everyone would wake up by 5:30 am and head to Loaves and Fishes to wait for breakfast , just in case the police decided to have another raid that day .
The Zimmermans spent only one night in the SafeGround tent village before a local non-profit group , Francis House , arranged for a one - week motel voucher so they could heal from their heart attacks out of the elements .
I made sure they had food to eat , and tried to help arrange for travel to Seattle so Charles could still have his dream job on that ranch .
The rancher , unfortunately , decided he did n't want to hire Charles anymore .
I 'd also started lobbying political and military connections to see if someone could fast - track resolution of Charles ' stalled military pension .
As it turns out , I did n't even need to do that .
According to Charles , Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) apparently read my piece about the Zimmermans and contacted Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , who sits on the Committee on Veterans Affairs .
As a result of their efforts , Charles Zimmerman had a mind - blowing meeting with a representative of the US Army yesterday afternoon .*
Charles called me as soon as the meeting had ended to tell me that the man had apologized for the delayed resolution of his case .
He said Charles would start receiving full benefits within a matter of weeks , including an initial check that would cover backpay for the past 18 years since his retirement .
" Are you sitting down ? " Charles asks .
" Yes , " I say .
" They say they 'll be sending me a check for $ 972,000 , " he replies .
We both laugh semi-hysterically for a bit before calming down enough to discuss rationally .
" What are you going to do with all that money ? , " I ask .
" Retire , " he says .
" Then help SafeGround as much as I can .
And that 's it . "
Mayor Kevin Johnson joined us at SafeGround for dinner Saturday night , breaking bread with the small homeless community to demonstrate his understanding of their situation , and his dedication to formulating an effective plan to give them a safe place to lay their heads at night .
Johnson committed to having a comprehensive proposal in front of the City Council within the next month , drawing from the input of the homeless , and various relief agencies .
Though a positive light hovers on the horizon for SafeGround , on Sunday they had to abandon the tent village they 'd established in the vacant lot owned by lawyer Mark Merin .
The city consequently dropped its case charging that Merin had created a public nuisance by allowing the homeless to camp on his property .
A judge dismissed charges brought by the neighbors to the property , though allowed them a window in which to charge civil damages against Merin .
It 's a photo that measures all of three by three inches in our September issue , but the letters about it started to flood my inbox literally the day Glamour hit newsstands .
( As editor - in - chief , I pay attention to this stuff ! )
" I am gasping with delight ... I love the woman on p 194 ! " said one ... then another , and another , andanotherandanotherandanother .
So ... who is she ?
And what on earth is so special about her ?
UPDATE : * See the body image revolution started by your amazing comments below .
*
Here 's the deal :
The picture was n't of a celebrity .
It was n't of a supermodel .
It was of a woman sitting in her underwear with a smile on her face and a belly that looks ... wait for it ... normal .
I 'd loved this photo at first sight myself -- we 'd commissioned it for a story on feeling comfortable in your skin , and wanted a model who looked like she was .
But even so , the letters blew me away : " the most amazing photograph I 've ever seen in any women 's magazine , " wrote one reader in Pavo , Georgia .
From another in Somerset , Massachusetts : " This beautiful woman has a real stomach and did I even see a few stretch marks ?
This is how my belly looks after giving birth to my two amazing kids !
This photo made me want to shout from the rooftops . "
The emails were filled with such joy -- joy at seeing a woman 's body with all the curves and quirks and rolls found in nature .
( Raising a question :
With all the six - packs out there , do you even know what a normal belly looks like anymore -- other than the one you see in the mirror ? )
So what 's the story behind the photo ?
" The woman on p. 194 " is actually 20 - year - old model Lizzi Miller , and this is her second appearance in Glamour , shot by fashion photographer Walter Chin .
A size 12 - 14 and avid softball player / belly dancer ( " I like exercising when it 's fun " ) , Lizzi moved to New York City from San Jose three years ago to become a model ( a " plus - size " one by modeling industry standards , though hello , at size 12 she 's actually " normal size " ... but I digress ) .
" When I was young I really struggled with my body and how it looked because I did n't understand why my friends were so effortlessly skinny , " Lizzi told me .
" As I got older I realized that everyone 's body is different and not everyone is skinny naturally -- me included !
I learned to love my body for how it is , every curve of it .
I used to be so self - conscious in a bikini because my stomach was n't perfectly defined .
But everyone has different body shapes !
And it 's not all about the physical !
If you walk on the beach in your bikini with confidence and you feel sexy , people will see you that way too . "
Everything man-made we see and use today has a creator .
This creator had an idea which turned into a concept .
From that concept flourished the vision .
Then the vision became reality , but with reality comes many questions such as â€ ˜What will it look like , is it needed or wanted or how will it be used by the end - user these all need answers .
With every new product created , it can then be adapted by someone else who has a different vision and so the cycle of production continues and grows .
A man named Cleven Goudeau A.K.A ( also known as ) Goodie had such a vision , which was way back in 1963 .
Mr. Cleven Goudeauâs vision has allowed many including myself to take part in the journey he started so long ago .
A journey of recognising that black art and culture exists and should be seen .
Goodie is truly the Pioneer and Innovator of Black Contemporary Greeting Cards .
It had to begin somewhere and it started with this man .
Black greeting card businesses today whether they are a website store on the internet or a market store in your local town did not exist .
Come to think of it when Goodies artistry talent was first published in a newspaper in 1951 , the World Wide Web , which we have come to depend upon today did not even exist then for the internet was born in 1969 .
Nothing along these lines existed when Goodie took those bold first steps and produced his first black card in 1963 .
Others did not even realize these steps needed to be taken .
But that ’s the beautiful thing about ideas , it only takes one person to visualise something special and to pursue it .
Then that idea brings great changes to society and then society adapts to include those great ideas .
It has taken many years for this man â€ œGoodieâ€ to be recognized and granted such a title of Pioneer of Black Greeting Cardsâ€ .
He has opened many doors for ethnic greeting card designers like me , yet many black people still donâ€™t know this courageous man exists and the achievements he reached .
I truly believe without his vision in 1963 , we would not see black cultured greeting cards today .
You have to also remember that when Goodies ’ vision materialised segregation was still around .
A time when black people where looked down upon , not worthy of sharing the same schools with our white counterparts .
With all this going on , what Goodie did was a heroic achievement up there with Rosa Parks , sitting at the front of the bus achievement .
Its people like Goodie that inspires me and makes me truly love my black culture .
A culture , which has overcome many obstacles and is still breaking down barriers today .
The turning point for Goodie was when his mother was ill and had to go to the hospital .
Wanting to give her a special card he designed his own Get Well card .
The doctors and nurses loved it so much that this single black greeting card found its way around the whole hospital .
With such a great response his first line of Goodie Cards was born .
Which I find ironic for that was the reason I started my line of greeting cards , but I designed my black card for Mother day .
His cards sold at local specialty stores in 1966 .Â
He tried to get help with a business loan of $ 50,000 but was denied .
Goodie was entering an industry with a brand new product that had no rules , no standard , and no nothing .
A great product for over 20 million black people to enjoy but the white organisations in the industry did not understand .
The greeting card industry then was worth $ 800 million annually and had only four major players .
Yet these major players were not making black greeting cards .
In 1968 Goodie became the co-founder and executive creative director of Onyx Enterprises Inc .
This was the only greeting card company that produced black greeting cards and white greeting cards side by side nationally .
Sadly Goodie left the greeting card business in1973 due to disappointing sales and complications with marketing .
His product had its own merits and needed nothing more than equal acceptance by the companies already in the greeting card industry .
For he was in a time when black people had to prove themselves .
This great vision was not embraced like it should have been all because they did not want to understand what black people wanted and needed .
Thanks to the most high and his blessed talent his range of Goodie Cards allowed him to put three kids through college , yet Hallmark and other greeting card companies will happily stand by the statement that there was no market for black greeting cards and totally deny the black market .
However , their statement simply does not make sense to me , why because black people have always existed and we have the same needs as any other culture .
Therefore if white people have a way to share happy celebrated moments by sending greeting cards , why would n’t their black counterparts want the same .
Today Goodie works with students introducing them to the world of cartooning through classes at Micheals in Vallejo , while also teaching classes at the Vallejo Arts Foundation .
This great man should be part of black history and be remembered for what he has done , for so many of us are striving to succeed in the greeting card industry with our own range of black greeting cards .
He has achieved so much and broken down so many barriers for us , yet this great man is so humble , he is truly blessed .
His words is the only way to end this epic story :
I create things that ca n’t be denied .

Let 's Play Splinter Cell : Conviction - Mission 11 : The White House with Alfredo and Destin
Susan Davis reports on the president ’s address on health care .
Associated Press South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson .
President Barack Obama ’s address to Congress this evening was moving along fairly smoothly until he pledged that there was nothing in the legislation that would provide health care to the millions of illegal immigrants residing in the nation .
A cry of “ You lie ! ” was audible from the Republican side of the aisle .
That heckler was South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson .
( Watch the video HERE . )
“ It ’s not true , ” the president responded to the outburst , while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , seated behind the president , offered her mother - of - five glare towards the Republican side of the chamber .
First Lady Michelle Obama was seen shaking her head from side to side .
While lawmakers may have become accustomed to that kind of language during the contentious town hall meetings in August , Wilson ’s outburst was uncommon for a joint session of Congress , where decorum usually reigns .
A spokesman for Wilson did not immediately return a request for comment .
UPDATE : Wilson ’s comment has prompted immediate and intense reactions .
“ Joe Wilson ” is currently the number one search item on Twitter , and fellow Republican and Arizona Sen .
John McCain called his comment “ totally disrespectful ” on CNN ’s Larry King Live .
McCain said Wilson should apologize to the president “ immediately . ”
Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill weighed in on her Twitter page : “ Biggest disappointmnt ( sic ) of evening , the total lack of respect shown by one member for the President .
Never acceptable to behave like a jerk . ”
UPDATE 10:33 p.m. : Wilson apologizes in a statement : “ This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president ’s remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill .
While I disagree with the president ’s statement , my comments were inappropriate and regrettable .
I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility . ”
So now it ’s official : I was right and the rest of the media was wrong about the war in Georgia last year .
The EU just issued a report blaming Georgia for starting last year ’s war with Russians .
About 1 year and 1 month after I wrote the same thing .
Unlike everyone else in the Western media , from the very start I wrote in The Nation that Georgia was to blame for starting the war , first here on Day 1 of the war , and then here a few days later .
Meanwhile , as I later wrote , the corporate media wrongly pinned all the blame for the war on a Stalinist / imperialist Russia bent on invading and taking back its former empire by force .
Just as they did with the Iraq War , the media once again lied to us and almost dragged America into what they were calling a “ New Cold War , ” one of John McCain ’s main campaign promises .
I took a lot of shit last year for not falling into line with the rest of the media over the war , so I ’m going to take this opportunity to do a little Dirty Chicken dance on your faces :
EU report : Georgian attack started war with Russia BRUSSELS — Georgia ’s attack on its breakaway South Ossetia region marked the start of last year ’s war with Russia , which retaliated with excessive force , an EU - commissioned report said Wednesday .
The report on the five - day war in August 2008 lay blame on both sides , but cited Georgia as starting the conflict with its night shelling in South Ossetia — an act it said was not justifiable under international law .
I guess we can expect mass firings in the media , and a giant bonus check my way for being right ?
Because America is a meritocracy , and being right gets rewarded , and being wrong gets you punished ?
Yeah ?
I ’m waiting …
I wrote a lot about that war last year , in part because I went down to the war zone myself .
I wrote about my experience there for the late great Radar magazine ’s swansong issue–the article , “ The Late Great American Empire , ” remains one of my prouder moments as a lowly journalist .

They were unlikely scenes for a quiet corner of the English countryside more used to fetes and flower festivals as two extremes of the British political spectrum invaded a tiny Derbyshire village yesterday .
Down a lane lined with redbrick houses , fields and conifer–edged bungalows , about 1,500 protestors spent several hours scuffling with police , hurling the occasional missile and yelling anti-Nazi slogans as dozens of officers , with dogs , vans and horses , held them back .
There were several arrests .
Over the thick hedge was the 10th annual gathering of the British National Party – the Red , White and Blue festival – underway this weekend on private farmland owned by a supporter between the villages of Denby and Codnor in the Amber Valley .
Inside the BNP site security men and women , all in black with trousers tucked into army boots , were stopping people leaving the site " for their own safety " .
But a temporary blockade of about 60 protesters stopping party members reaching the site from the other end of the lane was quickly broken up by police , and the promised " kettling " , or herding , of the BNP by the Unite Against Fascism activists never happened .
" We have the full support of residents , " said BNP official Simon Darby .
" We are pleased by the turnout , it 's up on last year , but with us winning the European election and a couple of county council seats we knew we 'd see a few more here .
But we are not here for trouble , it 's a nice family festival . "
But the reaction from locals was mixed .
At one end of the Codnor Denby Lane the church of St James held hourly prayers for " peace and tolerance " and allowed the protesters to use their toilets , while other residents brought cups of tea to police and reporters .
But shopkeepers were furious at the invasion , not of the BNP but of the protesters – a mix of anti-racist groups , union and Socialist Worker party members , or the " Trots , anarchists and troublemakers " , as one woman put it .
Eric Madeley closed his watch and clock repairers yesterday , despite it being his busiest day .
" In a selfish way the BNP are not bothering me but these protesters are .
They are just so intimidating , especially those with scarves round their faces .
It 's very worrying .
" There is a lot of support for the BNP around here , you can tell when you talk to people .
But we do n't have any bother , we are quite ethnically mixed – the Chinese running the chip shop , Asians have the shop down the road and there 's the Indian restaurant .
There 's no animosity towards them .
At the end of the day the BNP is entitled to its view , not that I 'd vote for them , but there is a lot of uncertainty in the country . "
The chemist was open for business .
" The BNP are a political party so they are entitled to their conference , same as anyone , " said pharmacist Umesh Solanki .
" People will be feeling resentful about immigration in a time of recession , same as any country .
A small lawful protest is also fine but the numbers here are too high . "
Local Labour MP Judy Mallaber said such a political gathering should not be being held in the village .
" For three years we have argued this site is completely unsuitable and it causes extreme stress for the people who live and farm right next to it and it means people who wish to exercise their right to protest have to do so in narrow streets , which causes more upset to residents and shopkeepers .
The BNP are seeking support , but they just show their contempt by going ahead without consideration for the effect on our community . "
John Kimberley , of the Amber Valley campaign against racism and fascism , said : " We just wanted to be close enough for the people inside the BNP camp to hear us , to demoralise them and to make sure that they know that no matter how they might try to present themselves , we recognise they are fascists . "
The noise of the police helicopter made that impossible and inside the BNP site many of the festival - goers were mostly unaware of the skirmishes outside .
Builder David Weaver , 47 , had brought his family up from Cornwall for the event .
Sitting on the grass next to a faux cemetery of crosses commemorating those the BNP claimed were " white victims of black racism " , he was having a picnic with his wife Penny and daughters Holly , 14 , Beth , 12 , and 10 - year - old Jenny .
" It 's the first time we 've come here .
I 've been a Labour voter but I 've joined the BNP because I think those people outside are shortsighted , they have no vision of what Britain will be like in 20 years time , " he said .
" Where are all the feminist groups coming out against the burqa ?
I have three daughters and I tell them I 'm fighting for them , so they have a future that is n't taken over by ranting Islamic clerics .
I 'm not racist , I do n't hate anyone , but immigration has gone too far . "
Inside the speaker 's marquee the BNP leader , Nick Griffin , was on the podium delivering a speech attacking those who called the party racist .
Outside , next to a stall selling Enoch Powell T - Shirts and golliwog mugs , Robert Walker , 47 , and his 16 - year - old son Daniel , from Huddersfield , were running a train set display .
" A British craft , " he said , bemoaning that much of it was made in China .
Walker complained that he had not been able to find a toy white conductor for the set .
Joe and Judith Osbourne are retired farmers whose fields edge the BNP site .
" Last year there was goose - stepping down this lane at 2 am and shouts of ' Heil Hitler ' , " said Mrs Osbourne .
" We were horrified when this first started , " said Mr Osbourne .
" We see them as racist and divisive .
They say they have the support of the local people , but when they offered free entry to the festival for residents only two people took them up on it so I do n't know what support they think they have .
Even the pub has a sign saying ' No BNP ' .
It is very upsetting to see them all in the next field . "
But as the flags of St George and the Union Jacks fluttered across the BNP campsite , the party 's treasurer John Walker said they were already planning next year 's gathering : " This time we will get licensing for live music and make it a livelier event . "
GAITHERSBURG , Md. --
Police escorted a procession of trucks hauling steel from the World Trade Center towers out of the area Tuesday morning .
For the past three years , the steel had been at the National Institute of Standards and Technology , where the events of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks were reconstructed .
The steel is being taken back to New York City .
NIST and its contractors and collaborators recommended " action in the areas of increased structural integrity , enhanced fire endurance of structures , new methods for fire resistant design of structures , enhanced active fire protection , improved building evacuation , improved emergency response , improved procedures and practices , and education and training . "
The convoy traveled down Interstate 270 to the Beltway , then north on Interstate 95 toward New York .
Every truck was flying the Star - Spangled Banner , NBC4 viewer Heather Salley said in an e-mail .
" Very sobering drive to work , " she wrote .
Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) , who is married , admits to an affair with a staffer who was married to one of his aides .
So you 've got betrayal ( of wife ) , betrayal ( of the man who worked for you ) , bad - judgment - fraternization ( top man in office boinking a staffer ) .
Then , as dramatic convention increasingly requires , you 've got the banal hypocrisy :
When Bill Clinton 's adultery came to public light , Ensign not only voted to remove the president from office , but insisted the president should resign as a result of the personal scandal .
When former Sen. Larry Craig was caught up in a sex scandal , Ensign not only called for Craig 's ouster , but led the charge against him .
Ensign has also been a fierce opponent of marriage equality , and supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage .
In 2004 , the Nevada Republican lectured his colleagues , " Marriage is the cornerstone on which our society was founded .
For those who say that the Constitution is so sacred that we cannot or should not adopt the Federal Marriage Amendment , I would simply point out that marriage , and the sanctity of that institution , predates the American Constitution and the founding of our nation . "
And did I mention that Ensign is a longtime member of the Promise Keepers , a conservative evangelical group that promotes strong families and marriages ?
I 'm not thrilled about stuff like this continuing to tank the Republican brand , because the Democrats are so very bad in so many exciting different ways .
However , I do appreciate that Sen. Ensign ( not in a red shirt , regrettably ) , Sen. " Huggies " Vitter , and Rep . Craig are bringing closer the day when Republicans cannot bloviate about matters of sexual propriety without everyone snickering and idly speculating about whether the pockets of their impeccable blue suits are stuffed with smuggled Thai anal beads made out of the polished bone of dead hookers .

The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the Record column , Sunday 4 October 2009
In the article below we said divorce in Italy was legalised in 1974 after a referendum but divorce was legalised in 1970 and a referendum , held in 1974 , failed to overturn it .
Towards the end of her career as one of Italy 's most famous and loved leading ladies , the Roman actress Anna Magnani instructed her make - up artist not to conceal the lines and wrinkles on her face .
" Leave them all there , " she said .
" I spent a lifetime earning them . "
Magnani is now celebrated as a role model for a new generation of Italian feminists , galvanised by sex scandals involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , and a daily diet of sexist imagery in the media .
Archive footage of Magnani's bon mot appears in a short documentary which has become a word - of - mouth sensation online in Italy .
Il Corpo delle Donne , or The Body of Women , is an acid critique of the routine sexism that pervades commercial Italian television .
In the film Magnani 's humorous dignity is contrasted with clip after clip featuring semi-naked showgirls and Botoxed presenters , all enduring programme formats designed to reveal as much flesh as is permissible at prime time , with a coruscating commentary by director Lorella Zanardo .
More than half a million viewers have so far watched Il Corpo delle Donne and last month the film was shown and discussed on one of the country 's most popular talk shows .
After a summer of sleaze in which Berlusconi has been variously accused of " frequenting minors " , sleeping with an escort girl and holding debauched parties at his Sardinian villa , a feminist backlash is gaining momentum .
The target is not only Berlusconi but the wider culture of a country in which a prime minister could survive such allegations .
According to Chiara Volpato , an academic at Milan 's Bicocca University , matters hit rock bottom when Berlusconi 's lawyer said his client would never pay for sex with an escort because the prime minister is merely an " end user " of women : " The choice of language really summed up how far we have sunk . "
This summer a group of academics , including Volpato , persuaded 15,000 people to sign a petition asking the wives of world leaders to boycott the G8 conference in Italy in protest at the plight of women in Berlusconi's Italy .
Female judges , senators , nuns , historians and businesswomen circulated two more petitions calling for an end to sexism on television , while the European court of human rights will decide if Berlusconi can be sanctioned for sexism after two politicians , Donata Gottardi and Anna Paola Concia , complained to the court about his " continuous and repeated disrespectful statements about the lives and the dignity of women " .
Last week , when journalist Maria Laura Rodotà published an open letter to Italian women in Corriere della Sera calling for a " New Feminism " , she was overwhelmed with responses .
" It was like uncorking a bottle , " she said .
Protest is also emerging on the right .
An article damning Berlusconi for promoting beautiful young women to political positions has been written by academic Sofia Ventura and published by a think - tank run by Berlusconi 's ally Gianfranco Fini .
Times were not always so bad .
Italian women can draw inspiration from a proud record of winning rights in the 1970s , when 20,000 feminists would fill Rome 's streets on protest marches .
Despite fierce resistance from the Vatican , divorce was legalised in 1974 after a referendum , and parliament legalised abortion in 1978 .
" In an Italy with no divorce , secret abortions and huge inequality in the home , feminism achieved nothing short of an earthquake , " said Miriam Mafai , a former parliamentarian and veteran journalist who helped to launch the Italian daily La Repubblica in 1976 .
But in recent years the Vatican has been making up lost ground .
Abortion may be legal , but women have reported Catholic doctors refusing to supply even morning - after pills .
And in the prime minister the unreconstructed Italian male has found a 21st - century hero .
Zanardo said that television was playing a crucial role in demeaning women and damaging their self - esteem : " Eighty per cent of Italians who watch TV use it as their sole source of information and 80 % of the women featured on TV are either sex objects or mere decoration . "
As young girls bred on Italian TV increasingly dream of life as a velina , or showgirl , their mothers are often too tired to protest , she added .
" Between jobs and housework , Italian women now work two hours a day longer than the European average . "
For now , the modern feminist revolt remains largely confined to universities and national newspapers .
Despite the flurry of activity , Ventura said she was pessimistic about rank - and - file women joining the petition - signing intellectuals who are mobilising : " The alarm is sounding in universities but not elsewhere , this is not yet a political problem .
Feminism achieved a lot first time round , but evidently it did not reach deep enough . "
Zanardo disagrees , claiming protest is growing outside university corridors , but people do not know where to look .
" It 's happening on the internet .
The proof was when the University of Bologna withdrew erotic images it used in advertising after a huge online protest . "
There are other signs .
A risqué TV comedy show on a Berlusconi channel was moved to a later time slot after protests from a parents ' group .
And when a blonde model on Berlusconi 's flagship football programme exposed a breast during a dance routine she was promptly sacked .
" I do n't think that would have happened in the past , " said Zanardo .
Zanardo's website is registering complaints about lewd images on TV and is planning courses in schools " to help children defend themselves from this television " .
The response to Il Corpo delle Donne , she says , has been overwhelming : " People who watch Italian TV all the time have told me ' Thanks , it 's the first time I really see what is going on ' . "
Last week , the Yale Project on Climate Change and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communications released their 2009 “ Six America ’s ” study .
The study finds that the U.S. population can be broadly broken up into six different categories that the study ’s authors name as follows : Alarmed , Concerned , Cautious , Disengaged , Doubtful , and Dismissive .
Here ’s how the Executive Summary describes each of the six groups :
The Alarmed ( 18 % ) are fully convinced of the reality and seriousness of climate change and are already taking individual , consumer , and political action to address it .
The Concerned ( 33 % ) – the largest of the six Americas – are also convinced that global warming is happening and a serious problem , but have not yet engaged the issue personally .
Three other Americas – the Cautious ( 19 % ) , the Disengaged ( 12 % ) and the Doubtful ( 11 % ) – represent different stages of understanding and acceptance of the problem , and none are actively involved .
The final America – the Dismissive ( 7 % ) – are very sure it is not happening and are actively involved as opponents of a national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The survey made a number of interesting findings :
Large majorities of all six groups are skeptical of humanity ’s ability to address climate disruption ( Figure 13 ) .
The Dismissive are as certain that climate disruption is n’t even happening as the Alarmed are certain that climate disruption is happening .
( Figure 5 ) .
Both the Alarmed and the Dismissive are very confident that they know what ’s really going on with climate ( Figure 7 ) .
Four of the six groups ( Alarmed , Concerned , Caution , and Disengaged ) all at least “ somewhat support ” carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) regulations ( Figure 19 ) .
) regulations ( Figure 19 ) .
Only the Dismissive group actually opposes increased fuel efficiency standards , and even then just barely ( Figure 20 ) .
All six groups at least “ somewhat support ” rebates for solar power installation and / or fuel efficient vehicles ( Figure 21 ) .
There is limited support for carbon capitalism , aka cap and trade , across all groups ( Figure 22 ) .
While the Alarmed and Concerned are largely Democrats , and the Doubtful and Dismissive are largely Republicans , iindependents are split nearly equally across all six groups ( Figure 29 ) .
All the groups are neutral to trusting of scientists as good sources of information about climate disruption , and all the groups are neutral to distrustful of the media as good sources of information ( Figures 35 and 36 respectively ) .
Catholics trend slightly toward being Alarmed , Protestants trend slightly toward being Doubtful , Mormons toward being Dismissive , Jews toward being Alarmed , “ other Christians ” toward being Dismissive , and all other religious groups ( non-religious , Buddhist , Hindu , Muslim , and non-Christians ) toward being Alarmed ( Table 23 ) .
The Dismissive have the highest number of self - identified “ evangelical ” or “ born - again ” Christians of any group ( Figure 33 ) .
The Dismissive listen to the radio the most , get the most information from the Web , read newspapers the least , and watch the least television of all the six groups ( Table 27 ) .
The Dismissive listen to the least “ apolitical ” news and have the most politically - biased news consumption of all the gruops .
The Concerned ( not the Alarmed ) are the group that trend opposite of the Dismissive .
Furthermore , the Dismissive are the most polarized in their news habits – all of the other five groups consume more varied news ( NPR , MSNBC , CNN , and Fox ) than the Dismissive , which get their news almost exclusively from a few sources ( Fox , for example ) .
The Alarmed consume the widest variety of news sources ( Table 28 ) .
There is , however , a potentially significant problem – the demographic information runs contrary to most prior studies I ’ve read about .
An ABC News poll found that people under 30 overwhelmingly wanted to address climate disruption ( 80 % ) – this new study shows that only 28 % of the Alarmed and only 22 % of the Concerned are under 34 , for a combined total of only about 49.1 % of everyone under 34 .
The difference could be partly related to the two different study age ranges , namely “ under 30 ” vs. “ 18 - 34 , ” but a 30 % difference is still pretty big .
The problem could also be that the poll is skewed toward older people – people 18 - 24 are underrepresented by 4 % , 25 - 74 are overrepresented by 3.5 to 7 % , and people 75 and up are 1 % underrepresented ( source : Census Bureau estimates for 2008 ) .
It ’s not clear from the methodology notes if this skew was corrected or not .
If the study is accurate , however , it points to some opportunities and some problems .
The poll suggests that the majority of people will accept some regulation of CO 2 , but not cap - and - trade .
The poll also suggests that increasing vehicle fuel economy and offering rebates for fuel efficient vehicles and solar power are acceptable to a significant majority of Americans .
If this is accurate , then these could provide a kernel of public support upon which Congress can build real legislation to address climate disruption and energy security .

Officials for the natural gas industry are quick to point out that a process called hydraulic fracturing has been in use for more than 60 years without a single documented case of groundwater contamination by the chemicals used to make gas flow more freely from wells .
But U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette is just as quick to respond that it ’s hard to document contamination when no one outside of the industry knows exactly what kinds of chemicals are being injected along with high - pressure water into wells to force open rock formations thousands of feet below the surface .
On a recent conference call with reporters to discuss a hydraulic fracturing — or “ fracking ” — bill she plans to introduce this week , DeGette , a Democrat from Denver , said most of the evidence of well - water contamination or groundwater spills is anecdotal because state and local officials do n’t know what chemicals are being used .
DeGette cited the case of an emergency room nurse in Grand Junction who suffered organ failure last year after treating a natural gas worker who was coated with fracking fluids .
“ She believes and many other people believe that her injuries came from chemicals that were included in the fracking fluid , but the problem is that since the companies do n’t have to disclose the chemicals that are in that fracking fluid , it ’s difficult to make a correlation , ” DeGette said .
In a statement , DeGette and U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey , a Democrat from New York , a co-sponsor of the pending legislation , point to “ troubling incidents around the country ” in which people living near drilling operations have fallen ill .
The lawmakers say chemicals known to be used in the process include “ diesel fuel , benzene , industrial solvents and other carcinogens and endocrine disrupters . ”
Industry officials argue the process is already regulated by state agencies and that the types of chemicals being used are trade secrets that can give them a production edge over competitors .
They say the exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act granted during the Bush administration in 2005 is needed to protect desperately needed domestic energy - sector jobs .
“ [ Fracking ’s ] got an exemplary safety record and it ’s vital to ensuring an American energy source , ” said Kathleen Sgamma , director of government affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States ( IPAMS ) .
“ Keep in mind that it has been regulated by the states for the last 60 years . ”
Sgamma said fracking uses 99.5 percent water and sand , with the remaining percentage comprised of chemicals such as food additives , food - worthy thickeners , chlorine , bacteriasides and emulsions to thicken the mixture .
But the word of the industry is n’t good enough for Hinchey , whose district in New York ’s Catskill Mountains has been the focus of stepped - up drilling activity in recent years .
He said he ’s heard from property owners around the country who have experienced water problems resulting from natural gas drilling .
“ What we ’re trying to do is restore a safe , solid , secure piece of legislation passed back in 1974 [ the Safe Drinking Water Act ] , which had a positive effect and should be put back in place for the obvious reasons — to protect the security and safety of people across the country , to make sure their wells are n’t contaminated , ” Hinchey said .
Just across the border in northeastern Pennsylvania , Carolyn Wells , who lives part time near the town of Dimock , said natural gas drilling in the mostly rural area is destroying her formerly peaceful escape from her primary residence in New York City .
“ People started leasing their land like crazy during the past two years , without reading the fine print or doing any research on what it means .
All they see is dollar signs that they think they will get , ” Wells said , counting at least 20 neighbors whose drinking water wells are contaminated with fracking fluids .
“ I ca n’t believe people will sacrifice clean air and water for money .
Does n’t do too much good if your environment is toxic or you get cancer . ”
But in Colorado , a spokeswoman for Williams , an energy company with one of the better environmental reputations on the Western Slope , discounts the notion that drinking water is being fouled by fracking fluids anywhere in the country .
“ Hydraulic fracturing is really misunderstood and it ’s really been misrepresented , ” said Susan Alvillar , community affairs representative for Williams .
“ It ’s such a necessary part of our business , but unless you ’ve got processed water in a truck that spills into a drinking water source or a stream , hydraulic fracturing 8,000 feet underneath the ground is not going to commingle those fluids and gas with drinking water . ”
In Colorado , Alvillar said , the state is more than capable of monitoring and regulating the process .
IPAM ’s Sgamma , who admitted there are occasional incidents , agreed : “ Accidents happen , and companies are liable if they make a mistake , and they pay fines or rectify the situation . ”
But DeGette made the case that the quality of water flowing from Colorado ’s Western Slope impacts states like Utah , Wyoming , Arizona and New Mexico , making federal oversight even more important .
And she pointed out that not all states have the tougher new drilling regulations Colorado recently adopted .
“ I must say I ’m very proud of my home state of Colorado for passing these new stringent regulations , but all the states have not passed regulations that are the same , ” DeGette said .
“ And the reason we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in the first place is that we decided that safe drinking water is a national priority and that the standards should apply to everybody . ”
DeGette called the jobs argument a scare campaign because her bill wo n’t add undue industry expense and contains provisions to allow for proprietary confidentiality when it comes to detailing the types and percentages of fracking fluids being used .
“ I ’ve been hearing hyperbole like this is going to put millions of people out of jobs and so on , ” DeGette said .
“ I do n’t know if the oil and gas companies do n’t understand the bill or if they ’re intentionally misrepresenting the bill , so I think there is an educational campaign to be made to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle . ”
Williams ’s Alvillar , though , said Colorado ’s new , environmentally tougher drilling regulations are in part to blame for the recent decline in drilling activity on the Western Slope , and another layer of federal regulation certainly wo n’t help the industry .
“ I do know , from reading other media accounts , that it is impacting our contract workforce , ” Alvillar said of the regulations .
“ We do n’t have as much work for them to do .
People , for instance , like Halliburton , who are running our well service , I know it ’s impacted their workforce . ”
The war of words over water is nothing new for Colorado .
Other industry watchers attribute the downturn in natural gas drilling on the Western Slope on the larger effects of the global economic crisis that caused oil and gas commodity prices to drop substantially .
Considering the current makeup of the court -- and the long - established propensity of Arthur Kennedy to lean right on civil - rights cases -- this probably is n't a surprise , just deeply unfortunate :
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court ruled Monday that white firefighters in New Haven , Conn. , were unfairly denied promotions because of their race , reversing a decision that high court nominee Sonia Sotomayor endorsed as an appeals court judge .
New Haven was wrong to scrap a promotion exam because no African - Americans and only two Hispanic firefighters were likely to be made lieutenants or captains based on the results , the court said Monday in a 5 - 4 decision .
The city said that it had acted to avoid a lawsuit from minorities .
The ruling could alter employment practices nationwide and make it harder to prove discrimination when there is no evidence it was intentional .
" Fear of litigation alone cannot justify an employer 's reliance on race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and qualified for promotions , " Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his opinion for the court .
He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
In dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the white firefighters " understandably attract this court 's sympathy .
But they had no vested right to promotion .
Nor have other persons received promotions in preference to them . "
Justices Stephen Breyer , David Souter and John Paul Stevens signed onto Ginsburg 's dissent , which she read aloud in court Monday .
You can read the ruling here [ PDF ] .
Ginsburg 's dissent is especially worth reading , since she thoroughly eviscerates the skewed logic the conservatives applied here .
The key graf :
By order of this Court , New Haven , a city in which African - Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60 percent of the population , must today be served as it was in the days of undisguised discrimination by a fire department in which members of racial and ethnic minorities are rarely seen in command positions .
...
The Court 's order and opinion , I anticipate , will not have staying power .
There 's also a lot of speculation about how this will affect Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination to the Court , since the ruling overturned here was hers .
However , what 's clear also is that if anyone is being an " activist judge " here , it is the Court 's right - wing faction .
As People for the American Way observed in its statement :
Ellie Andrews has just tied the knot with society aviator King Westley when she is whisked away to her father 's yacht and out of King 's clutches .
Ellie jumps ship and eventually winds up on a bus headed back to her husband .
Reluctantly she must accept the help of out - of - work reporter Peter Warne .
Actually , Warne does n't give her any choice : either she sticks with him until he gets her back to her husband , or he 'll blow the whistle on Ellie to her father .
Either way , Peter gets what ( he thinks ! ) he wants .... a really juicy newspaper story .

On August 17th , near Sayanogorsk in south central Russia , a catastrophic accident took place in the turbine and transformer rooms of the hydroelectric plant of the Sayano - Shushenskaya dam .
The exact cause is still under investigation , but what is known so far is that a tremendous amount of water from the Yenisei River flooded the turbine room , causing at least one transformer explosion and extensive damage to all ten turbines , destroying at least three of them .
74 workers are known to have lost their lives in the accident , while one remains missing .
Additionally , 40 tons of transformer oil were spilled into the river , killing an estimated 400 tons of trout in two fisheries .
Investigators plan to release findings in two months , as Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for a nationwide infrastructure inspection .

After September 11th , Bush 's approval ratings were near or above 90 % .
Practically the entire country was behind him - saluting and ready for duty .
Yes , the Left did try to derail his plans for Iraq - but they failed .
And when millions ( actual millions ) of Americans came out to protest that war - - it was largely ignored by the media .
But when 70,000 lunatics came to DC last week to protest " Government Spending " ( which , let 's be honest , is a euphemism for " Barack Hussein Obama " ) - they got massive amounts of media coverage and hours of pundit commentary .
Every tea -party rally has been aggressively championed , and all - but - sponsored , by cable - news giant FOX .
CODE PINK was almost completely ignored ( which , as a liberal , I 'm kinda glad about -- but I still stand behind my larger point ) .
A couple went to a Bush rally wearing anti-Bush T - Shirts and got arrested .
Guys standing outside Obama rallies openly carry guns and get interviewed by the media .
The heaviest hitters in the Republican party , and in the conservative media have loudly and proudly called for Obama 's failure .
Liberals who even softly criticized Bush were roundly shamed and called terrorist - loving - America - haters .
George W. Bush , despite the controversial beginning of his presidency , was given the chance - - no , in fact , after 9/11 , he was given all the unopposed freedom in the world to succeed or fail based upon his own decisions and his own performance .
Bush EARNED his hatred .
Obama has not had that luxury .
Gaming interfaces have seen a renaissance of late thanks to the Nintendo Wii and touch screen controls .
But Scribblenauts may be the first game to use your vocabulary as the interface .
Jeremiah Slaczka , the Lead Designer at the title ’s developer 5th Cell , describes the game as , “ An action puzzle game where you can literally write anything to solve the puzzle .
You can write ladder and it will appear , or flamethrower and use that . ”
The user handwrites the name of an object and it appears on screen .
But words ca n’t do justice to the concept :
The unusual premise for the title came from studying the market for the Nintendo DS , which has grown to include such a wide variety of concepts that appeal to people that usually do n’t play games .
Slaczka said , “ We looked at Nintendogs , Brain Age , and Wario Ware .
I did n’t want to make another puppy simulator , or brain trainer , but I wanted to make something for everyone . ”
How did they go about creating the objects ?
“ Five or six people went through the dictionary , encyclopedia , wikipedia .
Nothing could be too ridiculous or too niche to not include .
Just no copyrights or obscenity . ”
All of the objects , from people and animals to everyday and not - so - everyday things , went into a database .
And from there ?
“ We took these words , attached the art and the properties to it .
A ladder you can climb .
It is made of wood so it is buoyant . ”
And this is how the developer dictated how tens of thousands of things interact with one another .
The onus is on the player to imagine what can help in a situation , with few limits .
Of course , some people will always want to know boundaries : over the weekend someone posted a list of what was supposedly the 22,802 objects in the game .
“ That was leaked by a hacker who does not know anything .
It ’s more than that , ” Slaczka said .
There is something wonderful about discovering what obscurities can be found in the title .
Slaczka said the last item he squeezed in was Low Rider .
And the inclusions of niche objects such as Rick Astley , Cthulhu , and Molecule fosters that sense of inclusiveness .
President Obama 's top climate diplomat acknowledged today that Capitol Hill delays over global warming legislation will likely push international negotiations to work beyond a December summit in Copenhagen on a new treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol .
" I think that we 'll shape the thing to get as much done as can be done , and there are some pieces that need to get completed , " Todd Stern , the State Department 's climate envoy , told reporters .
" But I think the mission is to get the most ambitious , most far - reaching accord that we can in Copenhagen , and to the extent there 's some things that need to be completed after that , then that will happen . "
Stern did not go into specifics about what items will be left for diplomats beyond December .
But the diplomat said he agreed with U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer , who earlier this summer made a similar assessment that the Copenhagen negotiations wo n't be the end - all on a global warming treaty that applies to more than 190 nations .
According to the U.N.
Web site , additional climate talks are scheduled for May and November 2010 -- though more negotiations are likely to be scheduled should diplomats fail to make enough headway at the end of this year in Copenhagen .
The prospects for sealing a deal in Copenhagen hinge in large part on how much the United States and China -- the world 's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases -- can agree on leading into the Dec. 7 - 18 negotiations .
President Obama will head to Beijing in mid-November amid expectations the two countries may be ready to unveil some type of bilateral agreement on emission reductions and low - carbon energy technologies .
Obama also is planning to speak Tuesday at the United Nations during a special summit on climate change as diplomats look to kick - start talks that U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said this week are stalled .
" We are deeply concerned that the negotiation is not making much headway , " Ban told the Guardian newspaper today .
" It is absolutely and crucially important for the leaders to demonstrate their political will , leadership and to give clear political guidelines to the negotiators .
They should be responsible for the future of this entire humanity . "
Speaking today at a Washington forum hosted by The Atlantic magazine , Stern complained about the political fights in Congress in trying to pass cap - and - trade legislation , saying the status quo would hinder U.S. businesses ' ability to keep up with their competition .
" We 're going to spend the next five years pushing China and all the years after that chasing him if we stay where we are , " Stern said .
" The competitive threat to the United States is not that there is a modest price on carbon imposed in the context of cap - and - trade allowances .
That is not the threat .
That 's modest , and to the extent that there are trade - exposed industries , that can be dealt with .
That 's not the threat . "
" The threat , " Stern added , " is we just stay in this ridiculous ideological box where people are just baldly playing politics with it or taking a know - nothing approach and saying the science that 's clear enough is n't clear . "
Some Obama officials had wanted Congress to send the president a cap - and - trade bill for signature by December , but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) yesterday said the legislation may need to be punted into 2010 because of a packed agenda that includes health care and Wall Street regulatory reform .
A Reid spokesman later walked back from that assessment , saying the goal is still to try to debate the bill this year .
Former Rep. Phil Sharp ( D - Ind. ) , now the head of the nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future , said today that he is not ready to rule out action in Congress on a global warming bill .
" Until things are pronounced dead , I found they never got alive in a major way on Capitol Hill until people panic and say , ' Is that the alternative ? ' "
Stern said his ability to negotiate in Denmark will be limited without a final law that spells out exactly how much Washington can commit to .
But he maintained that it wo n't preclude the Obama administration from being a key player in the negotiations .
" It 's quite central to being the U.S. domestic effort , " Stern said .
" If the bill is n't done , if it 's moving through the tunnel , but it 's just not done yet because it 's big and complicated and health care is taking up a bunch of space , I think we can deal with that as long as it's moving along .
I hope it 's actually done .
I think that 's possible , too .
But there will be negotiation ways that can be dealt with as long as we 're pressing forward . "

MODES * fuf - modes *
* fuf - buffer - mode *
Buffer mode ~
This mode provides an interface to select a buffer from a list of existing
buffers and open it .
Press < C - ]> ( |g:fuf_buffer_keyDelete| ) in this mode and selected buffer will
be deleted .
* fuf - file - mode *
File mode ~
This mode provides an interface to search a file tree for a file and open it .
* fuf -coveragefile - mode *
Coverage - File mode ~
This mode provides an interface to select a file from all files of a preset
coverage and open it .
By default ,
This mode lists all files under the current working directory
recursively . ( |g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns| )
If you want to search other coverage , execute | FufCoverageFileRegister |
command to register new search coverage and | FufCoverageFileChange| command to
choose a search coverage and launch Coverage - File mode .
In addition , there is another way to change a search coverage with
|fuf#setOneTimeVariables ( ) | function .
Example : search only .h and .c files :
>
call fuf#setOneTimeVariables (['g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns ' , ['**/*.h' , '**/*. c ' ] ] )
\ | FufCoverageFile
<
Example : search your home directory in addition to the default coverage :
>
call fuf#setOneTimeVariables (['g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns ' , g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns + ['~/**/.*' , '~/**/*' ] ] )
\ | FufCoverageFile
<
* fuf - dir - mode *
Directory mode ~
This mode provides an interface to search a file tree for a directory and

This mode provides an interface to select one of the bookmarks you have added
beforehand and jump there .
You can add a cursor line to bookmarks by |:FufBookmarkFileAdd| command .
Execute that command and you will be prompted to enter a bookmark name .
FuzzyFinder adjusts a line number for jump .
If a line of bookmarked position
does not match to a pattern when the bookmark was added , FuzzyFinder searches
a matching line around bookmarked position .
So you can jump to a bookmarked
line even if the line is out of bookmarked position .
If you want to jump to
bookmarked line number without the adjustment , set
|g:fuf_bookmarkfile_searchRange| option to 0 .
Press < C - ] > ( |g:fuf_bookmarkfile_keyDelete| ) in this mode and selected
bookmark will be deleted .

==============================================================================
DETAILED TOPICS * fuf - detailed - topics *
* fuf-setting - one - time - option * * fuf#setOneTimeVariables ( ) *
Setting One - Time Options ~
If you want to set one - time options only for the next FuzzyFinder ,
|fuf#setOneTimeVariables ( ) | function will be of help .
This function is used as
follows :
>
call fuf#setOneTimeVariables (['g:fuf_ignoreCase ' , 0 ] , [ '&lines ' , 50 ] )
<
This function takes 0 or more arguments and each of them is a pair of a
variable name and its value .
Specified options will be set practically next
time FuzzyFinder is launched , and restored when FuzzyFinder is closed .
* fuf - search - patterns *
Search Patterns ~
You can enter one primary pattern and zero or more refining patterns as search
patterns .
An entered pattern is separated by " ; " ( |g:fuf_patternSeparator| ) ,
and the first pattern is a primary pattern and the rest of patterns is a
refining pattern .
>
primary refining refining
|----------|
|-------|
|----|
> MruFile>bookmark.vim;autoload/;/home/
<
A refining pattern is used to narrow down the list of matching items by
another pattern .
With a primary pattern , FuzzyFinder does fuzzy matching or partial matching ,
which you specified .
With a refining pattern , FuzzyFinder does partial
matching by default .
( |g:fuf_fuzzyRefining | )
When you enter a number as refining pattern , it also can match the index of
each item .
In a mode which targets a static set of file paths ( such as Buffer or MRU - File
mode , not File or Directory ) and |g:fuf_splitPathMatching| is non-zero ,
matching with a primary pattern is divided into head part and tail part and
done individually .
>
head tail
|------||-----|
foo/bar/baz.vim
fuzzy matching example :
+----------------+---------+---------+---------+
| item \ pattern | foo / bar | foo/ | bar |
+----------------+---------+---------+---------+
| foo / bar | match | match | match |
| foo / abc | unmatch | match | unmatch |
| abc / bar | unmatch | unmatch | match |
| foobar | unmatch | unmatch | match |
| foooo / barrrr | match | match | match |
| foooo / fooooo | unmatch | match | unmatch |
+----------------+---------+---------+---------+
<
refining pattern can match anywhere on each path in the above case .
* fuf - sorting - of - completion - items *
Sorting Of Completion Items ~
FuzzyFinder sorts completion items with some rules .
An item , one part of which is matched with a whole pattern , is placed upper .
E.g. , with the pattern " bc " , the item " abc " is placed upper than " bac " .
In the above case , items , each having matching part at the head of itself , are
placed upper than others .
E.g. , with the pattern " foo " , the item " foobar " is
placed upper than " foobarbaz " .
And the shorter the length of the item after matching position puts it higher .
E.g. , with the pattern " bar " , the item " foobar " is placed upper than
" foobarbaz " .
If a pattern matches an item at only word boundaries of it , the item is placed
upper . E.g. , with a pattern " fb " , items such as " fooBarBaz " and " foo_bar_baz "
is placed upper .
Plus , FuzzyFinder has a learning system .
An item which has been completed in
the past with current pattern is placed upper .
* fuf - reusing - window *
Reusing Of A Window Containing Target Buffer / File ~
If a window containing target buffer is found in current tab page when
FuzzyFinder is going to open the buffer in a split new window , move to it .
If
a window containing target buffer is found in other tab page when FuzzyFinder
is going to open the buffer in a new tab page , move to it .
You can disable that feature via ' reuse_window ' options if always want to open
a buffer in a new window .
* fuf - hiding - menu *
To Hide The Completion Menu Temporarily In FuzzyFinder ~
You can close it by < C - e > and reopen it by < C - x >< C-o > .
* fuf - abbreviation * * fuf - multiple - search *
Abbreviations And Multiple Search ~
You can use abbreviations and multiple search in all modes by setting
|g:fuf_abbrevMap| option .
For example , set as below :
>
let g:fuf_abbrevMap = {
\ " ^doc : " : [
\ " ~/project/**/doc/ " ,
\ " .vim/doc / " ,
\ ] ,
\ }
<
and enter " doc:txt " in File mode , then FuzzyFinder searches by the following
patterns :
" ~/ project/**/doc/*t*x*t* "
" .vim/doc/*t*x*t * "
and show concatenated search results .
* fuf - data - file *
Data File ~
FuzzyFinder writes completion statistics , MRU data , bookmark , etc to files
under |g:fuf_dataDir| .
|: FufEditDataFile| command is helpful in editing your data files .
This command
reads the data file in new unnamed buffer .
Write the buffer and the data file
will be updated .
* fuf - cache *
Cache ~
Once a cache was created ,
It is not automatically updated to speed up the
response time by default .
To update it , use |: FufRenewCache| command .
* fuf - dot - sequence *
Going Up Parent Directories With Dot Sequence ~
You can go up parent directories with entering dot sequence .
Dot sequence
after a path separator is expanded to " ../ " sequence .

Osoyoos , B.C. –It 's a sign of the times .
Driving deep into the Okanagan Valley in central British Columbia , there 's a puzzling message at the side of the road : " No National Park . "
Communities often rally together to protest garbage dumps , uranium mines and such .
But a national park ?
" Some people do n't appreciate the terrain we 're trying to protect , " says Debbie Clark , community liaison with Parks Canada , which wants to preserve a part of a unique and dry landscape .
The grasslands and bald hills outside the town of Osoyoos are an extension of the Sonoran Desert that runs as far south as Mexico and creeps north to form Canada 's only arid desert .
At first glance , you might think this area is not much different from the rest of the Okanagan Valley with its vineyards and orchards and lakes .
But closer inspection reveals the desert is in the details .
The Osoyoos Desert Centre , nine kilometres out of town , offers insight into this sensitive ecosystem , which is home to 100 rare plants and 300 critters found nowhere else in Canada .
Signs posted along the 1.6 - kilometre self - guided boardwalk tell of painted turtles , scorpions , lizards and pygmy horned toads .
I make a note to return in August during the full moon for Romancing the Desert .
This fundraiser lets visitors explore at night when desert dwellers come alive with activity and local wines and cuisine fuel the fun exploration .
Nearby is Spotted Lake , an unusual formation of salts , calcium and other minerals found in hundreds of pools that pockmark the terrain .
For Okanagan First Nations , this is sacred ground and the waters are known to have healing properties .
But it 's not on their reserve and the contested land , whose owner wanted to build a spa on the site , is off - limits to the public , though it can be viewed from a roadside lookout on Highway 3 .
Come summer , the water dries up , leaving salt - stained circles on the sun - baked earth .
It gets hot here in summer .
The temperature climbs above 38C and Osoyoos is often the country 's hottest spot .
And at an average 24C in July and August , Osoyoos Lake is said to have the warmest freshwater in Canada , making its sandy beaches an ideal destination to cool off .
All those orchards and vineyards that turn the desert green are fed by irrigation , which gives rise to such anomalies as a desert cherry festival .
The annual Cherry Fiesta on the July 1 Canada Day holiday includes cherry - spitting and pie-eating contests .
Crossing the isthmus that divides the town ( the name Osoyoos is derived from native dialect meaning where the water narrows ) , I head for Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort and Spa and Nk'Mip ( pronounced in - ka - meep ) Cellars .
This 80 - hectare is home to the first winery owned by aboriginal people in North America .
The Osoyoos Band has been growing grapes here since 1968 and in co-operation with Inniskillin Wineries now makes award - winning wines that reflect the terroir .
" You need 165 frost - free days in a vineyard and we have well over 200 , one of the longest growing seasons in Canada , " says Jennifer Busmann , who leads tours of the winery and its cellars .
" The summer heat intensifies the big flavours of Merlot and Syrrah . "
The Spirit Ridge hotel is amid the vineyards with terrific views of the lake and mountains across the valley .
The earth colours of the pueblo - style architecture lends a Southwestern feel to the place that is echoed in the adjoining Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre .
This attraction , built with rammed earth walls , presents the history of Okanagan First Nations through hands - on displays and films shown in a reconstructed winter hut and the Chaptik Legend Theatre .
The Osoyoos Band is known as one of the country 's most business - savvy aboriginal communities and this centre is a testament to its success .
The story continues out of doors where nature trails wind through the desert , past sculptures depicting traditional means of providing food and shelter in this harsh , hot climate .
A popular seasonal attraction at the cultural centre is the rattlesnake research program .
The desert is home to endangered Western rattlesnakes , which are captured , tagged , put up for awhile in the " rattlesnake hotel " so visitors can watch them before being released back into the wild .
Snakes hibernate , so the best time to see them slithering around is from April to October .
" They love to eat grapes and are frequently found in the vineyards , " says Charlotte Sanders , manager of the centre .
There are rattlesnake crossing signs on the grounds because " snakes are creatures of habit and stick to the same route to get where they 're going , " says Sanders .
So , watch your step , especially after swilling a few samples of chardonnay .
The popular southern Okanagan wine route takes in Dirty Laundry , Therapy , Laughing Stock and Blasted Church , to name just a few of the local producers .
Most welcome visitors and some , like Nk'Mip and Burrowing Owl have restaurants that offer a taste of the valley and feature regional seasonal fare .

This area is fast becoming a four - season destination .
There 's skiing from December to the end of March at Mount Baldy Ski Resort above the valley , viticulture is sprouting in every inch of arable land and real estate development is booming for snowbirds , the summer holiday crowd and for those who like to live in Canada 's hot zone .
This place looks like it needs a national park , not only to save the desert , but also to protect it from its own success .

STAGE OF GLOBAL CONQUEST : Selling recorded music may be an awful business , but it ’s one that Morris , 70 , still dominates .
Driven by hit acts such as Taylor Swift , Lady Gaga , U2 , Black Eyed Peas , and Kanye West , Universal stands alone atop the music charts , accounting for one - third of all albums sold .

STAGE OF GLOBAL CONQUEST :
The indie - film impresarios laid off two dozen employees , or 11 percent of their staff , in November .
The upbeat buzz around their film of the Broadway musical Nine , by director Rob Marshall , whose Chicago won six Oscars , has been overshadowed by the news , leaked in June , that the Weinsteins had brought in a financial consultant that specializes in helping companies get out from under too much debt .
( The company has around $ 500 million worth that matures in 2014 . )
A subsequent article in The New York Times , which laid out how the brothers accumulated the debt and lost sight of what they do best — turning Indie films onto mainstream audiences — bringing them to a do - or - die point in their long storied careers in the movie business , did n’t help matters .
But the brothers got some much - needed good news a week later when Quentin Tarantino ’s Inglourious Basterdsnabbed the top spot at the box office its first weekend in theaters , grossing more than $ 65 million worldwide .

" Stealing " Stealing Wi-Fi internet access may feel like a victimless crime , but it deprives ISPs of revenue .
Furthermore , if you 've hopped onto your next door neighbors ' wireless broadband connection to illegally download movies and music from the net , chances are that you are also slowing down their Internet access and impacting on their download limit . "
UK ISP Karoo currently requires its customers to agree that :
" [ Karoo ] shall be entitled to terminate the Service immediately if We discover that . . . you have permitted ( whether knowingly or not ) a third party ( or third parties ) to access the Service using a wireless connection over Your Communications Line . " " [ Karoo ] shall be entitled to terminate the Service immediately if We discover that . . . you have permitted ( whether knowingly or not ) a third party ( or third parties ) to access the Service using a wireless connection over Your Communications Line . "

Sithigh concludes :
" It is suggested that the thread connecting domestic WAPs [ Wireless Access Point ] , municipal wifi and spectrum reform is a desire to enable the use of the Internet by individuals , rather than the management of a network in the interests of [ ISPs ] .
Some of the legal provisions criticised ... are more appropriate to large , discrete networks rather than the flexible , atomised wireless commons .
Consider instead , however , a situation where the law protected the ability of the WAP admin to share and the external user to connect ... that providing access to the Internet with the maximum possible freedom of action and of use reserved to the user was itself important .
In the context of rules on state aid which might hamper municipal wifi , this is clearly important .
Inappropriate legal constraints on or actions against WAP admins , wifi users or public authorities acting in the best traditions of the local library or park ( if one may be permitted to use a metaphor ! ) are a clear and present threat to this model . "
More People , Less Driving : The Imperative of Curbing Sprawl
Experience with case studies has made it clear to many urban planners and environmentalists that to maximize the benefits of transit investments , and to slow growth in traffic congestion , vehicle miles traveled ( VMT ) , and carbon emissions , you have to focus on land use .
This knowledge has begun working its way into the policymaking world , to the extent that local and state legislatures are beginning to craft rules that explicitly factor the carbon impact of land use effects into decisions about new development and infrastructure construction .
In a few years time , the federal government may follow .
But there ’s not as much in the way of hard studies of the effects of land use as we might like — mainly because it ’s been a non-issue , so far as most of the country is concerned , for much of recent history .
Aiming to address this ( and acting under a congressional mandate ) , the Transportation Research Board recently completed a study that has now resulted in a very large report : " Driving and the Built Environment : The Effects of Compact Development on Motorized Travel , Energy Use , and CO Emissions . "
The report is actually five mini-papers , and at nearly 200 pages long it makes for a lot of reading .
But the findings reported in the introduction give an idea of what it ’s all about .
The authors conclude that compact development is likely to reduce VMT : " The effects of compact , mixed - use development on VMT are likely to be enhanced when this strategy is combined with other policy measures that make alternatives to driving relatively more convenient and affordable . "
No surprises there .
Finding No. 2 is : " The literature suggests that doubling residential density across a metropolitan area might lower household VMT by about 5 to 12 percent , and perhaps by as much as 25 percent , if coupled with higher employment concentrations , significant public transit improvements , mixed uses , and other supportive demand management measures . "
They note that were you to move the residents of Atlanta to an area built like Boston , you ’d lower the Atlantans ’ VMT per household by perhaps 25 percent .
Better land use results in reductions in energy use and carbon emissions , the authors report , from both direct and indirect causes .
( Direct causes would be a reduction in VMT ; indirect include things like longer vehicle lifetimes from reduced use and the greater efficiency of smaller or multi-family housing units . )
But one of the crucial pieces of data included in the report is this :
As many as 57 million new housing units are projected to accommodate population growth and replacement housing needs by 2030 , growing to between 62 and 105 million units by 2050 – a substantial net addition to the housing stock of 105.2 million in 2000 .
Critics of smart growth efforts or rail and transit investments often wave off the potential gains from building differently by noting that so much of the current housing stock is of the sprawling , single - family home , auto - oriented sort .
Convincing the people who currently live in such places to give that up for something different , they say , is sure to be an extremely difficult sell .
But that ’s not the issue .
No one is suggesting we rip down all of suburbia .
Rather we , or at least I , am pointing out that between now and mid-century , the country will very nearly have to build itself all over again to accommodate population growth .
In addition to the 100 million homes now in America , somewhere between 62 and 105 million more will be built .
The critical question is what the balance of that new construction will look like .
The TRB report suggests that if 75 percent of this new construction is of a more compact variety , that emissions could be reduced 10 percent or more from the baseline scenario ( and that is not taking into consideration the deployment of cleaner electricity generation and other potential sources of savings ) .
Ed Glaeser argued — and this is kind of hard to believe — that land use shifts from building high - speed rail between Dallas and Houston would not provide much in the way of benefits , since , he guessed , only 100,000 or so people in each city would move from the suburbs to the central city .
But this entirely misses the point .
Houston and Dallas may each double their current housing stock between now and 2050 .
Where are those homes going to go , with what climate impacts ?
That ’s the critical question .
Demographic shifts and changes in energy prices are sure to encourage some households that are currently living at low densities to move to more compact developments , and that ’s a good thing .
But that ’s not the main reason to begin focusing on the significant available savings from smarter land use decisions .
The main reason is the growth that America will continue to face .
It ’s difficult to imagine that the nation can double its housing stock while building in a sprawling fashion without facing major environmental costs and economic difficulties .
Land use patterns will need to change .
And as this report documents , there will be considerable advantages to facilitating that change .
In the 2,000 or so years since the Roman Empire employed a naturally occurring form of cement to build a vast system of concrete aqueducts and other large edifices , researchers have analyzed the molecular structure of natural materials and created entirely new building materials such as steel , which has a well - documented crystalline structure at the atomic scale .
Oddly enough , the three - dimensional crystalline structure of cement hydrate — the paste that forms and quickly hardens when cement powder is mixed with water — has eluded scientific attempts at decoding , despite the fact that concrete is the most prevalent man-made material on earth and the focus of a multibillion - dollar industry that is under pressure to clean up its act .
The manufacture of cement is responsible for about 5 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions worldwide , and new emission standards proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could push the cement industry to the developing world .
“ Cement is so widely used as a building material that nobody is going to replace it anytime soon .
But it has a carbon dioxide problem , so a basic understanding of this material could be very timely , ” said MIT Professor Sidney Yip , co-author of a paper published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) during the week of Sept.
7 that announces the decoding of the three - dimensional structure of the basic unit of cement hydrate by a group of MIT researchers who have adopted the team name of Liquid Stone .
“ We believe this work is a first step toward a consistent model of the molecular structure of cement hydrate , and we hope the scientific community will work with it , ” said Yip , who is in MIT ’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering ( NSE ) .
“ In every field there are breakthroughs that help the research frontier moving forward .
One example is Watson and Crick ’s discovery of the basic structure of DNA .
That structural model put biology on very sound footing . ”
Scientists have long believed that at the atomic level , cement hydrate ( or calcium - silica - hydrate ) closely resembles the rare mineral tobermorite , which has an ordered geometry consisting of layers of infinitely long chains of three - armed silica molecules ( called silica tetrahedra ) interspersed with neat layers of calcium oxide .
But the MIT team found that the calcium - silica - hydrate in cement is n’t really a crystal .
It ’s a hybrid that shares some characteristics with crystalline structures and some with the amorphous structure of frozen liquids , such as glass or ice .
At the atomic scale , tobermorite and other minerals resemble the regular , layered geometric patterns of kilim rugs , with horizontal layers of triangles interspersed with layers of colored stripes .
But a two - dimensional look at a unit of cement hydrate would show layers of triangles ( the silica tetrahedra ) with every second , fifth or eighth triangle turned up or down along the horizontal axis , reaching into the layer of calcium oxide above or below .
And it is in these messy areas — where breaks in the silica tetrahedra create small voids in the corresponding layers of calcium oxide — that water molecules attach , giving cement its robust quality .
Those erstwhile “ flaws ” in the otherwise regular geometric structure provide some give to the building material at the atomic scale that transfers up to the macro scale .
When under stress , the cement hydrate has the flexibility to stretch or compress just a little , rather than snapping .
“ We ’ve known for several years that at the nano scale , cement hydrates pack together tightly like oranges in a grocer ’s pyramid .
Now , we ’ve finally been able to look inside the orange to find its fundamental signature .
I call it the DNA of concrete , ” said Franz - Josef Ulm , the Macomber Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering ( CEE ) , a co-author of the paper .
“ Whereas water weakens a material like tobermorite or jennite , it strengthens the cement hydrate .
The ‘ disorder ’ or complexity of its chemistry creates a heterogenic , robust structure .
“ Now that we have a validated molecular model , we can manipulate the chemical structure to design concrete for strength and environmental qualities , such as the ability to withstand higher pressure or temperature , ” said Ulm .
CEE Visiting Professor Roland Pellenq , director of research at the Interdisciplinary Center of Nanosciences at Marseille , which is part of the French National Center of Scientific Research and Marseille University , pinned down the exact chemical shape and structure of C - S - H using atomistic modeling on 260 co-processors and a statistical method called the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation .
Like its name , the simulation requires a bit of gambling to find the answer .
Pellenq first removed all water molecules from the basic unit of tobermorite , watched the geometry collapse , then returned the water molecules singly , then doubly and so on , removing them each time to allow the geometry to reshape as it would naturally .
After he added the 104th water molecule , the correct atomic weight of C - S - H was reached , and Pellenq knew he had an accurate model for the geometric structure of the basic unit of cement hydrate .
The team then used that atomistic model to perform six tests that validated its accuracy .
“ This gives us a starting point for experiments to improve the mechanical properties and durability of concrete .
For instance , we can now start replacing silica in our model with other materials , ” said Pellenq .
Other team members are graduate student Rouzbeh Shahsavari of CEE and Markus Buehler , MIT ’s Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering ; Krystyn Van Vliet , MIT ’s Thomas Lord Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering ; and NSE postdoctoral associate Akihiro Kushima .
This research was funded by the Portuguese cement manufacturer , Cimpor Corp. , enabled through the MIT - Portugal Program .
You remember Cindy Sheehan , I ’m sure .
She was a vocal anti-war protestor whose son was killed in Iraq .
She protested for an extended time outside Bush ’s ranch .
Know what she ’s been doing since Obama got elected ?
Exactly all of the same things .
She ’d like to know what ’s become of the anti-war movement since January 20 , 2009 , though .
You know , I ’m confident there are huge swaths of disagreement between us .
There are large parts of my ideal world that would n’t resemble hers much at all .
But I respect her .
She has principles that are n’t determined by whether the president has a D or an R after his name .
However wrong I think her ideology is , there is evidence that it is pure .
( On that note , let me say , prophylactically , that you ’d have little trouble finding me raising hell about liberty and fiscal discipline concurrent with the Bush administration . )
You people could learn something from Sheehan , and by “ you people ” I mean all of you wussy , spineless , hypocritical liberals who ( apparently , only now ) have n’t the first problem with things like the PATRIOT Act , the wiretapping , the eavesdropping , the military tribunals , and any number of other things that have n’t changed at all ( or have actually worsened ! ) , all because your precious little god-king sits in the Oval Office .
( Cindy Sheehan plans to protest on Martha ’s Vineyard when The One is vacationing there , incidentally .
Let ’s watch for what I ’m sure will be copious and unending coverage of it , okay ? )

A Financial World Gone Mad
The Dow slipped a bit yesterday – only 39 points .
Everyone is watching .
They want to see how far this rally carries on .
Many think it is more than a bear market bounce ; they think it is for real .
The prevailing opinion is that quick action by the feds avoided a more serious meltdown .
Ben Bernanke says he was working to prevent a “ second Great Depression . ”
And now that the crisis is past , the economy is slowly climbing out of its hole .
The second quarter showed GDP falling at 1 % per year in the United States … rather than the 6.4 % rate recorded earlier in the year .
Housing sales have perked up .
Oil is trading above $ 71 – a sign of renewed economic activity .
And gold seems to be getting ready for another assault on the $ 1,000 mark – a sign of growing inflation pressures .
At least … that ’s the way the world sees it .
Here at The Daily Reckoning , we look …we squint …we wipe the fog off our glasses and try to tear the scales off our eyes .
What do we see ?
We see a financial world gone mad .
Or , perhaps we should say …a financial world that has still not recovered from the Bubble Madness of 2002 - 2007 .
One bubble begat another .
We have previously reported that the Bubble Era was over .
Because the machinery that made it possible – the bubblelized financial industry – was broken .
Well , we were only half right .
The finance sector has exploded .
Bear Stearns was sold for peanuts .
Lehman Bros. went broke .
Merrill was forced into a shotgun wedding with the Bank of America ; with Hank Paulson holding the firearm .
JPMorgan is still in business .
So is Goldman .
But now we know that even Goldman might have gone under if Paulson – ex-Goldman man – had not engineered a stealth bailout .
He brought the feds in to save AIG , and in the process he saved his old alma mater too … AIG ’s biggest trading partner , Goldman Sachs .
And now Goldman is in the news almost every day .
It reported spectacular trading results for the quarter , lifting the entire world stock market .
What ’s good for Goldman must be good for the whole world economy , investors reasoned .
Then it was reported that Goldman made its money in a variety of ways – none of which had anything to do with providing genuine service to the economy .
Goldman made a fortune on the feds ’ own money raising , it came out .
And then it came out … Goldman was making billions by trading at lightning speed – clipping investors for fractions of pennies each time a transaction passed through the markets .
Goldman … Goldman … Goldman …
The Italians think Goldman runs their country .
They ’ve got the top three posts in Rome … Premier Romano Prodi is an ex-Goldman guy .
So is the headman at the Treasury .
And the chief of the central bank , too .
They think Goldman is like a cult … a semi-secret society of insiders with the power to rule the country – surreptitiously .
Like the free masons … the Jesuits … or the Illuminati .
Goldman has its boys in important posts in the United States too – but not at the same level as in Italy .
Tim Geithner is not a Goldman graduate .
Neither is Ben Bernanke .
But both have plenty of input from ex-Goldman associates , colleagues and handlers .
We confess an interest – we have relatives working at Goldman .
But we doubt that Goldman rules the world .
Just look what they said and did over the last couple of years ; they had no more idea of what was going on than anyone else .
No , they do n’t rule the world … but they do manage to persuade it in their direction from time to time …
During the bubble years , they urged consumers , bankers , and investors to borrow …to speculate …and to ruin themselves .
Naturally , Goldman made out like … well … like a bandit .
And now Goldman guys urge the government to ruin itself too .
Yes , dear reader , the Bubble Era is not quite over .
Now , there ’s a bubble in government debt .
Here as well , Goldman makes money … like a bandit .
The more the feds borrow … the more debt there is to buy and sell .
And the more the feds stimulate … the more acts of reckless speculation there are to finance .
And the more money Goldman makes … the more politicians the firm is able to buy .
Of course , they welcome campaign contributions .
And of course , Wall Street is spending record amounts in lobbying .
But the real appeal is the lure of being able to join Goldman itself …of being able to spend some time in Washington … pushing business Goldman ’s way …and then cash in big by joining the firm and getting a piece of the action …
There are two big bubbles now .
There is the familiar one in federal government debt .
The other is the Peoples ’ Republic of China .
Andy Xie says China is a ‘ giant Ponzi scheme ’ fed by new investors hoping to get rich .
Of course , the China story is an attractive one .
China ’s growth rate is spectacular .
Even in a worldwide financial meltdown … and the biggest depression since the ’30 s … China is still growing at greater than 8 % per year – or so the figures tell us .
New cities are still being built …at a breathtaking pace .
Stocks on the Shanghai exchange are up 80 % so far this year .
China has the biggest pile of cash on the planet – $ 2 trillion worth .
And it has more bright , well - educated engineers , accountants and economists than anywhere else …
In fact , it has so many economists trained at Western universities , it is almost sure to blow itself up …
Maybe this is the Chinese Century .
Maybe it is not .
Either way , it seems inevitable to us that the Chinese bubble economy is going to pop .
Banks are lending three times as much as they lent last year .
You ca n’t increase lending at that rate and still maintain credit quality – if there was any in the first place .
A lot of buildings are going up that wo n’t find tenants .
A lot of factories are expanding that wo n’t find customers .
A lot of speculations are going on that investors will later regret .
That ’s just how a bubble works !
Mr. Xie says , for example , that the cost of property in China is about the same as in the United States .
But wait , the average income in China is only 1/7th what it is in the USA .
How can the Chinese afford American prices ?
Well , they can’t .
They ’re all betting on the ‘ greater fool theory ’ – that they can pay any price , because some greater fool will come along and pay more .
Trouble with that is that the Greatest Fool of All finally shows up …and then the whole structure collapses .
Barron ’s says that “ The Greenback is Broken . ”
True , the dollar has been losing ground as the stock market gains it .
Yesterday , it took $ 1.44 to buy a euro .
“ I was amazed at how expensive everything is in Paris , ” said son Will .
“ You go into a shop to buy a few groceries …
You expect to pay about $ 12 .
Instead , the bill comes to $ 40 .
Or , you stop to have a cup of coffee and a croissant .
It costs you $ 10 .
I do n’t know how you can afford to live in Paris . ”
Will lives in Buenos Aires … with frequent visits to in - laws in Florida …
“ You know , it used to be so much cheaper to live in Buenos Aires than just about anywhere .
But now , I think the prices are about the same as in Florida .
Everything seems so cheap in Florida .
And you can make some very good deals on property …
“ Remember that house that I bought in 2006 ?
You warned me not to do it .
But right after I bought it people were coming to my door asking if they could buy it .
One guy offered to write a check for $ 600,000 .
Then another guy offered $ 675,000 .
I began to think I really had something hot .
“ Of course , then the market crashed .
Now , I ’m thinking of selling it for $ 300,000 – if I could find a buyer .
“ But that ’s in South Florida …only about an hour up the coast from Miami .
There are places in the US where things are really , really cheap .
In Iowa , maybe , or Arkansas…or Michigan .
You can get a nice house for less than you ’d pay for a garage in Paris .
From that standpoint … the US seems like the place to be .
You can live so cheaply .
And fairly well , but quality of life is another thing … ”
The dollar is low … America is cheap .
Barron ’s is probably wrong about the buck .
It ’s not broken – not yet .
Our guess is that it will rise when stocks crash this fall .
We ’ve thought a lot about quality of life .
It is not a constant , fixed thing we conclude … .
There are only three main decisions you make in life – what you do ; who you do it with ; and where you do it .
Typically , these decisions are made without much real thinking – which is probably the best way .
They are not things that lend themselves to thought … but to feeling .
Pity the more man who marries a woman after a prolonged and logical thought process .
The poor sap is doomed .
His head may be in the game , but his heart will drop the ball .
The next thing you know , he will be in divorce court or therapy .
Likewise , the decision about where you live is not one that is readily subject to logical analysis .
You like a place because you like it …
And you may like it for a variety of reasons that defy analysis .
There ’s no accounting for taste , as they say .
Living in rural Iowa probably would n’t suit us .
We do n’t have the stomach for it .
We could n’t draw enough nourishment out of such lean meat .
We need more stimulation .
We like Paris for the street scenes .
Everywhere we look , we see something we like to look at – people , buildings , shop windows , streets , bridges , and river boats .
Same thing out here at our summer place .
We work in an octagonal office that sits in the park .
No matter what window we look out of , we see something that pleases us .
A stone barn with a red barrel tile roof .
Those big limousine cattle grazing in the field .
And there ’s the house itself … a conglomeration of a fortified farm house from the middle ages with a Renaissance - style faux - chateau cobbled onto it in the 19th century .
And there is our grandson … 16 months old … playing in the gravel …
Wait – what ’s he doing ?
Uh - oh …he ’s eating the gravel .
Gotta run …
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
This is so out - of - control , I just do n't know where to begin .
If you watch one video this year of a seriously ill medical marijuana patient getting tortured by idiots , make it this one : Someone should remind these people they live in Canada .
The guy gets his marijuana sent to him by the government .
He 's not some punk kid partying behind the dumpster .
As far as we 've come in the fight for medical marijuana , there remain countless individual battles that must be overcome before patients who need this medicine can count on being treated with fairness , compassion , and equality .
Anyone who would deny medicine to the sick is a monster , to be sure .
But the responsibility for this does n't end there .
We 've endured decades of deliberate lies and propaganda about marijuana spread by our own public servants and it's no surprise that many among us have had their humanity and common sense compromised .
It will take just as long to correct it all and events like this , disturbing as they may be , are an important part of the process .
In the meantime , here 's a Google page for the Brook Haven Care Centre in Kelowna , BC , where this incident took place .
You can write them a review , send a letter , or even give them a call .
The patient 's name is Nyle Nagy and the manager who punished him is named Adrien Vaughan .
Feel free to share your concerns .
I 'm sure Nyle would also appreciate receiving personal letters of support .
This link offers a different perspective on the situation from someone claiming to a member of Nyle Nagy 's family .
If this additional information is true , and it sounds authentic to me , then the Brookhaven Care Home does n't deserve as much criticism as they 've received .
If I had seen this prior to writing the post , I would have approached it differently .

After last month ’s news about a “ Bazooka Joe ” film adaptation , I did n’t think any film development news could faze me .
I was wrong .
According to The Hollywood Reporter , Universal is set to adapt the 1970′s arcade video game “ Asteroids ” for the silver screen .
The game has no plot , no characters , no anything .
It ’s basically a space ship shooting down … you guessed it …asteroids .
But that ’s not the part that has me worried .
What really tweaks my melon … what has me concerned for the future of human society …is the fact that Universal was NOT the only studio interested in this project .
In fact , so many people thought this adaptation was a “ good ” idea , the property has been the subject of a four - studio bidding war .
Whenever the “ Bazooka Joe ” movie gets adapted or when we hear of a “ Stretch Armstrong ” film , I can chalk it up to a fluke .
It ’s one stupid studio executive getting talked into a property based on brand recognition or the talent involved .
This , though , can not be a fluke .
Four separate Hollywood studios have literally been trying to throw money at a thirty year old video game property whose title is more likely to remind audiences of a bad sci - fi original picture than anything else .
There is very little value in the generic brand of “ asteroids , ” there is no story , and there is n’t even an original idea ( assuming you ’ve seen Armageddon , that is ) .
Everyone always says “ Hollywood is out of ideas . ”
I think that is pretty clear at this point .
What stuns me , though , is how much they have lowered the bar when it comes to rehashing old ideas .
I thought the concept of adapting The Pirates of the Caribbean was terrible , but I was proved wrong .
At least that movie had a tone , a theme song , and an idea buried in the word “ pirates . ”
Asteroids ?
There ’s just not really too much there .
And it ’s not that I ’m saying that this will be a bad movie , either .
If a great screenwriter writes a great space - oriented script involving asteroids , this could be good .
But why not just develop this as an original property ?
Does having it based on a 1970′s video game really add ANYTHING to the equation ?
I guess it gets you press …like this article .
Sigh .
Lorenzo di Bonaventura is producing , and Matthew Lopez will write the “ adaptation . ”
Good luck , Matthew … you ’ve got your work cut out for you .
A Level 3 sex offender who served 27 years in prison was arraigned yesterday on assault charges , accused of trying to rape a woman who was jogging along Plum Island Beach in Ipswich .
The arrest was made several days after the man was charged with soliciting a prostitute in Haverhill , according to the Essex district attorney ’s office .
Scott A. Gagnon , 51 , of Tewksbury was convicted in April 1980 in several assaults , including rape of a child with force , and one count of assault with intent to commit rape , according to the state sex offender registry .
He was released from prison in 2007 .
On Thursday , he was caught up during a prostitution sting in Haverhill , but was not held in custody .
Haverhill police Sergeant John Arahovites said that Gagnon was arrested at 1:30 p.m. at Portland and White streets after trying to solicit an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute .
He was among at least 10 people arrested .
According to the district attorney ’s office , Gagnon pleaded guilty to soliciting sex for a fee and paid a $ 500 fine .
Police said Gagnon attacked the jogger Monday about 6 p.m. on Plum Island Beach , an expanse of sand that extends for several miles , including a section in a national wildlife refuge .
The woman got away and called police , and , after an investigation , Gagnon was arrested and charged with assault with intent to rape .
Town officials wanted to assure people yesterday that Ipswich remains a safe community .
“ We have a little juvenile vandalism in the summertime , but we do n’t have street crime , ’’ said Bob T. Markel , Ipswich town manager .
“ This is very disheartening .
What has to be done to protect society against people like this ?
Maybe the sentence was n’t long enough . ’’
An investigation by Ipswich police and US Fish and Wildlife Service officers led authorities to Gagnon .
Vehicles have to pass a guard station to enter and exit the wildlife refuge .
Markel said the jogger recognized her attacker in a pickup trick and identified him to police .
Gagnon was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing tomorrow .
Gagnon made headlines last year when he was fired from a Tewksbury McDonald ’s after a town resident told management Gagnon was a Level 3 sex offender .
He tried to sue the resident and the restaurant , but dropped the lawsuit a week later , according to reports at the time .
According to state law , individuals designated Level 3 sex offenders are determined to “ have a high risk to reoffend . ’’

It seems to me that if we look closely at the situation , world oil production has likely peaked , even though prices are not behaving as most had expected .
Furthermore , the peaking of world oil production seems to be a major cause of the current financial crisis .
The tie of peak oil to recent demand destruction points to a possible continuing destruction in demand in the years ahead , with oil prices fluctuating , but not necessarily rising to great heights .
The question now is with respect to world production .
The price of oil is n't very high -- is there any possibility of a near - term peak in world oil production ?
Lower prices would seem to suggest there is no problem .
Most people who have read a little about peak oil have heard that US oil production peaked in 1970 .
This happened , even though oil companies have been working as hard as they can to keep production up .
Oil companies have even applied enhanced oil recovery techniques to wells where it looked like doing so would be profitable .
After the US mainland ( 48 states ) peaked in 1970 , extra effort was expended to ramp up Alaskan production .
It soon peaked as well , in 1988 .
1 . Where are we now with respect to world peak oil ?
There is considerable evidence that we may already be somewhat past the peak in world oil production .
Figure 2 - World Oil Production , separated between Organization of Oil Producing Countries ( OPEC ) , Former Soviet Union ( FSU ) , and others based British Petroleum Statistical Data ( BP )
Figure 2 indicates that world oil production was rising up until 2005 , but then leveled out in the 2005 to 2008 period , at a little over 80 million barrels a day of oil production .
If we divide up world production into three components -- Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countires ( OPEC ) , Former Soviet Union ( FSU ) and All Other , the three groups act quite differently .
OPEC production bounces around , as production is raised and lowered because of planned production changes , wars , over - production and need to rest fields , depletion , and response to market conditions .
FSU production reached a peak prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 .
It is currently at a new lower maximum ( still rising , but not quickly ) , with the application of new technology and additional investment .
Oil production for the big group of All Other countries ( shown in blue on Figure 2 ) is characterized by more steady investment .
When one considers the steady investment , production for this group has almost certainly peaked .
This group would include US , Canada , the North Sea , Mexico , China , and many smaller oil producers not in OPEC or the FSU .
The peak for this group occurred in 2002 , with a plateau occurring more or less in the 2000 to 2004 period .
Once this group started declining , there was n't enough of a production increase elsewhere ( FSU and OPEC ) to bring total production up .
One could argue that this was just because FSU and OPEC chose not to increase production more , but there seems to be more to the situation than this .
2 . What makes you think that world oil production has peaked ?
Figure 2 just shows that it has been flat recently .
There are several things :
a. Recent drop in world oil production .
In 2009 , there has been a drop in oil production , that does n't show up in the annual data in Figure 2 .
Figure 3 - World Oil Production , based on data of the US Energy Information Administration and British Petroleum ( BP ) .
* 2009 is January - April
There are a number of sources of oil production data .
Figure 3 compares three measures of oil production , two of them from the US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , the official US source of data .
The EIA now reports a broad measure of oil production called " all liquids " .
It includes everything from crude oil , to natural gas liquids , to refinery gain , to ethanol .
The problem with this measure is most of the " other liquids " are lower in energy content than crude oil .
They have been growing by volume in recent years .
I have attempted to correct for the lower energy content by showing a line called crude + 65 % x " other liquids " .
One can see that with each of these measures , oil production is clearly down in 2009 .
In fact , since oil production was close to flat between 2005 and 2008 , with the drop , production for 2009 year - to - date is at or below the level of 2004 production .
Since population is rising , and the number of vehicles in use is rising , this is truly alarming .
b. Strange behavior in oil prices in the 2003 to 2009 period .
One would expect oil prices to rise with the general inflation rate , but instead prices rose much faster than inflation in the 2003 to 2008 period .
Then , a sudden break came , and oil prices dropped from $ 147 barrel to $ 30 barrel in the second half of 2008 .
Oil prices have since risen to above $ 60 barrel .
( The graph shows only annual data , so you can not see this detail . )
Figure 4 - World crude and condensate oil production , based on **EIA crude and condensate oil production data and *** EIA West Texas Intermediate spot prices .
* 2009 oil production is average January - April ; prices are average January - June
The long rise in the price of oil between 2003 and 2008 seems to indicate production of oil was not rising as much as was needed by the economy and the growing number of vehicles .
Oil prices were rising to encourage increased production .
According to economic theory , higher oil prices should have lead to higher oil production ( or substitutes - but the impact of biofuels is small , and included in " All liquids " in Figure 3 ) , but this did not happen , suggesting that it really was not possible to ramp up production as much as the economy needed .
Even if some of the price rise at the end may have been speculation , the price rise still did not result in much of an increase in production .
It should be noted that the rise in energy prices started right after the production of the " All Other " group in Figure 2 began to decline .
It was at this point that a real increase in production was needed from OPEC or FSU to offset the drop in oil production from Mexico and the North Sea .
While there was some increase in production , it was not enough of an increase to keep oil prices steady .
Instead oil prices keep rising .
In response , per capita vehicle miles traveled declined starting in 2005 , according to a study by the Brookings Institution .
Figure 5 - Brookings Institution comparison of Gasoline Prices and US Per Capita Vehicle Miles Traveled from this study .
In the 2004 to 2006 period , the Fed , it its minutes , expressed concern about rising oil prices , and raised interest rates because it felt the economy must be overheating , if such inflationary effects were occurring .
The combination of higher oil prices , higher food prices ( caused by higher oil prices ) and the higher interest rates set by the Fed in response to higher oil prices had a braking effect on the economy .
People 's discretionary income dropped .
Housing prices began to drop , especially in the more distant suburbs , as people could afford less .
People began defaulting on loans , and the financial condition of banks became worse and worse .
Still , through all of this , oil prices continued to rise .
Finally , in July 2008 , a break came .
The economy could no longer tolerate the high oil price .
Instead of rising higher , other changes started occurring , affecting the economy as a whole .
Banks began cutting back on lending .
This cut - back in lending , as much as anything else , caused demand for all kinds of products to drop , since without more loans , people could n't buy automobiles and all of the other things they wanted , and without loans , businesses could n't fund new investments .
Once the break in oil prices occurred , oil companies began delaying their plans for increased production , especially in high cost places like the Oil Sands in Canada , where it would not be possible to produce oil and make a profit at the new lower prices .
The cutback in lending also affected some of the oil companies , forcing them to limit investments to what could be financed through cash flow from current production .
Since prices were low , cash flow was low , further reducing investible funds .
Production from existing wells continues to decline , and new investment is needed to offset this decline .
With the current lower investment , though , the amount of new investment is almost certainly inadequate , so future oil production is very likely to drop .
Spikes in oil prices have in the past have been associated with recessions , according to Jeff Rubin .
In addition , an econometric study by James Hamilton of the University of California at San Diego shows a link between oil prices and the current recession :
Whereas historical oil price shocks were primarily caused by physical disruptions of supply , the price run-up of 2007 - 08 was caused by strong demand confronting stagnating world production .
Although the causes were diﬀerent , the consequences for the economy appear to have been very similar to those observed in earlier episodes , with signiﬁcant eﬀects on overall consumption spending and purchases of domestic automobiles in particular .
In the absence of those declines , it is unlikely that we would have characterized the period 2007 : Q4 to 2008:Q3 as one of economic recession for the U.S .
If there is a single day for peak oil , it would be the day the price break took place .
This was July 11 , 2008 .
c. Forecasts by Tony Eriksen ( " ace " ) based on megaprojects data show declining future oil production .
Figure 5 - World Oil Production to 2012 as forecast by Tony Eriksen ( " ace " ) in May 2009 .
Oil includes crude oil , lease condensate and oil sands .
Tony and others have put together a database of planned investments in oil fields called the megaprojects database on Wikipedia .
This database includes all known capacity additions of 100,000 barrels a day or more , and is constantly updated .
With the drop in oil prices , more and more projects have been pushed off to future dates .
At the same time , existing fields continue to deplete .
Prior to the recent drop in prices , it seemed likely that production could continue to rise , at least for a few more years .
Now with lower prices , enough projects have been delayed that based on Tony 's analysis , oil decline can be expected for the next several years .
d. OPEC wells are for the most part very old .
Decline can be expected in the not - too - distant future .
We really have very poor information about OPEC 's true oil production capability .
Several of the OPEC countries have published very high reserve estimates , but these amounts are not audited , and there is serious doubt that the actual amounts are as high as they claim .
Also , we do n't know how fast the oil can be extracted .
We do n't know if these high reserves mean they actually have enough to maintain , or increase , their current production levels .
The reserves could also be consistent with a near - term drop in production , and a continuing dribble for hundreds of years .
Figure 6 - OPEC oil reserves , by backdated to year .
Summarized by author , using 2005 ASPO database and current list of OPEC members .
Figure 6 shows that most of OPEC oil reserves relate to fields that were discovered more than 40 year ago .
In fact , some were discovered more than 60 years ago .
The problem is that at some point , oil fields become depleted .
Instead of being able to pump a constant or rising amount of oil out , production begins to drop rapidly , even with rising investment .
In the United States , that drop in production occurred in 1970 ( see Figure 1 ) , about 40 years after production from its major oil fields began .
In the North Sea , the time frame was shorter -- about 28 years between initial production and the time when it became virtually impossible to maintain the prior level of production .
Several of the OPEC countries have not been pumping at maximum capacity for the full time and initial reserves seem to be quite large , so the time until terminal decline starts playing a major role is likely longer -- but could be very soon .
We know that Saudi Arabia is using aggressive techniques to maintain it production .
But at some point , these techniques are likely to stop working , and production may drop by as much as 3 million barrels a day quite quickly .
We have heard reports that Saudi Arabia is " resting " 1.5 million barrels a day of production from its largest field , Ghawar .
This may -- or may not -- indicate a problem in maintaining production in the field .
If Ghawar ( with at one point , 5 million barrels a day of production ) should start declining rapidly , this would be a problem .
e . The FSU does not look like it can play a major role in offsetting declines elsewhere .
Russia represents the largest part of the FSU .
Its production seems to have recently started declining .
Investment available for further development is limited by the lower oil prices , so Russia 's production is likely to continue to decline .
The production of the other countries in the FSU are relatively small .
Their production may be able to offset Russia 's decline for a few years , but are unlikely to add enough to offset much of the " All Other " decline in Figure 2 .
As a result , the vast majority of the decline in the " All Other " category will need to be made up by OPEC .
3. Ca n't OPEC adjust prices so that they are just right -- high enough to keep production rising , and low enough so the world economy will not go into shock ?
There are a couple of problems with adjusting prices .
The first is that it is not all that clear that OPEC has that much control over price .
Most members would prefer to produce " flat out " , so it is difficult for OPEC to reduce production by very much , from their maximum available production .
While we are often told that there is " x million barrels a day " in spare capacity , we have no way of verifying that that is in fact the case .
So if production is down , we do n't know if that is because of an intended cutback , or if it is because there are other issues ( for Venezuela , inability to pay creditors ; for Saudi Arabia , need to rest wells ) .
Apart from the difficulty in controlling the price , the real problem is that there really is no " sweet spot " where oil prices are high enough to encourage adequate production , but low enough to keep the world economy running .
The US Fed found that even when oil prices increased from $ 30 barrel to $ 40 barrel back in 2004 , this had inflationary effects on the economy , which they felt were necessary to control .
Clearly a much higher price than $ 40 barrel is needed to encourage production .
We do n't know exactly what that price is , but this graph gives an indication of the range in production costs :
Figure 7 - CERA estimates of full costs of oil production , from a Horizon oil presentation .
The CERA graph was put together when oil was about $ 90 barrel .
The dotted line seems to indicate the highest cost types of production that would be profitable at the $ 90 barrel price .
In order to get oil production to rise , we need new oil production from even the most expensive sources , including new deep water production and oil sands production .
This means we likely need oil prices of something like $ 100 barrel .
The world economy cannot support such high oil prices , without people defaulting on their loans , banks getting into serious financial difficulty , and the whole financial system crashing .
4 . Where can oil prices and production be expected to go from here ?
Opinions differ on this , but my view is that I do n't expect oil prices to go radically higher .
Instead , I expect that oil prices will continue to fluctuate , and the economy to continue to collapse .
Thus , what we will see will look more like collapsing demand than collapsing supply .
In my view , the underlying problem is the fact that the current level of debt ( by individuals , businesses , and governments ) cannot be maintained , unless we have a growing economy .
The reason we need a growing economy for the debt system to work is the fact that a person can borrow from tomorrow , only if tomorrow is better than today .
( This is especially the case if loans require the payment of interest . )
But if tomorrow is worse than today , borrowing from the future does n't work .
Even if tomorrow is the same as today , the system does n't work , if loans need to be paid back with interest .
The problem is that the economy cannot grow unless oil production is truly rising .
This lack of growth in world oil production since 2005 is what is causing the debt collapse we are now seeing .
This debt collapse is in turn giving rise to the demand destruction we are seeing currently .
Since oil production cannot rise in the future , it seems to me that we are going to see a continuing unwind of the credit bubble that was made possible by rising oil production .
Without credit , people will be unable to buy cars and houses .
Businesses will be unable to finance new investment , and we will see greater and greater demand destruction .
The result will be oil prices dropping , more and more people unemployed , and fewer goods and services purchased .
In short , the whole system will unwind from the demand side .
At some point , there may be a major break , if the international financial system cannot stand the strain .
There may also be political upheaval , both in oil producing countries ( because the price is too low ) and in oil consuming nations ( because more and more people are out of work ) .
The results are likely not to be very nice .
All TI Signing Keys Factored
Posted by Duncan on 13 September 2009 , 00:13 GMT
In July , we reported on the factoring of the 0004 key , required for the signing of TI - 83 + and TI - 83 + SE OS updates .
Thanks to an unprecedented community effort , all of TI 's signing keys have been factored ( Details on the United - TI thread ) , including both operating system and application signing keys for every upgradeable model .
The Nspire and Nspire CAS are n't included ; very little is known about them yet .
These keys allow free user - created operating systems to be installed without having to use awkward work - arounds such as Free83P and FreeFlash .
Free operating systems already exist for the TI - 83 + , the TI - 89 , and the TI - 92 + .
As of this writing , none of the operating systems available on ticalc.org right now are signed , but we look forward to accepting signed OSes from authors .
To sign your own operating system or Flash apps , you will need Benjamin Moody 's RabbitSign ( Unix , Windows ) .
For 68 k calculators ( TI - 89 / TI - 89 Titanium / TI - 92 + / Voyage 200 ) , Brandon Wilson 's resign68 k works as well .
We all know we 're supposed to eat healthy portions .
So why is it that a rough day at the office or even just the smell of chocolate - chip cookies can cause us to throw our best intentions out the window ?
If you overeat , think about what triggered your overindulgence so you can do better next time .
We tapped the nation 's leading experts for the unexpected reasons why so many of us overdo it -- so you can break the cycle and prevent an unwanted pile - on of pounds .
You 're not getting enough sleep
Missing out on your zzz 's not only puts you in a mental fog , it also triggers a constellation of actual metabolic changes that may lead to weight gain .
A lack of shut - eye harms your waistline because it affects two important hormones that control appetite and satiety -- leptin and ghrelin -- says Kristen L. Knutson , Ph.D. , a research associate specializing in sleep and health at the University of Chicago 's Department of Medicine .
Health.com : Potential side effects of sleeping pills
According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine , people who slept only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in leptin ( a hormone that signals the brain that the body has had enough to eat ) and a 28 percent increase in ghrelin ( a hormone that triggers hunger ) , compared with those who got more rest .
The result : Sleep - deprived study volunteers reported a 24 percent boost in appetite .
Short sleep can also impair glucose metabolism and over time set the stage for type 2 diabetes , Knutson notes .
How to get control :
When we 're exhausted , we hunger for just about everything in sight , especially if it 's sugary or high in carbs .
That may be because these foods give us both an energy boost and comfort ( since lack of sleep is a stressor ) , Knutson says .
To quell the urge for fattening foods and still get the energy kick you need , reach for a combination of complex carbs and protein .
" If you 're feeling tired , you want carbs .
But go for high - fiber carbs for long - lasting energy , " says Keri Gans , R.D. , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association ( ADA ) .
" Fiber burns slower than simple sugars , and adding in some protein keeps you satisfied longer . "
At breakfast , have whole - wheat toast with egg whites or a high - fiber cereal with fruit and a yogurt .
And for a food - free way to perk up during the day , take a 10 - minute walk outside .
You also can prevent uncontrollable cravings in the first place by prioritizing a good night 's sleep -- get seven to nine hours a night in a slumber - friendly bedroom ( one that 's as dark and quiet as possible and reserved for shut - eye and sex only ) .
A final tip :
If you 're plagued by sleep problems , ask your doctor for a referral to a sleep specialist .

You 're sabotaged by stress
Constant stress causes your body to pump out high doses of hormones , like cortisol , that over time can boost your appetite and lead you to overeat .
" Cortisol and insulin shift our preferences toward comfort foods - - high - fat , high - sugar , or high - salt foods , " says Elissa Epel , Ph.D. , an associate professor at the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) , Department of Psychiatry and a leader of the UCSF Center on Obesity Assessment , Study , and Treatment .
Health.com : Feeling stressed ?
Why you may feel it in your gut
Fat cells also produce cortisol , so if you 're overweight and stressed , you 're getting a double - whammy in terms of exposure .
Overweight women gained weight when faced with common stressors such as job demands , having a tough time paying bills , and family - relationship strains , according to a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology .
Cortisol , together with insulin , also causes your body to store more visceral fat , which is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke , Epel notes .
What 's more , stress makes it harder to stick with a healthy eating plan .
" It 's a reason why people go off diets , " notes Marci Gluck , Ph.D. , a clinical research psychologist at the Obesity and Diabetes Clinical Research Section of the National Institutes of Health in Phoenix , Arizona .
Folks who normally restrict their eating , tend to overeat in response to stress .
How to get control :
Sure , real - life pressures can put you in nonstop - nibble mode .
But working stress - reduction techniques into your busy days can really help .
Yoga , meditation , and deep - breathing exercises are powerful tools that keep tension in check .
And spending 20 minutes doing progressive muscle relaxation -- alternately tensing and relaxing muscle groups -- significantly lessens stress , anxiety , and cortisol , according to a study published in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders .

Exercise will also do the trick .
" Try dancing to your favorite tunes , running in place , playing a sport , or taking a simple walk , " says Elisa Zied , R.D. , an ADA spokeswoman and author of " Nutrition at Your Fingertips . "
When you 're feeling edgy , make a habit of turning to these activities rather than diving into your candy stash .
If you 're feeling completely overwhelmed by stress , talk to a counselor who specializes in stress management .
You 've got fatty foods ( literally ) on the brain
We 're hardwired to hunger for fatty , sugary , salty foods because , back when our ancestors were foraging for every meal , palatable eats meant extra energy and a leg - up on survival , says Dr. David A. Kessler , former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and author of " The End of Overeating : Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite . "
So it 's not just a lack of willpower that 's tripping you up , but rather your outdated survival mode .
In fact , when you eat fat - rich foods , your brain not only gets a signal that your body is satisfied but also forms long - term memories of the experience , according to new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
What once helped early humans survive is now giving us ever - expanding waistlines .
Adding to the challenge to control overeating , the mere sight of food can cue up a craving .
" [ Cravings ] are based on past learning and memories as well as the sight or smell of food , time of day , or location , " Kessler says .
" You 'll walk down the street and start thinking about chocolate - covered pretzels because you 've had them before on the same street . "
How to get control :
Avoid eating your favorite treat if you 're in a particular mood , if it 's a certain time of day , or if you 're in a specific place ; this will prevent you from creating a triggering link between those feelings or locations and that treat , Kessler says .
And since the smell and sight of fatty , sugary foods is pure temptation , try to keep yourself from passing the bakery or ice cream shop you can't resist .
Also , pay attention to what you 're thinking when temptation strikes .
" Once the brain is activated [ by a craving ] , having that inner dialogue of , ' No , I should n't have that , ' only increases the wanting , " Kessler notes .
Instead , focus on something you want more than that slice of cheesecake -- from being healthier for your kids to feeling less winded when you walk to work -- to help override the urge .

If logic is out the window , indulge in healthier versions of your favorites such as low - fat frozen yogurt with almonds when you crave a sundae or a calcium - rich glass of nonfat chocolate milk when you need a chocolate fix .
You Pigged Out -- Now What ?
• Forgive yourself .
" Having one overindulgent meal should not derail you from your healthful eating habits , while being too negative will make you more likely to throw up your hands in despair and overindulge at the next meal or several meals for days to come , " Elisa Zied , R.D. , says .
• Give yourself a do - over .
Immediately start with lean protein , veggies , whole grains , and fruit , and drink plenty of water , Zied suggests .
• Learn from it .
Think about what triggered your overindulgence -- not to punish yourself , but to choose smarter next time .
" If you keep a food journal , you might see you ended up pigging out because you waited too long to eat , " Keri Gans , R.D. , says .
• Add on exercise .
To feel in control again , simply tack on a few extra minutes to your regular walk , gym routine , etc .
At the same time , " try not to think of exercise as a punishment for overindulging , " Zied says .
If you do , you 'll grow to dread the gym

The message included Mr. Bezos ’s mea culpa from July .
“ This is an apology for the way we previously handled illegally sold copies of ‘ 1984 ’ and other novels on Kindle , ” Mr. Bezos said .
He went on to describe Amazon ’s actions as “ stupid , thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles . ”

The troubles began when the novels were added to the Kindle ’s online store by an outside company that did not have rights to them .
After the rights holder alerted Amazon , it removed the unauthorized versions from its systems and from customers ’ devices , distributing refunds .
But neither the refunds nor the subsequent apology were enough for some critics , who said the incident underscored the depth of the restrictions built into the Kindle .
Digital books for the Kindle are sold with so - called digital rights management software , which allows Amazon to maintain strict control over the copies of electronic books on its reader and prevents other companies from selling books for the device .
Consumer advocates and civil libertarians say the system could allow courts or governments to force Amazon to recall , and in essence censor , books that they deem politically dangerous or embarrassing .
The critics say the problem arises not just with Amazon , but also with other services offered online , like Google ’s planned digital library or streaming music and video sites , that replace tangible products like books , CDs or DVDs .
It 's a question that has baffled the worlds of agriculture and science – what is it that has caused the mysterious deaths of honey bees all over the world in the last five years ?
A new film may have the answer .
Vanishing of the Bees , which will be released in Britain next month , claims the cause is the use of a new generation of pesticides that weakens the bees and makes them more susceptible to other diseases .
Narrated by the British actress Emilia Fox , the 90 - minute film tells the story of what has become known as colony collapse disorder .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The problem first appeared in America in the winter of 2004 , when many beekeepers across the country found that their bees had suddenly vanished , leaving behind empty hives .
Since then scientists have failed to find a single cause for it .
The film goes on to suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides , some of them made by Bayer , one of the world 's biggest chemical companies , may be behind the disappearances .
The pesticides include the widely - used imidacloprid ( marketed under the trade name Gaucho ) , which has been banned in France following pressure from beekeepers .
It is still in use in Britain , the US and elsewhere .
Neonicotinoids are systemic compounds , which means they are applied to seeds rather than sprayed on to growing plants .
They enter into the plants themselves and affect the insect pests that consume them .
In theory , insects that are not pests should not be affected .
But Vanishing of the Bees , made by the independent filmmakers George Langworthy and Maryam Henein , suggests that long - term , low - level exposure to these compounds may be having a sub-lethal but debilitating effect on honey bees .
The pesticides , it suggests , may be the final straw for a bee population that has already been weakened in recent years by diseases ranging from the devastating varroa mite to the nosema fungus and other viruses .
In particular , the film targets Bayer , the long - established German firm which invented aspirin and is the world 's fourth - largest pharmaceutical company .
Bayer rejected the allegations last night , insisting that its products did not harm bees .
" Everybody knows this is about the varroa mite , the nosema pest and a number of fungal and viral diseases , " said Dr Julian Little , a UK spokesman for Bayer CropScience .
" The healthiest bees in the world are in Australia , where they have lots of neonicotinoids but they do n't have varroa .
If you look at a country where they have restricted the use of neonicotinoids , France , they have a worse bee problem there than they do in the UK , " Dr Little added .
The British Beekeepers ' Association said it did not have the evidence to say if neonicotinoids were behind honey bee declines .
" All the data we have seen so far is inconclusive , " said Tim Lovett , the association 's president .
But we were wrong .
Health care spending has since doubled , to around 16 percent of our gross domestic product , and in the next 25 years or so is projected to reach 31 percent of G.D.P.
Despite having those figures in hand , Congress might still pass legislation calling for spending more , not less , on health care , even though we ’ve been told for decades that what we spend has almost nothing to do with the quality of care we receive .

In fact , expensive care is often worse care , because it snowballs into what some are calling an “ epidemic of overtreatment , ” in which unnecessary procedures , tests and medications all spawn more tests , more meds ( to treat the side effects of the first batch ) and more follow - up scans and procedures ( in stand - alone clinics owned by the same doctors prescribing the tests , scans and procedures ) .
With so much evidence of wasteful and even harmful treatment , should n’t we instantly cut some of the money spent on exorbitant intensive - care medicine for dying , elderly people and redirect it to pediatricians and obstetricians offering preventive care for children and mothers ?
Sadly , we are very far from this goal .
A cynic would argue that this ca n’t happen because children can’t vote ( even if their parents can ) , whereas members of AARP and the American Medical Association not only vote but can also hire lobbyists to keep the money flowing .
One thing ’s for sure :
Our health care system has failed .
Generational spending wars loom on the horizon .
Rationing of health care is imminent .
But given the political inertia , we could soon find ourselves in a triage situation in which there is no time or money to create medical - review boards to ponder cost - containment issues or rationing schemes .
We ’ll be forced to implement quick - and - dirty rules based on something simple , sensible and easily verifiable .
Like age .
As in : No federal funds to be spent on intensive - care medicine for anyone over 85 .
I am not , of course , talking about euthanasia .
I ’m just wondering why the nation continues incurring enormous debt to pay for bypass surgery and titanium - knee replacements for octogenarians and nonagenarians , when for just a small fraction of those costs we could provide children with preventive health care and nutrition .
Eight million children have no health insurance , but their parents pay 3 percent of their salaries to Medicare to make sure that seniors get the very best money can buy in prescription drugs for everything from restless leg syndrome to erectile dysfunction , scooters and end - of - life intensive care .

The True Blood actress also says going blonde for the role has been eye - opening
The nudity in HBO ’s True Blood might seem risqué to American audiences , but Anna Paquin , who was born in Canada and grew up in New Zealand , does n’t really see what the fuss is about .
“ I do n’t think a naked body is particularly shocking or interesting , ” the 27 - year - old True Blood star tells , Nylon for its September issue .
“ It ’s not the culture I was raised in .
I was not brought up in the United States .
I do n’t share the [ attitude ] that you can have graphic violence , but – God forbid – you see someone ’s nipples . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
It helps that Paquin , who plays Sookie Stackhouse on the show , has her nude scenes with Stephen Moyer , to whom she became engaged this summer .
“ You ’re not having to sort of get over the ‘ Wow , I ’m naked with someone that I do n’t even know the middle name of ! ’ ” she told AOL Television recently .
Paquin also tells
Nylon that it ’s been interesting to see how people approach her now that she ’s gone blonde for the role .
Efforts by President Obama to put an end to the nation ’s failed “ War on Drugs ” ca n’t come an hour too soon --- if that ’s his intent .
From his actions , it ’s hard to know .
Drug offenses account for about half the 200,000 Federal prison inmates behind bars , compared to just 15 % of prisoners convicted of violent crimes involving weapons , explosives , or arson .
If America leads the world with 2.3 million prisoners in all its prisons , jails , and assorted lock - ups , it is largely because we have criminalized drug addiction , not treated it .
President Richard Nixon first declared a “ War on Drugs ” in 1969 to dramatize his fight against drug addiction .
Nixon --- who had a knack for waging wars he could not win--- got the country headed down a wrong road from which it may only now be just turning around .
Gil Kerlikowske , Obama ’s new head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , has renounced even the use of the phrase “ War on Drugs ” on grounds it favors incarceration of offenders rather than treatment .
But talk is no substitute for action .
To his credit , Obama has long appeared to be open to a fresh approach .
In an address at Howard University on September 28 , 2007 , then Senator Obama said , “ I think it ’s time we took a hard look at the wisdom of locking up some first time nonviolent drug users for decades . ”
“ We will give first - time , non-violent drug offenders a chance to serve their sentence , where appropriate , in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior , ” he added .
“ So let 's reform this system .
Let 's do what 's smart .
Let 's do what 's just . ”
And as overcrowding spurts and governors currently whine they can’t balance budgets , the public might get some real relief .
Last year , more than 700,000 of the country ’s 20 - million pot smokers were arrested for marijuana possession , according to NORML , an advocacy lobby that works for decriminalization .
Over the past decade , 5 - million folks got arrested on marijuana charges , 90 % of which were for “ simple possession , not trafficking or sale , ” NORML says .
“ Regardless of whether one is a ‘ drug warrior ’ or a ‘ drug legalizer , ” writes Bob Barr in the May 25thAtlanta Journal Constitution , “ it is difficult if not impossible to defend the 38 - year old war on drugs as a success . ”
That ’s because , “ Illicit drugs are every bit as easy to score on America ’s streets and in her schools now as they were more than three decades ago .
Last year , just under 84 % of the 12th graders considered that marijuana was ‘ very easy ’ or ‘ fairly easy ’ to obtain ; virtually the same as in a 1975 survey . ”
What accounts for the 547 % spurt in prison population between 1970 and 2007 , Barr writes , is that “ the primary focus of the federal anti-drug effort has been enforcement , interdiction and incarceration as opposed to demand reduction , prevention and treatment . ”
Mary Ellen DiGiacomo , of the Action Committee For Women in Prison ( ACWIP ) , of New Jersey , says , “ There ’s long waiting lines to get into ( substance abuse ) programs , and they do n’t have drug treatment programs at most women ’s institutions .
You get one therapist , one counselor you talk to but that does not constitute drug treatment . ”
This may be one reason Bureau of Justice Statistics finds two out of every three released convicts within three years wind up back inside .
As former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke wrote in The New Republic , “ There are roughly 1.8 million people arrested each year for drug law violations --- 40 percent of them for marijuana possession . ”
Schmoke called for creating more Federal drug courts where addicts “ would be treated from a public health perspective ” rather than a criminal one .
Gloria Killian , of Pasadena , founder and executive director of ACWIP , estimates “ Eighty percent of ( the 11,600 ) women in California ’s prisons are in there for nonviolent drug offenses .
Most low - level drug offenders are addicts and need treatment .
It ’s a medical problem .
It ’s a mental health problem . ”
Oddly , foreign presidents can see the problem clearly even if many U.S. “ law - and - order ” politicians cannot .
AP in a March 16th dispatch wrote that a report by three former Latin presidents “ dubbed the war on drugs a ‘ complete failure . ’ ” Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico , César Gaviria of Colombia , and Henrique Cardoso of Brazil , “ all conservative politicians , blamed the US emphasis on criminalization for the continuing toll caused by drug trafficking , and called for an approach based on public health , including the legalization of marijuana , ” AP said .
The ill - starred drug war has filled American prisons to bursting .
In Chicago , some prisoners are sleeping on the floor , the John Howard Assn. reports .
At the California Institution for Women , in Corona , designed for 800- 900 , Killian says , “ last year they ran at double capacity at all times . ”
The recreation rooms have been filled up with beds and “ the auditorium has been used as a dormitory . ”
Calling our prisons “ overcrowded ” and “ ill - managed , ” Senator Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) wrote in Parade magazine : “ Drug offenders , most of them passive users or minor dealers , are swamping our prisons . ”
Webb said 47.5 % of all the drug arrests in 2007 were for marijuana offenses .
What ’s more , “ nearly 60 % of the people in state prisons serving time for a drug offense had no history of violence or of any significant selling activity .
Indeed , four out of five drug arrests were for possession of illegal substances , while only one in five was for sales , ” Webb noted .
And , “ Three - quarters of the drug offenders in our state prisons were there for nonviolent or purely drug offenses . ”
Webb is the Senate ’s champion of prison reform because , he says , we are “ locking up too many people who do not belong in jail . ”
He introduced a bill in March to create a blue - ribbon panel to review criminal justice policies and recommend reforms within 18 months .
President Nixon created such a task force but when the Shafer Report ( after former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer ) concluded in 1972 that “ neither the marijuana user nor the drug itself can be said to constitute a danger to public safety ” and urged the government to stop penalizing pot smokers for personal use or distribution , Nixon simply ignored it .
Taxpayers are shelling out $ 68 billion annually for prisons , much of it winding up in the pockets of private contractors .
As author Andrew Bosworth explained in “ Dissident Voice , ” “ Inmates have become the raw material for a prison - industrial complex , shoring up perpetual profits for McJails .
Corporate prisons are paid on a per-prisoner / per day basis , and thus they lobby hard for longer mandatory sentences .
Inmates also provide cheap labor , and they are about to become , once again , guinea pigs for pharmaceutical trials .
All of this signals the conversion of people into valuable ‘ bio - mass . ”
Or as DiGiacomo bluntly put it , “ The prison - industrial complex wants people to keep going to prison because that ’s how they make their billions . ”
Bosworth adds , “ Prisons provide jobs to rural and small town Americans who would otherwise be unemployed .
These workers and their families represent votes , especially in the South , where electoral majorities are White and electoral minorities are Black . ”
In a rare insight he argues , “ The drug war is , in large part , a race war by other means . ”
Indeed , Bureau of Justice Statistics estimate that 32 % of black males will be imprisoned in their lifetime as against 17 % of Hispanic males and 5.9 percent of white males . ”
The Obama administration , AP reported , “ signaled today ( March 16th ) that it was ready to repudiate the prohibition and ‘ war on drugs ’ approach of previous presidents , and steer policy towards prevention and ‘ harm reduction ’ strategies favored by Europe . ”
Radley Balko , senior editor of Reason magazine , however , doubts Obama ’s intentions .
He wrote in The Daily Beast of April 16th : “ As he leaves on a trip to Mexico , the president looks poised to continue the same ruinous drug policies and the same failing tactics in the war on drugs . ”
Balko says U.S. fundings of Mexican crackdowns on drug cartels “ often ratchet up the level of violence , as the elimination of one major drug distributor provokes those who remain to war over his territory . ”
Balko notes that marijuana makes up 60 to 70 percent of the Mexican drug trade and “ lifting prohibitions on it in the United States would eradicate a major source of funds for the cartels . ”
Since 2006 , Balko notes , more than 10,000 Mexicans have been murdered “ as a direct consequence of the drug trade . ”
That figure , by the by , is roughly twice the number of U.S. soldiers and contractors killed in Iraq since President Bush launched his ill - starred aggression .
Balko charged that Obama has morphed “ from a thoughtful drug - war critic to a typical Beltway drug warrior . ”
He says while Obama never supported legalization , the drug reform community rallied behind his candidacy “ because in the past he has taken thoughtful , nuanced positions on the issue . ”
Balko charged campaigner Obama also pushed to revitalize the so - called Byrne Grant , which ties Federal aid to local police based on the number of their drug arrests , encouraging them to prowl for low - level offenders .
And while candidate Obama pledged to end Bush ’s raids on medical marijuana patient caregivers ’ , President Obama ’s Drug Enforcement Administration raided a medical marijuana dispensary , raising questions of just where the White House stands .
On the other hand , the Drug Policy Alliance Network ( DPAN ) , which seeks alternatives to the War on Drugs , notes “ The official White House website now calls for elimination both the crack / powder cocaine sentencing disparity and promoting AIDS prevention by lifting the federal ban on funding syringe access programs .
That ’s a remarkable change from the last eight years … ”
A real change in drug policy could save the country billions .
Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has pointed out : “ Prohibition is a drain on the public purse .
Federal , state and local governments spend roughly $ 44 billion per year to enforce drug prohibition .
These same governments forego roughly $ 33 billion per year in tax revenue they could collect from legalized drugs , assuming these were taxed at rates similar to those on alcohol and tobacco .
Under prohibition , these revenues accrue to traffickers as increased profits . ”
Miron told CNN , “ Prohibition of drugs corrupts politicians and law enforcement by putting police , prosecutors , judges and politicians in the position to threaten the profits of an illicit trade .
This is why bribery , threats and kidnapping are common for prohibited industries but rare otherwise .
Mexico ’s recent history illustrates this dramatically . ”
If Obama balks on marijuana reform he will be going against a strong - flowing tide of public opinion against him .
Allen St. Pierre , executive director of NORML , recently pointed out there are 36 marijuana bills pending in 24 states calling for legalization , de-criminalization , and medical marijuana .
“ Not all the bills will make it , ” he says , “ but they are a sign of change . ”
By legalizing drugs , the way the country legalized alcohol in the Thirties , the government could deal a sharp blow to the drug cartels just as it did to Al Capone and other organized crime moonshiners that supplied the speakeasies .
Plus , legalization could reduce our swollen prison populations at a big savings to taxpayers .
At the same time , it would free up police manpower to battle violent crime , not pot smokers .
Finally , and most important , it could set free hundreds of thousands of men and women who do not belong behind bars .
When it comes to decriminalizing marijuana , Americans seemingly are ready for real change --- not chump change .
Remember , if you 're not making babies ... the terrorists win !

If the aphorism holds — the guerrilla wins if he does not lose — the Taliban are winning and America is losing the war in Afghanistan .
Well into the eighth year of war , the Taliban are more numerous than ever , inflicting more casualties than ever , operating in more provinces than ever and controlling more territory than ever .
And their tactics are more sophisticated .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal calls the situation “ serious . ” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Michael Mullen calls it “ serious ” and “ deteriorating . ”
President Obama thus faces a decision that may decide the fate of his presidency .
For if the situation is grave and deteriorating , he can not do nothing .
Inaction invites , if it does not assure , defeat .
Does he cut U.S. losses , write off Afghanistan as not worth any more American blood and treasure , and execute a strategic retreat ?
Or does he become the war president who sends McChrystal the scores of thousands of U.S. troops necessary to stave off a defeat for all the years needed to conscript and train an Afghan army that can and will defend the Kabul regime and pacify the country ?
Afghanistan is being called Obama ’s Vietnam .
It could become that , and bring down his presidency as Vietnam brought down Lyndon Johnson’s .
But Afghanistan is not yet Vietnam in terms either of troops committed or casualties taken .
The 68,000 Americans who will be in Afghanistan at year ’s end are an eighth of the forces in Vietnam when Richard Nixon began to bring them home .
Vietnam cost the lives of 58,000 Americans .
The Afghan war has cost fewer than 1,000 .
U.S. casualties in Afghanistan are as yet only a fifth of the U.S. losses in the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 - 1902 .
If we compare Afghanistan to Vietnam , we are about in 1964 , when the Tonkin Gulf Resolution was passed and the bombing of the North began , or December 1965 , when the Marines came ashore at Danang .
Obama can still choose not to fight this war .
But should he so choose , he will be charged by Republicans and neoconservatives with a loss of nerve , with having cut and run , with having lost what he himself has repeatedly called a “ war of necessity , ” with having abandoned the noble cause for which many of America ’s best and bravest have already paid the ultimate price .
And it needs be said :
The consequences of a U.S. withdrawal today would be far greater than if we had never gone in , or had gone in , knocked over the Taliban , run al - Qaida out of the country , gotten out and gone home .
Instead , we brought NATO in , put tens of thousands of troops in and declared our determination to build an Afghan democracy that would be a model for the Islamic world , where women ’s rights were protected .
After inviting the world to observe how the superpower succeeds in taking down a tyranny and creating a democracy , we will have failed , and we will be perceived by the whole world to have failed .
While there was no vital U.S. interest in Afghanistan before we went in , we have invested so much blood , money and prestige that withdrawal now — which would entail a Taliban takeover of Kabul and the Pashtun south and east — would be a strategic debacle unprecedented since the fall of Saigon .
But what if Obama approves McChrystal ’s request and puts another 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops into the war ?
Certainly , that would stave off any defeat .
But what is the assurance it would bring enduring victory closer ?
The Taliban have matched us escalation for escalation and are now militarily stronger than at any time since the Northern Alliance , with U.S. air support , ran them out of Kabul .
About the political consequences of escalation , there is no doubt .
Obama would divide his party and country .
His support would steadily sink as the roll call of U.S. dead and wounded inexorably rose .
He would watch as the NATO allies moved toward the exit and America was left alone to fight alongside the Afghans in a seemingly endless war .
Consider .
If there were no Americans in Afghanistan today , and the Taliban were on the verge of victory , how many of us would demand the dispatch of 68,000 troops to fight to prevent it ?
Few , if any , one imagines .
What that answer suggests is that the principal reason for fighting on is not that Afghanistan is vital , but that we cannot accept the American defeat and humiliation that withdrawal would mean .
Thus Obama ’s dilemma : Accept a longer , bloodier war with little hope of ultimate victory , a decision that could cost him his presidency .
Or order a U.S. withdrawal and accept defeat , a decision that could cost him his presidency .
In such situations , presidents often decide not to decide .
Harry Truman could not decide in Korea .
LBJ could not decide in Vietnam .
Both lost their presidencies .
Ike and Nixon came in , cut U.S. losses and got out .
The country rewarded both with second terms .
What is there to say ?
What can be said ?
With the addition of the sixth floor - something we ’ve tried to get in previous years , but were unable to - the flow mechanism of PAX has become incredibly robust .
The sixth floor is , itself , large enough to hold a smaller conference on its own , and in previous years it has done just that for other people .
Now , this floor is turned to our own dark purpose , with multiple , comparatively vast theater rooms , a broad LAN scenario , also other things , but most importantly multiple ways in and out of each , so that the areas that were previously huge bottlenecks now were capped by human release valves every which way , so that the sensation of being trapped prior to slaughter was minimized as one travelled through the show , which … is good .
A line will always be a line , that is to say , it is inherently not what you wanted to do .
But it need not be purgatorial , and we experimented with Get in Line Games ( a team we met out in Pittsburgh ) to smooth it out to the extent it is possible to do so .
We received tons of absolutely unsolicited positive feedback , so let ’s call this progress .
Friday night , when my energon reserves were at their lowest , I wandered into the main theater for no particular reason .
Shortly thereafter , a few thousand people entered in advance of that night ’s show , sealing me in the venue like some ancient king .
I ’d hoped to catch the Anamanaguchi show , and now I had no choice but to so , and in the process met a bunch of people I had n’t really intended to who turned out to be fucking awesome .
I was hoping to catch Metroid Metal as well , since we finally got them out here , and they were up next which struck me as auspicious .
Thinking I might catch a couple songs and then crash , it quickly became clear that I was watching one of the best concerts we ’ve ever held at the show .
It ’s a good thing I stayed , because it ’s probably the last show I ’ll be watching in quite awhile .
That ’s kind of another story .
I very nearly missed the create a strip panel , but Scott Kurtz filled in until I could make a surprise appearance .
Here are the fruits of said panel , tantalizingly firm and mad with juice .
It has always been the profound irony of the show that we created it because we wanted to attend it , but attending it is ( for us ) virtually impossible .
Someone asked us in an interview what our relationship to the show actually is , and where Gabriel said hosts , I said ghosts : like creatures perpetually out of phase with living beings , we float from room to room haunting their inhabitants .
Perhaps because the quality of the attendees is so incredible , or perhaps because the Enforcers have so mastered this venue , but I ’ve never felt more like an attendee : able to commune authentically , to be a part of the strange organism which manifests there each year .

This rumor seems to pop up every time the wind blows in a certain direction .
T - mobile wants to acquire Sprint , Sprint wants to acquire T - mobile , Sprint and T - mobile dance the Samba etc etc. Deutsche Telekom ( T - mobile USA parent company ) has a market value six times that of Sprint and while Sprint seems to be on a roll these days with a bounty of surprisingly affordable yet all encompassing plans combined with a super star winter lineup they hemorrhage customers at every turn .
Any tech blogger or tech fan in general immediately jumps at the notion to point the incompatibility of the two company ’s networks , CDMA and GSM .
Considering Sprint does n’t exactly have a strong record of accomplishment merging companies with incompatible networks we can at least be thankful T - mobile is leading this dance .
That being said , there are still an unfathomable amount of questions as to how this would work , what would this do to the wireless landscape with only three major players .
Telegraph UK , the newspaper responsible for this round of rumors reports that the Deutsche Telekom has called in Deutsche Bank in preparation for an offer for Sprint .
This could get very interesting , very quickly and while the prospect of jumping right onto AT&T ’s back with a customer base that rivals their own makes my heart fill with joy , that does n’t mean it ’s the smart play .
If I were the boys at the FCC I ’d want to see the best damn play by play integration schematic ever created by man on how exactly this merger would work .
Telegraph UK
Interestingly enough , this report comes hot on the heels of a PCWorld story , which all but bashed T - mobile USA proclaiming “ T - mobile has little to offer US mobile providers . ”
Well sorry Tony Bradley , I disagree and I ’m sure I speak on behalf of all Tmonews readers .
While T - mobile ’s 3G network continues to roll out at a furious pace onward toward its 2009 goal of 250 million POP ’s it has yet to really turn the T - mobile image around .
The dominant player in the Android game thus far has also failed to really give T - mobile the same type of customer rush AT&T has felt with the iPhone deep in its pocket .
On the positive side , T - mobile continues to roll with JD power award after JD power award , for both customer service and call quality .
Unfortunately , those awards do n’t seem to materialize in significant gains for our beloved magenta .
I received a very insightful email from a reader two days ago who made two very interest points that I would like to consider , 1 ) The Microsoft experience shows that inattention to details and poor user experience can relegate even a dominant player to the sidelines over time .
On the other hand 2 ) Apple shows that even a small player with a well - developed idea can grow rapidly .
With Sprint still suffering from the stigma of failed customer service and a plagued wireless network , with AT&T taking nothing but a beating in the press lately T - mobile is in the perfect position to capitalize on its strengths .
For all its network awards , Verizon still suffers from the image of uber - expense and while T - mobile who rivals Verizon in almost every JD power award and has prices less than that of Verizon has yet to really exert that power .
Forwarding customers to billshrink simply is n’t the right move , it ’s not going to produce a sudden influx of millions of customers .
That needs to happen by reputation , reliability and marketing .
T - mobile needs to do more to showcase the strengths it has rather than its weaknesses and any good tech blogger worth a damn will tell you , pick the carrier first , and phone second .
Whatever the end result of a Deutsche Telekom / Sprint Merger is , T - mobile USA needs to focus on the now , and what it can do without spending billions of dollars to swallow up one large competitor or a handful of tiny ones .
Android is great , but it ’s not the end all be all of wireless , T - mobile is ripe to make a move on both Sprint and AT&T without spending billions to acquire either .
AT&T will continue to shoot itself in the foot with the iPhone network woes and Sprint , well Sprint will be Sprint and lose customers no matter what they bring to the table .
So T - mobile , spend the money , do n’t spend the money but acting fast to take advantage of one of the most exciting times in wireless is n’t just a recommendation right now , it ’s a full blown necessity .
WASHINGTON —
There seemed little question after the argument in an important campaign finance case at the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the makers of a slashing political documentary about Hillary Rodham Clinton were poised to win .
The open issue was just how broad that victory would be .
The argument was extraordinary in its timing , length and participants .
It took place during the court ’s summer break , almost a month before the start of the new term in October ; lasted more than 90 minutes instead of the usual hour ; and featured the Supreme Court debuts of Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the solicitor general , Elena Kagan .
It was , moreover , a rare re-argument .
When the case was first heard in March , it centered on whether the restrictions on corporate spending in the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance law applied to the documentary “ Hillary : The Movie , ” which was produced by a nonprofit advocacy corporation called Citizens United .
In the request for re-argument , the court raised the much broader question of whether it should sweep away restrictions on political speech by corporations .
On Wednesday , Ms. Kagan all but said that a loss for the government would be acceptable , so long as it was on narrow grounds .
Some statistics , like Bradman 's average and the number of centuries Tendulkar has made are known to pretty much every cricket buff .
But The List will bring you facts and figures that are n't so obvious , adding fuel to those fiery debates about the most valuable middle - order bat , and the most useless tailender .
If there 's a particular List that you would like to see , e-mail us with your comments and suggestions .
Only 36 hat - tricks have occurred in 1783 Tests and a mere 20 in 2321 ODIs .
They are rare events that trigger supreme adrenalin rushes , and apart from the wild excitement a hat - trick provides , it is of immense value to a team .
But how do you measure a hat - trick 's `value ' ?
The List looks at heavyweight hat - tricks , measured in terms of the sum of the averages of the batsmen dismissed .
Irfan Pathan 's hat - trick in the ongoing Test against Pakistan at Karachi was not just the first in the first over of a Test , it was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed ( 130.18 : Salman Butt 34.27 , Younis Khan 46.04 , Mohammad Yousuf 49.86 ) .
For sheer weight of runs , Glenn McGrath 's three - in - three that included Sherwin Campbell , Brian Lara and Jimmy Adams ( total runs 11,388 ) is the highest .
McGrath 's hat - trick was special because Lara was his 300th Test wicket and he had predicted reaching 300 wickets with the scalps of Campbell and Lara .
Frederick Spofforth was the first to perform this feat when his 13 for 110 helped Australia rout England by ten wickets at Melbourne in 1879 .
Taking a hat - trick is tough enough but to do it twice in a match is probably a once - in - a - blue - moon feat .
Jimmy Matthews took hat - tricks in each innings ( both on the same day ) against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1912 and Tommy Ward was his third wicket on both occasions .
Apart from Matthews , Hugh Trumble and Wasim Akram are the only other bowlers to have taken a hat - trick on two occasions .
Akram 's hat - tricks came in consecutive Tests against Sri Lanka at Lahore and Dhaka during the Asian Test Championship in 1999 .
Trumble was the first of two bowlers to take a hat - trick in his last Test .
The other was Geoff Griffin who became the first to take a hat - trick at Lord 's in just his second Test .
But in the course of the match , he was no -balled eleven times for throwing and never played another game .
Barack Obama celebrated his 48th birthday today by presenting Hearst columnist Helen Thomas , who turned 89 , a plate of cupcakes .
Today marked the culmination of a monumental year for Obama in which he accepted his party 's nomination , handily won the general election , and took office as the nation 's first African - American president .

Art Fag City at The L Magazine : Juergen Teller ’s Naked Night in The Museum
POST BY PADDY JOHNSON

This week at The L Magazine I discuss Juergen Teller ’s exhibition at Lehmann Maupin .
As a point of reference , earlier this week Mr. Teller edged out Matt Held at the top point of NY Magazine ’s approval matrix under “ high brow ” and “ brilliant . ”
( Held rated very high in the low brow field and ranked sort of brilliant . )
I ’m not sure I ’d rate Teller the same .
“ Why do press releases so frequently describe art as something that ' blurs distinctions ? '”  a friend asked me this weekend .
The question was prompted by photographer Juergen Teller 's show “ Paradise ”  at Lehmann Maupin .
The gallery described his work as “ blurring the distinction between commercial and non-commercial work . ” 
“ It seems like an odd purpose for art to have , ”  my friend continued .
“ It begins from the position that those distinctions need to be blurred . ” 
In Teller 's new exhibition , which features 14 large - scale photographs of two nude models in the Louvre , blurring of one sort or another occasionally becomes clear , but I question if genre - transcendence is lasting enough to be its purpose .

Wallabies and former Crusaders rugby coach Robbie Deans ' father died yesterday .
Anthony Maxwell
Deans died at his home , aged 83 .
He is survived by his wife , Joy , and other children Jo , Nicky , Bruce and Sarah .
While the Wallabies squad boarded a plane yesterday morning , Robbie Deans was en route to Christchurch to be with his father .
It is not known when he would now arrive at the Wallabies Cape Town base to prepare for their August 9 match against the Springboks .
It gets more unbelievable by the day , does n't it ?
Joe Szakos leads the Virginia Organizing Project , an almost fifteen year - old community organization that Health Care for America Now works with in Virginia to organize for health care reform .
Szakos 's organization employs dozens of people , and they get their health care through Anthem Blue Cross / Blue Shield .
This year , Szakos was informed that Anthem was going to increase the premiums on Virginia Organizing Project 's health plan by 14.1 % .
Around the same time , the Virginia Organizing Project received an email from Anthem :
We strongly support reform that builds a strong , sustainable private - sector health care system - and strongly oppose creating a government - run health plan .
We are urging our elected officials in Washington to take bipartisan action that will accomplish that .
We are educating policymakers in Washington and working with our trade associations to encourage Congress to build on the current system and not disrupt the quality , affordable coverage on which our members depend ....
As our elected officials debate health care , they need to hear directly from you .
Szakos immediately had some questions for Anthem .
Chief among them , why is Anthem using its resources to lobby against health care reform with a public health insurance option while at the same time increasing rates by 14.1 % ?
Szakos , along with three other Virginia Organizing Project board members , went down to Anthem 's offices in Richmond , VA to ask .
He left in handcuffs .
Szakos , a customer , could n't get an answer from Anthem .
There was no justification for raising rates on one hand , and spending money lobbying against health care reform on the other .
And instead of trying to offer Szakos an explanation , they had him arrested .
As Szakos said in the video , this is about greed and force .
There is no good explanation for these rate increases , and there is no justification for Anthem to spend money it collects in premiums from customers suffering under its " health care " plans on lobbying against reform that would help these very same people .
The only thing motivating Anthem - and all insurance companies - is greed .
And they get and keep their money by force .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 29 July 2009
In the article below about the trial of the Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi we referred to the man who swam across a lake to her home , John Yettaw , as a US veteran of the Vietnam war – as widely reported in the United States .
We should have made clear that this is a claim , so far unverified by the US military .
The trial of Burma 's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been adjourned until today for her defence lawyers to give their closing response before a verdict is delivered , possibly in two to three weeks .
The Nobel peace prize laureate is charged with breaking the terms of her house arrest by allowing an American man to spend two nights at her home in May .
She faces up to five years in prison if found guilty .
Her lawyers were reportedly making last - ditch attempts to call Nyunt Maung Shein , Burma 's former ambassador to the UN , to testify in court .
They claim to have proof that he told the UN 's human rights council that Aung San Suu Kyi was being " detained for her own security " .
Her lawyer , Nyan Win , said : " We have asked the [ Burma ] foreign ministry to appear before the court with the necessary records in order to have a fair trial . "
It appears that the defence will attempt to argue that if a government official confirmed she was detained , not under arrest , then she cannot be tried for allegedly breaking her detention order .
" It 's not over yet – the defence will get another chance to respond to the prosecution 's arguments , " Nyan Win said .
The adjournment came as Amnesty International awarded Aung San Suu Kyi its highest accolade , the title of ambassador of conscience , for leading the democracy struggle in Burma .
" Aung San Suu Kyi has remained a symbol of hope , courage and the undying defence of human rights , not only to the people of Myanmar but to people around the world , " Amnesty 's secretary general , Irene Khan , said in a statement .
The rock band U2 was due to announce the award at a concert in Dublin last night .
John Yettaw , a Vietnam veteran who was described by his wife as eccentric , said he swam across a lake to her home because he wanted to warn her that she was about to be assassinated by " terrorists . "
Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been detained for 14 of the last 20 years , pleaded with Yettaw to leave and relented only after he claimed to be too ill to swim back .
Reports said Yettaw 's lawyer was due to defend his client against charges of trespassing , which carries a sentence of up to three months in prison .
Khin Maung
Oo said at the weekend that he would attempt to win Yettaw , 53 , a lenient sentence .
" I will try my best to defend my client .
I will argue that he did not violate the restriction order and I will try my utmost to get him lesser punishment , " he said .
Although the prosecution was expected to wrap up its case against the Nobel prize winner her lawyer said a verdict was not imminent .
" I expect all the arguments will be made today but I think the verdict might take as long as two or three weeks , " Nyan Win told Reuters .
He said his client was " preparing for the worst " at the end of a trial that the military junta 's critics have denounced as an excuse to keep her incarcerated during national elections due next year .
Statements were expected from Aung San Suu Kyi's longtime companions , Khin Khin Win and her daughter Win Ma Ma .
The women , members of Suu Kyi's the National League for Democracy [ ( NLD ] ) , also face up to five years in prison .
The NLD won a landslide victory in elections in 1990 , but the ruling generals refused to recognise the result .
The junta has so far resisted international calls for Aung San Suu Kyi's immediate release .
Last week , the state - controlled media accused the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , of " interference " after she said a satisfactory conclusion to the trial could lead to better economic ties with Washington .
The defence does not deny that Yettaw visited her compound , but argues that she cannot be charged under laws abolished in 1988 .
It blames her bodyguards for failing to apprehend Yettaw , who remained undetected for several hours .

All this may explain why the same man could write “ we live on a shrinking and vulnerable planet which our lack of foresight is rapidly turning into a slum ” and yet gently chide the sort of Americans who march against coal in Washington .
Dyson has great affection for coal and for one big reason :
It is so inexpensive that most of the world can afford it .
“ There ’s a lot of truth to the statement Greens are people who never had to worry about their grocery bills , ” he says .
( “ Many of these people are my friends , ” he will also tell you . )
To Dyson , “ the move of the populations of China and India from poverty to middle - class prosperity should be the great historic achievement of the century .
Without coal it cannot happen . ”
That said , Dyson sees coal as the interim kindling of progress .
In “ roughly 50 years , ” he predicts , solar energy will become cheap and abundant , and “ there are many good reasons for preferring it to coal . ”
THE WORDS COLLEAGUES COMMONLY use to describe Dyson include “ unassuming ” and “ modest , ” and he seems the very embodiment of Newton ’s belief that a man should strive for simplicity and avoid confusion in life .
Dyson has been in residence at the institute since 1953 , a time when Albert Einstein shared his habit of walking to work there , which Dyson still does seven days a week , to write on a computer and solve any problems that come across his desk with paper and pencil .
( In his prime , legend held that he never used the eraser . )
He and Imme have spent 51 happy years together in the same house , a white clapboard just over the garden fence from the stucco affair once inhabited by their former neighbors , the Oppenheimers .
On some Sundays the Dysons pile into a car still decorated with an Obama bumper sticker and drive to running races , at which Dyson can be found at the finish line loudly cheering for the 72 - year - old Imme , a master ’s marathon champion .
On many other weekends , they visit some of their 16 grandchildren .
During the holiday season the Dysons routinely attend five parties a week , cocktail - soiree sprints at which guests tend to find him open - minded and shy : when friends ’ wives give him a hug , he blushes .
One of Dyson ’s daughters , the Internet vizier Esther Dyson , says her father raised her without a television so she would read more , and has always been “ just as interested in talking to ” the latest graduate student to make the pilgrimage to Princeton “ as he is the famous person at the next table . ”
Oliver Sacks says that Dyson has “ a genius for friendship . ”
But the truth is that Dyson is an elusive particle .
To Edward Witten it is clear that Dyson has little use for string theory , the cutting - edge “ theory of everything ” that links quantum mechanics and relativity in an effort to describe no less than the nature of all things .
Even so , Witten admits that there is a fever - dream quality to his conversations with Dyson : “ I do n’t always know what he disagrees with entirely .
His attitudes are complicated .
There are many layers . ”
Other people can be similarly intrigued and baffled .
When I began spending time with Dyson and asked who his close friends are , the only name he mentioned was John McPhee ’s , which surprised McPhee since he said he does n’t often speak with Dyson even though McPhee teaches nearby at Princeton University .
All six of Dyson ’s children describe him as a loving , intensely devoted father and yet also suggest that this is a parent with , in the words of his son , George , core parts of him that have always seemed “ remote . ”
William Press said he finds
Dyson to be both a “ deep ” and “ magnificently laudable person ” and also mysterious and inscrutable , a man with contrarian opinions that Press suspects may be motivated by “ a darker side he ’s determined the world is n’t going to see . ”
When I asked Sacks what he thought about all this , he said that “ a favorite word of Freeman ’s about doing science and being creative is the word ‘ subversive . ’
He feels it ’s rather important not only to be not orthodox , but to be subversive , and he ’s done that all his life . ”
Dyson says it ’s only principle that leads him to question global warming : “ According to the global - warming people , I say what I say because I ’m paid by the oil industry .
Of course I ’m not , but that ’s part of their rhetoric .
If you doubt it , you ’re a bad person , a tool of the oil or coal industry . ”
Global warming , he added , “ has become a party line . ”
What may trouble Dyson most about climate change are the experts .
Experts are , he thinks , too often crippled by the conventional wisdom they create , leading to the belief that “ they know it all . ”
The men he most admires tend to be what he calls “ amateurs , ” inventive spirits of uncredentialed brilliance like Bernhard Schmidt , an eccentric one - armed alcoholic telescope - lens designer ; Milton Humason , a janitor at Mount Wilson Observatory in California whose native scientific aptitude was such that he was promoted to staff astronomer ; and especially Darwin , who , Dyson says , “ was really an amateur and beat the professionals at their own game . ”
It ’s a point of pride with Dyson that in 1951 he became a member of the physics faculty at Cornell and then , two years later , moved on to the Institute for Advanced Study , where he became an influential man , a pragmatist providing solutions to the military and Congress , and also the 2000 winner of the $ 1 million Templeton Prize for broadening the understanding of science and religion , an award previously given to Mother Teresa and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn — all without ever earning a Ph.D. Dyson may , in fact , be the ultimate outsider - insider , “ the world ’s most civil heretic , ” as the classical composer Paul Moravec , the artistic consultant at the institute , says of him .
Climate - change specialists often speak of global warming as a matter of moral conscience .
Dyson says he thinks they sound presumptuous .
As he warned that day four years ago at Boston University , the history of science is filled with those “ who make confident predictions about the future and end up believing their predictions , ” and he cites examples of things people anticipated to the point of terrified certainty that never actually occurred , ranging from hellfire , to Hitler ’s atomic bomb , to the Y2 K millennium bug .
“ It ’s always possible Hansen could turn out to be right , ” he says of the climate scientist .
“ If what he says were obviously wrong , he would n’t have achieved what he has .
But Hansen has turned his science into ideology .
He ’s a very persuasive fellow and has the air of knowing everything .
He has all the credentials .
I have none .
I do n’t have a Ph.D.
He ’s published hundreds of papers on climate .
I have n’t .
By the public standard he ’s qualified to talk and I ’m not .
But I do because I think I ’m right .
I think I have a broad view of the subject , which Hansen does not .
I think it ’s true my career does n’t depend on it , whereas his does .
I never claim to be an expert on climate .
I think it ’s more a matter of judgement than knowledge . ”

Reached by telephone , Hansen sounds annoyed as he says , “ There are bigger fish to fry than Freeman Dyson , ” who “ does n’t know what he ’s talking about . ”
In an e-mail message , he adds that his own concern about global warming is not based only on models , and that while he respects the “ open- mindedness ” of Dyson , “ if he is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet , then he should first do his homework — which he obviously has not done on global warming . ”

Obama is keeping his eye on the prize – the Nobel Prize , that is , as a reward for brokering a Middle East " peace " deal .
Unfortunately , he ’s doing it on the backs of the Palestinian people – and the rest of us , as well .
The news out of the negotiations with the Israelis is that Bibi gets everything , and Obama gets to make an announcement that the perpetually stalled talks with the Palestinians will resume .
By " everything , " I mean to include what the Guardian describes as " a partial freeze " on settlement construction – an oxymoron that could only exist in the context of an agreement between Israel and the US .
But is n’t that what the " special relationship " is all about ?
Love , as Ayn Rand put it , is exception - making – and I certainly can’t imagine the US capitulating so quickly and completely as it has in this instance .
Quite aside from the settlements , however , the Obama - ites really gave away the store when they agreed to " adopt a much tougher line with Iran over its alleged nuclear program . "
What this means , more precisely , is that the bar for judging whether Iran is building useable nukes is going to be considerably lowered : get ready for a slew of " intelligence " reports claiming they ’re on the verge of nuking Tel Aviv .
With Congress getting ready to impose strict economic sanctions on Iranian energy exports , the stage is set for a military strike .
That a US President has agreed to go to war in exchange for a Nobel Peace Prize is an event that could only occur in Obama - world – which is apparently situated somewhere very close to Bizarro World .
The announcement of this " breakthrough , " as the Guardian calls it , is slated for the last week of September – and you can count on the war drums to start beating around the same time .
It ’ll be a long , drawn out process , however , of fake " negotiations , " phony intelligence reports , and diplomatic arm - twisting at the UN , before the ever - cautious Obama gets up the nerve to actually pull this on his ostensibly liberal supporters , and their patience with Obama ’s wars is likely to run out long before then .
On the Afghan front , the news is grim : a failed election fraught with fraud , a huge bombing in Kandahar that underscores the weakness of the American position , and growing voices of opposition being raised on the home front .
As conservatives tentatively and hesitantly reassess the interventionism - run - amok of the Bush years , and liberals begin to wake from their dreams of a perfectly " progressive " president , the outlines of a new anti-interventionist coalition are taking shape .
Suddenly Afghanistan is in the news , and commentators on the right as well as the left are taking note .
Tony Blankley , former chief aide to Newt Gingrich and editor of the Washington Times , joins Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuval and Pat Buchanan in comparing Obama to LBJ – a chief executive with an ambitious liberal domestic program dragged down by his commitment to a losing war .
Citing LBJ ’s 1964 taped phone conversations with McGeorge Bundy and Senator Richard Russell , Blankley shows that the President knew he was pushing America into a quagmire in Vietnam : " I do n’t think it ’s worth fighting for , " averred Johnson to Bundy .
" What the hell is Vietnam worth to me ?
What is it worth to the country ? "
Americans began asking the same questions a decade or so later , but by then it was too late – hundreds of thousands had already died , and with them the national honor .
That same day , President Johnson spoke with Senator Russell , a friend and confidante , asking his advice on the Vietnam matter .
Russell told him " I ’d get out : it is n’t important a damn bit . "
Yes , but the President was worried : " The Republicans are going to make a political issue out of it , " he said .
" Nixon , Rockefeller and Goldwater all ( are ) saying let ’s move ( and ) let ’s go into the North . …
They ’d impeach a president … that would run out .
Would n’t they ? "
Against his better judgment , Johnson escalated the Vietnam war , pushing through the Tonkin Gulf resolution , and publicly declaring that it was a war of necessity – a war we could and would win .
We know , now , what he really believed : but politics trumped both reason and morality – and , although Blankley avers LBJ was " no monster , " I beg to differ .
To have gone ahead with such a momentous decision based on a purely political calculation is nothing less than monstrous .
There ’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that one of the most corrupt and ruthless presidents in American history has gone on to his singularly just reward .
The subversive question Blankley raises is : does Obama risk a similar fate ?
" Today President Barack Obama is on the cusp of a fateful policy decision .
He has argued consistently that the war in Afghanistan is necessary to deny al - Qaida a base of terrorist operations and to stop the Taliban insurrection from destabilizing nuclear Pakistan .
But serious doubts are being raised by many policy experts and an emerging majority of the American and British publics as to whether we have a strategy and the materiel to succeed .
Even the optimists believe that a successful counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ( and needed as much in Pakistan ) will require several years of sustained commitment . "
Even then , avers Blankley , it may not be possible — the implication being that the President surely knows this .
He also no doubt knows his base will have a hard time following him into the wilds of Waziristan .
Blankley avers Republican support for the war will be muted and even tending toward reversal on account of partisan considerations .
" Thus , " he writes , " President Obama has a hard decision to make " : this is a reference to the review of Afghan military strategy scheduled to take place shortly .
Come September , the Middle East will be a major focus of the administration ’s concern , and it promises to be historic .
Whether or not it turns out to be a historic tragedy remains to be seen .
As Blankley puts it :
" In this already politically difficult summer of 2009 , President Obama must bring a higher level of intellectual integrity and moral courage to his go / no - go war decision than Lyndon Johnson was capable of 45 years ago .
Notwithstanding his prior and current commitment to prosecute the war in Afghanistan — and notwithstanding the ambiguous political effect of his decision — he owes it to both himself and the many young service members who soon may be shipping out to make a new , cold calculation of whether he believes that he has a reasonable chance of successfully leading us in this new stage of the war .
I do n’t envy him his job at the moment . "
The Democrats of today are even more fearful of Republican criticism of liberal " appeasers " than they were in LBJ ’s time .
Having become the antiwar party of the 1970s , with the triumph of McGovernism and the secession of the Scoop Jackson neocons , they have been cowering ever since , scared to death that the " kill ‘ em- all - and - sort - it- out - later " wing of the GOP will go after them hammer and tongs .
The result has been the promiscuous interventionism of the Clinton era , and , more recently , the rise of the " national security Democrats " — a school of foreign policy and military analysts dedicated to proving that Democrats can be just as bloodthirsty as their partisan opponents , albeit in a " pragmatic " and impeccably PC way .
Gathered around the Center for a New American Strategy and the Center for American Progress , which have supplied the Obama administration with civilian Pentagon officials dedicated to pursuing a " smart " strategy in Afghanistan , these reincarnations of " the best and the brightest " may yet convince Obama that he can damn the torpedoes and go full speed ahead .
Who , after all , is there to stop them ?
The " progressives " are too busy smearing the " tea - baggers " as " terrorists " to bother with the impending disaster – and , besides that , they could use a " good war " to divert attention away from the snowballing domestic failures of this administration , and their own apparent powerlessness in its inner councils .
As for the conservatives – well , we ’ll see .
Blankley is an unusually thoughtful example of the species , and I hardly expect Glenn Beck and his clueless cohorts to suddenly join Cindy Sheehan in opposing Obama ’s war .
No doubt the partisan instincts of a good number of rank - and - file conservatives will kick in , as the more intellectually precocious among them begin to wake up to the domestic uses of war as Obama pursues his bid to vastly expand the power of government on the home front .
Yet the neoconservative leadership of that once proud movement is dedicated to militarism as a high principle .
Slaughter is their religion .
What is going to be fascinating to watch is how many big - time liberals are going to jump on Obama ’s war - wagon and go along for the whole ride .
Already I ’ve seen a few references on the Huffington Post to " Obama ’s Vietnam " – even if one was only a link to a New York Times piece , and the site has carried plenty of pro-war material .
( For " balance , " no doubt : mass murder is debatable on the HuffPuff , while the health care issue is not . )
In any case , Blankley ’s conception of Obama facing a momentous decision needs to be put in its full context : the President is n’t deciding between war and peace .
He and his foreign policy advisors are merely debating which war to fight first , with the more pro-Israel faction voting for a strike against Iran , and the more pragmatic types wanting to finish the job in Kabul and environs before tackling Tehran .
This is a repetition of rather recent history , when the neocons in the Bush administration , such as Paul Wolfowitz , argued that an invasion of Iraq had to be our first response to 9/11 , while others argued for taking on the Taliban .
I suspect the latter types will win out , just as they did during the Bush years .
Whether this gives the antiwar movement time and the chance to attract enough support from both sides of the political spectrum to make an attack on Iran impossible is a tantalizing — but still highly speculative — question .
What is certain , however , is that by the time the Obama - ites get around to fulfilling their pledge to Netanyahu to take on Iran , Americans – left , right , and center – will be thoroughly war - sick , if not thoroughly sick of Obama .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
We are a little less than $ 5,000 short of meeting our fundraising goal for the summer season – and was n’t that one hairy ride ?
Good lord , talk about feeling the effects of the recession !
It ’s amazing we ’ve gotten this far , but we ’ve got just a bit further to go – so , c’mon , you guys ( and gals ) : put us over the top !
Antiwar.com does an essential job , one that no one else does : we keep track of the War Party – it ’s schemes and machinations , its lies and the liars who repeat them , its decisive influence on our government and its hold over " mainstream " politicians .
It ’s quite a task , you ’ll have to admit – but we ca n’t do it without you .
The danger of Antiwar.com folding has passed , thank the gods – but a deficit of five - thousand bucks will mean that our writers – the first to have their pay cut – will suffer .
That includes me , by the way .
The copyeditors , the free - lancers , the regular columnists – and yours truly : even a small deficit means cuts are necessary .
That ’s because we run such a tight ship .
Every penny is accounted for , and pre-budgeted .
A loss of a couple thousand – and out comes the knife .
So please help – after all , I do n’t really deserve a salary cut , do I ?
No matter how fly or flashy modern scanners become , there 's no getting away from their page - by - page assembly line style of operation .
Or so we thought .
The Ishikawa Komuro Lab at Tokyo University has demonstrated a prototype scanner capable of recording the contents of pages as they turn .
Using a laser range projector to estimate page geometry , the camera adjusts for light and movement distortion as necessary and retains faithful copies of the original .
At present it 's more a proof of concept for the underlying vision processing unit than a commercial venture , but all it needs is one major manufacturer to pick it up and the paperless revolution can finally get started in earnest .

" . . . and I shambled after as I 've been doing all my life after people who interest me , because the only people for me are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be saved , desirous of everything at the same time , the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes ' Awww !

In the window I smelled all the food of San Francisco .
There were seafood places out there where the buns were hot , and the baskets were good enough to eat too ; where the menus themselves were soft with foody esculence as though dipped in hot broths roasted dry and good enough to eat too .
Just show me the bluefish spangle on a seafood menu , and I 'd eat it ; let me smell the butter and lobster claws .
There were places where hamburgers sizzled on grills and the coffee was only a nickel .
And oh , that pan fried chow mein flavored air that blew into my room from Chinatown , vying with the spaghetti sauces of North Beach , the soft - shell crab of Fisherman 's Wharf - nay , the ribs of Fillmore turning on spits !
Throw in the Market street chili beans , red - hot , and french - fried potatoes of the Embarcadero wino night , and steamed clams from Sausalito across the bay , and that 's ah - dream of San Francisco .
Add fog , hunger making , raw fog , and the throb of neons in the soft night , the clack of high heeled beauties , white doves in a Chinese grocery window .
Great beautiful clouds floated overhead , valley clouds that made you feel the vastness of old tumbledown holy America from mouth to mouth and tip to tip .
' You have absolutely no regard for anybody but yourself and your damned kicks .
All you think about is what 's hanging between your legs and how much money or fun you can get out of people and then you just throw them aside .
Not only that but you 're silly about it .
It never occurs to you that life is serious and there are people trying to make something decent out of it instead of just goofing all the time . '
Every one of these things I said was a knife at myself .
Everything I had ever secretly held against my brother was coming out : how ugly I was and what filth I was discovering in the depths of my own impure psychologies .

Exclusive footage obtained by the Guardian of ballot papers pre-marked for Hamid Karzai that were seized by monitors .
The ballots appear to be stamped with the monitors ' seal and ready to cast .
The monitors filmed then destroyed the papers to stop them being used
The shaky footage shows two election monitors inspecting a book of 100 ballot papers that are still stitched together , as they were intended to arrive at the polling station in rural Afghanistan .
But something is wrong ; instead of being pristine , ready for the voter to make his or her mark , each paper bears a large blue tick next to the name of one candidate : Hamid Karzai .
As the monitors flick through the pad , the back of the ballots clearly show the authorisation stamp of election monitors , validating them as votes ready to be put in the ballot box and counted .
" We found it the day after the elections , " one of the monitors in the footage told me .
" They were trying to put it in one of the [ ballot ] boxes but did n't have time , so we took it home and filmed it .
If we had given it back to the election committee they would have used it again , so we burned it , but filmed it to protect ourselves if they come and threaten us . "
The video footage is just part of a picture of widespread fraud in the Afghan election uncovered by the Guardian .
On Thursday , President Karzai told a news conference : " I believe firmly , firmly in the integrity of the election and the integrity of the Afghan people , and the integrity of the government in that process . "
But evidence given by a number of officials and voters tells a very different story , one in which the selling of votes to presidential candidates was common and the idea of the election being fair was laughable .
I met a different official outside a Kabul juice bar , where he sat on the kerb with a look of defeat on his face , clutching a glass of squeezed pomegranate and wrapped by the blue fumes of kebab stalls and passing cars .
He showed me a series of photographs taken inside a brown cardboard voting booth in a village in Paktiya province of Afghanistan .
One shows a man marking a big pile of ballot papers in the name of Hamid Karzai .
Another shows a pile of election ID cards spread in front of an unidentified man wearing black shoes .
" This man brought 120 cards and he used each of them to vote three times , " said the official .
He had intended to hand his photographs to his superiors , he said , but as election day unfolded it became obvious that his superiors were themselves taking part in the fraud .
" I thought I would give the pictures to the election committee .
But they were all working for Karzai . "
Fearing he had been spotted taking the pictures , he fled to Kabul .
" Everyone was cheating in my polling station .
Only 10 % voted , but they registered 100 % turnout .
One man brought five books of ballots , each containing 100 votes , and stuffed them in the boxes after the elections were over . "
The election official came from the district of Ahmad Aba in Paktiya , an area of dusty hills framed by high , ragged mountains and typical Afghan hamlets with mud-walled compounds , cornfields and orchards .
I sat there with half a dozen men on an embankment in the shadow of willow and apple trees .
They were waiting for the Ramadan fast to pass , fumbling with their plastic prayer beads .
Boys sat in a bigger circle behind the men and behind them shoes , a prosthetic leg and flip - flops were stacked .
Haggling
As the men relaxed and smilingly described the election day , it became clear that what would constitute large - scale fraud in western context meant little more to them than the usual haggling over chicken or vegetables in a market .
" Election day was very good and very peaceful here , " said one villager .
" The security was very good .
It was a like a feast day . "
" Personally on polling day I put in 10 ballots , " said another .
" I took my voting card and the cards of the women in my family and went to the polling station .
No one said anything to me .
All the women 's votes were cast in this way . "
Behind the embankment , the women and girls stood in a stream , washing clothes .
Another three were scrubbing the metal gate of a nearby compound , preparing for the end of Ramadan .
A man with a shiny black turban joined the circle .
Told what we were discussing , he laughed .
" On polling day the people who did the cheating were the officials , " he said .
" They worked for the candidates . "
His family had voted , he said , but the women had n't gone to the polling station .
Their ballots were sold to the candidates ' representatives .
" Only four old women cast their votes . "
The vote had come down to a battle of budgets , with agents for both Karzai and his rival , Abdullah Abdullah , giving money in exchange for votes .
" The big tribal elders took lots of money from Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah .
They were supposed to distribute it , but they did n't give much to us , only 1,000 Afghani ( $ 20 ) , or a mobile phone card .
The elders took all the money . "
The black turbaned man squinted mischievously .
" Election day was a good day , " he said .
" We hope there is election every year . "
The men laughed .
In a nearby hamlet I met a fresh - faced election monitor who said he was 25 but looked younger .
We squatted on the edge of a dusty field while he described how the fraud had worked in his village .
" It was all cheating on election day , " he said .
" Each candidate had his men cheating for him in the polling station and they all knew the others were cheating .
Even I cheated , " he said .
" I did n't want to , but when I saw everyone cheating , I put 20 ballots in for Ashraf Ghani [ a former finance minister ] , and then I called all my friends in other villages and we collected more ballots for him .
" In the beginning I thought of selling my 20 cards to Karzai or Abdullah , but then I said no , they have enough votes . "
He showed me three identical voting cards with his name and picture .
" It was so easy to get those , " he said .
" Karzai and Abdullah had their men in the polling station , but there was no one for [ Ghani ] , so we cheated for him .
He is a very educated man and with good strategy for Afghanistan .
Also we are all from his tribe in this area .
I tried to put my extra ballots in our polling station , but I had some enemies who tried to take my picture so I went to another polling station and no one asked to ink my finger or anything , they just said bring cards and put them in the box .
It was a very happy day .
" Karzai 's men were paying 1,000 Afghani per family and Abdullah 's were paying 1,500 Afghani .
But many people took money from Abdullah and voted for Karzai anyway . "
The election monitor insisted it was a " democratic " area , meaning only that they were not hostile to government .
They were educated and many worked in the government , but they had also worked in all previous governments .
Like many differences in Afghanistan , the cheating had run along ethnic lines .
In the villages , where people were predominantly Pashtun , they had generally cheated for Karzai , but in the provincial capital , Gardez , the mostly Tajik people had cheated for Abdullah Abdullah .
Violations
I drove into Gardez to meet a third election monitor .
Shots rang out in the distance as we talked .
The Taliban and Afghan security forces were fighting on the outskirts , but in the market life was normal .
Street sellers shouted and trucks honked .
" I was offered $ 2,500 by Abdullah 's team to work for them on election day , but I did n't , " he said , describing a range of violations , from police ferrying voters so they could vote Karzai , to officials stuffing hundreds of ballots .
At Karzai's election headquarters in Gardez , he saw the head of a group of Pashtun tribes who he knew had taken money from Karzai 's people .
The village elders each took between $ 8,000 and $ 10,000 , he said .
" The election committee workers were very weak , so the representatives of each candidate took their ' own ' boxes and started counting them . "
There was a commotion , and a green police truck pulled up , parading the spoils of a rare victory : the dusty , bloody bodies of two dead Talibs .
We stood and watched as soldiers posed in front of them , their colleagues snapping pictures with mobile phones .
A crowd gathered , and an Afghan officer in wraparound sunglasses began an impromptu victory speech .
We left them , and drove back to Kabul .
Last week TorrentFreak reported that the Canadian Pirate Party had established its own BitTorrent tracker .
The Pirates hope to show that BitTorrent is not a threat , but a great tool for artists to promote their work .
Record label Thorny Bleeder agrees and is now offering free music via the tracker .
Last week the fledgling Canadian Pirate Party launched its very own BitTorrent tracker to show how this great technology can empower artists to get their material heard by a wider audience .
“ We ’re starting a BitTorrent tracker to show artists how to properly use P2P technology in order to gain access to a cheap and efficient marketing and distribution network , ” Pirate Party spokesman Jake Daynes explained to TorrentFreak .
Just a couple of days later and already Canadian record label Thorny Bleeder Records is showing its support for the party and its new RivetTracker - based distribution system .
Thorny Bleeder Records is an independent record label and the fruits of a partnership between Art of Dying ’s Jonny Hetherington and Greg Bradley along with industry veteran Brian Thompson .
They aim to offer artists new options in today ’s music business .
“ As a show of support for the Pirate Party of Canada , Thorny Bleeder Records are proud to announce that our sixteen track , multi-artist Get Thorny compilation is now available for free on their website , ” announced the label .
TorrentFreak caught up with Brian Thompson to learn more about their decision to embrace the Pirate Party and their tracker .
“ Thorny Bleeder Records strongly believes in the culture of file sharing as a benefit to an artist ’s development and to the growth of their fan base , ” Brian told Torrent Freak .
“ It ’s become increasingly difficult and expensive to have a band ’s single added to a radio station ’s playlist , so the Internet has quickly become the next best thing for new music discovery . ”
“ As a an artist and a record label , your number one goal is to be heard by as many people as possible .
BitTorrent provides the perfect distribution for music discovery to occur , it ’s today ’s version of the record store listening post .
Pirate Party ’s new BitTorrent tracker provides us with the perfect avenue to expose our artists to an entire new audience that would otherwise be unaccessible , ” he added .
Brian told us that Thorny Bleeder also supports the Pirate Party in their fight for copyright reform .
“ The world has changed dramatically since these laws were introduced eons ago and it makes no sense to continue adhering to these old laws that no longer support creativity and distribution in the digital reality of today and tomorrow , ” he added .
The compilation ‘ Get Thorny ’ can be downloaded here .
how far will cyborg technology really go ?
Brain - machine interfaces are developing at a rapid pace .
But do n't expect to order implants on demand anytime soon .
In the sci - fi realm , cyborgs are the results of a military experiment or products of a society where being only human just is n’t enough .
In the real world , the story of the first cyborgs is rather grim .
The vast majority are n’t people trying to enhance themselves but victims of an accident or a stroke , no longer able to communicate or do anything on their own .
So to help these patients , researchers developed a package of software and hardware called BrainGate that allows a tiny brain implant to control computers by thought , restoring a sense of mobility to those who need it .
To talk , move wheelchairs , or use another tool able to decode their commands , patients think of the motions they want to do and their implants convert the thought into a digital signal .
Over time , the patients get used to their new abilities , manipulating their devices like new appendages .
But since plugging a computer chip into a brain is pretty risky , it was limited to a small patient group for testing and observation .
So far , the tests are going so well that a new wave of BrainGate devices has been greenlit for a clinical study and if this study goes as well as expected , the technology may well be on its way to a hospital near you .
For the next ten years or so , the technology is very likely to remain a treatment .
If the devices will be confirmed as safe and reliable by larger studies and real world data , they might quickly find their way into the military .
But the big question is whether normal , healthy people would want to undergo brain surgery to work with all their household electronics on a whim .
Let ’s be clear that this procedure is very invasive and the more electronics we ’ll want to adopt into our bodies , the more invasive and risky the required surgeries will have to be .
To be a cyborg similar to those described in sci- fi movies and novels would be very extensive and extreme process , a process that would probably deter anyone who does n’t have to endure it for very good reasons .
As nifty as it ’d be to turn the TV on with a glance , I would have to question the value of this ability considering what had to be done to make it happen .
That said , when doctors can use new , less invasive techniques to merge us with machines and the required procedures will be safer and cheaper , we might see the real dawn of the cyborgs .
Until then , it seems that the technology is likely to be limited to extreme medical cases and small scale military experiments .

In a cloud of cold gases ( left ) entropy can be reduced ( right ) by focusing a laser that compresses one component ( blue ) without affecting the other ( red ) .
Rather than heating up the blue component , some of the disorder in the squeezed gas moves to the surrounding gas cloud .
Credit : J. Catani et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 , 140401 ( 2009 )
Physicists are continually reaching new lows as they reduce the temperatures of samples in their laboratories .
But even nano - kelvins are not low enough to overcome the entropy ( a measure of the disorder in a system ) that stands between them and the discovery of exotic states of ultra-cold matter .
Now physicists at two Italian universities have developed a technique that siphons entropy out of a collection of atoms in much the same way that a kitchen refrigerator removes heat from the food stored inside .
The new method is described in Physical Review Letters and highlighted in the September 28 issue of Physics .
The system that Jacopo Catani ( University of Florence ) and colleagues assembled begins with a cloud of potassium and rubidium atoms held in a magnetic trap .
They selected a laser with a wavelength of light that interacted with the potassium atoms , but had little effect on the rubidium atoms .
They then compressed the potassium atom cloud by focusing the laser to a point in the trap .
Compressing a gas usually increases its temperature , but the surrounding rubidium kept things in check , allowing the researchers to hold the temperature roughly constant as entropy was shifted from the potassium to the rubidium atoms .
The novel technique should work with other combinations of atoms as well , offering researchers a new tool to aid them in their pursuit of physics at ultra-low temperatures and entropies .

Recently given an advance copy of the official 2008 subway passenger counts , I found myself wondering -- what would it take in terms of auto facilities to replace the morning rush hour carrying capacity of the NYC subway ?
This is an important question because the cost ( be it financial , environmental , etc ) of building , operating , and maintaining a transportation facility is generally determined by the maximum capacity it is expected to provide .
To avoid ruining any surprises , all calculations here are derived from the publicly available 2007 Hub Bound Report , and implemented in this spreadsheet .
The " hub " here is Manhattan below 60th Street -- New York City 's official CBD .
Just to get warmed up , chew on this -- from 8:00 AM to 8:59 AM on an average Fall day in 2007 the NYC Subway carried 388,802 passengers into the CBD on 370 trains over 22 tracks .
In other words , a train carrying 1,050 people crossed into the CBD every 6 seconds .
Breathtaking if you ask me .
Over this same period , the average number of passengers in a vehicle crossing any of the East River crossings was 1.20 .
This means that , lacking the subway , we would need to move 324,000 additional vehicles into the CBD ( never mind where they would all park ) .
What does it take to move that many additional vehicles ?
Well , it depends .
Different auto facilities in the city appear to have different capacities ( as expressed in vehicles per hour per lane ) :
Facility Inbound Lanes Max Hourly Inbound Traffic Veh / Lane / Hr Lanes Needed Queens Midtown Tunnel 2 3,882 1,941 167 FDR
Drive 3 5,425 1,808 179 Brooklyn Battery Tunnel 2 3,017 1,509 215 Brooklyn Bridge 3 4,262 1,421 228 West Side Highway 4 4,825 1,206 269 2nd Ave 6 4,739 790 410 5th Avenue 5 1,712 342 946
At best , it would take 167 inbound lanes , or 84 copies of the Queens Midtown Tunnel , to carry what the NYC Subway carries over 22 inbound tracks through 12 tunnels and 2 ( partial ) bridges .
At worst , 200 new copies of 5th Avenue .
Somewhere in the middle would be 67 West Side Highways or 76 Brooklyn Bridges .
And this neglects the Long Island Railroad , Metro North , NJ Transit , and PATH systems entirely .
Of course , at 325 square feet per parking space , all these cars would need over 3.8 square miles of space to park , about 3 times the size of Central Park .
At that point , who would want to go to Manhattan anyway ?
Without the NYC Subway , I 'm pretty sure this is what it would look like if we provided for to everyone commute by car :
Update : people seem to be taking this map quite seriously , whereas I would call it ... conceptual .
The blocks in Manhattan below 57th Street are the theoretical parking lots , whereas everything else is the additional roads , bridges , and tunnels we would need to move the cars .

What follows is a snippet from the most recent Martenson Report ( Housing and Wealth : Part II ) .
This is important information .
What I ’ve found and present below is that the Federal Reserve is not just supporting the housing market , it is the housing market .
Just as important as a person ’s desire to buy a home is their ability to gain access to mortgage funding .
The mortgage market is a gigantic beast with many moving parts , but it is pretty easy to understand from a high level .
The process works like this : A homeowner secures a mortgage from a bank or mortgage company .
Then the mortgage is sold off to another company , with the cash generated by that sale now available to lend to other potential homeowners .
Ultimately the mortgage may pass through several sets of hands but ultimately it lands with a terminal holder .
In that chain , the mortgage might get sold off several times , or perhaps sliced and diced by Wall Street wizards , but all that matters is that some company ( with cash ) is there at the end to buy the mortgage to keep the whole chain moving along .
Lately , the “ terminal buyers ” in that chain have increasingly ended up being the federal government ( through the GSEs ) and the Federal Reserve .
And not just by a little bit , but by a lot .
Here are the numbers :
So far in 2009 ( through August ) , a total of 3.2 million existing homes were sold for an average price of $ 217,000 , while 263,000 new homes were sold for an average price of $ 264,000 .
Taken together , and assuming that we live in a world where 10 % is the average down payment , we get this table :
That is , a total of ~ $ 686 billion in new mortgages were issued in 2009 ( through August ) .
Now let ’s look at how many Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS ) and agency debt obligations were accumulated by the Federal Reserve on its balance sheet over the same period of 2009 :
( Source )
It turns out that in 2009 ( again , through August ) , the Federal Reserve has bought $ 624 billion of MBS and a further $ 98 billion of Agency debt , for a total of $ 722 billion in money injection into the housing market through Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the FHLB .
In other words , the Federal Reserve alone bought $ 722 billion of mortgages and agency debt when only $ 686 billion in new mortgages were issued .
So , through August , the Fed bought more than 100 % of the entire supply of new ( purchase ) mortgages in 2009 .
That ’s not a free housing market ; that ’s a market bought , owned , and sustained by the Federal Reserve ’s willingness to print up three quarters of a trillion dollars out of thin air .
While the individual mortgages issued in 2009 may or may not be the exact same ones purchased by the Federal Reserve , that ’s immaterial .
All the mortgage issuers care about is that when they issue a mortgage , a purchaser with money exists somewhere down the line .
The chain needs a terminal buyer , and that buyer has become the Federal Reserve .
The impact of these purchases by the Federal Reserve is to both provide liquidity and to drive down the rate of interest for new mortgages .
By lowering both the long end of the Treasury curve ( which the Fed does by actively buying Treasuries ) and providing more than sufficient demand for MBS and agency paper , long - term interest rates come down .
Without the Fed ’s activities , it is a rock - solid certainty that mortgage interest rates would be higher than they are , and possibly a LOT higher .
What all this means is that when ( not if ) the Federal Reserve begins to try and unwind itself from all of the magnificent interventions of the past year , it must contend with the fact that it is the housing market .
Where the Fed is hoping that it can gently release the soft chubby fingers of the housing market , which will then toddle off under its own power , it will discover that it is actually carrying a helpless newborn .

US deploys Land Warrior prototypes in Afghanistan
A whole US Army brigade has been deployed in Afghanistan fully - equipped with computerized combat warfare equipment collectively known as Land Warrior .
Soldiers of the 5th Brigade , 2nd Infantry Division have been selected to field test the high - tech soldier system , consisting of a gaggle of geopositioning equipment , interactive realtime maps , radios and computers , all designed for the betterment of soldiers , especially in unfamiliar terrain .
Each Land Warrior unit weighs in at about eight pounds , and costs $ 48,000 .
The 5th Brigade is taking 895 Land Warrior packs to Afghanistan .
Land Warrior had been 15 years and billions of dollars into development when it was cancelled in 2006 .
However , as sunk costs go , money has already been spent developing certain units to use Land Warrior in Iraq , so it was deployed .
Apparently , that worked out well .
So now , the US Military is wanting to try it out again .
However , skeptics among the ranks say that it might have been really useful in an urban setting like Iraq , but it wo n’t do much good in the environments of Afghanistan .

September 9 , 2009 -- ESSF --
The communist movement was first established in Siam ( renamed Thailand in 1939 ) mostly in the Chinese ethnic migrant communities , then proliferated in the seemingly disparate surrounding regions in the north , northeast and south of the country .
Following a long , difficult period of transition , the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) , once an urban party , retreated to the jungle and engaged in armed struggle .
Its national expansion , during the 1970s , occurred while the kingdom was transformed into a US base for military intervention in the Vietnam War .
The party eventually saw its decline during the Sino - Indochinese conflict of 1978–9 and disappeared from sight in the mid-1980s .
In Siam the formation of the CPT was dependent upon its strategic geopolitical position , a social formation characterised by a three - way segmentation of the population ( town - province , centre - outskirts , migrant - Thai ) and also by the gap between a Chinese political orientation and the realities of life in Thailand .
Thailand also benefited from its geographical position and avoided the colonisation suffered by its neighbours .
By creating ties with Germany , who helped form its army and navigating a balance between the French and British imperial influences in the region , Thailand became a buffer zone between the possessions of the French in the east and Great Britain in the south and west .
The communist movement in Thailand , therefore , could not arise from a powerful popular tradition of anti-colonial resistance .
Instead , the movement had to confront the dominant class and authorities whose power had never been checked by colonialism or loss of independence .
These realities had significant consequences on the trajectory of sociopolitical struggles in Thailand and made the CPT unique within the greater political sphere in Southeast Asia .
The Thai peasantry was particularly difficult to organise for a number of reasons .
For one thing , ethnic divisions made the expansion and unification of sharp class conflicts in rural Siam difficult .
At the same time , in urban areas , workers ’ strikes were initially acts of Chinese immigrant workers who sometimes fought to defend their jobs against the hiring by employers of Thais .
The Chinese labour movement was often linked to the Kuomindang or to family clans .
Thus , the communist movement was confronted with the difficult task of organising such a divided population .
Revolution of 1932
In 1932 the political struggle took a new turn with the overthrow of the absolute monarchy and transition to a constitutional monarchy .
The People ’s Party was a direct player in the coup .
Though its membership was small , the party was supported by regiments in Bangkok as well as a large faction of urban dwellers , if not provincial populations or rural peoples .
The civilian left wing was led by Pridi Banomyong ( 1900 – 83 ) , an intellectual influenced by European non-Marxist liberal and socialist ideas .
A field officer and a commoner , Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena ( 1887–1947 ) , led the military group .
Through his support for individual freedom , social progress and a state - implemented economic plan , Pridi gained support from businessmen , the Chinese trade unions and the politicians of the provinces .
Soon , however , the politically progressive civilian wing of the People ’s Party was usurped by the military wing .
In 1935 the new army chief and defence minister , Plaek Phibun Songkram ( 1897 –1964 ) , known as Field Marshal Phibun , became prime minister and established a dictatorship .
From 1933 to 1937 the number of military men doubled and the military budget increased dramatically .
The army became a vector of industrialisation .
In the name of nationalism it invested in agriculture and transport and took control of Chinese enterprises .
A new law on nationality in 1939 forced minorities to “ become ” Thais by learning the language , changing their family names and sending their children to Thai schools .
The regime of Phibun imposed a martial law more severe than Siam had ever known in order to assimilate non-ethnic
Thais into this nationalistic vision .
A new alliance was established between sectors of the traditional bourgeoisie ( including Sino - Thais ) , the administration and the military .
But , under Phibun , some campaigned for the “ superiority ” of the “ Thai race ” and racist campaigns were directed against minorities .
First communist parties
The Chinese community established in Thailand had been precociously politicised by the impact of the 1911 and 1927 revolutions in China .
Thus , the communist movement first established itself among Chinese traders and workers , with the primary exception to this trend in the poor and densely populated region of the northeast , where Vietnamese communists played a significant role from the late 1920s .
The onset of communism in Thailand was not widespread .
A first small staff of half a dozen people was sent to the kingdom by the Chinese Communist Party in 1923 .
In 1926 the Committee of the Southern Seas , or Nanyang Party , was established in Southeast Asia .
In 1927 hundreds of young Chinese founded the Communist Youth of Siam ( CYS ) , linked to the Communist Party of Siam ( CPS ) , a precursor of the CPT .
A second organisation , the Thai branch of the Chinese Communist Party or the Chinese Communist Party of Thailand ( CCPT ) , may have existed , though the relationship between the CPS , CPT and the CCPT is not clear .
At the same time , there was a constant movement of militants from China and Vietnam who , alongside Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia , promoted the establishment of the Thai communist movement .
Ho Chi Minh ( alias Nguyen Ai Quoc ) went several times to the field as an envoy of the Comintern to help with the establishment of the CPS .
Organising the movement in Thailand was risky .
Chinese militants were arrested from 1921 to 1931 in Bangkok and in the north and anti-communist laws became more stringent .
In 1933 the propagation of communist doctrine became a crime against the state .
Repression was widespread and the CPS declined until it fragmented altogether around 1936 .
In the northeast , Vietnamese militants were either detained or deported and remaining Vietnamese militants returned to their country to reinforce their own anti-colonial battles .
The influence of the Indochinese Communist Party on Thai communists declined significantly .
Communist Party of Thailand 's beginnings , 1940 –1972
At the onset of World War II , Thailand , under the authority of General Phibun , allied itself with Japan , embracing much of Japan ’s fascistic ideology .
In 1941 Japanese troops invaded the country under the pretense of fighting British and French armies on the Thai borders .
The Thai government declared war on the Allied powers while joining the Axis , but Japanese forces quickly took on the role of conquerors , alienating the Thai population .
Two resistance movements organised against the Japanese occupation : the Volunteer Organisation for Armed Opposition to Japan created by the newly reestablished CPT and the underground Seri Thai ( Free Thai ) network , represented in exile by Pridi Banomyong and Seni Pramoj ( 1905 –97 ) , a former ambassador to the US .
Both movements were limited in their capacity to act against the occupation and there was effectively no cooperation between them .
Still , Thailand ’s occupation by Japan was an impetus for communists in Thailand legitimately to declare its first battle for national liberation .
The CPT ’s movement - building during the war was more influential than its military activities , which were limited essentially to gathering intelligence and some operations of armed propaganda .
Though initially the political situation was not amenable to popular resistance , the atmosphere eventually changed and the communist struggle flourished with the creation of welfare associations , an underground labour union , and the Anti-Japanese Federation .
The party was not able to contend with the Seri Thai movement in the aftermath of the war , but the immediate postwar period nonetheless constituted a very important political opportunity for the communists ’ struggle .
Members of the Seri Thai network returned from exile to negotiate peace with the Allied movement .
Seni Pramoj , Oxford - educated and a member of the royal family , became prime minister in 1945 .
The following year a constitution proposed by Pridi was adopted and the parliamentary regime was restored .
In order to avoid a Russian veto on the entry of Thailand into the United Nations , the Thai government abrogated the anti-communist law and authorised the CPT to act legally .
As armed struggle was no longer on the agenda , the CPT dissolved its military forces .
Then , instead of organising peasants in the countryside , the CPT called back its members to Bangkok , which shows how much it remained an urban party .
Leaders and militants of the party returned from China , including Udom Srisuwan , who became a well - known editorialist of the CPT and its primary theorist .
During the years following the war the influence of revolutionary ideas began to find its place among students such as Jit Phumisak ( 1930 –66 ) , whose essays and poems impressed many generations of militants and who was eventually killed by police .
The underground , episodic CPT newspaper , Mahachon ( the Masses ) , became a weekly publication .
The party reestablished itself in the capital and started the Bangkok Labor Federation as well as unions , associations for women and youth and associations of school and university students .
The CPT became politically involved at the parliamentary level when parliament member Prasert Sapsunthon publicly declared his affiliation .
In order to offer a common framework to the union organisations in which it was active , the CPT created the Association of United Workers of Thailand .
Moreover , the prestige of the party increased with the defeat of the Kuomintang in China and the party ’s influence developed within the Central Labor Union ( CLU ) , which joined the World Federation of Trade Unions ( WFTU ) in 1949 .
Even so , during these years , the Thai left was diverse .
Pridi Banomyong created the Southeast Asia League to affirm solidarity with the national liberation movements in the region .
The writings of European socialists were translated into Thai .
A progressive Buddhist current was developed and represented by the thinker Buddhadasa ; the possible relationship between Marxism and Buddhism was discussed .
The development of a legal , pluralist left was ultimately hindered by the chronic instability of the postwar parliamentary regime .
In 1947 Phibun instigated a coup d’état and took power .
He took a series of measures against the communist movement , unions and Sino Thai schools , ending the CPT ’s period of legality after less than two years .
Phibun established the Thai Labor Union ( renamed the Thai National Trade Union Confederation -- TNTUC -- in 1951 ) , reserved only for Thai nationals and serving as a mass base for the regime .
In 1952 , in the name of the Anti-Communist Act , the Central Labor Union was dissolved and its leaders were arrested .
From 1950 Bangkok aligned itself with the United States and became the first country in Asia to offer troops and material to the United Nations in Korea .
In return , Washington offered massive military assistance to the Thai regime .
Thus , the geopolitical situation of Thailand changed dramatically .
In the past , Siam , as a buffer between French and British colonies , remained at the margins of regional conflicts and avoided colonial conquest .
This time , the kingdom was on the front lines , in the direct service of imperialist military strategy .
The anti-communist and anti-Chinese repression worsened and arrests increased .
The democratic movements and the left were muzzled .
Pridi Banomyong returned to exile , this time permanently .
The influence of the Chinese Communist Party and the role of the Sino - Thai cadres in the CPT did not insure the “ spontaneous ” adoption of a Maoist orientation for the CPT .
During the 1920s when Chinese influence on Thai communists was taking hold , the Chinese party itself was not yet Maoist .
The relationship between the two parties was tenuous after the counterrevolution of 1927 and “ pro-Chinese ” during this period did not necessarily mean “ pro-Mao ” .
The CPT ’s Maoist orientation shaped only after the victory of the revolution of 1949 , and was not formalised until the Sino - Soviet conflict in the 1960s .
The movement toward rural armed struggle was difficult for the Thai party to make , as it necessitated a radical reorganisation of party forces that were culturally and sociologically removed from the peasantry .
The prestige and influence of Chinese Maoism helped move the CPT toward rural struggle , but the evolution of Thailand ’s political scenery itself played a significant role .
From the mid–1940s to the end of the 1970s , the country had only three democratic interludes of three years each punctuating three decades of military rule .
There were 18 coups d’état under one reign of King Bhumibol , Rama IX , who ascended the throne in 1946 .
The CPT held its second congress in early 1952 and was officially named the Communist Party of Thailand .
It was only during this period , the early 1950s , that the Chinese Communist Party of Thailand ( CCPT ) was formally dissolved .
According to some estimates , this organisation had about 4000 members and the CPT only 200 .
Some militants went back to China and others joined the Thai party .
This integration reinforced the “ Chinese ” influence on the direction of the organisation .
The congress also endorsed the “ rural turn ” of the CPT , without giving up the development of its urban activities .
In particular , it mobilised forces to participate in the worldwide peace movement , an issue important to Thailand .
Meanwhile , Thailand experienced a new relatively democratic interlude .
Numerous jailed Chinese leaders were freed .
Thailand ’s trade relationship with China improved .
Prominent figures on the left went to Beijing , such as Thep Jotinuchit , leader of the socialist opposition , and Klaew Norapati , general secretary of the Economist Party .
The Chinese government linked itself with Thai opposition parties .
Beijing targeted the role of the United States in Thailand and the party focused on anti-imperialism and nationalism more than revolution .
In 1954 Thailand and the Philippines joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation ( SEATO ) , whose purpose was to fend off communism in the region through alliances with the West and pro-Western nations .
In 1957 a new coup d’état brought General Sarit Thanarat to power and the following year his regime consolidated authoritarian rule .
A wave of arrests hit militants and prominent figures on the left .
In 1959 imports from China were prohibited and in 1960 Thai troops were sent to fight secretly in Laos on the side of US forces .
The third congress of the CPT in 1961 effectively marked the inception of armed struggle , though much preparation was necessary to ready the forces before battle began .
Cadres had to be sent in the countryside to establish bases .
Militants had to be trained ( outside Thailand ) in military as well as political fields .
The CPT had to get the support of the Chinese , Indochinese and other small neighbouring parties .
Political repression contributed much to the turn toward armed struggle .
Soon after the third congress , one of the leaders of the CPT , Ruam Wongphan , was captured by security forces and later executed .
Other members of the central committee , based underground in Bangkok , found refuge along the border or in China .
For the first time , the national leadership of the party , by and large , left the capital and never returned .
Throughout the 1960s Thailand was a Western stronghold of the counterrevolutionary security belt in East Asia .
The United States turned Thailand into an important operational base for Indochina .
For four years , the CPT avoided confrontations with the government , knowing that the conditions were not yet ideal for engaging in military operations .
However , counterrevolutionary actions on the part of the Thai state accelerated the CPT ’s decision to engage in an armed struggle even if conditions were not yet ideal .
The mass base was fragile , comprised of no more than a few thousand sympathisers and only a small number of villages , primarily in the northeast , where battles broke out in 1965 .
Under pressure from the government army , the party was forced to begin fighting while it was still badly prepared in most regions of the country .
The CPT targeted remote provinces of strategic importance .
In the mountainous north it recruited members of Hmong tribes who had been bombarded with napalm by the Thai army in 1968 and who were still alienated from the rest of Thailand .
Alliances with the hill tribes were made by offering services such as health , education and assistance to the poor and by attacking outside enemies such as the Thai army , the forestry companies and various gangs .
In the northeast Isan region the battle for socialism was led by the Samakee - kun ( Solidarity ) movement , which was influenced by Khrong Chandawong , a member of the Socialist Front and the Peace Committee of Thailand .
Khrong was arrested during the waves of state - led repression in 1958 and sentenced to death in 1961 .
The repression contributed to the radicalisation of northeastern resistance , though it also caused a great deal of problems for the party .
The mountains of the south were dense with forests and served as an important refuge for the CPT and its active guerilla forces .
Armed struggle took place in 1966 , alongside the Communist Party of Malaya ( CPM ) , which depended on bases in the Thailand side at the border after defeat by the British .
In this region the communist movement did not benefit from proximity with China or Indochina and developed more autonomously than in the other provinces .
Muslim resistance in the south was reorganised underground along the border and by the 1960s the regional resistance was at once Islamic and socialist in character .
From success to crisis : 1973 –1982
The CPT developed itself along the fault lines of Thai society .
The militants were devoted to serving the people ; the CPT participated in social protection more than fomenting revolution .
It protected the tribal communities or villages from outside threats such as armed forces , a corrupt administration and usurers .
It also offered services that the state did not , such as healthcare and education and consequently benefited from a moral debt of recognition .
The party acted in favour of social justice but without necessarily radicalising the social sphere itself .
The CPT ’s strategy is summarised in the maxim : “ The countryside encircles the town , the jungles lead the village ” .
The first part of this saying is common to all Maoist parties , although its application differs in different regions ( in China and Vietnam , armed forces were established following revolutionary struggle and mass uprising , which was not the case for Thailand ) .
The second term of the maxim reflected a characteristic particular to the CPT : in order to escape repression , the political and military cadres did not stay in the village , but the surrounding forest .
Cadres and party members left their homes , entered the jungle and secretly returned to work in the villages .
They worked in the jungle during the day and in the village at night .
This system of organisation would have significant consequences for the future of the CPT .
The whole CPT organisation , then , was reoriented in order to support the rural armed struggle up to the point that in the beginning of the 1970s there was no leadership structure in Bangkok responsible for activities in the capital as a whole .
There were networks , each of which linked to a different region , charged with helping the development of the guerilla forces by assuring communication , information , or collection of funds , clothing and medicines .
Comparatively , renouncing centralised leadership of the urban network was an uncommon move for a Maoist party .
Operating along the Indochinese borders and near China , the CPT benefited from important logistical , financial , military and food support from its neighbours .
It had diplomatic representation in Beijing and the backcountry of Yunnan .
It opened bases in Laos where there were hospitals , schools and training camps .
With the exception of Thailand ’s southern region , militants based in the jungle were armed , fed and cared for thanks to this foreign assistance .
The cadres of the party were often sent to train in China ; thus , ideological dependence on Beijing was coupled with a dangerous physical dependence .
A crucial decade
The political climate in the 1970s shifted in such a way that the CPT was able to coordinate its struggle at the national level .
A national crisis –- simultaneously political , social and moral –- broke out in Thailand with the overthrow of the military dictatorship in 1973 and the proliferation of radicalised student and peasant movements .
For the first time , revolutionary victory seemed possible .
Communist guerillas were active in Thailand , Burma and Malaysia , hoping for support from Beijing and Hanoi .
US officials expected to see the loss of continental Southeast Asia .
During this period large numbers of people and a plurality of organisations were engaged in a struggle against dictatorship and for democracy .
Students participated actively in the organisation of labour unions .
They also launched a campaign promoting and publicising the rights of peasants and contributed to the development of peasant associations , especially in the north where the new Federation of Peasants of Thailand became prominent .
Workers ’ strikes and peasant delegations increased in the capital .
The arrest of democratic militants who demanded the promulgation of the constitution stoked the fire in October 1973 .
The student movements and then the common urban people of the capital took to the streets .
Faced with repression , the huge demonstrations turned violent .
The king had no choice but to demand the exile of the dictators .
For the first time in the history of Thailand , a military dictatorship was defeated under pressure from the street .
Individually , militants of both the CPT and the Socialist Party of Thailand participated in the October 1973 struggle .
They built underground networks and had an increasing influence on above - ground organisations .
The CPT enjoyed a substantial amount of prestige among the students , who admired its tenacity and its devotion to the people , but who knew very little about the party itself .
In fact , as such , the CPT was not at the initiative of the 1973 upsurge and had little to offer in terms of orientation to the continuing mass struggles .
Some student groups , such as the Federation of Independent Students ( FIST ) , which were animating the movements , looked to the CPT but usually were not members .
The false unanimity present after the October 1973 uprising died down as a result of the dual impact of social struggle within the kingdom and the victory of communist forces in Indochina .
The royal family worried about the radicalisation of struggles and was concerned with the abolition of the monarchy in Laos , a neighbouring country .
Political repression increased in severity and popular struggle became more risky .
After several assassinations and attempted assassinations , many student and labour leaders from Bangkok fled to the jungle to join the underground partisans of the CPT .
Notable among these was Seksan Prasertkul , a prominent union and student leader .
On October 6 , 1976 police , military and anti-left wing paramilitary forces assembled at the gates of Thammasat University and opened fire on protesters in a massacre .
There were hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests ; the televised images of the massacre shook the entire country .
Just three years after the removal of the dictator in 1973 , the military took power again in October 1976 , shortly after the massacre .
For many , it destroyed hope for Thailand ’s democratic evolution .
Still , this was not the end of the left .
By the thousands , in order to avoid arrest or death , to pursue their struggle and obsessed by the desire to avenge friends massacred at Thammasat , students joined the guerilla forces , along with workers and peasants .
The People ’s Liberation Army of Thailand ( PLAT ) increased its forces dramatically .
In the beginning of 1979 , at its peak , it had 12,000 to 14,000 soldiers according to government estimates ; according to other estimates , there were 20,000 .
Guerilla zones existed in more than 40 provinces and the CPT had influence in thousands of villages with a total population of more than 3 million .
It was not only numbers that gave the CPT and PLAT strength .
The credibility of party leadership was reinforced by the coup .
Though the party had not necessarily drawn large numbers of members from protest movements in the past , guerilla zones became the only refuge for the urban and student activists who were now hunted by government forces .
Members of the mainstream left were also forced to go underground and join the movement , including the United Socialist Front ( USF ) and particularly the Socialist Party of Thailand ( SPT ) .
The mass arrival of young urban folks in the guerilla camps caused many logistical problems .
The integration of students educated into the urban democratic fight within more traditional village communities was difficult .
A few months after the coup d’état of October 6 , 1976 , the first conflict broke out within the camps in the southern province of Surat Thani ; however , such conflicts remained localised .
Still , the rallying to the CPT , to the PLAT and to the new United Front of prominent worker , peasant and student activists , and the growing propensity of the student movement for revolution , allowed for a considerable enlargement of the social base of the Thai communist movement .
Sino - Indochinese War
Between 1979 and 1980 the CPT lost a great deal of support from the outside .
Militants left the guerillas and returned to towns in large numbers , discreetly at first , then publicly , in response to a government offer of general amnesty .
In 1981 through 1982 the crisis of the Thai left became increasingly profound .
The contradictions that undermined the heart of the CPT became apparent with its fourth congress .
At that time , approximately half the guerillas had already left the jungle .
Extensive political debates within the Thai left called its legitimacy into question .
One cause of this decline and perhaps the most obvious , was the Sino - Indochinese crisis .
Political and then military disputes between the Vietnamese , Cambodian and Chinese regimes had serious repercussions for Thailand .
A flow of refugees from the three Indochinese countries caused confrontations within the movement and raised several ideological and political issues .
Tensions were particularly obvious between the CPT and the Vietnamese Communist Party ( VCP ) .
The VCP had proposed , since 1975 , a considerable increase of military assistance to the CPT , in order to take advantage of the US collapse in Indochina and to give a push to the revolutionary struggle in Thailand .
Such offers were reiterated until 1978 , but the CPT refused , believing that the Vietnamese party wanted to exert its own influence on the revolutionary movement in Thailand .
For Hanoi , the CPT ’s refusal reflected the will of Beijing to avoid an extension of revolutionary struggle in the region and demonstrated the political dependence of the CPT on China .
In this period , the CPT was obliged to choose between its past allies .
It maintained its alliance with Beijing and the Khmer Rouge and denounced Vietnam as an agent of social imperialism in Southeast Asia .
Pham Van Dong , Vietnamese prime minister , declared in 1978 that all assistance to the CPT was suspended .
In 1979 the CPT and CCPDF camps in Laos were closed and the Thai militants expelled .
Crises of allegiance
The Third Indochinese War , in which China briefly invaded Vietnam in response to Vietnam ’s occupation of Cambodia , accelerated the crisis of the party , which politically and logistically depended on the support of its neighbours .
The war also instigated a series of debates within the CPT , as the militants began to question the capacity of the party ’s leadership .
The brutal decline of the CPT and its guerilla forces after a period of such rapid growth was a result of the way in which the leadership of the party reacted to the regional conflicts between the Chinese , Vietnamese and Cambodian regimes .
The party came into crisis even before the government and the army inflicted heavy blows on the resistance .
It was not defeated by superior forces , but was weakened both by the loss of its Indochinese allies and by the evolution of Chinese diplomacy as it opened up to the West .
The CPT was also undermined by the advent of deep internal differences .
Because the party was unable to avoid a rupture with Vietnamese and Lao forces , some questioned whether the CPT ’s leadership was more responsive to the Thai people or to Chinese policymakers .
These questions arose when the Chinese leadership supported ASEAN and efforts were made for the constitution of an anti-Vietnamese front .
Suspicions were also raised by increasing diplomacy between China and the US and the improvement of relations between the Thai and Chinese governments .
The Voice of the Thai People , the radio station of the CPT that had been established in China , permanently ceased broadcasting a few days after the declaration announcing China ’s rupture with Hanoi and denounced Vietnam as a threat to Thailand .
The disappearance of the radio station was a blow to the Thai movement , as it had been the principal means of political communication between militants in Thailand .
The discontinuation of the station was perceived by the government as a pledge of good will from Beijing toward Bangkok .
Moreover , the leadership began to solicit the militants to prepare for resistance against a Vietnamese invasion of Thailand .
The Vietnamese invasion never occurred .
Slowly , the militant
Thai left started to get the measure of the tragedy faced by the Cambodian people under the Khmer Rouge .
In the northeast , many PLAT units experienced the bloody “ radicalism ” of their Cambodian comrades .
Moreover , some CPT members implemented a “ Polpotian ” policy by forcefully shifting many Thai villages to the Cambodian side of the border .
After the Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia , the Thai government army allied itself to the Khmer Rouge and turned Chinese arms against PLAT .
Many newer members of the party and of PLAT finally decided to leave the jungle , often citing reasons concerning lack of democratic decision - making practices .
The politburo of the CPT was often non-communicative and few political documents circulated within the party .
Rare “ directives ” , often obscurely signed “ centre ” , were written in terms so general that they were nearly impossible to discuss .
The recruitment of new members to the party was rigidly controlled .
The vertical orientation , partially a result of being underground , prohibited horizontal contacts and exchanges .
Critical documents and communications only reached the leaders , who often did not reply .
Isolated in the jungle , with little contact with the population , the students , who in their thousands joined the armed struggle in 1976 , were powerless .
They left , discouraged , one by one , group by group .
Some left very early , others left much later , such as Seksan Prasertkul , who reached Bangkok only in 1981 .
The absence of democracy within the CPT , PLAT and the Thai revolutionary movement in general was an essential factor in the crisis of the left .
The militants were faced with the alternative of keeping quiet or voting with their feet by returning to the towns or villages .
A first disagreement , concerning strategy within Thailand , broke out regarding the attention paid to urban work versus rural work .
The coup d’état of October 1976 and the resultant move to the jungle temporarily staved off this debate .
Later , the evolution of government policy opened a new space for democratic intervention in the towns .
The union movement began new activities .
Bangkok became again a political centre of concern .
A second disagreement emerged over the party ’s Maoist orientation .
Many felt that the Thai revolutionary movement did not have a clear line of action .
These debates confirmed the end of the Chinese model .
China had become the single point of reference for the Thai militants .
The ideological formation of the militants was based on chosen Maoist works .
Faith in the Chinese “ big brother ” was shaken by the violent struggles between factions which tore apart the CCP in the following years .
The Chinese leadership eventually attacked the heritage of Mao himself .
The experience was traumatising for the Thai militants .
Fourth congress of CPT
The crisis of the Communist Party of Thailand was already obvious when the fourth congress convened more than 20 years after the third .
Due to the precariousness of the military situation , the leadership of the party decided to convene three regional assemblies
At this particular moment , the CPT was losing the majority of its active forces and its prestige was declining .
A small majority opted for a reform of the orientation and the functioning of the party : the northeast , the new zones of the north and the organisation in Bangkok voted together against the north , the south and the central leadership .
On ideological issues the term “ semi- feudal ” gave way to “ semi- capitalist ” .
The traditional orientation was replaced by formulas balancing the strategic importance of the town and the countryside , of the armed struggle and the political struggle .
Such formulas were closer to those of the Vietnamese than the Chinese .
The word “ revisionist ” was withdrawn from the party vocabulary .
Analysis of the USSR became vague and the congress declared that it was ready to seek alliances with all “ neutral ” groups who were not too allied to Moscow or Beijing .
The party ’s Maoist orientation was further questioned .
The reformers gained ground at the last congress .
However , the votes did not express homogeneous lines but blocs of factions .
The aftermath of the congress was bitter for the reformers .
The new leadership remained de facto under the control of former dominant factions , and key zones of the reformers did not have representation in the central committee .
The official communiqués of the CPT played down the debates and changes .
The documents of the fourth congress were only officially published in 1986 .
The 1982 congress did not resolve the crisis .
A new series of eye - catching defections occurred , including among the party leadership .
Groups of guerilla forces negotiated en masse their surrender , especially in the northeast .
In certain regions of the south the military forces of the CPT resisted the crisis , but on the national level the guerillas disintegrated .
In 1986 the CPT leadership announced that it had reorganised and reinforced its relationship with international solidarity ; however , the party did not reappear on the political scene .
Difficult departure from the jungle
The 1980s marked the end of an era of party oriented revolutionary struggle .
Another era commenced which , on the contrary , was characterised by the disappearance of political parties with leftist roots .
Unlike in places such as the Philippines , the crisis of the CPT did not give way to a pluralist left , but to the disappearance of the political left .
This contrast could be understood in part by the new policy of counterinsurrection implemented in Thailand under the government of General Prem Tinsulanonda .
The government offered individual amnesty to CPT members and negotiated the grouped return of guerilla units into newly established villages .
This policy was a success because it came at the time when the CPT leadership could not offer any credible solution to its crisis .
Still , it does not completely explain the reasons for the collapse or the disintegration of the political left as a whole .
The militant struggle in the jungle collapsed for a number of reasons .
First , ideological confusion , disciplinary constraints and isolation of camps from one another made collective departure difficult .
More importantly , members of the party and the revolutionary army living in the jungle had depended on the central leadership for everything ( money , rice , ammunition and arms ) and splitting meant being without material means for survival .
Each member had to search for work or for his or her family for financial resources .
Priority was placed on professional and social reintegration .
Many resumed the education interrupted by the 1976 coup .
Under such conditions , it proved very difficult for the returnees from the jungle to maintain their newly formed organisations .
There were also generational and linguistic issues .
The generation gap was particularly profound .
The leadership was largely composed of cadres advanced in age , of Chinese origin and for whom Thai was a second language .
The assimilation of Sino - Thai children accelerated with the suspension of immigration in 1949 .
They went to Thai schools and fewer spoke the dialects of their parents or grandparents .
Living in China or in surrounding camps , the historical cadres of the CPT remained unaware of these developments .
Language created a political barrier for other reasons as well .
English was not used frequently , even by the students , as Thailand had not been colonised and there were very few Marxist works translated into Thai .
Very few people could read Marx or understand how Marxism was plural , encompassing various trends .
Continuing the struggle
Some students who returned from the underground movement took up activities in the parties of the traditional “ political establishment ” linked to industrial and banking sectors and defended sociopolitical reform .
Others turned to the Socialist Democratic Party , established legally after the SPT went underground .
The National Labor Party recruited some student and labour cadres returning from the jungle and hoped to be a permanent voice for the workers for the first time in the Thai political arena , which was historically reserved for the elite classes .
However , the majority of leftist militants felt that this new party would primarily serve to intervene in the union movement on behalf of various military factions .
Others returning from the jungle concentrated their energy on the publication of above - ground political magazines , with both information on current events and in - depth discussions related to the militant experience .
Study groups were formed with students who were often anxious to reflect on these experiences .
The crisis of the CPT paved the way to a vast ideological debate within the Thai left and provoked an effort at political reflection never witnessed before in Thailand .
Social work and the defence of democracy took on greater importance for militants desirous to engage in work for social change .
New associations of volunteer work were established and oriented towards slums , children ’s welfare and the rural population .
Various cooperatives appeared in the villages .
These associations began to coordinate their actions more systematically .
Still , in spite of a very precarious political situation in the kingdom , the era of revolutionary struggle ended , at least temporarily .

Two generations of activists : Wirat Angkhathawon and Seksan Prasertkul
Two short biographies of Thai revolutionaries illustrate the depth of the “ generation gap ” between the founding members of the CPT and the 1970s radicals .
Wirat Angkhathawon ( 1921 –1997 )
[ The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest , vol .
VII , pp. 3538-3539 . ]
The Kingdom of Thailand entered into a period of turmoil in 1973 when the military dictatorship was overthrown .
Wirat Angkhathawon , at the age of 42 , became a principal leader of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) and a distinctive representative of the militant post - World War II generation .
Wirat was born in 1921 in Bangkok to a family of Chinese origin from the town of Swatow , a port in the south of China .
Although relatively affluent , his family encountered financial difficulties due to his father ’s health problems .
After studying in a Chinese school , Wirat joined the communists and began working in a match factory in 1940 .
Subsequently , Wirat was sent to the south of Thailand , meeting his future wife , Somphon , from a Sino - Thai trading family from the southern province of Patthalung .
Somphon spent a short period in China for studies and became a member of the Communist Party in 1943 .
Wirat returned to Bangkok in 1944 and was elected to the central committee of the CPT and the political department at the second congress in 1952 .
He was re-elected to the central committee and elected to the five - member secretariat of the CPT at the third congress in 1961 .
From 1950 to 1951
Wirat resided mostly outside of Thailand , in China and Laos or in mountain bases on the border of Thailand .
He first studied at the Marxist - Leninist Institute in Beijing and returned to Thailand in 1957–8 and regularly went to China for Communist Party meetings .
From 1965 to 1976
Wirat lived alternatively in China and a remote base of Nan in northern Thailand .
Wirat settled in Laos where he led the “ re-education ” of the dissident cadres of “ the region of three provinces ” ( Phetchabun - Phitsanulok - Loei ) before traveling to China in the late 1970s .
In 1982 he joined a base of CPT to participate in the fourth congress .
Wirat used the pseudonyms of Comrade Than , Jang Yuan and Tho Phianwitthaya .
It was under this last name that he signed , in 1978 , the principal document analysing the history of the CPT from the point of view of his leadership .
He was the writer of important official declarations of the party .
Wirat Angkhathawon advanced the prestige of the CPT among the generation of Thai radicals in the 1970s .
The CPT was the only Thai party successfully to organise resistance against the military dictatorship and was widely recognised for its political and economic integrity .
But after 1978 the CPT entered a period of crisis when the People ’s Republic of China moved decisively toward a market , pro-capitalist economy .
The CPT ’s staunch “ pro-Chinese ” stance impaired the party ’s reputation among leftists and youths in Thailand .
In late 1982 Wirat suffered a stroke .

Prasertkul , Seksan ( b. 1949 )
[ The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest , vol .
VI , pp. 2746-2748 . ]
Seksan Prasertkun ( or Prasertkul ) was among the most visible student leaders in the demonstrations of October 1973 that toppled the Thai military regime .
He was also among the first groups who joined the fighters of the Communist Party of Thailand when it became clear that a new coup d’etat was underway .
He was one of the militants who actively opposed the CPT leadership 's support for the People ’s Republic of China and the Khmer Rouge during the Sino - Indochinese conflict of 1978 –9 .
After losing this ideological campaign in the Thai communist movement , Seksan permanently returned to civilian life .
Marcel Barang , who translated many of Seksan ’s writings , summarised his exceptional journey in one sentence : “ Child of the poor , great student speaker , outcast underground fighter , highly quoted professor , renowned writer , witness and actor of his century . ”
In this way he became an emblematic figure of the radical generation of the 1970s .
Seksan Prasertkun had a poor childhood .
Son of a technician of small trawlers and a fruit and vegetable vendor , he became an excellent student in a monk school of his village of fisherfolk , at the mouth of Bang Pakong , on the Gulf of Thailand .
In 1967 , at the age of 18 years , Seksan had the 15th - highest score at the national university entrance examination , opening the doors of the prestigious Thammasat University in Bangkok .
Seksan received a scholarship to travel to the US to learn English in 1968 at the time when mobilisations against the war in Vietnam were at their height and returned to Thailand politicised .
In the late 1960s the military regimes of field marshals Thanom and Praphas were highly unpopular and nationalist and democratic demands expanded dramatically .
In 1972 the National Center for Student Action ( NSCT ) launched a campaign to boycott Japanese products .
Seksan became known by his university and polemical writings .
On October 6 , 1973 , when student “ leaders ” were arrested by the police , Seksan avoided arrest .
A talented speaker with charisma , Seksan led mass demonstrations to demand the release of students and a national constitution .
From October 13 – 14 , Thai armed forces fired on demonstrators , killing more than 1500 democracy protesters .
The civilian demonstration and military crackdown forced King Bhumibol to order the dismissal of the field marshals .
Seksan founded the Federation of Independent Students of Thailand ( FIST ) , one of the principal components of the radical wing of the movement .
Faced with the deadly rise of violence of the extreme right , he decided , earlier than most others , to join the fighters of the Communist Party .
He left the country in 1975 with three student activists for France , China , Vietnam and Laos ( where he obtained political and military training ) .
In October 1976 , when the army seised power in a bloody coup , Seksan joined the People ’s Liberation Army of Thailand ( PLAT ) to fight in the Rongkla mountain range in northern Thailand until the beginning of 1978 .
Seksan returned to Thai Communist Party outposts in northern Laos at a time when the triangular conflict between communist China , Vietnam and Khmer Rouge - led Cambodia worsened .
The CPT leadership sided with the Chinese and the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam , a position Seksan vehemently opposed .
In 1979 Seksan left for Laos to a base in the province of Phayao where his first son , Chang , was born in July .
Despite Seksan ’s criticism of the CPT position , the party refused his request to leave the movement and he and his family were sent to the Burmese border , in the district of Umphang , where they were in political quarantine .
But Seksan clashed with the provincial leadership of the party , in the framework of the preparation of the fourth congress of the CPT .
He was opposed to the mode of authoritarian designation of delegates , declaring later in Bangkok : “ We had to fight for democracy all over again in the jungle ” .
Now in opposition to the CPT , many former students were demoralised and averse to pursue the internal battle under exceptionally difficult conditions .
At the end of 1980 Seksan and other dissidents in the party were finally permitted to leave the jungle .
In his writings he wrote about his difficult journey .
Like many students who “ came back from the jungle ” Seksan resumed his studies .
He received a doctorate degree in political science from Cornell University in the US ; his thesis was on the evolution of the state and Thai economy .
He embarked on a new lifestyle as a professor , rising from 1993 to 1995 to dean of the political science faculty at Thammasat University .
From 1984 to 1993
Seksan authored numerous articles highly critical of upper - class privilege and repressive Thai society , including an autobiographic screenplay for the film Moonhunter ( 2001 ) .
Seksan Prasertkun is a generous man , whose self - assurance and frankness always stand out in a culture where self - effacement and ignorance of conflicts is seen as a virtue .
Nevertheless his own history reflects the radicalisation of a university milieu socially transformed by the arrival of a number of working - class students , shocked by the corruption of the regime and the Indochinese war and in contact with campuses beyond the Pacific .
Engaged fully in the struggle for a fair society , such students were profoundly disillusioned by the Thai Communist Party .
The difficulty lay in pursuing this initial engagement after the end of the armed struggle in a country without a militant tradition or alternative to the CPT .

SCRANTON , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
They came from around the world hoping to spend a high school year immersed in the culture and joys of America .
Exchange student Carlos Villareal of Colombia says he was underfed and kept in " an unsafe environment . "
Instead , five young foreign exchange students found themselves caught in a nightmare of neglect , malnourishment and abandonment by those supposed to protect them .
Now those five -- natives of countries stretching from Norway to Tanzania to Colombia -- are back home telling friends of a different America than they expected .
And their brief visit reverberates in America as a United States senator demands accountability and reform , a Pennsylvania district attorney seeks criminal charges and the U.S. State Department concedes it failed to protect kids coming to America .
" We at the Department of State recognize [ because we ] are responsible for this program we have to make sure we are aggressively overseeing this program and make sure children are well - suited , " said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley .
" This is a program that is very important to the Department of State , " Crowley said .
" We are talking 15 - to 18 - year - old children .
We are introducing them to the United States .
We are trying to put our best foot forward .
We recognize in this incident in Scranton and also elsewhere around the country we have failed to do so . "
What happened in Scranton , according to Lackawanna County , Pennsylvania , District Attorney Andrew Jarbola , is a crime .
He has convened a grand jury to look into the families where some of the 12 students who came to Scranton were placed , as well as the company who placed them there and its officials .
" Well , in my opinion they were treated kind of crudely , " Jarbola said .
" Not provided the proper food , hygiene and things of that nature .
And the areas they were placed ?
I know one of the students was placed in a home with a convicted felon -- convicted of drug trafficking or drug offenses -- and that is very disturbing to me . "
Jarbola said some students were so malnourished that one was treated in a hospital for dehydration while another passed out during track at school .
Watch report from CNN's Drew Griffin »
" They were n't provided with food , " Jarbola said .
" In fact there is one incident with tape on food items in the refrigerator of the host family that says , ' Do not touch .
This is for the host family only . '
So basically they were neglected . "
The company that placed the students first denied any problems existed , then said it had corrected them and fired those responsible .
The families who housed the students say the allegations are untrue .
But the students themselves tell a different story .
' It was nothing like I had envisioned '
The San Francisco - based Aspect Foundation sponsored all 12 of the Scranton students , some of whom were on State Department grants .
On its Web site , the Aspect Foundation says it began in 1985 as " a small non-profit organization offering affordable study - abroad opportunities to students from around the world , " and now " students live with volunteer host families in more than 350 communities throughout the United States . "
In 2008 , the State Department gave 17 placement groups $ 39.4 million in taxpayer funds to manage programs involving exchange students .
Aspect received $ 1.08 million of those funds .
Carlos Villarreal 's family , however , paid their son's way to America from Colombia , giving Aspect $ 13,000 for him to study here .
Villarreal said he lived with a family that housed ex-convicts and that he had very little to eat .
He said his mother 's repeated contacts with Aspect about his situation were ignored .
" I lost a lot of body weight , and [ it was ] an unsafe environment which I felt uncomfortable living in , and it was nothing like I had envisioned my experience in America , " he said .
The Rev. Elmer Smith told CNN he took in Villarreal as a favor to Aspect 's local coordinator , Edna Burgette , and denied he failed to feed him .
" The boy had no place to go , so I took him in and I fed him , " Smith said .
" He had a television in his room , he had heat in his room , he had air - conditioning in his room . "
Another woman who hosted students said she was sitting on her porch when Burgette walked by and asked her if she would take in a child .
Like Smith , the woman said that she was just trying to help a student whom she was told had nowhere else to go .
Jarbola said a girl from Norway , who asked to be identified only by her first name , Anne , tried to alert officials that she and some of the students were in dire straits .
Anne told CNN she had school officials send an e-mail to Aspect in October explaining how bad things were and including photographs of the inside of the home where she was placed .
The home was later condemned by the city .
Anne 's high school principal took her in , but other students were n't as lucky and spent nearly the entire school year in unsafe homes , until Children and Youth Services was tipped off about a month before school ended , Jarbola said .
Jarbola , who said Anne 's e-mail is now evidence in the criminal investigation , told CNN that when welfare officials interviewed the students , one was so hungry he wept when they gave him pizza during questioning .
In all , five of the students were removed from homes where they 'd been placed by Aspect .
Sponsoring agencies asked to police themselves
U.S. Sen . Robert Casey , D - Pennsylvania , said the situation sickened him .
" I'm the father of four daughters , " he said .
" I would never want my daughter nor would any parent want their daughter or son exposed to these kinds of conditions anywhere , but especially when you 're in a foreign country .
And in this case the United States was this foreign country . "
Aspect gave conflicting responses to CNN .
Vivian Fearen , its executive director , did not return calls seeking comment .
Her Pennsylvania public relations firm issued a statement blaming the Scranton problem on Burgette , who was fired once the allegations surfaced in the Scranton media .
Burgette also did not respond to repeated attempts by CNN for comment .
Later , however , Aspect issued a statement through the public relations firm .
" Based on their own investigation and verification from county children and youth officials , Aspect Foundation was led to believe that none of their students in northeastern Pennsylvania was abused , malnourished or dehydrated , " said Karen Walsh , public affairs director for the Neiman Group .
But the statement also said Aspect " fully acknowledges that what happened in Scranton , Pennsylvania , was deplorable and in complete violation of their own strict standards and those of the Department of State 's Exchange Visitor Program . "
" Aspect Foundation has corrected the problems ; terminated or accepted the resignations of those who were responsible for them ; and established new policies and procedures to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again , " Walsh said .
Walsh said the Lackawanna County Children and Youth Services agency reported no Aspect students in Scranton required medical attention and only three were relocated .
In addition to Burgette 's firing , Walsh said , two other supervisors resigned .
But the district attorney and other officials in Lackawanna County dispute Aspect 's contention .
Jarbola said two received medical attention .
All told , according to Jarbola , five were relocated , and those cases are being reviewed by the grand jury .
But Casey 's staff pointed out that Aspect employed Burgette for 10 years , making it difficult to portray her simply as a rogue employee .
Casey said Aspect knew in October the students were in trouble and chose to ignore it .
But he saved most of his anger for the State Department , which allows groups like Aspect to police themselves .
" It 's about time that the State Department complete its investigation -- even as the grand jury is working -- complete the investigation , level tough sanctions and make improvements to this program in terms of oversight , " Casey said .
In its initial statement to CNN , the State Department said when it hears of allegations , " we immediately contact the sponsoring organization involved and ask them to investigate .
We gather full information and act swiftly and appropriately . "
That 's the problem , argue critics , who say the department has had a hands - off policy for years when it comes to foreign exchange group sponsors .
When complaints are made against the sponsor , they are asked to investigate themselves .
Arkansas legislator Sue Madison said she had a law passed in her state to protect students after it was discovered some of them were forced to do manual labor , live in unfit conditions and even forced to hand over their money to host families .
" You make a complaint to the State Department and you basically never hear from them again , " Madison said , explaining why she decided her state needed a law to do its own enforcement .
Watchdog groups struggle to get State Department 's attention
Danielle Grijalva , director of the Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students , said she once worked in the industry .
The agencies , which she calls unregulated travel agents , can make millions of dollars enticing rich foreigners and lobbying for State Department grants to lure scholarship - eligible students here for a year of study .
Her group now monitors complaints .
The situation in Scranton , she said , is not isolated -- nor is the State Department 's initial response to the crisis .
She fields calls from parents and students alike who complain they have nowhere else to turn .
" It 's self - regulated , unmonitored , under - reported , " Grijalva said .
" Students being raped , placed in the homes of convicted felons , placed in the homes of registered sex offenders , come to the United States and lose 20 , 30 , 40 pounds . "
Grijalva shared e-mails with CNN which she said came from parents and students and host families -- even correspondence with the State Department managers who oversee the program .
The State Department " will not accept as a complaint any matter that is not presented to us by an involved party to the exchange agency , " she was told in a 2006 e-mail by Stanley Colvin , a deputy assistant secretary for private - sector exchange .
Complaints forwarded by watchdog groups like hers , she said , are not considered by the State Department as worthy of investigation .
The State Department turned down CNN 's request to talk to Colvin or other managers directly involved in managing the exchange programs .
" When we bring this to the attention of the State Department , once again , it 's a business issue , they can't get involved and they continue to look the other way , " Grijalva said .
Crowley said the department is not looking the other way now .
He said the Scranton situation showed the department " tended to inspect by exception .
Only when we were aware of dire circumstances did we send an investigator out . "
Crowley said the department asked the inspector general 's office to investigate Aspect but also plans to inspect its own management controls .
He said that given the number of students , the department will still have to depend on sponsoring agencies to monitor the students they bring over .
But he said the State Department can and will do more .
" We do recognize that the oversight of this program at the State Department was not strong enough , not aggressive enough , " Crowley said .
" We were not out there in the community looking hard at where our children were .
We have already taken steps to put more eyes on these homes around the country so that in the future not only will we be putting the appropriate emphasis on the agents that are responsible first and foremost for oversight we 'll be looking over their shoulders as well .
" That did not happen certainly in the case of Scranton , " he said .
Crowley also released a June 12 report on Aspect written by Colvin .
In it , Colvin said the department has warned the industry for the past three years that it was becoming harder to find suitable host families .
It said the department specifically told Aspect that an audit found the group only complying with host family screening requirements 67.7 percent of the time .
It 's unclear from the report why the State Department did not stop awarding Aspect grants at that point .
After finding a number of violations in Scranton , Colvin said the state would sanction Aspect by reducing the number of students it can bring over by 15 percent .
Based on the fees it charges , the penalty , Colvin wrote , will result in a revenue loss of $ 540,000 .
However , there is no mention in the report whether Aspect will have to return any of the $ 1 million of taxpayer - funded grants it received for the 2008 - 2009 school year .
The State Department did not respond to repeated requests for clarification .
Despite conditions , Tanzanian student says ' thank you '
Meanwhile , Tanzanian student Musa Mpulki has since returned home .
Before he left , he told CNN he did not want to upset his mother , so he never told her that he had little to eat during his nine - month stay in the home of a 72 - year - old man who had signs on his refrigerator that some food was only for family .
Although his housing situation was a nightmare , Mpulki said the students at the school made him appreciate America , and he said he appreciated the State Department grant that brought him to the United States .
" I guess I like to say , ' Thank you very much the government of the United States for to bring me here to get a good experience at the school and a good education . ' "
CNN 's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report .

Does that last bit sound familiar ?
It has been the weather report for the Northeast this summer , especially in June .
Where we saw precipitation fit for Noah ’s Ark , late blight found something akin to a four - star hotel .
Those soggy fields and backyard vegetable plots ?
Inviting , and all too easy to check into .
But weather alone does n’t explain the early severity of the disease this year .
We ’ve had wet , cool summers in the past , but it ’s never been this bad .
Instead we have to look at two other factors : the origin of the tomato plants many of us cultivate , and the renewed interest in gardening .
According to plant pathologists , this killer round of blight began with a widespread infiltration of the disease in tomato starter plants .
Large retailers like Home Depot , Kmart , Lowe ’s and Wal - Mart bought starter plants from industrial breeding operations in the South and distributed them throughout the Northeast .
( Fungal spores , which can travel up to 40 miles , may also have been dispersed in transit . )
Once those infected starter plants arrived at the stores , they were purchased and planted , transferring their pathogens like tiny Trojan horses into backyard and community gardens .
Perhaps this is why the Northeast was hit so viciously : instead of being spread through large farms , the blight sneaked through lots of little gardens , enabling it to escape the attention of the people who track plant diseases .
It ’s important to note , too , that this year there have been many more hosts than in the past as more and more Americans have taken to gardening .
Credit the recession or Michelle Obama or both , but there ’s been an increased awareness of the benefits of growing your own food .
According to the National Gardening Association , 43 million households planned a backyard garden or put a stake in a share of a community garden in 2009 , up from 36 million in 2008 .
That ’s quite a few home gardeners who  given the popularity of the humble tomato  probably planted a starter or two this summer .
Here ’s the unhappy twist : the explosion of home gardeners  the very people most conscious of buying local food and opting out of the conventional food chain  has paradoxically set the stage for the worst local tomato harvest in memory .
So what do we do ?
For starters , if you ’re planning a garden ( and not growing from seed  the preferable , if less convenient , choice ) , then buy starter plants from a local grower or nursery .
A tomato plant that travels 2,000 miles is no different from a tomato that has traveled 2,000 miles to your plate .
It ’s an effective way to help local growers , who rely on sales of these plants before the harvest arrives .
It ’s also a way to protect agriculture .
If late blight occurs in a small nursery it ’s relatively easy to recognize , as straightforward as being able to see the plant , recognize its symptoms and isolate it before it has a chance to spread .
This is less of an option on a farm that ’s spread out over dozens of acres , nor is it likely once the plant gets to a large retailer .
A plant pathologist from Cornell told me she visited one such store and noticed the tomato plants were infected with blight .
She immediately reported it to the manager , who said he could n’t remove the plants without approval from his superiors ( which would take time ) .
The pathologist returned a week later to find that the plants were still there .
Bulgaria 's Sports Minister Svilen Neykov has ordered a special review of the national lottery after the same numbers were picked in straight draws .
The numbers 4 , 15 , 23 , 24 , 35 , and 42 were drawn on September 6 and again on September 10 in consecutive lottery rounds .
The probability of this happening is 4.2 million to one , mathematician Mihail Konstantinov commented , although he added that such coincidences could happen .
Three of the numbers also appeared in the September 13 draw .
Lottery deputy chairwoman Maria Yaneva excluded any possibility of manipulation , telling the newspaper on Wednesday that the numbers were drawn in different order each time .
I often install programs that depend on environment variables for their proper operation and require that their executable directory will be add to the PATH .
Doing it using the Windows GUI is error - prone and tedious .
I have been burned many times .
' enver ' is the result .
The usage string explains how to use it .
Implementation highlights :
There are n't many :-) .
Enver parses the command line and works with the Windows registry using the _winreg module to modify the persistent environment .
The registry key is SYSTEM \CurrentControlSet \Control \Session Manager \Environment .
The treatment of PATH environment variable is special .
Enver checks specifically if the env var name is PATH and only appends to it because that 's what you usually do .
Once everything is done enver broadcasts a WM_SETTINGCHANGE to all the windows in order to make the change visible .
Issues :
1 ) Note that at the moment enver does n't modify the active environment , but only the registry so new command windows will see the changes .
So , if you type : ' set ' after running enver you wo n't see any changes .
Setting os.environ would n't help because the script is executed in a different shell then the host window .
2 ) There is no way to replace the entire PATH , or to remove entries from the PATH , only to append entries to the PATH .
Again , I do n't need the other features , if it 's important to someone go ahead and add the funtionality .
3 ) Works on the System environment only .
does n't bother with the User environment ( System applies to all users of the machine , User applies to current user only ) .
4 ) Most applications ( including active cmd.exe Windows ) do n't react to the broadcast message , so you will not see the cahnge until you restart them .
It 's been a long time since passengers have been allowed to smoke on an airliner in the United States .
It 's the same story in Europe .
But now the smoking crowd across the Atlantic have an option when the nicotine comes calling .
Ireland - based Ryanair is selling smokeless cigarettes on all the company 's flights .
Ryanair says a survey showed more than 24,000 passengers would like the option to smoke during flights and that was enough of an incentive in these lean times to try and gain some market share as well as some extra income .
So as long as you 're at least 18 years old , the company will sell you a pack of smokeless smokes for 6 euro ( about $ 8.75 ) .
Ryanair is a discount airlines that flies throughout Europe and North Africa and is no stranger to using a gimmick to bring in some business .
The company says the cigarettes can't be lit and deliver the nicotine through inhalation .
For those who fear the old days when the difference between the smoking section on an airplane and the non-smoking section was simply whichever way the air was flowing inside the cabin , the smokeless cigarettes do not emit any toxins or chemicals to nearby passengers .
Company spokesman Stephen McNamara believes when smokers can get their nicotine , everybody wins , " as these cigarettes are smokeless , they cause no discomfort to other passengers and can ensure a more enjoyable and stress - free flight for all passengers as non-smokers will no longer have to cope with moody smokers in need of nicotine . ”

Now that the heady days of the “ Cash for Clunkers ” program are coming to a close , we can afford to pause and thoughtfully evaluate what just happened .
Our breathless rush to hand out billions of dollars of government subsidies helped stimulate the economy and removed hundreds of thousands of older cars from the highways , and that has to be a good thing , right ?
Um … maybe not .
Depending on which economist you believe , Cash for Clunkers either sparked more car purchases , changed the timing of car purchases , or just borrowed purchases from other sectors of the economy .
But while economists dither , the consensus from the environmental side is clear .
Simply put , if the Cash for Clunkers program was a car , I would insist on trading it in .
Cash for Clunkers fails the environmental sniff test for a number of reasons .
Consider these facts :
• • Although the program was originally billed as a way to reduce greenhouse gases , it achieves this aim amid huge expense and massive inefficiencies .
Cash for Clunkers may diminish our nation 's overall carbon footprint , but the associated costs will be at least 10 times higher than other carbon - reduction strategies contemplated for current climate legislation .
Sharpen your pencil even further to add the amount of carbon it takes to make new cars and destroy older ones — and the bottom line of the program goes from bad to worse .
• • Cash for Clunkers was touted as a way to reduce the automobile - generated pollutants that continue to plague major urban areas such as Houston .
That 's certainly a noble goal , but pressure from the classic car lobby — which mainly serves the interests of mechanic shops that specialize in older cars — effectively watered down the program 's potential impact .
By deeming that cars built before the 1980s were not clunkers , legislators missed a cardinal opportunity to eliminate some of the least efficient vehicles on the planet .
Given that many of these older cars tend to be the cheapest vehicles on the market , the government could have given taxpayers a much bigger bang for their buck .
• • As big as these current missteps may be , they pale next to the ones coming down the road .
Yes , we took older cars off our highways — but we immediately replaced them with vehicles that are destined to become the clunkers of the future .
In effect , the Cash for Clunkers program promoted the continued proliferation of vehicles in our overly auto - dependent society .
Incremental progress toward a cleaner nationwide fleet is a good thing , but it will almost certainly be offset by the longer overall lifespan of our automobiles .
Personally , I would rather see fewer incentives squandered on promoting urban sprawl , and more investments directed toward creating highly efficient forms of mass transit .
Students of American history can trace the domination of the automobile in our culture to a few corporate giants ( including GM ) that bought up much of the nation 's network of trolleys and commuter trains — only to destroy or neglect these rail networks and replace them with buses , cars and roads .
Looking back , if we had been smart enough to deploy those billions ( in 2009 dollars ) toward mass transit rather than a nationwide infrastructure built around the automobile , our environment and our quality of life would certainly be in better shape today .
Another round of Cash for Clunkers is now contemplated .
If an environmentalist were named to oversee it , he or she could reward those willing to surrender older cars with subsidies that promote green technologies more generally — including major consumer goods such as solar panels , tankless water heaters and energy - efficient appliances .
A program founded on this approach would yield the best of both worlds : economic stimulation , plus true environmental benefits .
It 's an unlikely scenario , of course , especially since the auto industry has moved into overdrive to encourage lawmakers to simply extend and repeat the current Cash for Clunkers approach .
But before we put any more public money down on the barrelhead , I wish we could spend more time thinking not only about how to heal our troubled economy , but also how these investments can work to harm or heal our equally troubled environment .

Many visualizations focus on representing a specific set of data or statistical information .
Others focus on less - concrete topics , providing a visual representation of abstract concepts .
Generally speaking , the first type appear more like graphs or charts and the latter are often more creative and imaginative .

Ten unexpected inventions that add up to a portrait of Apple 's CEO .
Among the many uncanny parallels between Stephen Paul Jobs and Walter Elias Disney is this one : Very early on , both abandoned the work that in some respects might seem to define their careers .
Walt Disney began as a cartoonist , but by the late 1920s he had nothing to do with the drawing of Disney cartoons and is said to have told folks that he could n’t have held down an animator ’s job in his own studio .
And Steve Jobs held technical positions at HP and Atari at the dawn of his time in Silicon Valley , but his contributions to Apple have never been those of an engineer .
And yet , as I browsed Apple patents in recent months for stories like this one , I was n’t surprised to discover that Jobs ’ name is among the inventors listed on dozens of Apple filings over the past thirty years ( with a thirteen - year gap in the middle during his absence ) .
It does n’t feel like glory - hogging , either :
Anyone want to make the case that major Apple products would be pretty much the same if Jobs had n’t contributed ideas and refinements ?
And Jobs ’ name is typically one of several or many on a patent , usually along with that of Apple design honcho Jonathan Ive and other , lesser - known colleagues .
( Most Jobs patents relate to industrial design ; some are for software ; none are for circuitry or other under - the - hood technologies . )
Rummaging through Google Patent Search ‘s records of patents credited in part to Steve Jobs is an absorbing way to reflect on some of his accomplishments and failures –and maybe even to learn some new things about what makes the man tick .
Yes , his name is on the patents for most of the iconic computers , MP3 players , and other gizmos sold by Apple from 1998 to the present .
( I ’ve written about some of them before . )
But you know what ?
It ’s not the famous , obvious stuff that I find most interesting –it ’s the sidelights , loose ends , and mysteries .
I ’ll look at ten of those in a moment .
First , let ’s get a bunch of icons out of the way with a group shot , shall we ?
Guys , c’mon in …
Applause , applause ; thank you , thank you .
Okay , let ’s move on .
Here are ten other Steve Jobs patents to chew on–none of them landmarks , but all of them interesting :
1. A quiet blessing .
When I started doing stories comparing the cost of Windows PCs and Macs , I used to include Apple ’s power adapters –which are unusually compact and sport magnetic connectors , an optional extension cord , and little wings you can wrap the cable around –as a point in Macs ’ favor , until I got sick of Windows fans snickering .
I should n’t have caved .
The fact that the CEO obsesses over even mundane necessities such as power bricks is one of the things that makes Apple Apple , and makes Macs worth more money than garden - variety Windows boxes .
If you ’re not sure if you ’re a candidate to buy a Mac , here ’s a simple test :
If the notion of a really well - designed AC adapter excites you , you ’ll probably be very happy with a Mac .
And if it does n’t , you wo n’t .
The one shown here is from a 2001 patent filing that credits Jobs and eleven others .
2. A maniacal work of minimalism .
I have n’t been to every major Steve Jobs product unveiling , but I ’ve been to more than my share–starting before there were such things as Macs–and I ca n’t think of anything I saw Jobs reveal that seemed to tickle him more than the Apple Remote , which debuted at an October 12th , 2005 event and is shown here in a drawing from a patent filed five days earlier .
He showed a slide contrasting the Remote ’s six options embedded in two unmarked controls against a Windows Media Center remote completely covered by fifteen zillion buttons , and just stood there and beamed .
I think that the Apple Remote is merely very good –I prefer the Vudu box ’s thumbwheel driven model–but it ’s as striking an example of Jobsian restraint as you ’ll find .
If most consumer - electronics companies set out to build the simplest remote ever , they ’d still end up with three times the buttons , and half of them would have incomprehensible labels .
3 . An apparent obsession .
A surprising percentage of the Apple patents that carry Jobs ’ name involve one basic idea : desktop computers with the guts in one box , the display in another , and some form of articulated arm in between .
Apple only made such a machine for about two and a half years –the iMac G4 , produced between 2002 and 2004 .
Yet the U.S. Patent Office holds plenty of evidence that Jobs was smitten with the idea , including this patent for boxy a snake - arm iMac that was filed just weeks before Apple stopped shipping the more rounded G4 .
I ’m not sure if Jobs has ever spoken publicly about the brief life of the “ desklamp ” Mac , but I ’m betting that it was with at least some degree of regret that he retired it in favor of more conventional , less fanciful iMac designs .
I ’m also not sure if it means anything that some of these patents are among the few in which Jobs ’ name precedes that of any collaborator .
4 . A minor enigma .
Here ’s a “ handheld portable computing device ” from a 2007 patent filing , credited to Jobs and a dozen others , that looks like an early iPod Nano with some sort of touchstrip control rather than the iconic clickwheel .
Apple has yet to make such a device .
( The 2007 Nano turned out to be the squart , square variant–and it came out less than three months after this filing . )
But did it seriously consider doing so ?
Or is this something else ?
Maybe even an Apple product which was released which I ’m somehow not recognizing ?
5 . A frickin’ box .
The iPod Nano box , to be exact .
Although with the consistent design aesthetic of everything Apple , it sometimes seems beside the point to distinguish between the product and its packaging :
An iPod ’s box is pretty much part of the iPod that you happen to remove during use .
If Apple does n’t go entirely to recycled , biodegradable packaging at some point , it would n’t startle me to see it introduce a unibody aluminum iPod box with an Apple logo that lights up .
6 . A bad idea .
This we know about patents :
They ’re permanent and unflinching , recording embarrassing failures just as definitively as they do history - making successes .
So this drawing of a 1998 “ cursor control device “ - better known as the original iMac mouse–preserves for all time the fact that Steve Jobs and his team inexplicably chose to make a mouse that had nothing to do with the shape of the human hand .
What we do n’t know is whether the ten people credited with its creation ( who also designed an amazing array of brilliantly functional products ) all suffered a simultaneous bout of bad judgment , or whether some of them sort of knew deep in their hearts that mice should n’t be round and flat .
Later Macs returned to mice that were less distinctive but far more useful .
7 . A stairway to heaven , or at least the Genius Bar .
This would seem to be the towering glass staircase at the Apple Store in San Francisco ’s Union Square , a set of steps I ’ve trod up and down dozens of times since the store opened in October , 2005 .
( My most memorable trip up it ?
With out a doubt , the one on the evening of June 29th , 2007 , when I ascended it to buy an iPhone on the first night they were available .
Bathed in light and applauded by an army of Apple employees for my good taste , I felt like I was entering paradise . )
Microsoft , having taken note of the Apple Stores ’ great success , plans its own chain of retail outfits , but let ’s just say it :
There ’s absolutely no chance that Steve Ballmer is going to roll up his sleeves and help design the fixtures .
It ’s hard enough to envision him rolling up his sleeces and helping to design Windows 7 ’s fixtures .
I ’m not saying that that ’s good , and I ’m not saying that it ’s bad–just that it ’s a defining difference between the Two Most Important Steves in Tech .
8. Evidence of trouble .
[ UPDATE : Commenter “ Duck ” says that he or she thinks I ’m wrong about what this is , and it ’s a CD icon formerly seen in iTunes .
Which may well be right–looking at the other frames of animation in the patent , it looks like it .
Please disregard musings to follow in this item . ]
It ’s not quite the Blue Screen of Death , but OS X ’s spinning beach ball is never the bearer of glad tidings –it ’s there to tell you that you ’re trying to do stuff so fast that your Mac ca n’t keep up , and it ’s been known to do its rotating for abnormally long times and / or be the first warning sign of a crash .
( I get paranoid when I see it or any other animated status indicator , and brood about the computational cycles that are being wasted on needless animation . )
Apple filed a patent for the festive status indicator in January 2001 , and Jobs was one of two designers to receive credit ( Me , I would have tried to deny responsbility . )
It ’s one of the few examples of an Apple patent on something that we ’d all be just as happy to never see again .
9 . A commodity .
I do n’t even think of iPod and iPhone cases as something Apple gives much though to — other than cheerfully selling gadgets that scratch easily , then turning around and selling us protective cases from a thriving throng of very small companies –let alone a matter that occupies many of Jobs ’ precious brain cells .
But in 2002 , Apple filed patents for a couple of iPod cases , including this one which claims Jobs and ten others as its inventor .
From all evidence , it ’s nice , but not extraordinary .
( If you know what qualities would cause an iPod case to be extraordinary , please let me know . )
10 . A possible sign of things to come .
Most of the many Apple patents that the blogosphere discovers and takes as evidence of amazing gadgets to come have one thing in common : Steve Jobs ’ name is n’t on them .
He tends to show up on patents that show real Apple products in more - or - less final form .
This one is an exception :
It ’s a 2004 filing for a touch tablet computer of some sort , credited to Jobs and fourteen others .
Apple has released no such product to date , and the drawing at right is about as close as the filing gets to explaining how one might work .
But in recent months , the world has pretty much decided that Apple is building a tablet for release this year or next .
If it does–and there are still no guarantees –anyone who paid attention to this patent had the news first .
Sort of .
Anyone want to read things into these patents that I did n’t ?

Mainland China is about to come out as Shanghai puts on its first Gay Pride .
The celebration begins Sunday and will culminate with the big party on Saturday , June 13 .
While Hong Kong festooned itself with rainbow pride last year , Shanghai Pride is the first large - scale gay event to be held on the Chinese mainland .
“ Shanghai is undoubtedly China 's most liberal and progressive city and it is the logical choice to host Mainland China 's first gay pride festival , ” co-organizer Hannah Miller , an openly lesbian American living in China since 2001 , said in a press release .
“ It speaks volumes for China 's advancement that such an event can now be organized – it shows that China is becoming a modern , tolerant and forward - thinking nation . ”
But do n't expect to see revelers in the streets enjoying drag queens lip syncing from on top of brightly colored floats surrounded by bikini - clad dancers or demonstrators calling for greater access to rights in Shanghai .
Instead , organizers are planning a series of cultural events to take place at privately - owned venues .
“ The advantage of that is it does n't draw so much attention , or make it sound like we are trying to get people involved in gay rights or in any sort of protest , ” Miller told the BBC .
“ Basically we were told that if we framed it as a party for foreigners , as entertainment , then we would have more chance of success . ”
The entertainment consists of daily art exhibits , film screenings , food events and panel discussions throughout the week .
But not everyone agrees with a Gay Pride that promotes partying over activism .
“ Gay weddings ?
Is this a joke like the ' hot body competition ? , ' ” asked one commenter at the Shanghai Pride website .
“ Where is the protest ?
The marching for visibility ? ”
“ One step at a time ! ” responds the moderator .
While being gay or lesbian is not illegal in China , gay culture remains underground in this conservative society .
Young people – gay and straight – feel enormous pressure to procreate due to China 's 1 child per couple rule .

A two - year corruption and international money - laundering investigation stretching from the Jersey Shore to Brooklyn to Israel and Switzerland culminated in charges against 44 people on Thursday , including three New Jersey mayors , two state assemblymen and five rabbis , the authorities said .
The case began with bank fraud charges against a member of an insular Syrian Jewish enclave centered in a seaside town .
But when that man became a federal informant and posed as a crooked real estate developer offering cash bribes to obtain government approvals , it mushroomed into a political scandal that could rival any of the most explosive and sleazy episodes in New Jersey ’s recent past .
It was replete with tales of the illegal sales of body parts ; of furtive negotiations in diners , parking lots and boiler rooms ; of nervous jokes about “ patting down ” a man who turned out to indeed be an informant ; and , again and again , of the passing of cash  once in a box of Apple Jacks cereal stuffed with $ 97,000 .
“ For these defendants , corruption was a way of life , ” Ralph J. Marra Jr. , the acting United States attorney in New Jersey , said at a news conference .
“ They existed in an ethics - free zone . ”
Here ’s a little story on how usability decisions need to depend on context .
In Unity editor pretty much any window can be “ detached ” from the main window .
An obvious use case is putting it onto a separate monitor .
But of course you can just end up having a ton of detached windows overlapping each other .
Here I have four windows in total on OS X :
Here I have four windows on Windows :
However , users of OS X and Windows are used to applications behaving differently .
On OS X , it is very common that a single application has many overlapping windows .
Usually users do n’t have problems finding their windows either , thanks to Exposé .
Press a key , voilà , here they are :
On Windows , there is no Exposé .
So there ’s a problem : when a detached window is obscured by another window , how do you get to it ?
One would ask “ well , what ’s wrong in having windows partially overlapped , like in above screenshot ? ” , to which I ’d say “ you ’re a Mac user ” .
Windows users do not have a ton of windows on screen .
They tend to maximize the application they are currently working with .
I was doing this myself all the time , and it took 3 years of Mac laptop usage before I stopped maximizing everything on my Windows box !
So what a typical Windows user might see when using Unity is this .
Now , where are the other three detached windows ?
On Windows , it is very uncommon for a single application to have many overlapped windows .
When an application does that , the “ detached ” windows are always positioned on top of the main window .
There are some applications that do not do this ( yes I ’m looking at you GIMP ) , and almost everyone is not happy with their usability .
So we decided to take this context into account .
Windows users do not have Exposé , and they expect “ detached ” windows to be always on top of the main window .
Unity 2.6 will do this soon .
Of course , you still can dock all the windows together and this whole “ windows are obscured by other windows ” issue goes away :
Hmm …
I think the screenshots above show two new big features in upcoming Unity 2.6 .
Preemptive note : UI of the stuff above is not final .
Anything might change , do n’t become attached to any particular pixel !

Did iatrogenic harm select for supernatural beliefs ?
Did iatrogenic harm select for supernatural beliefs ?
Toward the end of Fooled by Randomness , The Black Swan ) talks about religion and the history of medicine .
He notes that one of the benefits of adhering to religious practices was that you probably avoided going to a doctor when you were in trouble -- you prayed to a god or whatever other supernatural entity your religion said would help you out .
Why was this a benefit ?
Because before roughly 50 to 100 years ago , going to the doctor was worse than doing nothing .
He bled you , gave your wife a disease by not washing his hands while delivering her baby , etc .
Basically , before very recent times , doctors were parasites .
They did not specialize in healing you , but in conning you into thinking that they could heal you -- for a small fee -- all while making you worse , on average .
This makes me think : there would have been a selection pressure on human beings to be skeptical of materialist claims about the world -- or at least about the nature of ourselves -- and thus , by default , to be naturally inclined toward supernatural beliefs .
Of course , praying to Zeus might not have done an awful lot of good -- but at least it would n't have given you new infections like a hospital would , and at least it would n't have bled you dry .
( And there may have been some benefit from all the social interactions that you got by attending religious services regularly vs. being socially isolated . )
Natural selection operates on the tiniest differences in relative fitness , and for most of human existence there must have been more than a little difference in fitness between those who eagerly sought out the help of a medicine man / doctor and those who just went to church ( or wherever ) and prayed to the spirits instead .
This may be an original hypothesis , but I do n't claim so since I have n't read much on the various theories of why religion is part of human nature .
Taleb came pretty close to saying so , but not explicitly .
Most economists talk about what 's rational or utility - maximizing , without making that final link to evolutionary fitness .
To its credit , the idea has a pretty solid basis for the necessary differences in relative fitness between believers and non-believers .

While gathering facts from across the Internet is relatively easy ( albeit tedious ) for humans to do , it 's far more difficult for computers to do automatically .
Google Squared is a first step towards solving that challenge .
It essentially searches the web to find the types of facts you might be interested in , extracts them and presents them in a meaningful way .
This technology is by no means perfect .
That 's why we designed Google Squared to be conversational , enabling you to respond to the initial result and get a better answer .
If there 's another row or column you 'd like to see , you can add it and Google Squared will automatically attempt to fetch and fill in the relevant facts for you .
As you remove rows and columns you do n't like , Google Squared will get a fresh idea of what you 're interested in and suggest new rows and columns to add .
See it in action in the video below :
If you click on any fact , you 'll see the sources Google Squared gathered it from as well as a list of other possible values that you can investigate .
So even if your square is n't perfect at the beginning , it 's easy to work with Google Squared to get a better answer in no time .
Once you 've got a square you 're happy with , you can save it and come back to it later .
To give Google Squared a whirl , try searching for [ planets ] or [ romantic movies ] .
You can try out Google Squared now in Google Labs .
The biggest problem for Tyrannosaurus rex could have been a single - celled parasite in a paleolithic turn on the tiny - fells - mighty , War of the Worlds story .
A relative of lowly Trichomonas , a microbe commonly found today in pigeons , may have killed off Sue , the famous T. rex skeleton at the Chicago Field Museum , and many other tyrannosaurids , too .
Paleontologist Ewan Wolff of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and colleagues use evidence from modern predatory bird species to argue that the protozoan parasite could have formed lesions along the tyrannosaur mandible , eroding the bone away .
In some cases , the illness might have been bad enough to prevent the animals from feeding , leading to their death from starvation , and creating telltale holes in the jaws of the great beasts .
" I think it 's very tempting when you see a hole in a bone to say it 's bite marks , but there are innumerable disease you could list that cause holes in bones that have nothing to do with bite wounds , " said Ewan Wolff , lead author of a new paper describing the work published Sept. 29 in PLoS One .
There are three pieces of evidence against the bite - wound hypothesis , Wolff said .
First , the holes are generally nicely circular or ovoid , not obviously tooth - shaped .
Second , dinosaurs obviously had many teeth , not just one , and the holes do n't seem to come in groups .
Third , there are no smaller marks or scrapes on the bone surrounding the holes .
" We 're definitely familiar with what predation traces look like from tooth marks in tyrannosaurus , " Wolff said .
" And this is not it . "
Furthermore , they found evidence in predatory birds that trichomonosis can cause holes in the mandible that look quite similar to those found in nine tyrannosaurid specimens .
The disease could have been passed to dinosaurs from their prey or from tyrannosaur to tyrannosaur during combat , mating , or cannibalism .
" Head or face - biting behavior relating to intraspecific territoriality , social dominance , courtship , feeding or some other unknown aspect of tyrannosaurid behavior would have provided the ideal mechanism for the transmission of this trichomonosis - like disease , " Wolff and colleagues wrote .
Other researchers , notably dinosaur anatomy expert Elizabeth Rega of Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona , California , have argued the holes were disease - induced .
But Rega 's culprit was a bacteria on the model of actinomyces .
Wolff , however , argued that much of the damage that actinomycosis causes in humans is due to pus .
Birds do n't actually create puss , and the same was likely true of dinosaurs .
It 's not part of the avian immune response .
Instead , birds coat invading organisms with a fibrous protein .
" So instead of getting puss , you get this very cheesy inflammatory area , " Wolff said .
" You get chronic infection that just does n't go away . "
He said that the actinomycosis - trichomonosis debate showed how his team 's approach differed from other paleopathologists .
" In the past , a lot of comparisons of paleopathological specimens have been made to humans or domesticated animals , " Wolff said , instead of with dinosaurs ' closer relatives , birds and reptiles .
" It makes a lot of sense to look at animals that share a close evolutionary relationship to each other and the diseases that they have .
The approach in this article is to do just that and that 's relatively novel in the paleopathological community . "
Still , not everyone is sold on the new idea about Sue 's holey jaw .
Rega called Wolff 's idea an " intriguing hypothesis " but one that was n't " a perfect match " for the data .
She noted that any disease that can make holes in bone has to stick around for a long time , wearing away at the material .
She does n't see trichomonosis as a good fit on that score .
" What the T - rex symptoms demand is chronically affected animals who do n't recover but who do n't die .
In this way , a long standing disease ( acting like actinomycosis ) fits the data better , " Rega wrote in an email to Wired.com .
" And if trichomonas is indeed the culprit , the natural history of trichomonas suggests it was more chronic and less acute in its non-avian dinosaur phase in the late Cretaceous . "
And some still contend that bite marks could be responsible for the holes , too .
" My suspicion is that it 's not valid , " said Bruce Rothschild , a medical doctor and paleopathologist at the University of Kansas .
Rothschild said the holes in Sue 's jaw look a lot like the marks made by trepanation — the practice of puncturing of the skull — in ancient humans .
" I 'm not saying it was trepanation , " Rothschild said .
" I 'm saying it was a bite . "
And he disputed that the modern examples of presumed trichomonas jaw holes matched up " exactly " with the tyrannosaur fossil holes .
" To me , it 's not exactly the same , " he said .
Rothschild said that the tyrannosaur fossils showed just " a hole with simple infilling , " without the more complex features associated with lesions .
What might be next is looking at dinosaur specimens for other signs of starvation , suggested Thomas Holtz , a tyrannosaur specialist at the University of Maryland .
" I do n't know if you 'd see maybe bone loss as a sign of starvation , " Holtz said .
Wolff said his team could follow up with exactly that type of observation .
Another line of inquiry could run in the molecular direction , trying to determine if parasites like trichomonas did in fact exist 65 millions of years ago .
" I do n't know to what degree anyone can confirm that this particular group of organisms were around during the Cretaceous , " Holtz said .
" We do n't have a fossil record for them . "

If Gordon Brown could think imaginatively , he 'd learn from the government in Iran that there 's a simple way of ensuring he 's never ignored by President Obama again .
Just a couple of nuclear tests without US permission , over the Norfolk Broads or Lake Windermere , and there 'd be international conferences and United Nations resolutions , and Brown could step off a plane surrounded by bodyguards and say " Hey Obama , I see you take notice of me now . "
The Iranian President 's profile has risen massively as a result of the nuclear tests , to the extent that Lindsay Lohan and Lady Gaga are probably screaming at their publicists , " Why have n't you organised ME a photo shoot with my own personal ballistic long - range Shahab - 3 nuclear rocket ?
Look at the New York Times , it 's just Ahmadinejad Ahmadinejad Ahmadinejad . "
The reason for the current alarm , according to every report , is the missile " can reach Israel " .
But given that Israel 's only a couple of countries away from Iran , you 'd expect that , would n't you ?
There can't be much of a market for nuclear weapons that obliterate everything in the vicinity but wo n't travel .
But the politics surrounding nuclear weapons is highly confusing .
During the Cold War we were told the world was being kept safe by such weaponry , as the threat of global annihilation prevented either side from going to war .
So when the United Nations leaders meet the Iranian president they should say , " How many have you got ?
ONE !
That wo n't keep us safe , America 's got 9,400 by itself , we 'd better sort you out a couple of van -loads to even things up . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The other complication is the rule regarding who 's allowed to have them .
The thinking appears to be that Ahmadinejad can't be because this is a man who fiddled his election , prays for holy guidance and tells lies about the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
Nuclear weapons can only be owned by countries that could never be ruled by such a madman .
Also , the Iranian President has said he'd like to destroy Israel .
Whereas the Israelis are much better at playing the game .
Instead of saying they'd like to destroy a country , they just went ahead and tried to do it .
That way everyone knows where they stand , there 's no bad feeling and America will let you keep your 80 nuclear warheads .
The other difference is that , unlike Iran with its defiant " tests " , Israel saw no need to show off about its nuclear capacity .
They kept it entirely secret .
When a citizen leaked news of the weapons programme the government jailed him for 17 years .
Because they did n't feel the need to gloat , which is a much more endearing way to build your arsenal of nuclear warheads .
Ahmadinejad uses these tests to appear powerful to his own population , and defiant against world leaders who insist they 're the only ones who should be trusted with these missiles .
The more hypocritical the Western indignation , the more his strategy works .
Gordon Brown must beg Obama to threaten Britain with sanctions for building nuclear weapons , so Brown can bang his fist and scream he 's going to carry on spending £ 76bn on Trident whatever ANY infidel says , and jointly light the fuse on a cruise missile with Peter Mandelson and the election 's as good as won .

Via ZeroHedge , comes a smoking gun release today from the FDIC .
I mentioned last week that the FDIC , which is essentially broke ( and by the FDIC , I mean , of course , the DIF - the Deposit Insurance Fund which insures customer deposits up to $ 250,000 ) , was discussing a plan to re-fund itself by borrowing from its member banks .
Today 's FDIC press release confirms just that .
" But wait , Kid Dynamite , " you might say , " the release says that the FDIC will have banks prepay 3 years worth of fees . "
Yes - that 's the same as borrowing from the banks .
Sadly , the FDIC wants to go this route , instead of using a special assessment on the banks , because , in their own words :
" Furthermore , any additional special assessment or immediate , large increase in assessment rates would impose a burden on an industry that is struggling to maintain positive earnings overall . "
In plain English , that 's like saying " everyone wants to pretend that the banks are solvent , but if we make them actually pay us extra money , it will make it harder to cover up the fact that the banks are insolvent . "
Thus , we wave a magic wand , and even though the FDIC is asking the banks for 3 years worth of money today , the banks will be able to recognize the cost over 3 years .
Since when do we treat insurance as a depreciating asset ?
It 's not like when you buy an airplane and recognize the cost over 20 years !
There is a simple , unarguable fact : if Citibank pays the FDIC $ 1B TODAY ( I 'm making this number up ) in fees for the next 3 years , Citibank has $ 1B less in cash today .
Not $ 333 MM less in cash - $ 1B less in cash .
The FDIC 's release today is a must read - it contains some serious and scary truths about our national financial situation , despite what the press and the administration have been telling us over the past six months .
Take , for example , this gem :
" Staff ’s current projection of $ 100 billion in failure costs from 2009 through 2013 is higher than staff ’s projection in May of $ 70 billion over the same period .
Projected failures have increased due to further deterioration in the condition of insured institutions , as reflected in the increasing number of problem institutions .
Asset quality problems among insured institutions are not expected to abate in the near - term . "
In plain speak :
While you read headlines every day about the end of the recession , improvement among all metrics , green shoots , and how great it is to have 9.7 % unemployment and over 500 k in new jobless claims weekly , the fact of the matter is that in the last 4 months , the estimate for losses from bank failures over the next 4 years has increased by 43 % !
And guess what - asset quality problems are not expected to abate !
The FDIC also reminds us of their previous time frame for restoring the Deposit Insurance Fund :
" In October 2008 , the Board adopted a Restoration Plan to return the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF or the Fund ) to its statutorily mandated minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 percent within five years .
In February 2009 , given the extraordinary circumstances facing the banking industry , the Board amended its Restoration Plan to allow the Fund seven years to return to 1.15 percent .
In May 2009 , Congress amended the statute governing establishment and implementation of the Restoration Plan to allow the FDIC up to eight years to return the DIF reserve ratio back to 1.15 percent , absent extraordinary circumstances . "
So , last year , the FDIC hoped to replenish the DIF within 5 years .
As reality hit , they adjusted this estimate to a 7 year time frame in February .
Then , in May , despite an epidemic spread of green shoots in the media , the FDIC again extended the estimate of time needed until the DIF was replenished to 8 years .
There is another terrifying tidbit in the FDIC 's release that 's easy to gloss over :
" At the beginning of this crisis , in June 2008 , total assets held by the DIF were approximately $ 55 billion , and consisted almost entirely of cash and marketable securities ( i.e. , liquid assets ) .
As the crisis has unfolded , the liquid assets of the DIF have been used to protect depositors of failed institutions and have been exchanged for less liquid claims against the assets in failed institutions .
As of June 30 , 2009 , while total assets of the DIF had increased to almost $ 65 billion , cash and marketable securities had fallen to about $ 22 billion .
The pace of resolutions continues to put downward pressure on cash balances .
While the less liquid assets in the DIF have value that will eventually be converted to cash when sold , the FDIC ’s immediate need is for more liquid assets to fund near - term failures . "
This is the doozy - the FDIC has been exchanging cash for trash - as banks fail , the FDIC takes assets ( as they 've admitted above : illiquid , presumably low quality paper - perhaps MBS that will turn out worthless ? ) and gives the failed banks cash to protect depositors .
The last sentence of the quote above presumes that in the end , if they wait long enough , these illiquid assets will have value .
The problem is , the FDIC needs cash now , and these assets simply cannot be sold for what we 're pretending they are worth right now .
If you 've been following the crisis , you should realize that this is no different from what the banks the FDIC has NOT yet seized have been hoping - that their trash assets will eventually recover .
Everyone is sitting around extending and pretending , delaying and praying , refusing to mark to market , and keeping their fingers crossed that in the end , these assets will be worth what we pretend they are worth .
What happens if they 're wrong ?
Obviously , I 'm adamantly against continued attempts to hide the health of the banking industry .
The FDIC does n't want to impose special fees on the banks because it's a tough time for the banks , so they concoct a plan to cook the books - they admit this !
They acknowledge that the " prepayment " plan does n't really change the balance of the fund !
" Although the FDIC ’s immediate liquidity needs would be resolved by the inflow of approximately $ 45 billion in cash from the prepaid assessments , it would not initially affect the DIF balance .
The DIF would initially account for the amount collected as both an asset ( cash ) and an offsetting liability ( deferred revenue ) . "
When you pull forward revenue , you 're not improving the long term health of the insurance fund - you 're taking money now , and giving up money later .
We need to have another round of special assessments on the banks to shore up the DIF , write trash assets down to realistic levels , seize the bad banks , take the pain , and then we 'll be able to move on unencumbered by a never ending pile of bad debt .
As we stand now , failed banks have passed their problems on to the other banks , since the FDIC has inherited fantasy assets which are clogging up the balance sheet of its fund .

Writing boot code is useful for many reasons , whether you are :
Developing your own operating system
Developing disk encryption systems
Experimenting and researching
Or even writing a bootkit
While developing the IDA Bochs plugin at Hex - Rays , we had to write a small MBR and we needed a nice and fast way to compile and debug our code .
In the beginning , we were using bochsdbg .exe to debug our code and little by little once we coded the “ Bochs Disk Image loader ” part we could debug the MBR with IDA and Bochs plugin .
Now you may be wondering :
How can I use IDA Bochs plugin to debug my MBR ?
For a quick answer , here are the needed steps :
Prepare a Bochs disk image Prepare a bochsrc file Insert your MBR into the disk image Open bochsrc file with IDA Start debugging
In case you did not know , bochsrc files ( though they are text files ) are handled by the bochsrc.ldw ( IDA Loader ) .
The loader parses the bochsrc file looking for the first “ ata ” keyword then it locates its “ path ” attribute .
In the following example , bochsrc loader will detect “ c.img ” .
romimage : file =$ BXSHARE /BIOS - bochs - latest vgaromimage : file =$ BXSHARE / VGABIOS -lgpl-latest megs : 16 ata0 : enabled=1 , ioaddr1=0x1f0 , ioaddr2=0x3f0 , irq=14 ata0 - master : type=disk , path = " c.img " , mode=flat , cylinders=20 , heads =16 , spt=63 boot : disk ...
After finding the disk image file , the loader will simply create a new segment at 0x7C00 containing the first sector of that file only and then it selects the Bochs debugger ( in Disk Image loader mode ) .
Once the loader is finished you can press F9 and start debugging .
As simple as this sounds , this process is really limited :
What if the MBR loads more code from different sectors ?
( MBR with 2 or more sectors of code )
What about symbol names ?
What if we want to customize and control the MBR loading process ?
Fortunately , IDA Pro provides a rich API ( with the SDK or scripting ) that will allow us to tackle all these issues .
Preparing a Bochs disk image
If you do n’t have a Bochs image ready , please use the bximage .
exe tool to create a disk image .
Preparing bochsrc file
Edit your bochsrc file and add the ata0 ( generated by bximage tool ) line to it , and finally run bochsdbg .exe to verify that you can run Bochs properly ( outside of IDA ) .
If you see the Bochs debugger prompt , you can press “ c ” to continue execution but Bochs will complain because our disk image is not bootable .
( As a new disk image , It lacks the 55 AA signature at the end of the first sector )
Inserting the MBR into the disk image
For your convenience , we included a sample mbr.asm file ready for you to compile .
nasmw -f bin mbr.asm
To insert the mbr into the disk image , we can write a small Python function :
def UpdateImage ( imgfile , mbrfile ) : " " " Write the MBR code into the disk image " " " # open image file f = open ( imgfile , " r+b " ) if not f : print " Could not open image file ! " return False # open MBR file f2 = open ( mbrfile , " rb " ) if not f2 : print " Could not open mbr file ! " return False # read whole MBR file mbr = f2.read ( ) f2.close ( ) # update image file f.write ( mbr ) f.close ( ) return True
Loading bochsrc with IDA
As discussed previously , loading the bochsrc file into IDA is not enough ( see above ) so we need to write another script that acts like a loader :
def MbrLoader ( ) : " " " This small routine loads the MBR into IDA
It acts as a custom file loader ( written with a script ) " " " import idaapi ; import idc ; global SECTOR_SIZE , BOOT_START , BOOT_SIZE , BOOT_END , SECTOR2 , MBRNAME # wait till end of analysis idc. Wait ( ) # adjust segment idc.SetSegBounds ( BOOT_START , BOOT_START , BOOT_START + BOOT_SIZE , idaapi. SEGMOD_KEEP ) # load the rest of the MBR idc.loadfile ( MBRNAME , SECTOR_SIZE , SECTOR2 , SECTOR_SIZE ) # Make code idc.AnalyzeArea( BOOT_START , BOOT_END )
What we did is simply extend the segment from 512 to 1024 ( our sample MBR is 1024 bytes long ) and load into IDA the rest of the MBR code from the compiled mbr.asm binary .
Importing symbols into IDA
When we assemble mbr.asm , a map file will also be generated .
We will write a simple parser to extract the addresses and names from the map file and copy them to IDA :
def ParseMap( map_file ) : " " " Opens and parses a map file Returns a list of tuples ( addr , addr_name ) or an empty list on failure " " " ret = [ ] f = open ( map_file ) if not f : return ret # look for the beginning of symbols for line in f : if line.startswith ( " Real " ) : break else : return ret # Prepare RE for the line of the following form : # 7C1 F 7C1 F io_error r = re.compile ( '\s *( \w+ ) \s*( \w+ ) \s*( \w* ) ' ) for line in f : m = r.match( line.strip ( ) ) if not m : continue ret.append(( int (m.group ( 2 ) , 16 ) , m.group ( 3 ) ) ) return ret def ApplySymbols ( ) : " " " This function tries to apply the symbol names in the database
If it succeeds it prints how many symbol names were applied " " " global MBRNAME map_file = MBRNAME + " .map " if not os.path.exists ( map_file ) : return syms = ParseMap( map_file ) if not len ( syms ) : return for sym in syms : MakeNameEx(sym[ 0 ] , sym [ 1 ] , SN_CHECK|SN_NOWARN ) print " Applied %d symbol ( s ) " % len( syms )
Putting it all together
Now that we addressed all of the issues previously mentioned , let us glue everything with a batch file :
rem Assemble the MBR if exist mbr del mbr nasmw -f bin mbr.asm if not exist mbr goto end rem Update the image file python mbr.py update if not errorlevel 0 goto end rem Run IDA to load the file idaw -c - A - OIDAPython : mbr.py bochsrc rem database was not created if not exist bochsrc.idb goto end if exist mbr del mbr if exist mbr.map del mbr.map rem delete old database if exist mbr.idb del mbr.idb rem rename to mbr ren bochsrc.idb mbr.idb rem Start idag ( without debugger ) rem start idag mbr rem Start IDAG with debugger directly start idag - rbochs mbr echo Ready to debug with IDA Bochs :end
If you noticed , we run IDA twice : the first time we run it and pass our script name to IDAPython ; the script will continue the custom loading process and symbol propagation for us .
The second time we run IDA with the “ - rbochs ” switch telling IDA to open the database and directly run the debugger .
You can still run IDA just once : “ start idag - c - A - OIDAPython : mbr.py bochsrc ” however you do not call Exit ( ) and you turn off batch mode ( with Batch ( ) ) .
And last but not least , how do you debug your MBR code ?

There 's the guy Jeff I work with , real smart guy .
Has a past , though .
One of the things he told me about from his college was too strange not to share .
He told me this story after I told him were my relatives lived .
He and his friends declared war on Sweden .
No , really .
It started when one of his friends wanted to start a Scrabble group , and I forgot what the name was , but the initials were SAAB .
So he tried to register saab.com , only to find it was taken !
By a Swedish car manufacturer , even !
Well , he got mad , and while slightly drunk , declared war on Sweden .
He wrote this letter , formally declaring war on Sweden , and sent it to the Swedish Embassy , The King of Sweden , and SAAB headquarters in Sweden .
The letter outlined their rage at the name SAAB being stolen , and said that they would get their Navy , which consisted of three college guys and a canoe , row to Sweden ( which they anticipated would take a few months ) , and attack in one of Stockholm 's harbors after they had a bite to eat .
A few months later , they got a box from Sweden .
It was from the SAAB headquarters , and it had a letter of its own .
SAAB said that they were sorry the name had been taken , and hoped the package arrived before their Navy departed .
The explained that SAAB did n't just make cars , but engines for military aircraft , and hoped that their contribution of an air force to their Navy war on Sweden would be taken as a formal apology .
The package contained about 100 of those " ready - to - assemble " balsa wood kits of rubber - band driven airplanes .
With the SAAB logo , of course .
That is really cool !
I am glad to say the people at SAAB have a good sense of humor .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson -- the South Carolina Republican who heckled President Obama during his speech to a joint session of Congress -- has raised at least $ 1 million in contributions , a campaign aide confirmed .
Rep. Joe Wilson , R - South Carolina , shouts " You lie ! " during President Obama 's speech Wednesday night .
News of that cash haul comes after Wilson directly asked in a Web video for campaign cash to fend off attacks from political opponents and said he 's standing by his opposition to Democratic efforts at health care reform .
Wilson has come under fire for shouting " you lie " to Obama during the Wednesday night address to Congress on health care reform .
The lawmaker soon apologized for his behavior , viewed by Republicans and Democrats as an ill - mannered breach of political decorum .
The remark energized Wilson 's opponents and supporters , who have been opening their wallets and sending donations to Wilson and Rob Miller , his Democratic opponent in next year 's congressional race .
Miller -- who has reported raking in more than $ 1 million as a result of the outburst -- ran against Wilson last year , losing by 8 percentage points .
It was Wilson 's smallest margin of victory in his five elections to Congress .
In an e-mail to supporters Friday night , Miller said he had raised the money in small contributions in less than 48 hours -- a total that dwarfs the $ 67,000 he has taken in during the entire first half of the year .
Wilson shouted " you lie " after Obama laid out what the congressman said were " bogus claims " about health care reform " spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost . "
" The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts , but by prominent politicians , that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens , " Obama said in his speech .
" Now , such a charge would be laughable if it were n't so cynical and irresponsible .
It is a lie , plain and simple .
Watch CNN's John King and Joe Johns talk about little words and big money »
" There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants .
This , too , is false .
The reforms I 'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally , " Obama said .
It was at that point Wilson made his now - infamous exclamation , sparking boos and Obama 's retort : " It 's not true . "
In a YouTube video released on Thursday , Wilson said , " On these issues , I will not be muzzled , I will speak up and speak loudly against this risky plan . "
He added : " Supporters of the government takeover of health care , and the liberals who want to give health care to illegals , are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan . "

If music is art , these concert posters are just an extension of the artist .
As we showed you in 25 Magnificent Modern Day Movie Illustrations , art is all around us .
What it 's the designer 's job to do , is to create an illustration that not only captures our attention , but more importantly , delivers a message .
The creator is as much an artist as much as he or she is a designer .
What the designers of these concert poster have done so well is keep it simple .
Sometimes it's a clever play on words and other times it 's a familiar symbol .

Smallest exoplanet is shown to be a solid , rocky world
16 September 2009
The search for a habitable exoplanet is one of the holy grails in astronomy .
One of the first steps towards this goal is the detection of terrestrial planets around solar - type stars .
Dedicated programmes , using telescopes in space and on ground , have yielded evidence for hundreds of planets outside of our Solar System .
The majority of these are giant , gaseous planets , but in recent years small , almost Earth - mass planets have been detected demonstrating that the discovery of Earth analogues - exoplanets with one Earth mass or one Earth radius orbiting a solar - type star at a distance of about 1 astronomical unit - is within reach .
A number of techniques are routinely employed in the search for exoplanets : spectroscopic radial velocity , astrometry , microlensing , photometric transits .
Of these , the search for transits - the passage of the exoplanet in front of the parent star - provides unprecedented access to the planet 's physical properties .
In particular , the combination of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements provides direct and very accurate estimates of the planetary mass and radius , and hence mean density .
These parameters in turn provide tight constraints on the composition and physical structure of the planet and hence on the likelihood of the exoplanet being a true Earth analogue .
The CoRoT space mission employs the transit strategy in the search for exoplanets .
Continuous observations , lasting about 150 days each , are made of two large ( 4 square degrees ) regions towards the centre and anti-centre of the Galaxy .
During the first of these observation periods towards the anti-centre ( October 2007 to March 2008 ) , 46 stars exhibited evidence for transits , among them CoRoT - 7 , a main - sequence , close - by ( at a distance of 150 pc ) solar - type star .
Investigation of the data , as described by Alain Léger and colleagues , provided compelling evidence for the presence of an exoplanet .
The discovery was announced earlier this year at which time the analysis of CoRoT data had shown that CoRoT - 7 b ( as the planet is known ) has a diameter less than twice that of Earth making it the smallest exoplanet ( to date ) orbiting a main - sequence star .
The CoRoT data also demonstrated that the planet is about 2.5 million km from its parent star and orbits once every 20.4 hours .
Further progress , and in particular the determination of the planet mass , could only be made by obtaining accurate measurements of the variation in the velocity of the star caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet .
The need for ground - based support observations for CoRoT had always been envisaged and time on the HARPS spectrograph ( at the ESO 3.6 - m telescope at La Silla in Chile ) had been secured as a result of an ESA call for European co-investigators for CoRoT .
Didier Queloz and colleagues describe how almost 70 hours of observations of the CoRoT - 7 system with HARPS finally provided the sought - after result : CoRoT - 7b is one of the lightest exoplanets detected to date with a mass five times that of the Earth .
This puts CoRoT - 7b firmly in the category of " super - Earth " - an exoplanet with a mass between that of Earth and gas giants .
Although about a dozen super - Earths have been detected CoRoT - 7b is the first for which both mass and radius estimates are available .
Combining the radius estimates from CoRoT and the mass estimates from HARPS results in an exoplanet mean density of 5.5 g/cm3 .
There are only three other known planets with similar density : Earth , Mercury and Venus ( Mars is less dense ) which strongly suggests that the planet is a solid , rocky planet .
" We are coming tantalising close to reaching the ultimate goal of detecting a true Earth - like planet , " comments Malcolm Fridlund , ESA CoRoT Project Scientist and member of the CoRoT Science Team .
" This bodes well for future exoplanet search missions , such as the Cosmic Vision candidate , PLATO . "

Es ist Wahlkampf .
Am 27 .
September 2009 finden bundesweit die Bundestagswahlen statt , und alle traditionellen Parteien belügen und betrügen auf jedem erdenklichen Kanal dem Bürger mal wieder so richtig die Hucke voll , um so viele Stimmen wie möglich zu bekommen !
Da ist es den Parteien vollkommen unwichtig , mit welchen Missetaten sie die letzten 4 Jahre für Unrecht gesorgt haben – sie loben sich selbst in den höchsten Tönen , wie erfolgreich sie doch waren .
Schlimmer noch !
Die SPD beispielsweise , bis dato Kuschelpartner der CDU , rügt die CDU dermaßen hochtrabend , dass man glatt vergessen könnte , dass der komplette Ausbau des Überwachungswahns zu großen Teil in Übereinstimmung dieser beiden Parteien beschlossen wurde !
Aber genug der vielen Worte , seit langer Zeit hat der Bürger wieder eine echte Alternative bei der Wahl zwischen Pest , Seuche oder Krebs – in diesem Jahr ist die Piratenpartei in 15 von 16 Bundesländern vertreten , um in diesem Land Politik nicht nur für die Bürger zu machen , sondern auch mit den Bürgern , eben echte Basisdemokratie .
Die Erfolge der Piratenpartei sind seit der Europawahl enorm !
So vervielfachte sich die Mitgliederzahl in Deutschland um das 8 fache auf derzeit über 8.000 Mitglieder , zahlreiche Politiker aus anderen Parteien ( welche dort dem allgemeinen Maulkorbzwang unterlegen waren ) wechselten zu den Piraten , die Akzeptanz im Internet ist ungebrochen weit über der der traditionellen Parteien , und die Uraltparteien fangen bereits an , die Themen der Piraten für eigene Wahlkampfzwecke zu missbrauchen .
So ist die SPD plötzlich ein selbsternannter Rächer der Unterdrückten , die FDP versteht sich als Freiheitskämpfer , und öffentliche Konfrontationen dieser mit den Piraten wird weitestgehend vermieden .
Pressevertreter jeder Sparte tun sich verdammt schwer , die Piratenpartei auch nur zu erwähnen , obwohl diese mittlerweile rund um den Globus vertreten ist , was keine andere Partei bisher geschafft hat !
So müssen die Piraten um jede Erwähnung kämpfen , um in der Öffentlichkeit bekannter zu werden , denn bekannterweise informieren sich ( leider ) viele der Wähler über einschlägige Blätter , und vertrauen den lieblichen und vorgekauten Meinungen der TV - Landschaft , welche auch nur eigene Ziele verfolgt !
So dürften die öffentlich - rechtlichen Sendeanstalten die Piraten fürchten , da die Piraten erklärte Gegner von GEZ - Gebühren sind .
Die privaten Sender wiederherum haben kein Interesse an Berichten mit/über die Piraten , weil das Thema Urheberrechte gerade für die privaten Sender ein äußerst lukrativer Einnahmenbereich darstellt .
Umso einleuchtender ist auch die Haltung des TV - Senders Pro7 , speziell des Herrn Stefan Raab , welcher in seiner kommenden Sendung am 26 .
September 2009 „ TV TOTAL BUNDESTAGSWAHL “ sich beharrlich weigert , auch den Piraten einen Platz zu gewähren .
Begründung :
„ Spitzenkandidaten einer jeden Partei , welche DERZEIT im Bundestag vertreten ist “
Gleichermaßen wirbt ProSieben - Geschäftsführer
Thilo Proff : „ Laut Statistischem Bundesamt geht jeder dritte Wahlberechtigte unter 30 Jahren nicht zur Wahl .
Als erfolgreichster TV - Sender der jungen Mediengeneration will ProSieben genau diese Altersgruppe motivieren , von ihrem Wahlrecht als wichtigstem Instrument der Demokratie Gebrauch zu machen . “
Da sieht man mal die Scheinheiligkeit in voller Bandbreite !
Auf der einen Seite soll mit dieser Spaßsendung ( als mehr kann man diese nach dieser Aussage nicht mehr betrachten , denn sie knüpft lückenlos an der jahrzehntelangen Tradition an , die Bürger nur soweit zu informieren , wie man selbst davon profitieren kann ) der Erst - und Nichtwähler angesprochen werden , aber andererseits versucht man diesen , die traditioniellen Parteien als die einzigsten wählbaren Parteien zu verkaufen .
Pro7 scheint das Internet ebenso wenig begriffen zu haben , wie unsere Altpolitiker , die lieber die Freiheit jedes einzelnen Bürgers opfern , um für den Staat noch mehr Sicherheit zu schaffen , und noch mehr Überwachung einzuführen !
Die Piraten bedauern die undemokratische Haltung von Pro7 und verurteilen das als bewusste Beeinflussung der Erst- , Nicht - und Altwähler .
Auch aus dem Hintergrund , dass bei Wahlkämpfen jede Partei gleich zu behandeln ist , ist die Entscheidung von Pro7 nicht erklärbar und auch nicht zu akzeptieren !
Im Forum von TV TOTAL gibt es bereits mehrere Threads , in welchen heiss zu der Entscheidung diskutiert wird .
Wir fordern Pro7 und auch Stefan Raab hiermit nochmals auf , auch den Piraten einen Platz zu stellen , da die Piraten über soviel Popularität verfügen , dass ein Einzug in den Bundestag mittlerweile realistischer ist , als dass die traditionellen Parteien auch nur ein einziges Wahlversprechen nach der Wahl einhalten !

More than half of the internet ’s top websites use a little known capability of Adobe ’s Flash plug - in to track users and store information about them , but only four of them mention the so - called Flash cookies in their privacy policies , UC Berkeley researchers reported Monday .
Unlike traditional browser cookies , Flash cookies are relatively unknown to web users , and they are not controlled through the cookie privacy controls in a browser .
That means even if a user thinks they have cleared their computer of tracking objects , they most likely have not .
What ’s even sneakier ?
Several services even use the surreptitious data storage to reinstate traditional cookies that a user deleted , which is called ‘ re - spawning ’ in homage to video games where zombies come back to life even after being “ killed , ” the report found .
So even if a user gets rid of a website ’s tracking cookie , that cookie ’s unique ID will be assigned back to a new cookie again using the Flash data as the “ backup . ”
Even the Whitehouse.gov showed up in the report , with researchers reporting they found a Flash cookie with the name “ userId . ”
The site does say in its privacy policy that it uses tracking technology but it does not mention Flash or tell users how to get rid of the Flash cookie .
The report is being submitted Monday as a comment in the government ’s proceeding about the use of cookies on federal websites .
Federal websites have traditionally been banned from using tracking cookies , despite being common around the web — a situation the Obama administration is proposing to change as part of an attempt to modernize government websites .
But the debate should n’t be about allowing browser cookies or not , according Ashkan Soltani , a UC Berkeley graduate student who helped lead the study .
“ If users do n’t want to be tracked and there is a problem with tracking , then we should regulate tracking , not regulate cookies , ” Soltani said .
The study also comes as Congress and federal regulators are looking at ways of reining in the online tracking and advertising industry , whose attempts at self - regulation have conspicuously failed to make the industry transparent about when , how and why it collects data about internet users .
Websites and advertisers track users closely in order to improve services and to prove to advertisers that an ad has been shown one time to 1 million users , and not 10 times to the same 100,000 people .
Ad networks also collect the information in order to segment users into different groups , such as “ car fanatic ” or “ fashionista , ” in order to charge advertisers a premium for reaching just the slice of the populace that the company thinks will be most receptive to its ad .
Smelling possible regulation coming , third party ad networks recently agreed to an updated voluntary code of conduct , though it prohibits little and has no enforcement mechanism .
For instance , when it comes to sensitive health information , the networks are free to collect as much information as they like , so long as it does not involve an actual prescription .
Soltani led a summer research team at Berkeley , under the direction of Chris Hoofnagle , the Director of Information Privacy Programs at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology .
The team tested the top 100 sites to see what their privacy policies said , what their tracking technology actually does and what happens if a user blocks the Flash cookie .
The study found that 54 of the top 100 set Flash cookies , which vary from simply setting audio preferences to tracking users by a unique identifier .
Wired.com , for instance , placed on this writer ’s work computer to set the volume of a video player .
Adobe ’s Flash software is installed on an estimate 98 percent of personal computers , and has been a key component in the explosion of online video , powering video players for sites such as YouTube and Hulu .
Websites can store up to 100 K of information in the plug - in , 25 times what a browser cookie can hold .
Sites like Pandora.com also use Flash ’s storage capability to preload portions of songs or videos to ensure smooth playback .
All modern browsers now include fine - grained controls to let users decide what cookies to accept and which to get rid of , but Flash cookies are handled differently .
These are fixed through a web page on Adobe ’s site , where the controls are not easily understood ( There is a panel for Global Privacy Settings and another for Website Privacy Settings — the difference is unclear ) .
In fact , the controls are so odd , the page has to tell you that it is the control , not just a tutorial on how to use the control .
This so - called behavioral targeting is coming under scrutiny , in part since Google bought one of the largest practitioners — DoubleClick — and recently announced it would start using its troves of user data to deliver targeted ads .
Its main money makers , the small text ads next to search results and on websites across the net , simply rely on the words in a search or on a webpage to place ads , a tactic known as contextual ads .
Defenders of behavioral ads say that privacy should n’t be a concern since cookies really identify a browser , not a person .
Moreover , they argue that users would prefer to have relevant ads .
Targeted Behavioral
Ads could also help save online journalism .
Under this theory , Google text ads do n’t work on a news story about the governor raising the sales tax , since there ’s no product that goes with that context .
But if the site knew the reader was in the market for a car , it could show an ad for the new Lexus and earn much more .
The report names two companies , Clearspring and QuantCast , as companies whose technologies reinstate cookies for other websites .
Clearspring , the makers of the popular AddThis tool that lets users share a link by e-mail or on social networking sites , used its Flash cookie to reinstated deleted browser cookies for AOL.com , Answers.com and Mapquest.com , according to the report .
The company defends its behavior , saying everyone uses Flash cookies these days , that it discloses its use of Flash in its privacy policy and that the copying of data back into cookies is a simply way to speed up pages by transferring data into HTML cookies , which browsers read faster .
Clearspring ’s AddThis tool is used by more than 300,000 publishers and the company collects data on some 525 million unique internet users monthly , according to Clearspring CEO Hooman Radfar .
The data will soon be used to personalize the AddThis widget , making it so that a user who has previously shared a story by Twitter and Friendfeed will see those options first , rather than social networks he does n’t use .
“ We have the president , the pope and the queen of England using us , ” Hooman told Wired.com in an interview a few weeks ago .
“ If they can trust us , then you can . ”

A faulty cash machine in west London has given people twice as much money as they asked for , free of charge .
The machine at a Tesco , in Hounslow , developed a fault for a number of hours which replaced every £ 10 note they requested with a £ 20 note .
Queues formed at the machine as the mistake became evident on 13 August .
A spokeswoman for Tesco , which operates the cash machine , said it would not try to recoup the money , adding it was not known how much extra money was taken .
The spokeswoman said : " As soon as we were made aware that one of our cash machines was dispensing £ 20 notes instead of tens we immediately closed the machine . "
She added : " This was thankfully an extremely rare , operational error . "
This country was founded and designed as a republic and as such designated individuals with rights to be ensured and protected other individuals voted into power .
We are losing that concept of the individual and the individuals rights .
With the Large Hadron Collider set to start up in November , a new book takes you inside the world 's largest and most powerful particle accelerator .
Paul Halpern has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and is a professor at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia .
He is the author of 13 popular science books , including Cosmic Wormholes and the Cyclical Serpent .
Read an exclusive excerpt from his latest book , Collider .
Physicist Paul Halpern explores the past , present and intriguing future of high - energy particle physics in Collider .
He explains what all the hubbub surrounding the LHC is about and why physicists are pretty much beside themselves with anticipation .
Wired.com spoke with Halpern about what the LHC may find and how the United States failed in its quest for its own giant collider .
Wired.com :
We hear a lot about the Higgs boson and whether it will be found in the U.S. by Fermilab 's Tevaton or at CERN ( European Organization for Nuclear Research ) by the LHC .
What ’s so great about the Higgs ?
Paul Halpern :
In the 1970s the Standard Model was developed , which is a way of uniting electromagnetism with the weak force .
It predicts certain types of particles : the W and Z bosons as the carriers of the weak force , and the Higgs boson as a mechanism for explaining why the W and Z bosons are so much heavier than the photons , which are massless .
The Higgs boson is the only known way to explain the great disparity between masses , and theoretical physics works best when you assume that all particles have equal mass .
Fields theory imagines that at some fundamental level , at highest energies all particles are essentially interacting points which have zero mass , and that somehow something created a disparity , and that was the Higgs field .
The Higgs field is just something that fills up all of space , and it has a free parameter kind of like a roulette wheel that can spin in any direction .
Somehow when the temperature of the universe cooled beyond a certain amount there was a phase transition , and the Higgs field became locked in one direction , shared by the entire Higgs field across space in lockstep .
Once the Higgs field locked into that phase , first of all that set the lowest energy of the universe , and secondly that energy was translated into a
mass which was given to certain particles .
These were particles that interacted with the Higgs field , and these included the W and Z bosons but also the quarks and leptons that make up matter .
These acquired mass , and it explains why everything around us except for photons has mass .
And just like ice freezing into patterns , the universe froze into certain patterns , and these patterns meant the acquisition of mass by certain particles .
The Higgs that scientists are looking for is kind of a remnant of the original Higgs field .
It 's kind of a leftover , a relic .
Wired.com : Was it worth building an $ 8 billion collider to find the Higgs boson ?
Halpern :
Well , that ’s only one of the uses for the collider .
Another use is to look for what are called the minimally supersymmetric Standard Model particles , which is a fancy way of saying particles that are expected to be slightly higher mass than known particles but that occupy a kind of mirror world .
So in our world , photons , which are a type of boson , carry force , W and Z particles carry force , and things called gravitons and gluons also carry force .
And quarks and leptons are the building blocks of matter .
But there ’s no reason to assume that this division always existed .
Perhaps early on in the universe , there was one type of particle which was kind of a combination of matter and force carrying particles .
That would mean there must be companions of quarks and leptons which are like them but with certain opposite properties ...
We ’re looking for the lowest energy ones because it ’s predicted that some of them will have masses that might be able to be detected in colliders .
No one ’s hoping to find all the supersymmetric companions , but if we could just find the lowest energy ones , then people who believe in supersymmetry will know that they ’re on the right track .
But so far there ’s absolutely no evidence for supersymmetry and theorists have been talking about it since the 1970s .
Supersymmetry plays a role in what ’s called string theory too .
And if supersymmetry is not true , than that rules out certain types of string theory .
Wired.com :
What else could the LHC find ?
Halpern :
The other reason for looking for these supersymmetric companions is to try to find the elusive particles that make up what 's called dark matter .
Astronomers know that much of the universe is missing .
In fact , if you add up all the energy and mass in the universe , 95 percent is invisible .
Only 5 percent is known visible matter including everything around us , atoms and so forth , and 95 percent is either dark energy or dark matter .
Dark energy meaning repulsive type of energy which is pushing the universe apart and dark matter meaning a type of matter which is exerting a gravitational pull on galaxies but we do n't see it .
The reason astronomers believe in dark matter is because if you just take visible matter , then the stars on the edges of galaxies ought to be moving a lot slower than they are .
Another piece of evidence is that galaxies ought to be less tightly clustered than they are .
So for example , if you look at our galaxy and the neighboring galaxies , and you predict how much pull they should exert on each other , there 's something missing .
There 's some missing glue that 's holding the galaxies together into clusters .
Wired.com :
How big a blow was it to American science to lose the Superconducting Super Collider ?
Halpern : I know a professor who left a long - standing tenured university position , where he was a full professor and highly respected , to get a job at the SSC .
And then after resigning from his job which he had his whole life , the SSC was canceled and he could n't go back to his original position .
He had to take a job at a small college .
And I 'm sure there are many stories like that .
There are many people whose careers were completely severed because of the SSC , from the support staff all the way up to the professors plus students who were planning to use that material for dissertations and things like that .
It had a huge impact first of all on the perception of the United States I think .
In recent years the perception that the United States is on the leading edge of science has waned , especially in high - energy physics .
So Europe has renewed vigor , renewed centrality in science .
And that , coupled with the unfortunate disasters and setbacks in NASA , lent a double blow to the perception of American science .
When I went over to CERN to interview scientists , I met someone who was involved with the SSC but then came over to CERN .
He was very cynical about American science and said a big difference between Europe and the United States is that in the United States budgets are year to year , and in recent years there 's been no long - term commitment so there 's no kind of budget which can be planned 10 years in advance .
Whereas for CERN , European governments commit a certain amount of money every year and then the CERN board decides what that money is used for .
So the CERN board can plan 10 years in advance .
CERN is already planning upgrades to the LHC and so forth .
Whereas with the SSC everything was done year to year , and whether or not it would get funding or how much funding , that was up for grabs every single year .
Wired.com :
Is the LHC the last super collider we 're going to see ?
Halpern :
They 're talking about a linear collider , which is the ILC , International Linear Collider .
That 's in the early planning stages and that would n't be a ruing that would involve two linear accelerators colliding particles with each other which would require a lot of land .
But the advantage of the linear colliders is that they can narrow down the energies and thus narrow down the masses more precisely .
With the LHC they can't really enlarge the ring or build a new ring .
There 's just no room , they 're up against the mountains .
So one side is the mountains , the other side is Geneva .
So unless they can get rid of the mountains or get rid of Geneva there 's no place to enlarge the ring .
But what they can do is replace the magnets .
So they 're planning to replace the magnets sometime in the next decade and upgrade it and that will be the super LHC .
And the reason that will improve things is because with stronger magnets they can improve the luminosity and luminosity means improving the chances of collision .
__Wired.com : __Have we ceded the lead in high - energy physics for good ?
Halpern : Never say never .
It could be the case that in an era in which the American budget deficit is reduced , or perhaps we even have a surplus again someday , somewhere down the line American scientists will start to push for an increase in funds toward high - energy physics .
But right now the clout of high - energy physics is fairly low because of the shift towards Europe .
Unfortunately it means a lot for the American educational system .
We 're going to have at least a generation of students in the United States who wont be able to have much hands - on experience with particle physics .
And if they want to become a high - energy physicist , they know they 're going to have to spend time in Europe or else just be computer analysts .
If they want equipment experience they 'll have to go to Europe or else they can just get data channeled from Europe to the United States and just analyze the data and do everything remotely .
So I kind of fear for the future of high - energy physics because traditionally experimentalists had a lot of hands - on experience with detectors and could produce the hardware .
But then they would also get experience with the software and with the computer programming and analysis .
However , nowadays it 's harder and harder for people to get detector experience because once a detector is sealed up , people can't really interact with it .
Then you have people who are in other countries analyzing the data who have very little chance of interacting with the equipment .
So what would happen is , if let 's say there needs to be a new generation of detectors or a new gen of accelerators , that there might be very little experience among the next generation of students .
I think it 's gonna be a real problem because you need well - trained people in order to troubleshoot and to suggest new devices and so forth ; now perhaps people will be able to do it from a theoretical knowledge from studying the older systems and so forth but I think hands - on experience has been really critical to particle physics so far .
So for instance , the people who work in the LHC for the most part , the leaders there are people who worked with much smaller detectors at Fermilab and at the SPS and so forth and know exactly how everything fits together .
__Wired.com : __What would it mean to the U.S. if the Tevatron were to find the Higgs boson before the LHC ?
Halpern : I think it would give a new boost to American high - energy physics .
But it could be a short - lived boost , because then the question would be will we channel money into some kind of extension to Fermilab or a new accelerator , or will the next discoveries be in Europe ?
But I think what 's going to happen ultimately is that everything 's going to be international .
I think that 's the direction that big science is going , that no one country can afford projects .
Countries do n't want to invest in national projects , they want to invest in international projects .
That was part of the problem with the SSC .
It was sort of an American project , but we wanted it to be international and we wanted to get other countries to invest in us .
Whereas the ILC is genuinely international in that the site has n't been chosen yet and it could be any country , and countries are expected to donate ; everybody who 's involved is expected to make a donation so it 's more equal .

I had pretty much decided that I had said all I have to say about stated income loans with this post , but now that , per Chevy Chase , IT'S BACK ! , I 'm going to say one more thing .
Then I 'm done .
Apologists for stated income always bring us back to this so - called " classic " loan involving a self - employed borrower who " needs " a stated income loan because income is hard to verify or , you know , the tax returns do n't " show the whole picture . "
This is never , really , actually , an argument about why stating rather than verifying income is necessary , although it pretends to be .
It 's really about why people with volatile income or a preference for not paying taxes on their income should get the " benefit " of financing on the same terms as wage - slaves and people who do n't cheat on their taxes .
That argument will end just before the sun freezes , so I 'm not at all interested in participating in it .
My big problem with stated income lending has never really been about the wisdom or importance or lack thereof of making mortgage loans to the self - employed .
My problem has to do with elemental safety and soundness of lenders , in a way that may not be obvious , so I 'm going to hammer it for a bit .
Let us take the " classic " stated income hypothetical loan : the borrower is self - employed , has been for years and years , is buying a house , and has some trouble verifying income .
Imagine that everything else about the loan is just groovy : high FICO , big down payment , lots of cash reserves after closing , scout badges out the wazoo .
I 'm not " stacking the deck " here .
This looks like a super loan in all respects , except that question about whether there is sufficient current income to service the borrower 's debts , or reason to believe that current income will last long enough to get past payment three or so .
We can make this loan in one of two ways :
1 . We go " stated income . "
The borrower provides no tax returns , and just happens to state income sufficient to produce a debt - to - income ratio of 36 % , which just so happens to be the maximum traditional cut - off for " acceptable risk . "
2 . We go " full doc , " and the underwriter does a complete income analysis .
In writing , on the sacred 1008 ( the Underwriting Transmittal in the file ) , the underwriter fully discusses the business and its cash flow , noting that a 24 - month averaging of income is producing a DTI of 68 % .
However , the underwriter believes that cash flow trend is positive , that there are documented reasons to believe it will continue , that the borrower has sufficient personal cash assets not needed for the business to supplement income for debt service , and hence this high DTI is justified .
The 1008 of course is countersigned by a senior credit officer , because it is an exception to normal lending rules -- the DTI is too high -- and also because we are doing our required Fair Lending monitoring , making sure that the exceptions we make are made fairly , not just to rich white folks or folks in certain zip codes , but to anyone who qualifies for them .
Either way , it 's the same loan , but Number 1 was more " efficient . "
Same risk , right ?
Wrong .
The default risk of the individual loan is only one risk .
There 's another huge looming risk created in Number 1 that we keep ignoring .
What happens if the loan performs just fine for a while ?
Well , if it 's held by a financial institution , that institution will be subject to periodic safety and soundness and regulatory compliance examinations .
One major point of those exams is to make sure the institution is holding sufficient reserves and capital against its loan portfolio .
Among other things , an examiner might look at some reports of loan activity .
And on reports , Number 1 looks like a low - risk loan with a 36 % DTI .
Number 2 catches someone 's attention .
But , you say , would n't an examiner 's attention be caught by the fact that Number 1's " doc type code " is stated , making it the kind of apparent higher risk worth a look at the loan file ?
Well , not if we started this whole thing by having assumed that there 's no additional risk in stated income if other loan characteristics are good enough .
The whole circular argument -- stated is OK for OK loans -- means that this will be considered one of those " not high risk " stated income loans , because all the other data points ( FICO , DTI , LTV , etc. ) look good .
The odds , therefore , that Number 2 would get further review are high , because it stands out as an exception loan with a high DTI .
The odds that Number 1 would get further review are no better or worse than random .
And for any other purpose , such as counterparty due diligence , investor approval , um , servicer ratings , etc. , that relies on aggregated data , Number 1 is n't going to make the institution 's average DTI look worse , while Number 2 will .
It matters if you write enough of those loans .
And what does the institution risk by having an auditor or examiner take a look at the file for Number 2 ?
Why , the risk is that the auditor or examiner will not agree with that analysis , or will find the documentation unconvincing , or will be troubled by an apparent over - willingness to make exceptions or something .
This is how the game is played : the loan shows up on some examination problem report , management is forced to respond with a memo defending its underwriting practices , and possibly even more loans get reviewed as the examiners seek potential evidence that whatever they do n't like about that file is part of a pattern .
Any stray skeletons you might have in your loan file closet ( and everyone has a few loans they rather wish they had n't made , or had handled better when they made them ) get dragged out onto the conference room table .
Number 1 , in other words , does n't attract scrutiny .
And what happens if it actually goes bad ?
Well , with Number 1 , it's " clearly " the borrower 's fault .
He or she lied , and we can pursue a deficiency judgment or other measures with a clear conscience , because we were defrauded here .
We can show the examiners and auditors how it 's just not our fault .
The big bonus , if it 's a brokered or correspondent loan , is that we can put it back to someone else , even if we actually made the underwriting determination .
No rep and warranty relief from fraud , you know .
With Number 2 ?
There is no way the lender can say it did not know the loan carried higher risk .
Of course , higher - risk loans do fail from time to time , and no one has to engage in excessive brow - beating over it , if you believed that what you did when you originally made the loan was legit .
If you 're thinking better of it now , at least with Number 2 you have an opportunity to see where your underwriting practice or assumptions about small business analysis went wrong .
For anyone using loan servicing databases to research risk factors , of course , Number 1 might cause the conclusion to be drawn that stated income is a risk independent of other loan features .
Number 2 might cause the conclusion to be drawn that 68 % DTIs just do n't work out well on the whole .
You could , of course , go back and update the system with Number 1 , after it fails and your QC people get around to finding the true income numbers , so that the database will show the true ratio of 68 % , but that gets you to the catching - examiner - attention problem above .
And what about Fair Lending compliance ?
Insofar as a lot of stated income lending is just a way around having to make a formal exception to your lending policies , it 's a good way of hiding certain patterns in terms of who you let get away with what .
We do ourselves no good by thinking that the current environment -- in which any marginal risk can get a stated loan -- is the permanent environment .
Structural ways to avoid showing your exception patterns invite abuse .
I have said before that stated income is a way of letting borrowers be underwriters , instead of making lenders be underwriters .
When I say make lenders be lenders , I do n't mean let 's not regulate them .
I have no problem with regulatory examinations ; far from it .
I am someone whose signature ( usually , in fact , as that second sign - off ) has appeared on exactly these kinds of loans , and whose butt has been on the line for them .
We all face having loans we approved go bad ; the world works that way .
What the stated income lenders are doing is getting themselves off the hook by encouraging borrowers to make misrepresentations .
That is , they 're taking risky loans , but instead of doing so with eyes open and docs on the table , they 're putting their customers at risk of prosecution while producing aggregate data that appears to show that there is minimal risk in what they 're doing .
This practice is not only unsafe and unsound , it 's contemptible .
We use the term " bagholder " all the time , and it seems to me we 've forgotten where that metaphor comes from .
It did n't used to be considered acceptable to find some naive rube you could manipulate into holding the bag when the cops showed up , while the seasoned robbers scarpered .
I 'm really amazed by all these self - employed folks who keep popping up in our comments to defend stated income lending .
It is a way for you to get a loan on terms that mean you potentially face prosecution if something goes wrong .
Your enthusiasm for taking this risk is making a lot of marginal lenders happy , because you 're helping them hide the true risk in their loan portfolios from auditors , examiners , and counterparties .
You are n't getting those stated income loans because lenders like to do business with entrepreneurs , " the backbone of America . "
You 're not getting an " exception " from a lender who puts it in writing and takes the responsibility for its own decision .
You 're getting stated income loans because you 're willing to be the bagholder .
And no , this does n't particularly do much for my assessment of your business acumen .
Frankly , I 'd rather see your tax returns and your P&L and hear your story about how investments in the business you have made , with the intent to grow it wisely , have limited your income or made it highly variable , than to see you volunteer to risk prosecution for fraud because , you know , you really need to buy a house .
Do you do business with people like that all the time ?
Are you typically attracted to deals that are claimed to be perfectly legitimate , except that it 's important not to fully disclose certain facts to certain parties ?
Does that maybe explain some of your accounts receivable problems and your pathetic cash flow ?
It certainly seems to be explaining some lenders ' cash - flow problems at the moment .
This is n't just an issue for regulated depositories .
All those claims by securities issuers and raters about how we had no idea that gambling was going on in this joint are directly comparable .
The tough news for the self - employed " respectable " borrower is that I do n't care if you 're individually willing to play bagholder : you can't afford to underwrite that collective risk .
We have a major credit crisis that 's proving that .
The Republicans keep repeating the lie that health care reform will institute “ death panels ” where government bureaucrats will decide who can have treatment and who will die .
So it is interesting to do a reality check and realize that the truth is that we already have death panels , but that they are run by the private insurance companies .
In a shocking new study that is prompting investigations into wrongful business practices , the California Nurses Association analyzed data from California ’s health insurance companies , and found that from 2002 through the first half of 2009 , the health insurance companies rejected 45.7 million claims , which is a stunning 22 % of all claims .
But the bad news is that the rejection rates are going up .
If you only consider the first six months of 2009 , PacifiCare rejected an almost unbelievable 39.6 % of all claims .
Other insurers are not far behind .
In other news from the health care crime syndicate , drug company Pfizer is paying $ 2.3 Billion — the largest criminal fine of any kind ever — for glaring health fraud .
The size of the fine was in part due to the fact that this is Pfizer ’s fourth settlement for illegal activities .
My question is , if corporations are legally treated as persons , should n’t the three strikes law apply to this ?
The President had a big victory this week when the Senate voted to strip funding for additional F - 22 fighter jets , which the Pentagon and the Air Force did n't want , which have n't been flown once in Iraq or Afghanistan and which are apparently vulnerable to rain .
It was a small step toward breaking the stranglehold of the military - industrial complex .
The lobbyists were out in force to keep this alive , and a lot of lawmakers who have parts of the F - 22 made in their district wanted to keep the gravy train going , but eventually , sanity prevailed .
The military budget is increasing this year , and eventually we have to end a circumstance where we spend more on the military than every other country in the world combined , but if we could n't cancel the F - 22 , we would not be able to cancel pretty much anything .
So it was a good step toward lessening the power and influence of military contractors .
Robert Farley has a great roundup of opinions .
Naturally , John Cornyn ( Bugfuck Crazy - TX ) does n't agree .
In fact , he thinks we have to use the F - 22 to counter all sorts of threats .
Including ... India .
" It 's important to our national security because we 're not just fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , " Cornyn says .
" We 're fighting -- we have graver threats and greater threats than that : From a rising India , with increased exercise of their military power ; Russia ; Iran , that 's threatening to build a nuclear weapon ; with North Korea , shooting intercontinental ballistic missiles , capable of hitting American soil . "
I was n't aware that we were at war with India .
In fact , I do n't get over there much , but I 'm pretty sure we 're an ally .
In fact , Hillary Clinton just spent four days there this week .
We just completed a civilian nuclear power agreement with them last year .
I guess being Republican means " never having to say you 're sorry to an allied country for calling them an enemy . "
Remember when John McCain thought we were at war with Spain ?

Five books including a novel by world - renowned Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes have been banned from the public high school curriculum in Puerto Rico because of coarse language , education officials announced Friday .
Proofreaders with the Department of Education raised concerns after reading Fuentes ' " Aura " and four books by Puerto Rican authors , spokesman Alan Obrador said .
The books had been part of the curriculum for 11th graders in recent years .
Juan Rodriguez , academic affairs subsecretary , said some of the questionable words referred to genitalia .
Students " might learn ( those words ) in the street , but we have to watch over the integrity of young people , and we cannot endorse the use of such vocabulary in a classroom , " he said .
There was no immediate reaction from the likes of educators , librarians and parents ' groups following the announcement late Friday .
Fuentes is one of Latin America 's most famed novelists and essayists .
" Aura " ( 1962 ) tells the story of a man who falls in love with the young niece of his boss .
The other banned books are " Antologia personal , " by Jose Luis Gonzalez ; " El entierro de Cortijo , " by Edgardo Rodriguez Julia ; " Mejor te lo cuento : antologia personal , " by Juan Antonio Ramos ; and " Reunion de espejos , " a compilation of essays by Jose Luis Vega .

Mr Jackson , who managed the Jackson Five when Michael was a child , is said to have approached Prince Michael , 12 , Paris , 11 , and seven - year old Prince Michael II - known as Blanket - to appear on stage next year .
News of the tour comes after Mr Jackson told reporters that Paris had shown talent as a performer and that Blanket was a very good dancer .
* Updates at the foot of the post *
We posted a relatively amusing screenshot earlier today which saw a highly embarrassing photo posted to someones Facebook profile .
The photo initially seemed similar to a number of others we ’ve posted over the last year or so , but after a little more digging , it appears there is a sinister underbelly to the photo and many others currently floating around the web .
It seems as though some of message - board site 4 Chan.org ’s elite has managed to acquire a list of Christian Facebook users and quite possibly their passwords too .
In doing so , they ’ve hacked a number of accounts , posted a number of extremely embarrassing photos and messages to Facebook walls , and then continued to comment under the shares – pretending to be the actual account owner .
One example is shown below , and their Facebook profile page is still public :
For the unaware , 4 chan is a place where anyone can anonymously post messages , photos , links , thoughts and because of this , the site is often the source of a number of sinister threads , memes , contests and indeed , plans of attack .
4 Chan is believed to have been the initiator of pornographic attacks on YouTube , DDOS attacks on Scientology ’s website , hacking of Sarah Palin ’s email account , a fake story submitted to CNN about Steve Job ’s heart attack , and many many more .
What makes this very difficult to confirm is that 4 Chan does not offer a search facility , and pages expire after a period of time – meaning the site is very often never held directly accountable for anything .
We do know that the hackers are impersonating the members , posting embarrassing images and messages , and sending private messages to many of their friends .
Some of the private messages are equally vulgar , others seeming to try and help by asking friends to tell the account owner to change their password .
Update 1
It has been confirmed that at least one Christian university has had their server hacked and usernames and passwords stolen .
It ’s quite likely that many of these passwords are the same passwords used on Facebook , making it very easy for hackers to access the site .
Update 2
The list of leaked usernames and passwords is real and we have a copy .
The list contains a list of email addresses and their passwords .
Incidentally , the list appears to have originated from a Christian dating website .
Update 3
We managed to get hold of a folder full of similar screenshots of not just Facebook profiles , but email accounts and other social network profiles too .
4 Chan , or whoever is definitely responsible , really went to town here .
Some of the images posted are incredibly graphic and the language used used awful .
There ’s definitely some elements of humor involved , it is 4 Chan after all , but many people are going to have a lot of explaining to do .
Update 4
It ’s not just Facebook .
More details here .
This is a breaking story , more information will be posted as and when we receive it .

The American Prospect reviewed a couple of books about Wal - Mart , and included this charming anecdote about Wal - Mart founder Sam Walton
Around the time that the young Sam Walton opened his first stores , John Kennedy redeemed a presidential campaign promise by persuading Congress to extend the minimum wage to retail workers , who had until then not been covered by the law .
Congress granted an exclusion , however , to small businesses with annual sales beneath $ 1 million — a figure that in 1965 it lowered to $ 250,000 .
Walton was furious .
The mechanization of agriculture had finally reached the backwaters of the Ozark Plateau , where he was opening one store after another .
The men and women who had formerly worked on small farms suddenly found themselves redundant , and he could scoop them up for a song , as little as 50 cents an hour .
Now the goddamn federal government was telling him he had to pay his workers the $ 1.15 hourly minimum .
Walton 's response was to divide up his stores into individual companies whose revenues did not exceed the $ 250,000 threshold .
Eventually , though , a federal court ruled that this was simply a scheme to avoid paying the minimum wage , and he was ordered to pay his workers the accumulated sums he owed them , plus a double - time penalty thrown in for good measure .
Wal - Mart cut the checks , but Walton also summoned the employees at a major cluster of his stores to a meeting .
" I 'll fire anyone who cashes the check , " he told them .
BERLIN  Usain
Bolt is n't just rewriting the record books ; he 's redefining what the human body can do .
LOOKING AHEAD : Bolt says 200 may not bring record time
Bolt became the first man to run 100 meters in under 9.6 seconds and still left people wondering how fast he can go .
Bolt clocked 9.58 seconds Sunday night , smashing the world record of 9.69 he set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
He won his first IAAF world championships title in the same stadium where Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics .
" I do n't think I 'm in Beijing shape , but I think I 'm in very good shape , " said Bolt , who was in a car accident earlier this year that took away from his training .
Tyson Gay did his part in the highly anticipated showdown , but was overshadowed by the ebullient 6 - 5 Jamaican .
Gay , who is 5 - 11 and wore the U.S. team 's " JO " patch honoring Owens on his singlet , set an American record of 9.71 .
He eclipsed his own mark of 9.77 .
" I 'm really happy that Usain Bolt broke the record , " said Gay , the second - fastest human ever .
" I know that may sound strange , but I knew it was humanly possible for somebody to run that fast .
Unfortunately , it was n't me . "
Gay , who has a groin injury he says is " barely hanging on , " will speak to doctors and determine whether he will try to fend off Bolt in the 200 , starting Tuesday .
Asafa Powell , the former world recordholder from Jamaica , was third in 9.84 .
Bolt took command of the race at about 40 meters .
" He was gone , disappearing , " said Dwain Chambers of Britain , who was sixth in 10.0 .
Chambers expects the world record to fall again next year .
" The kid 's on fire . "
Bolt , who will turn 23 Friday , clipped more time off an existing 100 - meter world record than anyone since electronic timing was introduced in 1968 .
" I think 9.5 is definitely a big thing , " Bolt said .
" I 'm feeling proud . "
Clowning around at the start of the 100 - meter final Sunday , Bolt covered his mouth with his hand , then removed it to reveal a wide grin .
He licked his fingers before smoothing his eyebrows , blew a kiss and nodded vigorously as the public address announcer in the IAAF world championships introduced him .
But unlike Beijing , where Bolt eased up and showboated at the finish of the 100 final , he bulldozed across the line for a world record .
Bolt did sneak a peek on each side , but no one was within his orbit .
And he struck his " lightning " pose after the race as fans waved their yellow foam " Bolt Arms " at him .
" I can have all the fun I want before the race , " the playful Jamaican said .
" When the starter says , ' On your mark , ' I refocus , and then it 's time to go .
I know what I have to do , so there 's no worries . "
And he did it .
With his long stride and quick turnover , Bolt is the perfect example of the way a sprinter should perform .
He got off to a good start — a part of his race he has worked to improve — and took the lead at about 40 meters .
" When I got to the 50 , " Bolt said , " I knew it was going to be hard for anyone to get past me . "
Bolt has said his goal is to be a living legend .
" I think it 's getting there , " he said , " but for me , I do n't think two seasons can do it .
I think I have to do it year after year .
I have to do a lot of hard work , because these guys are going to be coming . "
Gay , whose showdowns with Bolt had been dubbed as the " Grosse Duelle " on Berlin billboards , might not get a chance for revenge in the 200 .
Gay , who won the 100 and 200 in the 2007 world championships , has been hampered by a groin injury that might require surgery after the season .
The 200 rounds start Tuesday .
" There 's some pain right now , and see how it goes tonight , " Gay said .
Bolt is n't predicting a world record in the 200 .
" I 'm going at it to run hard , " he said , " but I think it 's going to be more difficult because I just took Tyson 's 100 - meter championship .
He 's not going to be smiling at me for the 200 meters .
" It 's going to be all fun . "
The women 's 100 is also shaping up as a USA - Jamaica duel .
Kerron Stewart , the 2008 Olympic silver medalist from Jamaica who ran for Auburn University , had the leading time of 10.92 seconds after the second round .
" This is all I can do :
You either give everything or nothing at all , " Stewart said .
Carmelita Jeter , the U.S. champion , was next ( 10.94 ) , followed by two Jamaicans , defending champion Veronica Campbell - Brown ( 10.99 ) and Shelly - Ann Fraser ( 11.02 . ) .
The other two Americans , Lauryn Williams , who ran 11.06 , and Muna Lee , who ran 11.13 , each had season bests .
The final is Monday .
( TV : 1 - 4 p.m. ET , Versus )
In the women 's 400 , Sanya Richards will have to beat her top rival three times in four days to win her first individual world title .
In a rare draw , Richards , the five - time U.S. champ , and Britain 's Christine Ohuruogu , the Olympic gold medalist , found themselves in the same heat Saturday .
They raced again in the semifinals , with Richards winning both .
The final is Tuesday .
Richards suffers from Behcet 's Syndrome , an inflammation of the blood vessels which she said has flared up while she 's been in Berlin .
" They say stress brings it on , " Richards said .
" It does n't get more stressful than this , but I feel fine . "
Christian Cantwell won the first medal for the USA on Saturday .
Cantwell beat Olympic champion Tomasz Majewski of Poland for gold in the shot put .

I 've tried everything to resist but I 'm afraid this post is going to start with a cliche : I 've seen the light .
The shadows have receded .
You get my drift .
Last week incandescent lightbulbs began their long - awaited march out of existence and , at the same time , the next generation of ultra - low - power lightbulb has come a step closer to practicality .
I 'm not talking about the compact fluorescent lightbulbs ( CFLs ) that everyone is busy replacing their energy - wasting incandescents with .
Instead , I mean the bulb that is one technological step beyond CFL , the LED .
Until now , LEDs have been a disappointment for everyday use but Philips has come up with a new bulb that will hopefully make the doubters shut up .
As part of my plans to green my house and , in preparation for the departure of the age of the incandescent bulb , I 've been researching the best way to replace the lights in my home with low - energy alternatives .
Some would say I 've been quite boring and obsessive about this – but never let it be said that I 'd let this research go to waste .
It 's easy enough to find CFL replacements for the bayonet and screw - cap sockets in living rooms and bedrooms .
The range of reliable bulbs in various shapes , sizes and brightnesses has bloomed in recent years and their prices keep getting lower .
( Actually , the prices are a steal – I replaced a bunch of bulbs at my parents ' home recently and managed to buy 10 good - quality CFLs for 50p ) .
More problematic are the lights in my kitchen and bathroom .
These were a mixture of halogen spotlights with GU10 sockets and R50 reflector bulbs with screw caps .
All were at least 50W each and they all had to go .
As Russell Smith of Eco Parity Solutions found in the energy survey of my house a few months back , the carbon footprint of my electricity consumption was vast , and most of it was used in my lighting .
First things first , I looked for direct replacements for the R50 reflector bulbs .
Megaman , a reliable source of low - energy lights , makes some but they 're not easy to find even in specialist DIY shops , so not the most accessible option .
Another route I considered was to get all the light sockets in the kitchen and bathroom replaced with standard GU10 sockets if I could find a reliable halogen - replacement .
After some experimenting , I settled on 11W Megaman spotlights : they 're slightly longer than halogen bulbs but still fit in the standard sockets .
In total , I replaced 17 incandescent 50 W bulbs with 11W CFL spotlights , each costing around £ 9 .
But something still niggled .
Before settling on the Megaman spotlights I had flirted with LEDs .
Tempted by their even lower power consumption ( sometimes just 2 - 3 W )
I even bought a few to test out .
But , as anyone who 's gone down this road will testify , LEDs are still expensive and , overall , unimpressive .
The bulbs I got were very dim indeed and the light was an ultra - harsh blueish - white .
They were n't cheap – at around £ 10 each – and the only thing they had going for them was that they come on straight away .
Even the Megaman CFLs I eventually settled on take around 30 seconds to get to full brightness from a cold start .
But this just was n't enough to persuade me to use them .
But how quickly things change .
This month , Philips unveiled its new range of LED bulbs .
I was sceptical that they'd be any better than the several I had tried already but , well , something has definitely changed in this technology .
The 3W Econic spotlight is a direct replacement for the ubiquitous 35 W halogen bulb and claims to have the same light output .
When I tried it out , I found that Philips was n't exaggerating .
This is brighter than any other LED I 've come across .
Putting two in our small shower room , after a while I forgot that the bulbs were not halogens .
There are some slight issues .
The light is whiter than is ideal but by no means harsh ( I would n't , for example , have any problems using an array of these bulbs in my kitchen and bathroom but probably not bedrooms and lounges ) .
Then there 's the upfront cost , which is very steep – each Econic bulb comes in at £ 25 .
But the manufacturers claim the bulb will keep going for 15 years .
Given the electricity savings over that period too , this might be an investment worth making .
This new range from Philips also includes some candle - shaped bulbs and a screw - cap bulb too .
The most interesting thing about the Econic and its new stablemates is that finally here 's an LED bulb worth talking about .
The technology will no doubt get better and cheaper .
So who 's to say that , within a few years , we 're not all using LEDs to reduce the cost of lighting our homes to mere pennies ?
Reducing the carbon footprint of lighting to virtually nothing seems tantalisingly close .
Only the desire to recover some imaginary good from the tragedy that was empire can explain the elevation of the neoconservative ideologue Niall Ferguson to chief imperial historian on the BBC and now Channel 4 .
His aggressive rewriting of history , driven by the messianic fantasies of the American right , is being presented as a new revelation .
In fact , Ferguson 's " history " is a fairytale for our times which puts the white man and his burden back at the centre of heroic action .
Colonialism - a tale of slavery , plunder , war , corruption , land - grabbing , famines , exploitation , indentured labour , impoverishment , massacres , genocide and forced resettlement - is rewritten into a benign developmental mission marred by a few unfortunate accidents and excesses .
Soundbite culture thrives on these simplistic grand narratives .
Half - truths and fanciful speculation , shorn of academic protocols such as footnotes , can sound donnishly authoritative .
The racism institutionalised by empire also seems to be back in fashion .
The book accompanying Ferguson 's current Channel 4 series on 20th - century history , The War of the World , tells us that people " seem predisposed " to " trust members of their own race " , " those who are drawn to ' the Other ' may ... be atypical in their sexual predilections " and that " when a Chinese woman marries a European man , the chances are relatively high ... that only the first child they conceive will be viable . "
Not far from the pseudo - scientific nonsense that once made it possible to punish interracial relationships .
Behind such talk and the embrace of the broadcasters is the insistence that we are being offered gutsy truths that the " politically correct " establishment would love to suppress .
This is the neo-conservative as spunky rebel against liberal tyranny .
Yet Ferguson peddles nothing more than the most hackneyed , self - aggrandising myths of empire , canards once championed by old imperialists such as Macaulay and Mill and rehashed now by the Bush administration : western imperialism brings freedom , democracy and prosperity to primitive cultures .
The myth decorates US and British foreign policy spin while trendier versions have also emerged in platforms such as the Euston Manifesto .
By anointing Ferguson and his fellow imperial apologists such as Andrew Roberts as semi-official historians , the British media are colluding in a dangerous denial of the past and lending support to contemporary US imperial propaganda .
The evidence - researched by scholars such as Amartya Sen , Nicholas Dirks , Mike Davis and Mahmood Mamdani , Caroline Elkins and Walter Rodney - shows that European colonialism brought with it not good governance and freedom , but impoverishment , bloodshed , repression and misery .
Joseph Conrad , no radical , described it as " a flabby , pretending , weak - eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly " .
Good governance ?
More famines were recorded in the first century of the British Raj than in the previous 2,000 years , including 17 - 20 million deaths from 1896 to 1900 alone .
While a million Indians a year died from avoidable famines , taxation subsidising colonial wars , and relief often deliberately denied as surplus grain was shipped to England .
Tolerance ?
The British empire reinforced strict ethnic / religious identities and governed through these divisions .
As with the partition of India when 10 million were displaced , arbitrarily drawn boundaries between " tribes " in Africa resulted in massive displacement and bloodshed .
Freedom and fair play ?
In Kenya , a handful of white settlers appropriated 12,000 square miles and pushed 1.25 million native Kikuyus to 2,000 restricted square miles .
Resistance was brutally crushed through internment in detention camps , torture and massacres .
Some 50,000 Kikuyus were massacred and 300,000 interned to put down the Mau Mau rebellion by peasants who wanted to farm their own land .
A thousand peaceful protesters were killed in the Amritsar massacre of 1919 .
A collective failure of the imagination now makes it difficult for us to think about the globe before European and American domination .
Greed and violence are hardly exclusive to one culture .
But colonialism destroyed or strangled possibilities and potential for progress , such as Mughal Emperor Akbar 's " sul - e- kul " or " universal good " which underpinned his governance .
The scale of European imperialism inaugurated a new chapter in the history of greed which still shapes all our lives .
Natural resources - cotton , sugar , teak , rubber , minerals - were plundered in gigantic quantities .
The Indian textile industry was the most advanced in the world when the British arrived ; within half a century it had been destroyed .
The enslaved and indentured ( at least 20 million Africans and 1.5 million Indians ) were shipped across the globe to work on plantations , mines and railroads .
The stupendous profits deriving from this enabled today 's developed world to prosper .
The point is n't for Europeans to feel guilt , but a serious consideration of historical responsibility is n't the same thing as a blame game .
Forgetting history is tempting but undermines a society 's capacity for change .
Among the many facile assumptions encouraged by these imperial apologists is that those who criticise colonialism are absolving tyrants and bigots in Asia and Africa from responsibility for their crimes .
Of course it is possible and absolutely necessary to condemn both .
Indians must acknowledge their culpability for atrocities during the partition , for example .
But that in no way exonerates the British Raj from its pivotal role in the tragedy that led to over a million deaths .
A wilful ignorance of other people 's cultures and histories encourages the notion that freedom , democracy and tolerance are intrinsically western .
As Amartya Sen has argued , the subcontinent has long been home to traditions of free - thinking and debate .
Participatory governance was not Britain 's gift ( recall Gandhi's indigenous village republics ) , even if parliamentary democracy as an institutional form was adopted in some ex-colonies .
Free trade is another mythical western contribution to world history .
Amitav Ghosh has reconstructed the forgotten history of a vibrant trade culture between medieval India and Africa .
When the Portuguese arrived , they demanded that the Hindu ruler of Calicut expel Muslims , " enemies of the Holy - Faith " , from his kingdom .
He refused and was subjected to two days of bombardment .
Indeed , one legacy of European colonialism that we all reckon with is the self - fulfilling prophecy of the " clash of civilisations " .
The claim that east and west are bound to come into conflict is merely an extension of imperial practice which found it useful to seal off porous cultures into fixed categories .
This tragic " lie of the colonial situation " , as Frantz Fanon called it , rebounds on us tragically in the terror unleashed in the name of Islam and Bush 's " war on terror " .
If we are to undo the destructive legacies of empire , it wo n't do to invest celebratory falsifications with credibility .
To make sense of a shared present and look towards a more humane future , we need to start with a little informed honesty about the past .
