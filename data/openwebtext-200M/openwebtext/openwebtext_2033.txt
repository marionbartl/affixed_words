Pouring your cash into the far reaches of the world wide web may sound like a crazy idea .
Lending cash to others online can cut out the middleman
After all , the internet has seen its fair share of nasties from phishing e-mails posing as a bank to key logging software pinching our passwords and personal information , all in an effort to steal our identity and cash .
But now there is a wave of sites trying to convince people that the web is the place for their money .
The concept is called social lending and the idea is to introduce people who need money to people who want to lend some - cutting out the middlemen like banks and mortgage companies .
Zopa is a pioneer in this space .
For the past two years it has allowed members to borrow and lend on their own terms .
Alison Daniel is an HR Advisor at a magazine publishing company who was looking for a loan to pay her overdraft .
" I looked at my bank and other various banks where I could get a loan and then I heard about Zopa , went on to their online calculator and the rates came up really cheaply so I opted for Zopa , " she said .
The site itself is very easy to use .
After both the borrower and the lender have registered , they choose what rate at which they would like to borrow or lend .
If the rate they choose corresponds then the site brings them together .
You do feel a connection to the people you are loaning to
Jane Bennett
Lender , Kiva
But how trustworthy is the site and will lenders get their money back ?
James Alexander , CEO of Zopa says they do everything they can to minimise any risk .
" We risk assess , identity and credit check every individual that comes to Zopa , " he said .
" So it 's a community of known individuals and what Zopa does is connect these people so they can borrow and lend money on their own terms . "
To minimize risk Zopa will spread your loan among a few borrowers .
So if are lending £ 500 ( $ 993 ) then your money will automatically go to 50 different people .
Banker to the poor
So think of Zopa like eBay for money , and like eBay , there are still risks involved in trading .
But social lending is not just for people looking for a material gain , it can also be an easy way to give a helping hand to those most in need .
The social lending site Kiva allows lenders to give to a specific entrepreneur in a poor or developing world country .
Social lending enabled Angel Isaev to start a cycle business
One person who has been helped by the site is Angel Isaev from Bulgaria .
Two years ago , he decided to open up his own bicycle repair business after losing his job at a local shop that closed down .
And to make this dream come true he needed cash .
" At the beginning I was a very , very poor boy , " said Mr Isaev .
" Then I was told about Kiva , and with their help I was able to fulfil my dream ; I was able to prove I 'm a businessman . "
For a minimum loan of $ 25 ( £ 13 ) Kiva allows people to sponsor a business by choosing from thousands of cases detailed online .
Mr Isaev 's lender Jane Bennett says an attractive feature of Kiva is that she can see who she is lending to .
" There are certainly occasions when I am looking to see who I am going loan money to and I would like to loan to them all because it is just amazing to see the stories of these people and how they are getting on with their lives , " she said .
" You do feel a connection to the people you are loaning to and I think it is because you see a picture of them and find out a bit about their life . "
Throughout the period of the loan - usually six to 12 months - sponsors receive e-mail updates about how borrowers are getting on as they repay their loan .
This sort of scheme is generally called Microfinance .
It is not new , but the web 's ability to allow anyone to become a banker to the world 's poor certainly is .
Currency exchange
And the web is also turning other established financial models on their head , such as currency exchange .
FXA
World is the world 's first peer - to - peer currency exchange where you can trade your foreign currency at a rate that you have set or at the rate the banks trade among themselves .
The site will offer you two options : Instant Challenge will give you the best rate available from a peer at any given time , or you can place an eBay - style listing where you can choose your rate and wait for someone else who is happy to trade .
Sites like this give more choice to users in deciding what they do with their money .
So , is social lending set to be the next big thing ?
" They are what we call a niche mass , " explained social lending expert Professor Michael Hulme of Lancaster University .
" In other words , it is likely that there will be a growing market but not a market that replaces financial services and high street banking and stuff like that . "

Weider Prime Reviews - What Is It ?
Author : Eric Lander | Last Updated Date : 02.03.2020
WARNING : DO NOT BUY Weider Prime Until You Read This Review !
Is it a Scam ?
Does It Really Work ?
Check Ingredients , Side Effects and More !
Weider Prime is claimed to be a healthy testosterone - boosting supplement that uses a combination of minerals and vitamins , as well as different natural plant extracts .
It intends to increase testosterone levels in the male body by providing your body with the necessary nutrients .
As a man gets older he starts suffering from a hormonal imbalance , which may lead to unpleasant symptoms , such as an increase in body fat and reduced muscle mass .
The product can be bought at different online retailers , making it easy to obtain .
It seems that some retailers only ship to the addresses in the United States , thus it is simpler to buy the supplement if the potential customers stay within the USA .
Before we focus on the ingredients of the product let us take a look at the manufacturer .
The manufacturer of Weider Prime holds the product 's name .
The official website does not provide the company 's address , which is the first red flag .
There is only a contact number and an email address .
From the contact number , it is clear that the headquarters of the manufacturer are located in the United States .
The product 's landing page provides no terms and conditions or other important links either .
The website links to a full list of ingredients and provides some details on the potential benefits of the formula .
Some studies are also mentioned , as well as graphs with information on some possible effects of the major ingredient in the product on muscle strength and testosterone levels .
The product makes four vital claims about its benefits for the male body .
It promises not only to increase testosterone production , but also to enhance physical performance , provide an enhancement in nutrient absorption and burn body fat .
Ingredients of Weider Prime - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
Even though the company presented Weider Prime on the market in 2013 , it is still not on the top .
As it was already mentioned , the supplement works by providing the human body with a variety of vital nutrients that play an important role in testosterone and energy production .
The formula contains a range of plant extracts , according to the manufacturer 's claim on the official website .
Some ingredient can speed up the process of reducing body fat but the company does not give its name .
Lastly , this formula includes an extract that can increase the bioavailability of other ingredients in the product .
We have found information on the primary ingredients in Weider Prime .
The major one is Diindolymethane .
It has been added to help with the hormonal balance , regulate estrogen levels and prevent the conversion of testosterone into estrogen .
Diindolymethane can be naturally found in the human body , mainly during the digestion process .
It contains indole - 3 - carbinol , the nutrient that is believed to balance estrogen and testosterone levels in the human body .
Its anti-cancer benefits are under a big question , though .
This compound may beneficial in the prevention of cancer .
Ashwagandha Extract has been shown to influence muscle strength .
One study took eight weeks during which each participant received a 300 mg dose on a daily basis .
After the study was completed , the group of participants had a significant improvement in their muscle strength .
Unfortunately , this ingredient may have some health restrictions .
Cordyceps Extract is an ingredient that was extracted from a wild fungus .
It has different health benefits and is even used to decrease body fat .
It is reported to works by building muscle mass and increasing caloric burn .
This component is initially grown in the high mountains in China .
It has been used in the treatment of male sexual problems , chronic bronchitis , liver disorders , anemia , and dizziness .
Cordyceps can have anti-aging effects and control high blood sugar levels .
Unfortunately , this ingredient is badly studied and needs more research .
Piperine is a compound that has no health benefits on its own , but it needs to be combined with other substances .
It can increase the body 's ability to absorb the other ingredients included into the supplement .
This ingredient also has tumor prevention antidepressant , and immune - suppressing properties .
Some other nutrients included in the Weider Prime formula include vitamin B6 , vitamin D3 , vitamin B12 , zinc , calcium , and chromium .
But these ingredients are less important when it comes to the effects of the product .
The major drawback of all of the higher described ingredients is that their amounts are not provided on the site , so you never know what effects to expect .
Customer Reviews - Does It Have Any Side Effects ?
This Weider Prime supplement is said to utilize natural vitamins , minerals , and plant extracts , but this does not mean that these ingredients cannot cause side - effects .
Having studied the comments and reviews about the supplement , we have found that some customers have suffered from certain side effects .
According to users , the most common ones included stomach upset , bloating , and sleeping troubles .
It is a well - known fact that each body can react differently to the same ingredients , so it is up to you to decide whether you need to buy this product , even after reading about its side effects .
Ashwagandha Extract contained in Weider Prime may not be the best herb for people with active inflammation .
Inflammation does not refer to a molecular mechanism , but it is issue when cardinal signs are present , i.e. swelling , redness , heat , and pain .
If you are interested in the product , you probably want to find out how this testosterone booster has worked for other users .
Many of customers ' reviews are negative .
Common comments are related to the absence of noticeable benefits even after using the product for a few weeks .
Other reviews mention that there are other more effective testosterone boosters available in the market .
Let us take a look at the opinions regarding this testosterone booster .
" I took two capsules of Weider Prime with dinner and I felt dizzy before I finished eating .
I also experienced a slight headache that lasted all night .
I had these side effects after my first dose and I decide not to take the product any more .
I have never get headaches because of medications "
" I am almost through my first bottle of Weiderprime and I noticed a boost in energy .
I was quite pleased with the supplement but then started having loose bowels .
They were almost uncontrollable .
I stopped taking the drug for a few weeks and took again .
I had the same reaction .
I tried doing so several times but every time it started again .
I am very disappointed , as I was happy with the initial results "
" It seems like Weider Prime should be stronger .
This supplement does n't really have much effect on me but I do n't know what .
Do I have different body chemistry ?
Besides , I suffered from such unpleasant adverse effects as diarrhea and nausea .
I do not recommend this product to anyone "
Where To Buy Weider Prime ?
Weider Prime can be purchased directly from the official website of the manufacturer or from some retail stores , for instance , Costco .
The product 's price depends on the retailer you are buying it from .
Each bottle contains a two - month supply , which seems to be an affordable solution .
A 120 - capsule bottle of the supplement can be bought for about $ 28.99 .
My Final Summary
Weider Prime is associated with a number of disadvantages .
The product can only be found online .
It is not as effective as advertised on the official website .
The product is recommended only for adult men .
The supplement has a relatively high price when compared to the products of the kind .
Many users do not even feel any positive results after using Weider Prime .
The fact is that there are other testosterone boosters on the market that prove to be more effective and safe .
You are advised to choose a male enhancement supplement that is made by a reputable company .
With this in mind , Weider Prime cannot be recommended to usage .
Affordable Alternative
Many doctors consider that the problem can be well solved by another product known as Testogen .
I completely agree with them because I study many products of the kind !
I recommend you reading my review about Testogen .
You 'll be pleasantly surprised .

The Supreme Court heard arguments last week in a hugely important case about voter ID laws .
Asking for identification at the polls may sound reasonable , but an Indiana law disenfranchises large numbers of people without driver ’s licenses , especially poor and minority voters .
If the court upholds the law , as appears likely , it will be a sad new chapter in its abandonment of voters , a group whose rights it once defended vigorously .
As long as there have been elections , there have been attempts to keep eligible people from voting .
States and localities adopted poll taxes , literacy tests , “ white primaries , ” “ malapportionment ”  drawing district lines to give a small number of rural voters the same representation as a large number of urban voters  and restrictions on student voting .
In recent decades , the Supreme Court has rejected all of them .
The court understood that the Constitution guaranteed a robust form of democracy and saw its clear value for the nation .
During the tumultuous late - 1960s , Chief Justice Earl Warren declared that most of the country ’s problems could be solved through the political process if everyone “ has the opportunity to participate on equal terms with everyone else and can share in electing representatives who will be representative of the entire community and not of some special interest . ”
In recent years , however , with a conservative majority in place , the court has become increasingly hostile to voters .
During the oral arguments in the Bush v. Gore case in 2000 , Justice Sandra Day O’Connor showed disdain for voters who had trouble with Florida ’s disastrous punch - card ballots .
After insisting that the directions “ could n’t be clearer , ” she suggested that the court ignore the ballots of voters who had failed to master the intricacies .
That is precisely what it did , by a 5 - 4 vote .

A measure to extend amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for three weeks failed to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday .
The failure is a setback for Democrats who had been hoping for the extra time to hammer out a solution to a politically explosive issue : that is , whether and how to extend retroactive immunity to the telecom companies that cooperated with the federal government 's program of eavesdropping without warrants .
How this will play out remains to be seen , but pressure is mounting on politicians who want more time to investigate how the government intends to use the information it gathers .
The current Protect America
Act , which amends the underlying FISA rules to give the executive branch expanded surveillance powers , expires on Friday .
Earlier this week , the U.S. Senate approved legislation renewing the stopgap FISA provisions established in the PAA .
The bill broadens the rights of the executive branch to spy on U.S. residents without judicial oversight ; it also gives the controversial retroactive immunity to telecom providers .
Since the so - called warrantless wiretap program was uncovered by the media and made public a few years ago , some 40 lawsuits have been filed against AT&T and other major providers that allowed the government to listen in on their customers ' phone conversations without obtaining a warrant .
President Bush has been an active supporter of this protection ; Democrats and a few Republicans have resisted it , arguing that more information about the surveillance program is needed .
The path from a bill passed in one chamber of Congress to becoming a permanent law is not a straightforward one .
The House could pass a bill without the immunity provision , which would surely be vetoed by the president .
Or , it could pass a veto - proof bill -- but in that case , the areas of conflict between the Senate and House versions would still have to be hammered out in conference committee .
End of the Suits
Should the current language of the telecom immunity clause survive to become law , it could effectively end the pending litigation against these companies .
" It is very disappointing that the Senate passed this bill , " said Kurt Opsahl , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is a party in the suits .
" We will have to see what happens in the House . "
However , it is not necessarily a given that the plaintiffs would have no recourse against the telecoms , Opsahl told the E - Commerce Times .
Conceivably , the law could be challenged in court .
" Once we see what the final bill is , we will make the appropriate decision of whether and how to challenge it , " he said .
Carte Blanche
As presented by the administration , the case for the bill 's passage is that broad surveillance powers are necessary to identify and prevent terrorist attacks .
The government already has such power to spy on people outside U.S. borders .
Within the country , though , it is hamstrung by the need to get court approval for wiretaps in a timely manner .
The immunity is necessary , the administration argues , to secure the telecoms ' participation in the program .
However , the new law may erode more protections against government intrusion than most people realize , opponents warn .
" It totally eviscerates our fundamental process of having a judge provide oversight and serve as a watchdog against abuse , " Peter Vogel , an attorney with Gardere Wynne Sewell , told the E - Commerce Times .
" Part of responsibility of the judiciary is to serve as a check against legislative and executive branches .
What the executive branch wants here is to circumvent the judiciary 's participation . "
If the bill were to become law , warrantless wiretapping could be successfully challenged in court , Vogel said , adding that the immunity exemption to telecoms also might be overturned .
" Basically , what these companies did is hand over records without a court authority , just on the government 's request . "
Who 's a Terrorist ?
The Senate bill does not clearly define a " terrorist " who would thus be subject to the warrantless wiretap program .
" Could I be considered a ' terrorist ' because I answered these questions and spoke out against a program the executive branch favors ? "
Vogel asked rhetorically .
He pointed to government investigations of civil rights activists in the '60s -- most notably Martin Luther King , Jr. -- as examples of questionable executive branch decision - making on who deserves investigation .
Vogel also took issue with the safeguards the bill put in place , noting that the Secret Intelligence Court 's review of processes that might violate rights would take place after the fact .
The Etiology and Elaboration of a Flagrant Mistranslation
[ Guest post by Victor Mair ]
A series of earlier Language Log posts have discussed the curious phenomenon seen in the grocery - store sign on the right : absurdly crude English mistranslations in bizarrely inappropriate contexts .
In " Gan : whodunnit , and how , and why ? " ( 5/31/2006 ) , I explained one of the sources of this phenomenon : several Chinese characters pronounced GAN1 or GAN4 -- and meaning such widely disparate things as " dry , " " calendrical sign , " " to do , " and much else beside -- all got collapsed into one simplified character : 干.
This has led to enormous confusion , especially when people who know next to no English rely on machine translation software to convert Chinese into English .
The chaos caused by this combination of circumstances is vastly exacerbated by the fact that this little , three - stroke symbol also has a vulgar meaning when pronounced in the fourth tone , GAN4 , namely " fuck , " which is probably an extension of the regular sense of " do . "
Because GAN4 ( " do " ) and GAN1 ( " dry " ) are now both written with that little , three - stroke character , the damage is compounded by the enormous range of intended senses of GAN1 / 4 ( " dry , " " do , " " act , " " work , " " undertake , " " shield , " " have to do with ; be concerned with , " " edge of a body of water , " " be rude , impolite , blunt , " " embarrass or annoy , " " give the cold - shoulder to , " " empty , hollow , " measure word for a group of people , " trunk , stem , main part , " " cadre , " " competent , capable , able , talented , " " go bad , " " be a disaster , " etc. ) , all of which are capable of coming out of the translation software as " fuck . "
People who see signs employing the f-word all over China , even in large stores and fancy restaurants , are not only aghast , they wonder how the dickens such a gross mistranslation could have originated and proliferated .
I believe that the explanation given in the previous paragraph adequately and accurately accounts for the origin of the basic GAN1 / 4 = " fuck " mistranslation .
The question that remains , then , is how did this virus spread ?
Theories abound , to say the least .
I have intelligent colleagues who believe that naughty people do this on purpose just to scandalize customers and clients .
Others hold that it is done to make English look like an uncouth language .
Still others maintain that devious foreign translators plant these mistranslations all over the place to make Chinese look stupid and crude .
And there are so many additional theories that attempt to account for the GAN1 / 4 = " fuck " misrendering that I can't keep track of them .
Most of us , however , have all along suspected that this phenomenon resulted from reliance on faulty translation software .
Indeed , it is easy to prove that absurd English translations are being spewed out daily in China when individuals who do n't know English merely plug Chinese sentences into the software and expect it to come up with reasonable renditions .
For example , one of my students has told me about a sign in Tai'an , in Shandong province , near Qufu , the legendary birthplace of Confucius .
The Chinese text reads " Liang2shi4 zheng3gu3 tui1na2 " , which means " Liang Family Bone - Setting ( Medical ) Massage " .
( For a description of TUI1NA2 in traditional Chinese medicine , see the Wikipedia entry . )
The English text on the sign reads " Whole Bone of the Beam Surname Pushes to Take " !
After trying for more than a year to find proof that the GAN1 / 4 = " fuck " mistranslation was indeed the result of relying on poor translation software , I am now able to demonstrate that this really does seem to be the case .
Here is the evidence .
There is a bulletin board called Lequ Yuan ( which means something like " Pleasure Garden " ) , and on that site there is a page called " L�you Wenhua Tan " ( which punningly means both " Donkey Friends Forum " and " Travel Friends Forum " ) .
On January 14 , 2003 at 00:51:23 , somebody calling him / herself " kailash " made a post entitled " Gaoxiao fanyi ( Ridiculous Translations ) . "
The contents of kailash 's post ( in the top left ) are the following , in my English translation :
Truly ridiculous !
Location of photograph(s ) :
The new X supermarket at Hexi in Changsha ( Hunan ) .
The one that is most classic is that for GAN1HUO4 [= " dry goods " -- it must have actually been " fuck foods " in the photograph , which is no longer accessible on the pku.edu.cn web site ] .
Can GAN1 really be translated that way ?
Below are some ( translated ) comments on that post , with the commenter 's name after each one :
" I suspect that somebody 's been playing tricks . "
Balang " You go buy a Jinshan Ciba with Added Jinshan Kuaiyi . "
Huayuan ( " Flower Garden " ) " Really ! " kailash " I still do n't believe it . " windy " Ha , ha , ha ! " Knight yvan " Is it true or fake ?
Somehow I suspect that it has been faked . "
By No Means a Lonely Ostrich
Huayuan followed up with another post later that same day , at 11:05:21 to be precise .
His response to the doubters , begins thus : NI QU MAI GE JINSHAN CIBA JIA JINSHAN KUAIYI ( " You go buy a Jinshan Ciba with Added Jinshan Kuaiyi " ) .
Now , just what is this Jinshan Ciba that can be equipped with a Jinshan Kuaiyi ?
Literally rendered , these names mean " Gold Mountain Word Hegemon " and " Gold Mountain Fast Translator . "
Jinshan Ciba is an electronic reading aid ( a sort of glorified bilingual [ Chinese and English ] , and to a certain extent multilingual [ since some Japanese is included ] , dictionary ) , while Jinshan Kuaiyi is a machine translation device .
These tools are widely used all over China .
Nearly all of the PRC students at the University of Pennsylvania have brought theirs with them , although they realize that Jinshan Kuaiyi usually produces English that is laughable .
Huayuan 's post continues ( emphasis added ) :
Then let it ( Jinshan Ciba / Kuaiyi ) translate this sentence : NI3 XIANG3 GAN4 SHEN2ME ?
( " What do you want to do ? " )
It will come out with : " what do you want to fuck ? "
This is an experiment that can be repeated ; scientifically it is sufficiently rigorous .
Now , that was in 2003 .
I have checked the latest version of Jinshan Ciba / Kuaiyi , and it does not return the vulgar mistranslation recorded by Huayuan , although it still comes out with a lot of other gibberish ( see below ) .
It would appear that somebody told the makers of Jinshan Ciba / Kuaiyi about this gross problem with their translation software and they have taken steps to remedy it .
However , the damage has already been done and the cancer continues to spread throughout the Chinese body linguistic .
There still must be countless earlier versions of the Jinshan software out there that are being used daily .
The only way to halt this ludicrous phenomenon is never to paint , print , or publish an English translation without first checking with someone who is fluent in the target language .
That , of course , is unlikely in the foreseeable future , because there just are n't enough skilled speakers of English to go around for the huge demand that has engulfed China .
I tested the latest version of the Jinshan software , and here are some samples of what it now produces ( screen shots taken a few days ago ) :
NI3 XIANG3 GAN4 SHEN2ME ?
Jinshan : " What do you want to do ? "
NI3 XIANG3YAO4 GAN4 SHEN2ME ?
Jinshan : " What do you want to do ? "
NI3MEN ZHENG4ZAI4 GAN4 SHEN2ME ?
Jinshan : " You just at stem what ? " corrected translation : " What are you doing right now ? "
NI3MEN GAN4 SHEN2ME NI ?
Jinshan : " What do you do ? " corrected translation : " What are you doing ? " or " What do you think you 're doing ? "
NI3MEN GANG1CAI2 GAN4 SHEN2ME ?
Jinshan : " What are you just dry ? " corrected translation : " What were you doing just now ? "
NI3 GAN4 SHEN2ME ZHE4ME SHUO1 ?
Jinshan : " What do you do to say so ? " corrected translation : " What do you mean by talking like this ? " or " Why are you speaking this way ? "
GAN1HUO4Jinshan : " Dry goods "
GAN1TIAO2 QU1Jinshan : " The stem adjusts area" corrected translation : " Dry Seasonings Section . " ( see below for a brief discussion )
Those who travel around China know for certain that the GAN1 / 4 = " fuck " abomination is not fake .
It is real , and now -- though it remains thoroughly deplorable -- I think I understand how it happened .
Here are just two of the countless instances of the GAN1 / 4 = " fuck " paradigm that have spread throughout in China :
Pinyin : GAN1TIAO2 QU1
English : " Fuck to adjust the area "
Correct translation : " Dry Seasonings Section "
Note :
It is no wonder that machines get confused by this expression ( see the less salacious machine translation above , no .
8 of the screen shots , " the stem adjusts area " ) , since every Chinese to whom I 've shown this sign has hesitated in their pronunciation ( the second syllable could also be read DIAO4 ) and in their interpretation of its meaning -- there are many different possibilities .
Pinyin : SAN3 GAN1GUO3
English " spread to fuck the fruit "
Correct translation : " Loose Dried Fruit "
Note : More often GAN1GUO3 actually refers to nuts instead of fruit .
Many other examples of GAN mistranslated as " fuck " can be found on the internet -- several have been featured in the earlier Language Log posts linked above , for example this sign from a hotel buffet :
And this restaurant sign :
Two more : what should be " dry foods price counter " is rendered in large letters as " FUCK THE CERTAIN PRICE OF GOODS " :
And what should be " dried foods " becomes " FUCK GOODS " :
As a sample of the other widespread effects of unwise reliance on dictionaries , digital or otherwise , here are some incredibly fine examples of Chinglish in Shanghai . , probably also caused by excessive reliance on poor - quality machine translation .
Among other precious items , notice the " Bang products " and the " antithetical couplet ocean . "
Well , enough for now .
I hope that I do not have to spend the rest of my life documenting and explaining Chinglish .
For the moment , however , it would appear that I still have much work to do .
I wish to express my gratitude to Jonathan Smith for helping me track down early occurrences of the GAN1 / 4 = " f*ck " atrocity on the Web and for the fabulous TUINA sign in Shandong , and to Jiajia Wang for making the screen shots of Jinshan Ciba / Kuaiyi in action , also for scouring Facebook for interesting examples of Chinglish .
[ Above is a guest post by Victor Mair ]
I dug up a CD of Kingsoft 2002 and tested it on some of Prof .
Mair 's example sentences .
Thought it might be nice to have a screenshot of how the software used to work to compare to the more acceptable translations of recent versions of Kingsoft QuickTrans :
The last line of the attached image is part of the translation of the title of an academic paper that was published in the Economic Administrative Cadre Bulletin in 2003 , and discussed here in the EastSouthWestNorth blog : * [ 019 ] A Solid Fuck ( 12/08/2007 ) ( KDnet )
In issue 2 , volume 16 , June 2003 of the Kansu province Economic Administrative Cadre Academy Bulletin , there appeared an essay titled < 开拓进取，真抓实干，不断开创西部大开发的新局面 >.
The author Song Chaosu is the Kansu provincial party secretary and the chairman of the Kansu provincial people 's congress standing committee .
In the database , the title of the article was translated into English as : Expand Enterprising and Really Grasp Solid Fuck and Continuously Expand and Great the New Situation of Buildings of Western Region .
If there is a " solid fuck , " it is the translation job .
A more appropriate translation is : Develop and Forge Ahead with True Understanding and Effort in order to Continuously Create New Situations to Open Up the Western Region . "

The federal government has told New York State health officials that chemotherapy , which had been covered for illegal immigrants under a government - financed program for emergency medical care , does not qualify for coverage .
The decision sets the stage for a battle between the state and federal governments over how medical emergencies are defined .
The change comes amid a fierce national debate on providing medical care to immigrants , with New York State officials and critics saying this latest move is one more indication of the Bush administration ’s efforts to exclude the uninsured from public health services .
State officials in New York and other states have found themselves caught in the middle .
The New York dispute , focusing on illegal immigrants with cancer — a marginal group of unknown size among the more than 500,000 people living in New York illegally — has become a flash point for health officials and advocates for immigrants in recent weeks .
Under a limited provision of Medicaid , the national health program for the poor , the federal government permits emergency coverage for illegal immigrants and other noncitizens .
But the Bush administration has been more closely scrutinizing and increasingly denying state claims for federal payment for some emergency services , Medicaid experts said .

With an exhilarated grin and his arms spread wide like wings , Joe Egan seems momentarily suspended in mid-air .
In fact , he has just launched himself backwards off an 80ft diving board , to the amazement of the crowd at Martin County Fair in east Florida .
His target is the shimmering blue pool below , and by the time he hits the water the diver will be travelling at a breathtaking 60 mph or faster .
Daredevil feats like this one take years to perfect .

Brave : Joe Egan launches himself from 80ft into an 18ft deep pool
In the two seconds that he flies through the air , the diver will perform a series of twists and turns , but the trick is to land feet first and with your body completely tense and straight .
Hitting the water head first can result in severe concussion or even a fractured skull .
Tony Ally , three - time Olympic and Commonwealth champion and fitness coach for the Great British diving squad , says : " It 's an incredible force - almost like landing on concrete . "
The athletes must be in perfect physical condition to cope with the impact .
They regularly experience spasms and cramps due to the extreme G - force exerted on their bodies , and the amount of adrenaline pumping through their veins .
Such is the gruelling nature of the sport , divers are only able to jump 15 times a day and must undergo intense tissue and muscular massage after every session .
High diving platforms are typically no taller than 80ft - the highest it is safe to dive without causing injury .
The world record stands , however , at an unfathomable 200ft - although the diver broke his spine in the process .
Tony
Ally says : " Walking up that ladder is incredible .
The pool below looks tiny - like you are about to dive into a bucket . "
But it is not as dangerous as it appears - in reality the pool has a diameter of 70ft and is at least 18 ft deep .
Provided the diver keeps his concentration , the chance of an accident is small .

From Kotaku : PSP Sets Fire To Schoolboy's Pants
" At the Warner Middle School in Farmington Hills Michigan this morning a fire broke out in a young boy 's pants .
According to police , the PSP in the student 's pocket overheated and exploded , burning hole in his pocket and causing minor burns on his legs . "
Looking at the comments in Kotaku 's story people seem to be blaming the fault on a 3rd party battery , which are known to cause problems .
I wonder though if he left a game running when he pocketed the PSP .
Those spinning UMDs tax the battery something fierce .
Perhaps if he 'd installed custom firmware and ripped his games to the memory stick like any sane person does , this whole horrible situation could have been avoided .
Goes to show what happens when you obey the rules :
Lose your PSP and the pants you carry it in .
To cancel one high - level Franco - German meeting is unfortunate .
To cancel two in less than a week implies a bank of freezing fog is descending over the Rhine .
French and German officials sought yesterday to play down the significance of the abrupt postponement – both by Paris – of two meetings between the countries ' most senior politicians .
Privately , and not so privately , the talk in both capitals is of a serious rift in the single most important national partnership in Europe .
Officials blame an increasingly difficult relationship between President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With France scheduled to take the presidency of the European Union in July , the Franco - German tiff could not be timed worse .
Berlin has been especially annoyed by M. Sarkozy 's determination to push ahead with a so - called " Club Med " or formal union of countries on the shores of the Mediterranean .
Chancellor Merkel believes that such an organisation would be either a pointless distraction or a threat to the unity of the EU .
There have also been tensions over the management of the euro and on foreign and defence policy .
France has repeatedly criticised the monetary policy of the European Central Bank while ignoring its European commitments to restrain its budget deficit .
Germany has refused to join a French - sponsored EU military mission to Darfur .
At the heart of the quarrel – not yet an overt crisis – is the strained relationship between the two leaders .
German officials say that the hyperactive and boastful behaviour of the French President – and his over - familiar personal style – has irritated Ms Merkel .
French officials suggest M. Sarkozy finds Ms Merkel too cautious and too ponderous .
French diplomats also complain that M. Sarkozy – in his determination to shake up all aspects of French government – wants to play down the Paris - Berlin relationship that has been the bedrock of France 's domestic and European policy for half a century .
" For Sarkozy , the West very much means UK and the US , " one French source said .
Late last week , Paris postponed for three months a Franco - German summit that had been scheduled for next Monday in Bavaria .
The Elysée Palace said that President Sarkozy 's diary was too busy .
Early this week , France called off at , one day 's notice , a meeting between the French Finance minister , Christine Lagarde , and her German counterpart , Peer Steinbrück .

The reason given was trivial , bordering on the insulting .
Mme Lagarde had to accompany M. Sarkozy on a visit to a provincial health centre and luxury goods factory .
Eckart von Klaeden , chief parliamentary spokesman for Ms Merkel 's ruling conservatives , said the French explanation was " hardly convincing " .
Martin Schulz , the German Social Democrat leader in the European parliament , said : " I think that Sarkozy has hit such a low that his internal political weaknesses are now beginning to affect Franco - German co-operation . "
The newspaper Le Monde said that , whatever excuses were put forward , it was clear that Franco - German relations had fallen victim to a " maladie diplomatique " .
Le Monde said that you had to go back eight years , to a spat over EU voting rights between Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and President Jacques Chirac , to find such a " sullen " relationship between the " countries which once claimed to be the motors of Europe " .
M. Sarkozy wants to make his plans for a Mediterranean Union one of the centrepieces of his six - month presidency of the EU from 1 July .
He has invited the Mediterranean states to a summit in Paris on 13 July and wants other EU countries to come along the next day – France 's national day – to bestow their blessings .
However , several northern EU countries , led by Germany , are deeply unhappy about the French initiative .
They complain that there is no need for a separate Mediterranean Union , distinct from the EU 's own partnership agreements with its southern and eastern neighbours .
The German newspaper Die Welt said M. Sarkozy had tried to persuade Ms Merkel to write a joint article , praising the Club Med idea , for publication in French and German newspapers before next week 's bilateral summit .
She refused .
M. Sarkozy then postponed the meeting .
The French and German governments insisted officially that the postponement was a timetabling problem .
The journal Nature reports the breakthrough by US researchers who developed a novel material in which holographs can be created in minutes .
The images that the material can capture are almost as sharp as those broadcast on US television .
The polymer can also be made into large screens opening up many more possible uses for the 3D images .
Looking good
The problems associated with making holographs has before now limited the use of them to very specialised fields .
But the photorefractive polymer created by Savas Tay and colleagues at the University of Arizona , Tucson , may help to change that as it removes some of the obstacles to producing them .
Holographs are created by mixing reflected laser light with a second laser beam to lay down a static image - typically a lengthy , complicated and delicate process .
Images are laid down in the holographic material using lasers
The material has been shown to stay stable throughout hundreds of write and erase cycles .
The ability to quickly refresh images in holographs could mean that surgeons use them as a guide during operations or as a better way for pharmaceutical researchers to study molecular interactions for new drugs during simulations .
The team has automated the process of capturing , writing and erasing images via a system that can take input from MRI , CAT scans , satellite or aerial photographs and microscopes .
The team released a video showing the images that result from its holographic recording system .
They warned that the footage was a " poor guide " to the finished quality which was comparable to the pictures broadcast in the US NTSC format .
Working with hi-tech firm Nitto Denko the researchers have so far only made a screen measuring 10 cm by 10 cm .
However , in Nature they wrote : " There is no technological limit to the achievable display size , because large thin - film devices can be fabricated and even tiled together " .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Screeners failed to find most of the fake bombs smuggled by plainclothes investigators through checkpoints at two major airports from late 2005 until last fall , the Transportation Security Administration said Thursday .
The TSA now conducts daily testing , which has led to improvements at airports across the country , the agency said .
Investigators successfully smuggled 75 percent of the fake bombs through checkpoints at Los Angeles International Airport in California , and 60 percent through Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport in Illinois , according to a report obtained by USA Today .
In tests at California 's San Francisco International Airport , where a private company conducts inspections , 20 percent of the contraband made it through security .
The TSA confirmed the results but said the tests , conducted in fiscal year 2006 , prompted the agency to change its protocols .
Taking a cue from the experiences in San Francisco , the TSA now conducts daily testing , which has led to improvements at airports across the country , the agency said .
The agency conducts 2,500 tests a day nationwide , said spokeswoman Ellen Howe .
" There are tests literally in every lane , every shift , every day , " she said .
The TSA does not release test results , but she said the increased tests have shown an overall improvement .
The agency 's Office of Investigations conducted the tests in question from October 2005 to September 2006 , Howe said .
Investigators posed as passengers , concealing fake bombs , bomb components and weapons in their clothing and carry - on bags as they went through security screening .
The TSA conducted about 70 tests in Los Angeles , 75 in Chicago and 145 in San Francisco .
The government has conducted similar testing in the past , with similarly poor results .
Repeated tests by the Department of Homeland Security 's Office of Inspector General led the Government Accountability Office to conclude that better technology would improve security .
The TSA said it 's working to deploy improved machinery such as X - ray machines that can better distinguish between harmless objects and bombs .
However , the agency also has worked to emphasize the search for bomb components , said TSA Administrator Kip Hawley .
Some 30,000 screeners , renamed as transportation security officers , underwent training in fall 2005 to detect such components .
The TSA chief also increased weekly training from three to four hours , Howe said .
San Francisco 's practice of continuous testing has become the norm , Howe said .
With constant testing , it becomes second nature to find components , she said .
" We have to keep challenging screeners ; we have to keep changing it up , " she said .
In the past , San Francisco screeners were criticized when it was learned they had advance warning of the testing and used the airport 's security cameras to follow investigators to checkpoints .
More recently , Richard L. Skinner , the Department of Homeland Security 's inspector general , disclosed that screeners at Jackson - Evers International Airport in Mississippi had advance notice of tests in 2004 , and were given descriptions of undercover investigators and the type and location of items to be sneaked through checkpoints .
Skinner said he 's expanding his probe of possible cheating to include other , unnamed airports .
In addition to the physical tests of airport checkpoints , the TSA uses " threat image projection , " which digitally inserts images of " threat objects " such as knives and bomb parts into X - ray machine images of passengers ' bags .
The system is intended to train screeners and keep them alert .

Older brain , foreground , shows less synchronised activity
Harvard University used medical imaging techniques to compare the brains of 93 healthy people aged 18 to 93 .
The scans showed the brain gradually loses the material it needs for one major region to communicate effectively with another .
The study , published in Neuron , suggests this slowly undermines sophisticated " higher " cognitive functions such as memory and learning .
Understanding why we lose cognitive function as we age may help us to prolong our mental abilities later in life
Professor Randy Buckner
Howard Hughes Medical Institute
This may help to explain why advanced age is often accompanied by a loss of mental agility , even in an otherwise healthy individual .
Lead researcher Jessica Andrews - Hanna said : " This research helps us to understand how and why our minds change as we get older , and why some individuals remain sharp into their 90s , while others ' mental abilities decline as they age .
" One of the reasons for loss of mental ability may be that these systems in the brain are no longer in sync with one another . "
Previous studies have focused on the effect of ageing on specific structures in the brain .
The latest work , using functional magnetic resonance imaging , was different because it examined the effect on communication between different regions .
White matter
The researchers tracked the nerve cell - packed white matter , which effectively serves as the brain 's wiring , allowing different areas to communicate and share information .
The scans showed white matter degraded over time .
In particular , they revealed a reduction in connections between the front and back regions of the brain .
As a result , while the younger brains were in sync , this was not always the case for older brains .
Older people whose brains remained in sync were more likely to perform better in a battery of tests of mental capacity than peers whose scans showed more evidence of disruption .
However , the pattern of disruption varied between individuals - as did their performance on individual tests .
The researchers found the system governing our internal thoughts , which tends to kick in when we are not focusing on processing information from the outside world , was particularly vulnerable to disruption .
The researchers said the study promises a better physiological understanding of cognitive decline , and may help research into the impact of risk factors such as heart disease .
Professor Randy Buckner , who worked on the study , said : " Understanding why we lose cognitive function as we age may help us to prolong our mental abilities later in life . "
Vascular element
Professor Clive Ballard , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said more work was needed to confirm and clarify the findings .
He said : " Understanding how the brain changes as people age is an important part of the fight to protect against cognitive diseases such as dementia .
" People displaying the signs of Alzheimer 's disease were ruled out of the study , but those with subtle vascular changes in the brain may have been included .
" Further work is needed to establish if the pattern of change is related to age only , or to vascular changes in the brain . "
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said the research highlighted the complexity of the brain .
She said : " If we can better understand the normal effects of ageing on a brain then we can differentiate it from Alzheimer 's and improve diagnosis . "
Who carries the greatest responsibility for the deaths of unborn children in this country ?
I accuse the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales , His Eminence Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor .
I charge that he is partly to blame for our abnormally high abortion rate .
Let me begin with a point of agreement .
" Whatever our religious creed or political conviction , " Murphy - O'Connor writes , the level of abortion in the UK " can only be a source of distress and profound anguish for us all " .
Quite so .
But why has it climbed so high ?
Is it the rising tide of liberalism ?
The absence of abstinence ?
Strange as it may seem , the evidence suggests the opposite .
Last week the cardinal sacked the board of a hospital in north London .
It had permitted a GP 's surgery to move on to the site , and the doctors there , horror of horrors , were helping women with family planning .
Though it is partly funded by the NHS , St John & St Elizabeth 's is a Catholic hospital , which forbids doctors from prescribing contraceptives or referring women for abortions .
The cardinal says he wants the hospital to provide medical help that is " truly in the interests of human persons " .
Murphy - O'Connor has denounced contraception and abortion many times .
That 's what he is there for : the primary purpose of most religions is to control women .
But while we may disagree with his position , we seldom question either its consistency or its results .
It 's time we started .
The most effective means of preventing the deaths of unborn children is to promote contraception .
In the history of most countries that acquire access to modern medical technology , there is a period in which rates of contraception and abortion rise simultaneously .
Christian fundamentalists suggest the trends are related , and attribute them to what the Pope calls " a secularist and relativist mentality " .
In fact it 's a sign of demographic transition .
As societies become more prosperous and women acquire better opportunities , they seek smaller families .
In the early years of transition , contraceptives are often hard to obtain and poorly understood , so women will also use abortion to limit the number of children .
But , as a study published in the journal International Family Planning Perspectives shows , once the birth rate stabilises , contraceptive use continues to increase and the abortion rate falls .
In this case one trend causes the other : " Rising contraceptive use results in reduced abortion incidence . "
The rate of abortion falls once 80 % of the population is using effective contraception .
A study published in the Lancet shows that between 1995 and 2003 , the global rate of induced abortions fell from 35 per 1,000 women each year to 29 .
This period coincides with the rise of the " globalised secular culture " the Pope laments .
When the figures are broken down , it becomes clear that , apart from the former Soviet Union , abortion is highest in conservative and religious societies .
In largely secular western Europe , the average rate is 12 abortions per 1,000 women .
In the more religious southern European countries , the average rate is 18 .
In the US , where church attendance is still higher , there are 23 abortions for every 1,000 women , the highest level in the rich world .
In central and South America , where the Catholic church holds greatest sway , the rates are 25 and 33 respectively .
In the very conservative societies of east Africa , it 's 39 .
One abnormal outlier is the UK : our rate is six points higher than that of our western European neighbours .
I am not suggesting a sole causal relationship : the figures also reflect changing demographies .
But it 's clear that religious conviction does little to reduce abortion and plenty to increase it .
The highest rates of all - 44 per 1,000 - occur in the former Soviet Union : under communism , contraceptives were almost impossible to obtain .
But , thanks to better access to contraception , this is also where the decline is fastest : in 1995 the rate was twice as high .
There has been a small rise in abortion in western Europe , attributed by the Guttmacher Institute in the US to " immigration of people with low levels of contraceptive awareness " .
The explanation , in other words , is consistent : more contraception means less abortion .
There is also a clear relationship between sex education and falling rates of unintended pregnancy .
A report by the United Nations agency Unicef notes that in the Netherlands , which has the world 's lowest abortion rate , a sharp reduction in unwanted teenage pregnancies was caused by " the combination of a relatively inclusive society with more open attitudes towards sex and sex education , including contraception " .
By contrast , in the US and UK , which have the developed world 's highest teenage pregnancy rates , " contraceptive advice and services may be formally available , but in a ' closed ' atmosphere of embarrassment and secrecy " .
A paper published by the British Medical Journal assessed four programmes seeking to persuade teenagers in the UK to abstain from sex .
It found that they " were associated with an increase in the number of pregnancies among partners of young male participants " .
This should n't be surprising .
Teenagers will have sex whatever grown - ups say , and the least familiar with contraception are the most likely to become pregnant .
The more effectively religious leaders and conservative papers anathemise contraception , sex education and premarital sex , the higher abortion rates will go .
The cardinal helps sustain our appalling level of unwanted pregnancies .
But the suffering his church causes in the rich nations does n't compare to the misery inflicted on the poor .
Chillingly , as the Lancet paper shows , there is no relationship between the legality and the incidence of abortion .
Women with no access to contraceptives will try to terminate unwanted pregnancies .
A World Health Organisation report shows that almost half the world 's abortions are unauthorised and unsafe .
In East Africa and Latin America , where religious conservatives ensure that terminations remain illegal , they account for almost all abortions .
Methods include drinking turpentine or bleach , shoving sticks or coathangers into the uterus , and pummelling the abdomen , which often causes the uterus to burst , killing the patient .
The WHO estimates that between 65,000 and 70,000 women die as a result of illegal abortions every year , while 5 million suffer severe complications .
These effects , the organisation says , " are the visible consequences of restrictive legal codes " .
I hope David Cameron , who wants restrictions on legal terminations in the UK , knows what the alternatives look like .
When the Pope tells bishops in Kenya - the global centre of this crisis - that they should defend traditional family values " at all costs " against agencies offering safe abortions , or when he travels to Brazil to denounce its contraceptive programme , he condemns women to death .
When George Bush blocks aid for family planning charities that promote safe abortions , he ensures , paradoxically , that contraceptives are replaced with backstreet foeticide .
These people spread misery , disease and death .
And they call themselves pro-life .

Who needs an energy plan when Shell and Exxon already have one for us ?
We need more government by special interests , for special interests .
Big
Oil will continue to give lip service to alternative energies and place pretty flowers on their adverts but they will never , ever make a serious move beyond oil .
Shell just posted the largest profit ever in the UK to the tune of $ 27.6 billion for 2007 .
How ’d it work for you ?
Instead of spending trillions to make a mess of the Middle East , is n’t it time we spend some of that on building a long term energy plan ?
The GOP has no faith in the American ability to create something new and better but that should not stop others from moving down that path .
Instead of giving tax breaks and free drilling rights to Big Oil , let ’s use that money to help launch the energy programs of the future .
Some of the new ideas may not work and others will but anyone who does n’t believe in such possibilities really needs to step aside .

One person out of every thousand has synaesthesia , a psychological phenomenon in which they can smell a sound or hear a color .
Most of these people are not aware they are synaesthetes and feel certain about the way they perceive things : they think the way they experience the world is normal .
But , when they realize that something is not quite right , they become disappointed .
The research field has grown from grapheme - color synaesthesia to include other forms of synaesthesia in which flavors are evoked by music or words ( lexical - gustatory synaesthesia ) , space structures by time units , colors by music , etc .
Surprising as it may seem , there are people who can smell sounds , see smells or hear colors .
Actually , all of us , at some point in our lives , have had this skill ( some authors affirm that it is common in newborns ) .
This phenomenon , called “ synaesthesia ” – from the Greek “ syn ” ( with ) and “ aisthesis ” ( sensation ) – consists of the pairing of two bodily senses by which the perception of a determined stimulus activates a different subjective perception with no external stimulus ( in science , the evoker stimulus is called inducer and the additional experience concurrent ) .
In the department of Experimental Psychology and Physiology at the University of Granada , a research group is carrying out pioneer work in Spain on the systematic study of synaesthesia and its relation with perception and emotions .
Professor Juan Lupiáñez Castillo and Alicia Callejas Sevilla have devoted many years to the study of this unknown but interesting phenomenon , which affects approximately one person out of every thousand .
Many of these people do not even know that they are synaesthetes , as they think they perceive the world normally .
Callejas ’ doctoral thesis is one of the most detailed studies on this phenomenon at an international level , and it is probably the first doctoral thesis on this topic in Europe .
Her study covers the various forms of synaesthesia focussing on the most common one : the grapheme - color type ( for people with this form of synaesthesia , letters , words and numbers evoke colors in an automatic and involuntary way ) .
One of the distinctive characteristics of this form of synaesthesia is the fact that people are certain about their perceptions : they feel that their way of experiencing the world is correct , and they become disappointed when they realize there is something that is not quite right .
‘ Therefore , when a person with grapheme - color synaesthesia indicates that the word table is blue , it is quite probable that if he or she ever sees the same word written in a color other than blue , this word will appear to him or her as wrong and consider it a mistake .
The synaesthete might even point out that the word is ugly or that he or she does not like it because it is not correct , ’ affirms Callejas .
Consequently , finding the word table written in red might be unpleasant whereas seeing it in blue might be agreeable .
This emotional reaction associated with how synaesthetes perceive consistent or inconsistent stimuli is an extremely interesting subject and has been studied for the first time in this doctoral thesis .
Some of Callejas ’ conclusions show that these emotional reactions occur automatically and can not be ignored .
Moreover , they can affect the synaesthete to the point of slanting his or her preferences when faced with certain stimuli which correspond to his or her inner experiences .
Even more important is the fact that these emotions can transform how they perceive events associated with these experiences .
These events may have no emotional meaning initially but they can become more or less pleasant if they take place at the same time the synaesthete finds a word in the correct or incorrect color .
‘ Then , there are people for whom time units evoke colors – explains the researcher .
It is also common for a synaesthete to see colors when listening to words , sounds in general or music notes ( people who can see music , for instance ) .
There are also cases , although fewer , where people can see colors in flavors , others perceive flavors or experience touch sensations when listening to different sounds , some link flavours to touch sensations , etc . ’
These researchers from Granada underline that synaesthetes always experience the same vision , synaesthesia is permanent ( a given stimulus always evokes the same Color for one person ) and idiosyncratic ( it is different for each person ) .
Therefore , if for a synaesthete the word dog is red , every time he or she sees it , it will be perceived as red .
Even though synaesthesia has been known for a long time , its scientific study is relatively recent .
Writings such as the Castel one , in which reference is made to previous studies about a synaesthesia case in a blind person , are found in the 18th century .
The evolution of the study of this phenomenon has been spectacular – the number of researchers working on this topic is constantly increasing , as will be evident in the Conference which will take place in Granada – and , as the phase of proving that this phenomenon exists has been overcome , explains Alicia Callejas , ‘ we are starting to approach questions of major theoretical importance , and to develop adequate study strategies . ’
The results of her research have been published in the following prestigious scientific journals , among others : Cortex , Experimental Brain Research and Consciousness and Cognition .
Below are the challenges posed most frequently to o.a.g. by visitors skeptical of her views .
To save time , she has decided to publish a FAQ to address them .

FAQ #1
HOW CAN YOU TELL WOMEN NOT TO BE IN PORN ?
ISN'T IT THEIR CHOICE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH THEIR BODIES ?
The " choice " issue is a perennial favorite among the pro-porn set , usually deployed as a conversation - stopper .
University professor Rebecca
Whisnant has a great statement this one , which we 'll quote first :
“ We need to think and talk somewhat differently about women who participate in the sex industry .
Yes , many are coerced .
Many are not coerced , but their choices to participate are made under far less than ideal conditions and result in significant harm to themselves .
Finally , there may be some women ( a relative few , to be sure ) who choose participation in the sex industry from a meaningful range of options and who experience that participation as at least tolerable , and at best empowering .
Certainly there are women who report this to be true of them , and while we many often suspect that a level of denial is operative , we need not assume a priori that denial or dissociation explains every such case .
Rather we can grant , at least for the sake of argument , that such cases exist .
The next question is , what of it ?
In particular , it seems to me that a useful next question would be this : on whose backs are they having this tolerable - to - empowering experience ?
What are the costs to women in general , and to the overwhelming majority of prostituted women in particular , of allowing this opportunity to those few ( by definition relatively privileged ) women who might feely and sincerely choose it for themselves ?
( Not For Sale , page 24 )
Okay , there are several main reasons that women get involved in porn , stripping , and prostitution .
Unfortunately , no study currently exists with a pie chart of how many women fall into each category .
That would actually be a big help .
However , our extensive research indicates that the following seven are the most common scenarios :
1. Childhood Sexual Abuse
A girl is molested , or raped , sometimes repeatedly , most commonly by a father or stepfather .
The Department of Justice reports that 44 % of rape victims were younger than 18 when assaulted .
Sexually abused children are about 4 times more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder , and these typically include post - traumatic stress disorder , depression , anxiety , self - mutilation , or a dissociative disorder .
At any rate , there is inevitably a destructive effect on the girl ’s developing psyche .
Survivors commonly describe feeling disconnected from their bodies and from themselves ... a loss of control ... unbearable shame ... and confusion about sexuality .
Of course , not each and every sexual abuse survivor becomes a porn star , because that would equal 1 of every 6 American women .
The numbers are that high .
But researchers in the field find that frequently , survivors can directly trace their entry into porn , stripping , or prostitution back to their previous abuse .
Their first sexual experiences have taught them that their primary value in life is their body and what others want to do with it .
Or they learn that they are dirty little whores and they might as well live the part .
As Taylor Lee , sexual abuse survivor and ex-stripper explains ,
" The first time I had sex , I was raped by someone close enough to my family to call my mother ' mom . '
Now , I was sure what I was for .
I knew that my greatest asset was my sexuality and knew how badly it was desired .
I also realized that I had little control over my sexuality , that it could be taken at will .
It was easy to give it for profit ; at least then I was in control . "
( Not For Sale , page 58 )
Legendary porn performer Traci Lords recently linked a rape she experienced as a 10 - year old with her underage entry into the porn industry .
And America ’s porn sweetheart , Jenna Jameson , has also reported several rapes during her adolescence .
Can a truly free choice be made in response to childhood trauma ?
We think not .
2. Homelessness
If a teen girl becomes homeless , either escaping an abusive home or being thrown out of one , she has two pressing concerns : food and shelter .
Decent , well - paying jobs that cover the rent are in short supply for a homeless teenage girl to procure , especially if she has not completed high school .
Generally , you need a marketable skill , access to showers and clean clothing , and a physical address to list on the job application .
But the girl quickly realizes , on her own or through the encouragement of a street pimp , that she indeed has a marketable skill : she can get paid in cash to perform sexual acts with strangers .
( See Anitra ’s story : www.oneangrygirl.net/anitra_winder.html)
Researchers in multiple studies have consistently found that the average age of entry into prostitution falls between 13 and 19 , the years when most of you were doing your history homework and picking out your prom dress .
As one girl prostituting in Seattle put it , " We were all molested and sexually abused as children , do n't you know that ?
We ran to get away .
They did n't want us in the house anymore .
We were thrown out , thrown away .
We 've been on the street since we were 12 , 13 , 14 . " ( Not For Sale , page 114 ) Frequently , pornography is also made of prostitutes , often without their consent .
In Farley and Lynne 's study of prostituted women in British Columbia , 67 % percent of subjects reported this happening to them .
The resulting pictures and videos are useful to pimps as blackmail evidence , should the woman ever attempt to leave her situation .
Is a homeless teenage girl trying to stay alive by engaging in prostitution and pornography truly exercising her free will and making an uncoerced career choice ?
We think not .
3. Drug Addiction
A woman or girl addicted to drugs requires a reliable , steady cash flow to maintain her habit .
If she 's a corporate lawyer , or Whitney Houston , then no big deal .
However , if she 's homeless or poor or unskilled , she is far more likely to resort to prostitution , porn or stripping than to try to finance her addiction making $ 7.50 an hour at Wal - Mart .
As previously mentioned , selling sex is the one marketable skill that every women shares in a culture like ours .
We all know that if times get tough enough , we can likely find a buyer for our body .
But just like you probably did n’t get shitfaced drunk before you took your SAT ’s or sat for the big job interview , we do n’t expect people on drugs to make sensible , binding career decisions .
Can a woman in the grip of a chemical addiction exercise free will or well - reasoned career choice ?
We think not .
4. Trafficking
Girls living in poor countries – think Nepal , Philipines , Ukraine – are being sold by their families into brothels at alarming rates .
The family gets a steady income , the girl gets raped 15 to 20 times a day by middle - aged sex tourists seeking virgin pussy .
Alternatively , girls seeking jobs abroad – because none exist in their home country – will answer ads to become hostesses , waitresses , or “ entertainers . ”
When they reach their destinations , they discover that they are expected to prostitute in gang - controlled brothels , or strip in gang - controlled clubs .
Or both .
If they need convincing to adjust to these circumstances , gang members are brought in to beat them , rape them , lock them up , and destroy their passports .
Finally , some girls ( and boys ) are simply kidnapped or stolen and forced into the sex industry after being raped and beaten into submission .
Trafficked women are also brought to America to work the strip club circuit .
This is happening all over the world right this minute , but feel free to visit the website for Coalition Against Trafficking in Women ( http://www.catwinternational.org) if you require further proof .
Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times has also written extensively on this subject .
Can a trafficked or kidnapped girl freely or consensually participate in her new job ?
We think not .
Frequently , scenarios 1 through 4 become intertwined , making " choice " an ever more dubious possibility .
The sexual abuse victim becomes a runaway .
The runaway becomes drug- addicted .
The addict loses her home .
And so on .
5. Unaware
Somewhat more rare , but increasing in popularity , are cases of pornography being made of women who are unaware of what 's happening .
Girls and women are videotaped in restrooms , in changing rooms , in tanning salons .
Tiny cameras hidden in briefcases take " upskirt " photos later posted to voyeur websites .
Boyfriends and husbands will also take consensual naked pics of their partners , but then send them to amateur porn sites , or to Hustler Magazine , without their partners ' knowledge ... or they do this after a breakup in order to get revenge .
Free choice ?
Yeah , right .
6. Socialization / No Other Options
An increasingly common scenario .
Say you 're an average , all - American girl , born in 1987 .
That makes you 18 in 2005 .
At age five , you watched skinny women shake their asses around in the " Baby Got Back " video , which played on MTV approximately every 15 minutes during the summer of 1992 .
You and your little friends copied those moves and your parents thought it was so darn cute that they got out the camcorder .
At age eleven , the Spice Girls were your idols .
They showed that you could achieve Girl Power by looking hot , staying skinny , and showing lots of leg .
You thought Ginger Spice was the hottest , and pleaded to dye your hair red .
When you got to 7th grade , you were sexually harassed by your classmates , something you shared with 83 % of the female student population ( Harris Interactive Poll , 2001 ) .
See , your breasts had developed rather quickly , and boys dared each other to sneak up behind you and grab them .
Sometimes they succeeded , but the teachers never saw .
Other girls did , and spread rumors about what a slut you were .
For a while you had no friends , and you developed a quiet eating disorder .
You never had a sex ed. class , because your state 's Department of Education did n't require it .
By 8th grade graduation , you heard that all the popular girls were giving blow jobs after school .
Their boyfriends expected this after two weeks of going out .
High school was a little better .
Luckily , you never got date - raped , but your best friend did .
She did n't do anything about it , though , because everyone knew she 'd had a major crush on the rapist .
Meanwhile , IM was the hot new thing , and you were busy chatting away and fending off requests to send sexy photos of yourself to the pervy guys in the chat rooms .
You lost your virginity at a party in 10th grade but never spoke to the guy afterwards .
You heard later that he 'd assessed you as " fat thighs , great tits . "
Your guy friends were all bragging about jerking off to porn , and you quickly realized that you had to act like that was no big deal .
That 's what all the other girls did .
By 11th grade all the girls were wearing the Playboy bunny chokers and Porn Star shirts and shorts with " Naughty " written across the ass .
Guys who dated a lot of girls called themselves " pimps , " and you and your friends went through a phase when you called each other " whore , " as a term of affection .
One of the most popular guy 's dads had promised to hire him a stripper for his 18th birthday party , according to the latest rumor .
You watched girls get drunk at parties and make out with each other while the guys cheered and took photos .
You saw American Pie and The Girl Next Door and countless reality TV shows where women paraded around in hot pants and thong swimsuits and even wedding gowns , competing for fabulous prizes and / or husbands .
Senior year , a new Hooters restaurant opened on the highway near your school and became the cool new hangout .
Sometimes you ended up there with friends after the game , and your Uncle Jim hosted his 45th birthday party there .
But then you turned 18 and graduated .
Your family can't really afford college for you , and your grades were never that stellar anyway .
So you do some neighborhood babysitting , and some lifeguarding at the lake , and try to imagine your next move .
This girl you know says she 's going to audition at the Glass Slipper strip club on Route 39 – " always hiring new dancers ! " – and invites you to come with .
Your summer boyfriend thinks it 's a really hot idea .
You say you need to think about it .
All of your ideas about love and sexuality have been shaped by a lifetime of semi-sleazy , exploitative experiences .
But you think of them as normal , just like you think porn is a natural part of everyone ’s life .
You 've never been raped , but you 've grown up in a rape culture .
Time and again , it 's been clearly demonstrated that you , and all womankind , are really only useful for one thing .
Luckily , this one thing happens to be what men will pay you top dollar for .
And right now , you ’re unemployed .
If you decide to become a stripper , are you really choosing freely ?
Or are you simply taking the next logical step in your American - girl socialization process , a track fashioned by the marketers , magazine editors , and movie producers , upon which you were placed as a young child ?
Did you ever really have a choice ?
We think not .
7. Total Free Choice
We believe this scenario represents the tiniest minority of prostitutes , strippers , and porn performers , but we ’re willing to grant that a few cases exist .
These are the women who had an array of equally enticing options – college scholarship , live - in nanny position , radio DJ , paralegal , direct marketing representative , contestant on Star Search …or the sex industry .
They chose the sex industry for its high salary , flexible hours , advancement potential , and considerable hipster cred .
They are happy and fulfilled in their careers .
We know this because they are always telling us how happy and fulfilled they are in the titillating first - person columns they write for Marie Claire and Cosmo and Maxim and The Nation .
Because the media loves the " happy hooker " story , and because homeless meth addicts and teenage runaways do n't tend to write grammatical prose , theirs is the scenario most commonly presented to the American public .
We admit it 's possible , but we know it ai n't common .
Free choice ?
Well , that 's what they 're telling us .
So now you 've read about the seven most common scenarios that lead women into the sex industry .
Perhaps you are even willing to admit that in the first 5 scenarios , free will in the John Locke or David Hume sense is not clearly evident .
In scenarios 6 and 7 , one can make an argument that some choice does exist .
Following the pro-porn argument that most liberals adopt , using porn and buying hookers is fair and square if they freely and joyfully consented ... but uncool if they have n't .
However .
When you 're using porn , or hiring an escort , or watching a stripper , how can you actually know which girl you 're getting ?
Do the girls wear labels that say “ Need the cash for my heroin addiction ” or “ Quit my career in finance to do this instead ” ?
Do the pornographers provide mini bios of the stars ?
No , they do n’t .
You have no idea who you ’re getting ,
Sure , you might be lucky once or twice and rent a video featuring a grad - school dropout , or score a lapdance from the ex-teacher who decided to try a second career as a stripper just for kicks .
But we estimate that the majority of the time , you will be watching rape and incest survivors on the screen and stage .
And if you ’ve ever enjoyed a Traci Lords or Jenna Jameson video , you already have .
FAQ#2
IF YOU HATE PORN SO MUCH , WHY DON ’T YOU JUST NOT WATCH IT ?
Well , one angry girl does n’t like porn , and she does n’t watch it .
But is her life porn - free ?
Hardly .
Used to be that if you wanted porn , you had to go out and look for it .
These days , it comes looking for you whether you want it or not .
Not a day goes by without several visual reminders of the multi-billion dollar sex industry that is gradually poisoning our country .
Some everyday porn intrusions :
• Porn spam in your inbox , or porn sites resulting from a carelessly worded Internet search
• Billboards for strip clubs and big box porn stores like Penthouse Boutique on the highways
• In Portland , OR : passing 3 or 4 strip clubs on your way to work
• In New York City : riding in taxis with neon strip club ads on the roof
• Soft - core porn titles mixed in with the new releases when you ’re browsing at Blockbuster
• Escort ads in the back of every “ arts ” weekly , plus strip club ads sprinkled throughout
• Playboy bunny gear and Pimp shirts on the kidz at the mall
• Frequent “ exclusive ” features and articles on porn in mainstream TV , newspapers , magazines
• Newly available : porn on the cell phone or iPod of the guy sitting next to you on the train ; porn on the DVD player of the SUV next to you in traffic
• If you ’re single : having to choose from a pool of men currently expecting sex on the first date , a shaved pubic area , frequent anal sex , threesomes with your best friend … who then decide they ca n’t be in a “ relationship ” with a woman because it ’s too much of a “ hassle ”
• Interacting every day with men and women whose views of sex and love have been shaped by all the porn they ’ve seen
Now , one angry girl does n’t smoke weed either , but manages quite successfully to avoid having it shoved in her face several times each day .
Why should porn be different ?
Should antiporn folks have to stay home and avoid all forms of media so that you can have infinite quantities of masturbation fodder , or an unlimited number of hot young sluts to rent for the night ?
In summary , telling someone who hates porn to “ just not watch it ” is rather like telling someone who hates George W. Bush to “ just forget he ’s the President . ”
FAQ#3
SO YOU THINK PORN SHOULD BE BANNED ?
If you scour this website , you will find no statement attributed to o.a.g. suggesting pornography should be banned .
Pro-porn folks always throw that accusation at us to try to shut us up .
Banning pornography will not address the demand for it .
As noted elsewhere , we favor education about the realities of pornography over any legislative efforts to reduce porn use .
FAQ#4
WHY DO YOU HATE SEX ?
This might be a valid question if pornography and sex were the same thing .
But they are n’t .
As one astute feminist has pointed out , comparing porn to sex is like hitting someone in the head with a frying pan and calling it cooking .
To use another culinary analogy , if you tell people you do n’t like to eat at Burger King , they do n’t immediately accuse you of hating food .
If you honestly believe that porn and sex are equivalent , you need more help than we can offer here .
And we feel sorry for you .
FAQ#5
ISN ’T IT THE PARENTS FAULT IF THEIR KIDS ARE SEEING PORN ?
one angry girl basically agrees with this .
She thinks too many parents are fearfully naïve about the reach of porn , and could be doing much more to monitor their kids ’ media intake .
There is no convincing reason for letting a child have internet or cable access in their own bedroom .
Moving the TV’s and computers to a central location – the family room , the kitchen – would surely cut down on a minor ’s ability to access porn in the home .
With that said , today we ’ve asked parents to do an impossible job , and we have n’t given them much help .
Let ’s compare porn to alcohol for a moment .
Both are legal substances for adults , but prohibited to children .
Imagine you ’re the parent of a 12 - year old boy , and every night random people barge into your home unannounced and proceed to offer Johnny free tequila shots .
Same thing happens when he visits a friend , goes to the library , buys a magazine , or hangs out at the mall .
As his parent , you do your best to shoo the tequila people away , but they seem to come back each day , always insisting that they have the right to access your child .
You ’d like to shadow Johnny at all times to be sure he never drinks the tequila , but unfortunately , you ’ve occasionally got other things to do .
Now we could say that you are n’t a vigilant enough parent , that you ’re not doing enough to protect your kid from the dangers of tequila .
Or , we could ask ourselves , “ Why ca n’t we do something to prevent all these strangers from getting near your child ? ”
We might say that about alcohol , but we wo n’t say it about porn .
Because we as a society have apparently decided that an adult ’s right to unlimited photos of dirty , nasty whores undergoing double anal penetration , and every major media corporation ’s right to make a profit off it , supersedes the right of your child to have some semblance of a childhood .
FAQ#6
PORN HAS BEEN A POSITIVE THING FOR ME ( AND MY PARTNER ) SO WHY SHOULD I FEEL BAD ABOUT USING IT ?
Well , lots of folks just LOVE those low prices at Wal - Mart , but they should realize that every dollar they spend at Wal - Mart further enriches an employer that pays its workers so little that they routinely qualify for food stamps and Medicaid .
Likewise with porn : it might enhance your masturbation or finally convince your wife to try anal sex , but every dollar you spend on porn… and escorts … and strip clubs … helps to feed an industry that thrives on the suffering of others .
Some examples :
• Pedophiles use porn to “ season ” their victims .
If you want an 8 - year - old to give you a blow job , you ’re going to need to show him a photo so he knows what to do .
87 % of molesters of girls , and 77 % of the molesters of boys admitted to regular use of hard - core pornography .
• Prostitutes often have porn made of them which is used to blackmail them ( Farley , 2003 )
• At a 2003 meeting of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , two - thirds of the 350 divorce lawyers who attended said Internet porn contributed to more than half of the divorce cases they handled .
• Porn performers commonly turn to drugs to cope with the effects of porn on their psyches .
As ex-actress Shelley Lubben notes , “ some women hate it so much you can hear them vomiting in the bathroom between scenes . ”
• Over half of convicted rapists in 56 % of the rapists in 1988 study said they imitated favorite porn scenes while committing their crimes .
And a detective examining rapes committed in Michigan between 1956 - 1979 found that porn was used before or during the crime in 41 % of the incidents .
Say you and your spouse enjoy watching women get double penetrated .
It improves your sex life .
But in order for you to have this viewing pleasure , there is a woman out there who has to undergo double penetration .
Now there is a chance that she greatly enjoys double penetration .
There is a greater chance that she does n’t , and is doing the scene because she does n’t have the industry power to say no to it , but she APPEARS to be enjoying the double penetration anyway , because she is ACTING .
This woman might be doing the scene by total free choice .
She ’s a nymphomaniac , she ca n’t get enough sex .
She may also be doing the scene because her pimp is withholding her cocaine until she does it .
You do n’t have any way of knowing , because as noted elsewhere , the women are not wearing labels that “ Totally loving this double penetration ” or “ Want to vomit from the pain but need the money too badly . ”
FAQ#7
ARE YOU SAYING THAT PORN TURNS MEN INTO RAPISTS ?
We are saying the link between pornography use and subsequent aggression was proven so successfully by Zillmann and Bryant that their studies cannot be replicated for fear of further harming possible research subjects ( Paul , 2005 ) .
Luckily for us , not every man who uses porn commits a rape .
But then , not every person who smokes gets lung cancer either , and you ’ll notice that cigarettes come with handy warning labels all the same .
FAQ#8
EVERYTHING HERE IS ANTIPORN !
WHY DON ’T YOU PRESENT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT ?
one angry girl thinks the “ other side of the argument ” is sufficiently presented by the bazillion porn sites already on the Internet , which currently outnumber the antiporn sites by about 300 million to one .
Since the pornographers do n’t feel compelled to present any antiporn arguments among their streaming videos of nasty teen sluts , we are n’t compelled to parrot their nonsense here .
But in the spirit of fairness , we ’ll offer a compromise : when every porn site on the Internet includes a chapter or two of Andrea Dworkin ’s work , then we¹ll include some Wendy McElroy here .
Sound fair ?
FAQ#9
WHY CANÕT I CALL MYSELF A FEMINIST AND STILL ENJOY PORN ?
We checked the dictionary tonight and the definition of feminist is not ³whatever the hell a woman feels like doing . ²
To be precise , feminism is ³the doctrine advocating social , political , and all other rights of women equal to those of men , ² and a feminist is someone who actively works towards those goals .
For all women .
On the planet .
Nobody will ever be able to convince one angry girl that pornography is a route to social and political equality for all women , and in fact , the majority of the evidence currently available points to the exact opposite .
If you are a true feminist , you do not say to the untold numbers of women hurt by pornography , ³I donÕt really care about your experiences , because porn is such a lucrative job / my boyfriend and I really like it / it makes me feel sexxeee . ²
So keep your porn if you must , but don¹t call yourself a feminist .

By Martin Bosworth
The American Prospect ’s Harold Meyerson has an op-ed in the Washington Post today outlining the nature of the coming recession , and how our economic response is going to have to change if we ’re to fix it .
“ Wait , ” you ’re thinking , “ is he saying we ’re in recession ?
Surely not !
I know it ’s a worry , but no one ’s actually said it ’s official yet . ”
Let ’s take a look at the facts , then :
Citigroup , America ’s largest bank , has been hit with a staggering $ 10 billion in losses this quarter .
Naturally , the company is doing what all companies do as a first response to crisis–cutting thousands of jobs–and is begging foreign investors to pump cash into its reserves to keep it solvent .
Countrywide , America ’s largest lender , reported spikes in delinquencies and foreclosures so severe that the company was looking at bankruptcy protection .
It was hailed as a relief when Bank of America announced plans to buy the lender , but think about this –how bad is our economic state when our biggest giants in their respective industries are doing so poorly ?
And what about the consumer , that bulwark of economic growth through spending ?
Well , thanks to a combination of collapsing home equity , high gas , energy , and food prices , and nearly insurmountable personal debt , consumers are falling behind on loan payments , credit card debt is on the rise , and retail sales are plummeting from lack of consumer spending .
If this is n’t a recession , it ’s damn close , and like the wolf hungrily stalking its prey , will be upon us soon .
Back to Meyerson ’s column .
He accurately notes that the mazelike structures of current Wall Street investment strategies make it nigh - impossible to accurately oversee these transactions , which has led to so many billions of dollars ’ worth of losses .
Moreover , he also notes that without some serious infusion of jobs , cash , and direction from the government , this recession may deepen into a depression that will take years to recover from .
“ Okay , ” you may be asking , “ but where can we get the money for such a thing ?
That ’s going to be expensive ! ”
Well , here ’s one simple idea–ending the war in Iraq immediately and bringing our troops home .
Imagine what we could do with the influx of capital we ’re wasting on a failed venture that has cost thousands of lives and tens of millions of dollars .
I live in DC , so I used my own city as the basis for calculation :
Taxpayers in District Of Columbia will pay $ 2 billion for the cost of the Iraq War through 2007 .
For the same amount of money , the following could have been provided :
504,157 People with Health Care OR
3,465,229 Homes with Renewable Electricity OR
33,815 Public Safety Officers OR
33,333 Music and Arts Teachers OR
946,048 Scholarships for University Students OR
174 New Elementary Schools OR
6,801 Affordable Housing Units OR
620,958 Children with Health Care OR
266,133 Head Start Places for Children OR
33,333 Elementary School Teachers OR
29,432 Port Container Inspectors
Any one of these projects provides a golden opportunity for new jobs and economic revitalization for my city , or the even better long - term investment of raising kids with decent educations and the ability to make better lives for themselves .
But we ’ll never know , because that money went instead to turning a country into a protectorate of our empire just to keep the oil pumps working .
I said not long ago that in order to win , Democrats should run on the economy instead of Iraq , and I still hold to that .
But I am rethinking that approach–instead of trying to push Iraq aside in people ’s minds , Democrats and progressives should link the two together .
Every dollar spent in Iraq , fighting a war started on a lie that has cost us immeasurably , is a dollar not spent on rebuilding our country ’s prosperity , peace , and future solvency .
End the war , bring our troops home , and let ’s get down to the equally painful business of rebuilding our country ’s economic base and transiting us out from a system based on debt , consumption , greed , and graft .
We ’ve done it before , and we can do it again .
We do n’t have any choice in the matter .

Updated 5:15 p.m. Central Time Feb. 25th
A spokesperson in Minnesota Representative and House Judiciary Committee member Keith Ellison ’s office confirmed today that Representative Ellison has added his name to Florida Representative Robert Wexler ’s letter calling for the HJC to immediately commence impeachment hearings investigating Vice President Richard B. Cheney for possible impeachable offenses .
Wexler has also gathered over 230,000 online citizen signatures in support of Cheney ’s impeachment at : www.WexlerWantsHearings.com.
Ellison spearheaded an effort to initiate impeachment proceedings while he was a state legislator in Minnesota and was an early cosigner onto H. Res. 333 ( now 799 ) authored by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and has continued to consistently support efforts to impeach the Vice President and President George W. Bush .
A list found on Wexler ’s campaign website : www.WexlerforCongress.com just added Ellison ’s name and lists three other members of the HJC as signatories , Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) and Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) along with Rep. Wexler .
Ellison ’s signing means that five of the twenty two Democrats on the committee have cosigned Wexler ’s letter .
Three other HJC members signed onto H. Res. 333 : Hency ‘ Hank ’ Johnson ( D - GA ) , Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) , Sheila Jackson - Lee ( D - TX ) last year and one more , Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) , has publicly stated that he will sign Wexler ’s letter which brings a total of nine HJC members publicly favoring impeachment and thirteen not yet in support .
HJC Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) and powerful member Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) were impeachment advocates but have changed positions in the new congress , seemingly heeding the call of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to keep impeachment “ off the table ” .
Here is the list from Wexler ’s site with Ellison ’s name added :

More than 250 bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a massive suicide bombing in northwestern Iraq , the deadliest single attack in the troubled country since the war began in 2003 .
Rescue workers and relativespulled dozens of bodies Wednesday from demolished clay homes in theneighbouring villagesof Qataniya and Adnaniya , where fourvehicles blew up within minutes of each other on Tuesday .
At least one of the vehicles was a fuel tanker full of explosives , police said .
The blasts set shops ablaze , severely damaged nearby apartment buildings and flattened entire neighbourhoods .
Health Minister Zayan Othman said more than 350 people were wounded in the blasts and warned that the death toll could rise .
" My friend and I were thrown high in the air .
I still do n't know what happened to him , " Khadir Shamu , 30 , told the Associated Press .
The BBC reported that the wounded streamed into area hospitals on Wednesday , as did potential blood donors looking to help .
In one hospital , a bridetold reporters that her new husband and nine of his family members had been killed in the explosions .
The devastating strikestruck villages that are home to the Yazidi community , an ancient Kurdish sect that worships an angel figure that some Muslims and Christians consider to be the devil .
The Yazidi community , located near the Syrian border , has been attacked by Muslim extremists before .
U.S. military officials were quick to condemn Tuesday 's attack .
" This is an act of ethnic cleansing , if you will , almost genocide , when you consider the fact of the target they attacked , " U.S. army Maj .
Benjamin Mixon , the commander of U.S. forces in northern Iraq , told CNN .
With the death toll hitting 250 on Wednesday , theincident officially became the largest loss of life in an Iraqi attack since the 2003 U.S. invasion , surpassing a Nov. 23 bombing thatkilled 215 people and devastated Sadr City , a Shia neighbourhood in Baghdad .
Al - Qaeda blamed
No one claimed responsibility forTuesday 's suicide bombings , but Dakhil Qassim , the mayor of the nearby town of Sinjar , blamedal - Qaeda , citing what he said were Kurdish government intelligence reports .
He said the bombings intended to kill " poor Yazidis who have nothing to do with the armed conflict , " and added that al - Qaeda militants were " very active " in the area near the Syrian border .
A U.S. spokesman in Iraq also pointed to al - Qaeda .
" The car bombs that were used all had the consistent profile of al - Qaeda in Iraq violence , " Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner told reporters in Baghdad .
Iraq officials fear thesurge of U.S. troops in the city of Baghdad is pushing extremists to launch attacks in more remote parts of Iraq .
Difficult to curb violence
Yahid Said , who researches global governance at the London School of Economics , said the attack shows how difficult it will be to curb violence in Iraq .
" It definitely signals the fact that no matter how much is invested in the surge and other efforts , it 's very difficult to control that territory of Iraq and to stop terrorists from inflicting damage , " he told CBC News .
U.S. Gen . David Petraeus said the attack shows that the U.S. cannot too quickly withdraw the 30,000 additionalsoldiers sent to Iraq in early 2007 , boosting the total U.S. contingent in the country to roughly 145,000 soldiers .
Petraeus said he will recommend that the U.S. Congress withdraw troops slowly through to next summer so that the U.S. does n't lose " the gains we have fought so hard to achieve . "
Can the masses be wooed by Linux ?
Second - tier PC maker Everex teamed up with a startup called gOS to build the gPC TC2502 , a $ 199 VIA - powered Ubuntu 7.10 Linux system with an Enlightenment E17 interface .
Although they assure us that the " g " does n't stand for Google , the PC 's productivity will be almost solely derived from Google apps accessed through Firefox : Mail , Calendar , News , Maps and Documents & Spreadsheets .
It will also come with OpenOffice.org 2.2 and some other freeware Linux faves .
But again , the question is , will the Wal - Mart crowd bite the bait ?
Advertisement
It turns out , 5 % of people buying a PC at Wal - Mart are buying one for the first time , yes , in 2007 .
That means that for them , there 's no brand allegiance , there 's no OS that they are already comfortable with , there 's nothing but functionality ( " Does it have the e-mail and the pretty ladies on the World Wide Internet ? " ) and price ( " I 'm not gonna pay no $ 300 for no damn computer ! " ) .
This meets both , and looks enough like some kind of Macindows hybrid for the more computer savvy relatives to help out the new buyer .

There are some omissions in the early stages : Picasa did n't quite work right , so it 's not there yet .
( GIMP is there , but not a lot of people like GIMP . )
There 's Skype , but I do n't think it can do video yet .
There are apps for working with iPods , but I am worried that people who want to use an iPod will be frustrated with the lack of iTunes .
The funniest thing is that Everex deliberately built a large box , even though there 's not much under the hood .
This is a pure psychological play to woo the pickup truck set , who believe a Chevy S10 is a sure sign of sexual inadequacy .
The system will pack a 1.5GHz low - wattage VIA C7 - D processor ( pitched as a " green " machine ) .
It will have 512MB of RAM and an 80 GB HDD .
It wo n't even have a DVD burner , though they are now practically free .
And as for the monitor you 've come to expect in a bundle , it 's gonna cost you extra .
( Speakers , mouse and keyboard are included . )
All in all , though , I like to see things get shaken up .
This is apparently replacing a Windows model at that price point or slightly higher , and the approach is different , and probably smarter , than the teeny tiny subscription - based Zonbu ( of which Everex is also a manufacturing partner ) .
The whole FOSS ( free open - source software ) movement really should be aimed at newbies and non-power users .
After all , the generalist can do all that they can dream up on any machine out there , whereas the specialists are the ones who are truly locked to one OS or another .

Beautiful Soup 3 has been replaced by Beautiful Soup 4 .
You may be looking for the Beautiful Soup 4 documentation Beautiful Soup 3 only works on Python 2.x , but Beautiful Soup 4 also works on Python 3.x.
Beautiful Soup 4 is faster , has more features , and works with third - party parsers like lxml and html5lib .
You should use Beautiful Soup 4 for all new projects , and you should port any existing projects to Beautiful Soup 4 .
Beautiful Soup 3 will be discontinued on or after December 31 , 2020 .
Beautiful Soup 3 已 经 被Beautiful Soup 4替代.请在新的项目中查看 Beautiful Soup 4 的文档. Beautiful Soup 3只能在python2.x版本中运行 , 而Beautiful Soup 4还可以在python3.x版本中运行.
Beautiful Soup 4速度更快 , 特性更多 ,而且与第三方的文档解析库(如lxml和html5lib)协同工作.推荐在新的项目中使用Beautiful
Soup 4 . Beautiful Soup 3 将于2020年12月31日或之后停产。
Beautiful Soup is an HTML / XML parser for Python that can turn even invalid markup into a parse tree .
It provides simple , idiomatic ways of navigating , searching , and modifying the parse tree .
It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work .
There 's also a Ruby port called Rubyful Soup .
This document illustrates all major features of Beautiful Soup version 3.0 , with examples .
It shows you what the library is good for , how it works , how to use it , how to make it do what you want , and what to do when it violates your expectations .
Table of Contents
Quick Start
Get Beautiful Soup here .
The changelog describes differences between 3.0 and earlier versions .
Include Beautiful Soup in your application with a line like one of the following :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup # For processing HTML from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup # For processing XML import BeautifulSoup #
To get everything
If you get the message " No module named BeautifulSoup " , but you know Beautiful Soup is installed , you 're probably using the Beautiful Soup 4 beta .
Use this code instead :
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup #
To get everything
This document only covers Beautiful Soup 3 .
Beautiful Soup 4 has some slight differences ; see the README . txt file for details .
Here 's some code demonstrating the basic features of Beautiful Soup .
You can copy and paste this code into a Python session to run it yourself .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import re doc = [ ' < html > < head > < title > Page title </ title ></head >' , '< body > < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.' , ' < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two </b>.' , '< /html > ' ] soup = BeautifulSoup ( ''.join ( doc ) ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < head > # < title > # Page title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # one # </b> # . # </p> # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # two # </b> # . # </ p> # </ body > # </html >
Here are some ways to navigate the soup :
soup.contents[0 ].name # u'html ' soup.contents[0].contents [0 ].name # u'head ' head = soup.contents[0].contents[0 ] head.parent.name # u'html ' head .
next # < title > Page title </ title > head.nextSibling.name # u'body ' head.nextSibling.contents [ 0 ]
# < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> head.nextSibling.contents[0].nextSibling # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</ p>
Here are a couple of ways to search the soup for certain tags , or tags with certain properties :
titleTag = soup.html.head.title titleTag # < title > Page title </ title > titleTag.string # u'Page title ' len ( soup ( ' p ' ) ) # 2 soup.findAll ('p ' , align= " center " ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </ b>. </p >] soup. find ('p ' , align= " center " ) # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one < / b>. </ p> soup ( 'p ' , align= " center " ) [ 0 ] [ ' id ' ] # u'firstpara ' soup.find ('p ' , align=re.compile ( '^b.*' ) ) [ ' id ' ] # u'secondpara ' soup.find ('p ' ) .b. string # u'one ' soup ( 'p ' ) [ 1 ] .b. string # u'two '
It 's easy to modify the soup :
titleTag [ 'id ' ] = ' the Title ' titleTag.contents[0].replaceWith ( " New title " ) soup.html.head # < head >< title id =" the Title " >
New title </ title ></head > soup.p.extract( ) soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < head > # < title id =" the Title " > # New title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # two # </b> # . # </ p> # </ body >
# </html > soup.p.replaceWith(soup.b ) # < html > # < head > # < title id =" the Title " > # New title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < b> # two # </b> # </ body >
# </html > soup.body.insert( 0 , " This page used to have " ) soup.body.insert ( 2 , " < p > tags ! " ) soup.body # < body > This page used to have < b > two </b> < p > tags !</ body >
Here 's a real - world example .
It fetches the ICC Commercial Crime Services weekly piracy report , parses it with Beautiful Soup , and pulls out the piracy incidents :
import urllib2 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup page = urllib2.urlopen ( " http://www.icc-ccs.org/prc/piracyreport.php " ) soup = BeautifulSoup ( page ) for incident in soup ( 'td ' , width = " 90 % " ) : where , linebreak , what = incident.contents [ :3 ] print where .strip ( ) print what .
strip ( ) print
Parsing a Document
A Beautiful Soup constructor takes an XML or HTML document in the form of a string ( or an open file - like object ) .
It parses the document and creates a corresponding data structure in memory .
If you give Beautiful Soup a perfectly - formed document , the parsed data structure looks just like the original document .
But if there 's something wrong with the document , Beautiful Soup uses heuristics to figure out a reasonable structure for the data structure .
Parsing HTML
Use the BeautifulSoup class to parse an HTML document .
Here are some of the things that BeautifulSoup knows :
Some tags can be nested ( < BLOCKQUOTE > ) and some can't ( < P > ) .
Table and list tags have a natural nesting order .
For instance , < TD > tags go inside < TR > tags , not the other way around .
The contents of a < SCRIPT > tag should not be parsed as HTML .
A < META > tag may specify an encoding for the document .
Here it is in action :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup html = " < html > < p > Para 1 < p> Para 2< blockquote > Quote 1< blockquote > Quote 2 " soup = BeautifulSoup ( html ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < p > # Para 1 # </ p> # < p > # Para 2 # < blockquote > # Quote 1 # < blockquote > # Quote 2 # </blockquote > # </blockquote > # </ p> # </html >
Note that BeautifulSoup figured out sensible places to put the closing tags , even though the original document lacked them .
That document is n't valid HTML , but it 's not too bad either .
Here 's a really horrible document .
Among other problems , it 's got a < FORM > tag that starts outside of a < TABLE > tag and ends inside the < TABLE > tag .
( HTML like this was found on a website run by a major web company . )
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup html = " " " < html > < form > < table > < td > < input name = " input1 " > Row 1 cell 1 < tr >< td > Row 2 cell 1 </ form > < td > Row 2 cell 2 < br > This </ br > sure is a long cell </ body > < /html > " " "
Beautiful Soup handles this document as well :
print BeautifulSoup ( html ) .prettify ( ) # < html > # < form > # < table > # < td> # < input name = " input1 " /> # Row 1 cell 1 # </td > # < tr> # < td> # Row 2 cell 1 # </td> # </tr> # </table > # </ form > # < td> # Row 2 cell 2 # < br /> #
This # sure is a long cell # </td> # </html >
The last cell of the table is outside the < TABLE > tag ; Beautiful Soup decided to close the < TABLE > tag when it closed the < FORM > tag .
The author of the original document probably intended the < FORM > tag to extend to the end of the table , but Beautiful Soup has no way of knowing that .
Even in a bizarre case like this , Beautiful Soup parses the invalid document and gives you access to all the data .
Parsing XML
The BeautifulSoup class is full of web - browser - like heuristics for divining the intent of HTML authors .
But XML does n't have a fixed tag set , so those heuristics do n't apply .
So BeautifulSoup does n't do XML very well .
Use the BeautifulStoneSoup class to parse XML documents .
It 's a general class with no special knowledge of any XML dialect and very simple rules about tag nesting :
Here it is in action :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup xml = " < doc >< tag1 > Contents 1<tag2 > Contents 2<tag1 > Contents 3 " soup = BeautifulStoneSoup ( xml ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < doc > # < tag1 > # Contents 1 # < tag2 > # Contents 2 # </tag2 > # </tag1 > # < tag1 > # Contents 3 # </tag1 > # </doc >
most common shortcoming of BeautifulStoneSoup is that it does n't know about self - closing tags .
HTML has a fixed set of self - closing tags , but with XML it depends on what the DTD says .
You can tell BeautifulStoneSoup that certain tags are self - closing by passing in their names as the selfClosingTags argument to the constructor :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup xml = " < tag > Text 1 < selfclosing > Text 2 " print BeautifulStoneSoup ( xml ) .prettify ( ) # < tag > # Text 1 # < selfclosing > # Text 2 # </selfclosing >
# </tag> print BeautifulStoneSoup ( xml , selfClosingTags= [' selfclosing '] ) . prettify ( ) # < tag > # Text 1 # < selfclosing /> # Text 2 # </tag >
If That Does n't Work
There are several other parser classes with different heuristics from these two .
You can also subclass and customize a parser and give it your own heuristics .
Beautiful Soup Gives You Unicode , Dammit
By the time your document is parsed , it has been transformed into Unicode .
Beautiful Soup stores only Unicode strings in its data structures .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " Hello " ) soup.contents [ 0 ] # u' Hello ' soup.originalEncoding # ' ascii '
Here 's an example with a Japanese document encoded in UTF -8 :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " \xe3\x81\x93\xe3\x82\x8c\xe3\x81\xaf " ) soup.contents [ 0 ] # u'\u3053\u308c\u306f ' soup.originalEncoding # 'utf - 8 ' str( soup ) # ' \xe3\x81\x93\xe3\x82\x8c\xe3\x81\xaf ' # Note : this bit uses EUC - JP , so it only works if you have cjkcodecs # installed , or are running Python 2.4. soup.__str__('euc - jp ' ) # ' \xa4\xb3\xa4\xec\xa4\xcf '
Beautiful Soup uses a class called UnicodeDammit to detect the encodings of documents you give it and convert them to Unicode , no matter what .
If you need to do this for other documents ( without using Beautiful Soup to parse them ) , you can use UnicodeDammit by itself .
It 's heavily based on code from the Universal Feed Parser .
If you 're running an older version of Python than 2.4 , be sure to download and install cjkcodecs and iconvcodec , which make Python capable of supporting more codecs , especially CJK codecs .
Also install the chardet library , for better autodetection .
Beautiful Soup tries the following encodings , in order of priority , to turn your document into Unicode :
An encoding you pass in as the fromEncoding argument to the soup constructor .
argument to the soup constructor .
An encoding discovered in the document itself : for instance , in an XML declaration or ( for HTML documents ) an http - equiv META tag .
If Beautiful Soup finds this kind of encoding within the document , it parses the document again from the beginning and gives the new encoding a try .
The only exception is if you explicitly specified an encoding , and that encoding actually worked : then it will ignore any encoding it finds in the document .
META tag .
If Beautiful Soup finds this kind of encoding within the document , it parses the document again from the beginning and gives the new encoding a try .
The only exception is if you explicitly specified an encoding , and that encoding actually worked : then it will ignore any encoding it finds in the document .
An encoding sniffed by looking at the first few bytes of the file .
If an encoding is detected at this stage , it will be one of the UTF -* encodings , EBCDIC , or ASCII .
An encoding sniffed by the chardet library , if you have it installed .
library , if you have it installed .
UTF -8
Windows - 1252
Beautiful Soup will almost always guess right if it can make a guess at all .
But for documents with no declarations and in strange encodings , it will often not be able to guess .
It will fall back to Windows - 1252 , which will probably be wrong .
Here 's an EUC - JP example where Beautiful Soup guesses the encoding wrong .
( Again , because it uses EUC - JP , this example will only work if you are running Python 2.4 or have cjkcodecs installed ) :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup euc_jp = ' \xa4\xb3\xa4\xec\xa4\xcf ' soup = BeautifulSoup ( euc_jp ) soup.originalEncoding # ' windows -1252 ' str( soup ) # '\xc2\xa4\xc2\xb3\xc2\xa4\xc3\xac\xc2\xa4\xc3\x8 f ' # Wrong !
But if you specify the encoding with fromEncoding , it parses the document correctly , and can convert it to UTF - 8 or back to EUC - JP .
soup = BeautifulSoup ( euc_jp , fromEncoding = " euc - jp " ) soup.originalEncoding # ' windows -1252 ' str( soup ) # ' \xe3\x81\x93\xe3\x82\x8c\xe3\x81\xaf ' # Right ! soup.__str__(self , ' euc - jp ' ) == euc_jp # True
If you give Beautiful Soup a document in the Windows - 1252 encoding ( or a similar encoding like ISO - 8859 - 1 or ISO - 8859 - 2 ) , Beautiful Soup finds and destroys the document 's smart quotes and other Windows - specific characters .
Rather than transforming those characters into their Unicode equivalents , Beautiful Soup transforms them into HTML entities ( BeautifulSoup ) or XML entities ( BeautifulStoneSoup ) .
To prevent this , you can pass smartQuotesTo=None into the soup constructor : then smart quotes will be converted to Unicode like any other native - encoding characters .
You can also pass in " xml " or " html " for smartQuotesTo , to change the default behavior of BeautifulSoup and BeautifulStoneSoup .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup , BeautifulStoneSoup text = " Deploy the \x91SMART QUOTES\x92 ! " str( BeautifulSoup ( text ) ) # ' Deploy the ‘ SMART QUOTES ’!' str( BeautifulStoneSoup ( text ) ) # ' Deploy the ‘ SMART QUOTES ’!' str( BeautifulSoup ( text , smartQuotesTo= " xml " ) )
# ' Deploy the ‘ SMART QUOTES ’!' BeautifulSoup ( text , smartQuotesTo=None).contents [ 0 ]
# u'Deploy the \u2018SMART QUOTES\u2019 !'
Printing a Document
You can turn a Beautiful Soup document ( or any subset of it ) into a string with the str function , or the prettify or renderContents methods .
You can also use the unicode function to get the whole document as a Unicode string .
The prettify method adds strategic newlines and spacing to make the structure of the document obvious .
It also strips out text nodes that contain only whitespace , which might change the meaning of an XML document .
The str and unicode functions do n't strip out text nodes that contain only whitespace , and they do n't add any whitespace between nodes either .
Here 's an example .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = " < html > < h1 > Heading </h1>< p> Text " soup = BeautifulSoup ( doc ) str( soup ) # '< html > < h1 > Heading </h1>< p> Text</p></html>' soup.renderContents ( ) # '< html ><h1 > Heading </h1>< p> Text</p></html>' soup.__str__( ) # '< html ><h1 > Heading </h1>< p> Text</p></html>' unicode ( soup ) # u'< html >< h1 > Heading </h1>< p> Text</p></html>' soup.prettify ( ) # '< html >
< h1 >
Heading
</h1 >
< p >
Text
</ p>
</html > ' print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < h1 > # Heading # </h1 > # < p > # Text # </ p> # </html >
Note that str and renderContents give different results when used on a tag within the document .
str prints a tag and its contents , and renderContents only prints the contents .
heading = soup.h1 str( heading ) # '< h1 > Heading </h1 >' heading.renderContents ( ) # ' Heading '
When you call __str__ , prettify , or renderContents , you can specify an output encoding .
The default encoding ( the one used by str ) is UTF - 8 .
Here 's an example that parses an ISO - 8851 - 1 string and then outputs the same string in different encodings :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = " Sacr\xe9 bleu ! " soup = BeautifulSoup ( doc ) str( soup ) # ' Sacr\xc3\xa9 bleu !' # UTF - 8 soup.__str__( " ISO - 8859-1 " ) # ' Sacr\xe9 bleu !' soup.__str__( " UTF - 16 " ) # '\xff\xfeS\x00a\x00c\x00r\x00\xe9\x00 \x00b\x00l\x00e\x00u\x00!\x00 ' soup.__str__( " EUC-JP " ) # ' Sacr\x8 f\xab\xb1 bleu !'
If the original document contained an encoding declaration , then Beautiful Soup rewrites the declaration to mention the new encoding when it converts the document back to a string .
This means that if you load an HTML document into BeautifulSoup and print it back out , not only should the HTML be cleaned up , but it should be transparently converted to UTF - 8 .
Here 's an HTML example :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = " " " < html > < meta http-equiv= " Content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=ISO - Latin - 1 " > Sacr\xe9 bleu ! < /html > " " " print BeautifulSoup ( doc ) .prettify ( ) # < html > # < meta http-equiv=" Content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> # Sacré bleu !
# </html >
Here 's an XML example :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup doc = " " " < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " ISO - Latin - 1 " > Sacr\xe9 bleu ! " " " print BeautifulStoneSoup( doc ) .prettify ( ) # <?xml version= ' 1.0 ' encoding='utf
-8 '> # Sacré bleu !
The Parse Tree
So far we 've focused on loading documents and writing them back out .
Most of the time , though , you 're interested in the parse tree : the data structure Beautiful Soup builds as it parses the document .
A parser object ( an instance of BeautifulSoup or BeautifulStoneSoup ) is a deeply - nested , well - connected data structure that corresponds to the structure of an XML or HTML document .
The parser object contains two other types of objects :
Tag objects , which correspond to tags like the < TITLE > tag and the < B > tags ; and NavigableString objects , which correspond to strings like " Page title " and " This is paragraph " .
There are also some subclasses of NavigableString ( CData , Comment , Declaration , and ProcessingInstruction ) , which correspond to special XML constructs .
They act like NavigableString s , except that when it 's time to print them out they have some extra data attached to them .
Here 's a document that includes a comment :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import re hello = " Hello ! <!-- I 've got to be nice to get what I want .--> " commentSoup = BeautifulSoup ( hello ) comment = commentSoup.find(text=re.compile ( " nice " ) ) comment.__class__ # < class ' BeautifulSoup.Comment '> comment # u" I 've got to be nice to get what I want . "
comment.previousSibling # u' Hello ! ' str( comment ) # " <!-- I 've got to be nice to get what I want .--> " print commentSoup # Hello ! <!-- I 've got to be nice to get what I want .-->
Now , let 's take a closer look at the document used at the beginning of the documentation :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = [ ' < html > < head >< title > Page title </ title ></head >' , '< body > < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.' , ' < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two </b>.' , '< /html > ' ] soup = BeautifulSoup ( ''.join ( doc ) ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < head > # < title > # Page title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # one # </b> # . # </p> # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # two # </b> # . # </ p> # </ body > # </html >
Tag and NavigableString objects have lots of useful members , most of which are covered in Navigating the Parse Tree and Searching the Parse Tree .
However , there 's one aspect of Tag objects we 'll cover here : the attributes .
SGML tags have attributes :. for instance , each of the < P > tags in the example HTML above has an " id " attribute and an " align " attribute .
You can access a tag 's attributes by treating the Tag object as though it were a dictionary :
firstPTag , secondPTag = soup.findAll ('p ' ) firstPTag [ 'id ' ] # u'firstPara ' secondPTag [ 'id ' ] # u'secondPara '
NavigableString objects do n't have attributes ; only Tag objects have them .
Navigating the Parse Tree
All Tag objects have all of the members listed below ( though the actual value of the member may be None ) .
NavigableString objects have all of them except for contents and string .
parent
In the example above , the parent of the < HEAD >
Tag is the < HTML > Tag .
The parent of the < HTML >
Tag is the BeautifulSoup parser object itself .
The parent of the parser object is None .
By following parent , you can move up the parse tree :
soup.head.parent.name # u'html ' soup.head.parent.parent.__class__.__name__ # ' BeautifulSoup ' soup. parent == None # True
contents
With parent you move up the parse tree .
With contents you move down the tree .
contents is an ordered list of the Tag and NavigableString objects contained within a page element .
Only the top - level parser object and Tag objects have contents .
NavigableString objects are just strings and can't contain sub-elements , so they do n't have contents .
In the example above , the contents of the first < P >
Tag is a list containing a NavigableString ( " This is paragraph " ) , a < B > Tag , and another NavigableString ( " . " ) .
The contents of the < B > Tag : a list containing a NavigableString ( " one " ) .
pTag = soup .p pTag.contents # [ u ' This is paragraph ' , < b> one </b> , u ' . ' ]
pTag.contents [ 1].contents # [ u' one ' ]
pTag.contents [0 ] .contents # AttributeError : ' NavigableString ' object has no attribute ' contents '
string
For your convenience , if a tag has only one child node , and that child node is a string , the child node is made available as tag. string , as well as tag.contents [ 0 ] .
In the example above , soup .b.string is a NavigableString representing the Unicode string " one " .
That 's the string contained in the first < B >
Tag in the parse tree .
soup.b.string # u'one ' soup.b.contents [ 0 ] # u'one '
But soup.p.string is None , because the first < P >
Tag in the parse tree has more than one child .
soup .
head.string is also None , even though the < HEAD >
Tag has only one child , because that child is a Tag ( the < TITLE > Tag ) , not a NavigableString .
soup.p.string == None # True soup.head.string == None # True
nextSibling and previousSibling
These members let you skip to the next or previous thing on the same level of the parse tree .
In the document above , the nextSibling of the < HEAD >
Tag is the < BODY >
Tag , because the < BODY >
Tag is the next thing directly beneath the < html > Tag .
The nextSibling of the < BODY > tag is None , because there 's nothing else directly beneath the < HTML > Tag .
soup.head.nextSibling.name # u'body ' soup.html.nextSibling == None # True
Conversely , the previousSibling of the < BODY >
Tag is the < HEAD > tag , and the previousSibling of the < HEAD >
Tag is None :
soup.body.previousSibling.name # u'head ' soup.head.previousSibling == None # True
Some more examples : the nextSibling of the first < P >
Tag is the second < P > Tag .
The previousSibling of the < B >
Tag inside the second < P >
Tag is the NavigableString " This is paragraph " .
The previousSibling of that NavigableString is None , not anything inside the first < P > Tag .
soup.p.nextSibling # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p> secondBTag = soup.findAll ('b ' ) [ 1 ] secondBTag.previousSibling # u' This is paragraph ' secondBTag.previousSibling.previousSibling == None # True
next and previous
These members let you move through the document elements in the order they were processed by the parser , rather than in the order they appear in the tree .
For instance , the next of the < HEAD >
Tag is the < TITLE > Tag , not the < BODY > Tag .
This is because , in the original document , the < TITLE > tag comes immediately after the < HEAD > tag .
soup.head.next # u'title ' soup.head.nextSibling.name # u'body ' soup.head.previous.name # u'html '
Where next and previous are concerned , a Tag 's contents come before its nextSibling .
You usually wo n't have to use these members , but sometimes it 's the easiest way to get to something buried inside the parse tree .
Iterating over a Tag
You can iterate over the contents of a Tag by treating it as a list .
This is a useful shortcut .
Similarly , to see how many child nodes a Tag has , you can call len( tag ) instead of len( tag.contents ) .
In terms of the document above :
for i in soup.body : print i # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </ b>.</p> # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p> len( soup.body ) # 2 len(soup.body.contents ) # 2
Using tag names as members
It 's easy to navigate the parse tree by acting as though the name of the tag you want is a member of a parser or Tag object .
We 've been doing it throughout these examples .
In terms of the document above , soup . head gives us the first ( and , as it happens , only ) < HEAD >
Tag in the document :
soup .head # < head >< title > Page title </ title ></head >
In general , calling mytag .foo returns the first child of mytag that happens to be a < FOO > Tag .
If there are n't any < FOO >
Tag s beneath mytag , then mytag .
foo returns None .
You can use this to traverse the parse tree very quickly :
soup.head.title # < title > Page title </ title > soup.body.p.b.string # u'one '
You can also use this to quickly jump to a certain part of a parse tree .
For instance , if you 're not worried about < TITLE > tags in weird places outside of the < HEAD > tag , you can just use soup.
title to get an HTML document 's title .
You do n't have to use soup.
head .
title :
soup.title.string # u'Page title '
soup .p jumps to the first < P > tag inside a document , wherever it is .
soup.table.tr.td jumps to the first column of the first row of the first table in the document .
These members actually alias to the first method , covered below .
I mention it here because the alias makes it very easy to zoom in on an interesting part of a well - known parse tree .
An alternate form of this idiom lets you access the first < FOO > tag as .
fooTag instead of .foo .
For instance , soup.table.tr.td could also be expressed as soup.tableTag.trTag.tdTag , or even soup.tableTag.tr.tdTag .
This is useful if you like to be more explicit about what you 're doing , or if you 're parsing XML whose tag names conflict with the names of Beautiful Soup methods and members .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup xml = '< person name = " Bob " >< parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " >' xmlSoup = BeautifulStoneSoup( xml ) xmlSoup.person.parent # A Beautiful Soup member # < person name = " Bob " >< parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " ></ parent ></person> xmlSoup.person.parentTag # A tag name # < parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " ></ parent >
If you 're looking for tag names that are n't valid Python identifiers ( like hyphenated - name ) , you need to use find .
Searching the Parse Tree
Beautiful Soup provides many methods that traverse the parse tree , gathering Tag s and NavigableString s that match criteria you specify .
There are several ways to define criteria for matching Beautiful Soup objects .
Let 's demonstrate by examining in depth the most basic of all Beautiful Soup search methods , findAll .
As before , we 'll demonstrate on the following document :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = [ ' < html > < head >< title > Page title </ title ></head >' , '< body > < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.' , ' < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two </b>.' , '< /html > ' ] soup = BeautifulSoup ( ''.join ( doc ) ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < head > # < title > # Page title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # one # </b> # . # </p> # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # two # </b> # . # </ p> # </ body > # </html >
Incidentally , the two methods described in this section ( findAll and find ) are available only to Tag objects and the top - level parser objects , not to Navigable String objects .
The methods defined in Searching Within the Parse Tree are also available to NavigableString objects .
The basic find method : findAll ( name , attrs , recursive , text , limit , ** kwargs )
The findAll method traverses the tree , starting at the given point , and finds all the Tag and NavigableString objects that match the criteria you give .
The signature for the findall method is this :
findAll ( name=None , attrs={} , recursive =True , text =None , limit=None , ** kwargs )
These arguments show up over and over again throughout the Beautiful Soup API .
The most important arguments are name and the keyword arguments .
The name argument restricts the set of tags by name .
There are several ways to restrict the name , and these too show up over and over again throughout the Beautiful Soup API .
The simplest usage is to just pass in a tag name .
This code finds all the < B >
Tag s in the document : soup.findAll ('b ' ) # [ < b> one</b> , < b>two</b >]
You can also pass in a regular expression .
This code finds all the tags whose names start with B : import re tagsStarting WithB = soup.findAll( re.compile ( ' ^b ' ) ) [ tag.name for tag in tagsStarting WithB ] # [ u' body ' , u'b ' , u'b ' ]
You can pass in a list or a dictionary .
These two calls find all the < TITLE > and all the < P > tags .
They work the same way , but the second call runs faster : soup.findAll ( [ ' title ' , 'p ' ] ) # [ < title > Page title < / title > , # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>] soup.findAll( {' title ' : True , ' p ' : True} ) # [ < title > Page title < / title > , # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>]
You can pass in the special value True , which matches every tag with a name : that is , it matches every tag .
allTags = soup.findAll( True ) [ tag.name for tag in allTags ] [ u' html ' , u'head ' , u'title ' , u'body ' , u'p ' , u'b ' , u'p ' , u'b ' ]
This does n't look useful , but True is very useful when restricting attribute values .
You can pass in a callable object which takes a Tag object as its only argument , and returns a boolean .
Every
Tag object that findAll encounters will be passed into this object , and if the call returns
True then the tag is considered to match .
This code finds the tags that have two , and only two , attributes : soup.findAll(lambda tag : len(tag.attrs ) == 2 ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p >]
This code finds the tags that have one - character names and no attributes : soup.findAll(lambda tag : len( tag.name ) == 1 and not tag.attrs ) # [ < b> one</b> , < b>two</b >]
The keyword arguments impose restrictions on the attributes of a tag .
This simple example finds all the tags which have a value of " center " for their " align " attribute : soup.findAll(align=" center " ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p >]
As with the name argument , you can pass a keyword argument different kinds of object to impose different restrictions on the corresponding attribute .
You can pass a string , as seen above , to restrict an attribute to a single value .
You can also pass a regular expression , a list , a hash , the special values True or None , or a callable that takes the attribute value as its argument ( note that the value may be None ) .
Some examples : soup.findAll(id=re.compile( " para$ " ) ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>] soup.findAll( align=[" center " , " blah " ] ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>] soup.findAll(align=lambda( value ) : value and len( value ) < 5 ) # [ < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p >]
The special values True and None are of special interest .
True matches a tag that has any value for the given attribute , and None matches a tag that has no value for the given attribute .
Some examples : soup.findAll(align=True ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>] [ tag.name for tag in soup.findAll( align=None ) ] # [ u' html ' , u'head ' , u'title ' , u'body ' , u'b ' , u'b ' ]
If you need to impose complex or interlocking restrictions on a tag 's attributes , pass in a callable object for name , as seen above , and deal with the Tag object .
You might have noticed a problem here .
What if you have a document with a tag that defines an attribute called name ?
You ca n't use a keyword argument called name because the Beautiful Soup search methods already define a name argument .
You also ca n't use a Python reserved word like for as a keyword argument .
Beautiful Soup provides a special argument called attrs which you can use in these situations .
attrs is a dictionary that acts just like the keyword arguments : soup.findAll(id=re.compile( " para$ " ) ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>] soup.findAll(attrs={'id ' : re.compile ( " para$ " ) } ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p>]
You can use attrs if you need to put restrictions on attributes whose names are Python reserved words , like class , for , or import ; or attributes whose names are non-keyword arguments to the Beautiful Soup search methods : name , recursive , limit , text , or attrs itself .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup xml = '< person name = " Bob " >< parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " >' xmlSoup = BeautifulStoneSoup( xml ) xmlSoup.findAll(name= " Alice " ) # [ ] xmlSoup.findAll( attrs= {" name " : " Alice " } ) # [ parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " ></ parent >]
Searching by CSS class
The attrs argument would be a pretty obscure feature were it not for one thing : CSS .
It 's very useful to search for a tag that has a certain CSS class , but the name of the CSS attribute , class , is also a Python reserved word .
You could search by CSS class with soup. find ( " tagName " , { " class " : " cssClass " } ) , but that 's a lot of code for such a common operation .
Instead , you can pass a string for attrs instead of a dictionary .
The string will be used to restrict the CSS class .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " " " Bob 's < b> Bold < / b> Barbeque Sauce now available in < b class = " hickory " >
Hickory < /b> and < b class = " lime " > Lime < /a > " " " ) soup.find ( " b " , { " class " : " lime " } ) # < b class = " lime " >
Lime < /b> soup.find ( " b " , " hickory " ) # < b class = " hickory " >
Hickory </b>
text is an argument that lets you search for NavigableString objects instead of Tag s.
Its value can be a string , a regular expression , a list or dictionary , True or None , or a callable that takes a NavigableString object as its argument : soup.findAll( text=" one " ) # [ u' one ' ] soup.findAll(text=u'one ' ) # [ u'one ' ] soup.findAll( text=[ " one " , " two " ] ) # [ u'one ' , u'two ' ] soup.findAll(text=re.compile(" paragraph " ) ) # [ u ' This is paragraph ' , u' This is paragraph '] soup.findAll(text=True ) # [ u' Page title ' , u' This is paragraph ' , u'one ' , u '. ' , u' This is paragraph ' , # u'two ' , u ' . ' ] soup.findAll(text=lambda(x ) : len( x ) < 12 ) # [ u' Page title ' , u'one ' , u '. ' , u'two ' , u ' . ' ]
If you use text , then any values you give for name and the keyword arguments are ignored .
recursive is a boolean argument ( defaulting to True ) which tells Beautiful Soup whether to go all the way down the parse tree , or whether to only look at the immediate children of the Tag or the parser object .
Here 's the difference : [ tag.name for tag in soup.html.findAll ( ) ]
# [ u' head ' , u'title ' , u'body ' , u'p ' , u'b ' , u'p ' , u'b ' ] [ tag.name for tag in soup.html.findAll(recursive=False ) ] # [ u' head ' , u'body ' ]
When recursive is false , only the immediate children of the < HTML > tag are searched .
If you know that 's all you need to search , you can save some time this way .
Setting limit argument lets you stop the search once Beautiful Soup finds a certain number of matches .
If there are a thousand tables in your document , but you only need the fourth one , pass in 4 to limit and you 'll save time .
By default , there is no limit .
soup.findAll ('p ' , limit=1 ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p>] soup.findAll ('p ' , limit=100 ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> , # <p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p >]
Calling a tag is like calling findall
A little shortcut for you .
If you call the parser object or a Tag like a function , then you can pass in all of findall 's arguments and it's the same as calling findall .
In terms of the document above :
soup ( text=lambda( x ) : len( x ) < 12 ) # [ u' Page title ' , u'one ' , u '. ' , u'two ' , u ' . ' ] soup.body ( 'p ' , limit=1 ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p >]
Okay , now let 's look at the other search methods .
They all take pretty much the same arguments as findAll .
The find method is almost exactly like findAll , except that instead of finding all the matching objects , it only finds the first one .
It 's like imposing a limit of 1 on the result set , and then extracting the single result from the array .
In terms of the document above :
soup.findAll ('p ' , limit=1 ) # [ < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p>] soup.find ('p ' , limit=1 ) # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> soup.find ( ' nosuchtag ' , limit=1 ) == None # True
In general , when you see a search method with a plural name ( like findAll or findNextSiblings ) , that method takes a limit argument and returns a list of results .
When you see a search method that does n't have a plural name ( like find or findNextSibling ) , you know that the method does n't take a limit and returns a single result .
What happened to first ?
Previous versions of Beautiful Soup had methods like first , fetch , and fetchPrevious .
These methods are sitll there , but they 're deprecated , and may go away soon .
The total effect of all those names was very confusing .
The new names are named consistently : as mentioned above , if the method name is plural or refers to All , it returns multiple objects .
Otherwise , it returns one object .
Searching Within the Parse Tree
The methods described above , findAll and find , start at a certain point in the parse tree and go down .
They recursively iterate through an object 's contents until they bottom out .
This means that you can't call these methods on NavigableString objects , because they have no contents : they 're always the leaves of the parse tree .
But downwards is n't the only way you can iterate through a document .
Back in Navigating the Parse Tree I showed you many other ways : parent , nextSibling , and so on .
Each of these iteration techniques has two corresponding methods : one that works like findAll , and one that works like find .
And since NavigableString objects do support these operations , you can call these methods on them as well as on Tag objects and the main parser object .
Why is this useful ?
Well , sometimes you just can't use findAll or find to get to the Tag or NavigableString you want .
For instance , consider some HTML like this :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( '' ' < ul > < li >
An unrelated list </ul > < h1 > Heading</h1 > < p > This is < b > the list you want </b>:</p> < ul >< li> The data you want </ul >''' )
There are a number of ways to navigate to the < LI > tag that contains the data you want .
The most obvious is this :
soup ( ' li ' , limit=2 ) [ 1 ]
# < li>The data you want </ li >
It should be equally obvious that that 's not a very stable way to get that < LI > tag .
If you 're only scraping this page once it does n't matter , but if you 're going to scrape it many times over a long period , such considerations become important .
If the irrelevant list grows another < LI > tag , you 'll get that tag instead of the one you want , and your script will break or give the wrong data .
soup ( 'ul ' , limit=2 ) [ 1 ] . li # < li>The data you want </ li >
That 's is a little better , because it can survive changes to the irrelevant list .
But if the document grows another irrelevant list at the top , you 'll get the first < LI > tag of that list instead of the one you want .
A more reliable way of referring to the ul tag you want would better reflect that tag 's place in the structure of the document .
When you look at that HTML , you might think of the list you want as ' the < UL > tag beneath the < H1 > tag ' .
The problem is that the tag is n't contained inside the < H1 > tag ; it just happens to comes after it .
It 's easy enough to get the < H1 > tag , but there 's no way to get from there to the < UL > tag using first and fetch , because those methods only search the contents of the < H1 > tag .
You need to navigate to the < UL > tag with the next or nextSibling members :
s = soup.h1 while getattr(s , ' name ' , None ) != 'ul ' : s = s.nextSibling s.li # < li>The data you want </ li >
Or , if you think this might be more stable :
s = soup. find ( text =' Heading ') while getattr(s , ' name ' , None ) != 'ul ' : s = s.next s.li # < li>The data you want </ li >
But that 's more trouble than you should need to go through .
The methods in this section provide a useful shorthand .
They can be used whenever you find yourself wanting to write a while loop over one of the navigation members .
Given a starting point somewhere in the tree , they navigate the tree in some way and keep track of Tag or NavigableString objects that match the criteria you specify .
Instead of the first loop in the example code above , you can just write this :
soup.h1.findNextSibling ( 'ul ' ) . li # < li>
The data you want </ li >
Instead of the second loop , you can write this :
soup.find ( text =' Heading '). findNext ( 'ul ' ) . li # < li>
The data you want </ li >
The loops are replaced with calls to findNextSibling and findNext .
The rest of this section is a reference to all the methods of this kind .
Again , there are two methods for every navigation member : one that returns a list the way findAll does , and one that returns a scalar the way find does .
One last time , let 's load up the familiar soup document for example 's sake :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup doc = [ ' < html > < head >< title > Page title </ title ></head >' , '< body > < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.' , ' < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two </b>.' , '< /html > ' ] soup = BeautifulSoup ( ''.join ( doc ) ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # < head > # < title > # Page title # </ title > # </head > # < body > # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # one # </b> # . # </p> # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " > #
This is paragraph # < b > # two # </b> # . # </ p> # </ body > # </html >
These methods repeatedly follow an object 's nextSibling member , gathering Tag or NavigableText objects that match the criteria you specify .
In terms of the document above :
paraText = soup.find ( text=' This is paragraph ') paraText.findNextSiblings ('b ' ) # [ < b> one</b>] paraText.findNextSibling ( text = lambda( text ) : len( text ) == 1 ) # u ' . '
These methods repeatedly follow an object 's previousSibling member , gathering Tag or NavigableText objects that match the criteria you specify .
In terms of the document above :
paraText = soup.find ( text='.' ) paraText.findPreviousSiblings ('b ' ) # [ < b> one</b>] paraText.findPreviousSibling ( text = True ) # u' This is paragraph '
These methods repeatedly follow an object 's next member , gathering Tag or NavigableText objects that match the criteria you specify .
In terms of the document above :
pTag = soup.find ('p ' ) pTag.findAllNext(text=True ) # [ u ' This is paragraph ' , u'one ' , u ' . ' , u' This is paragraph ' , u'two ' , u ' . ' ] pTag.findNext ('p ') # < p id =" secondpara " align = " blah " >
This is paragraph < b> two</b>.</p> pTag.findNext ('b ') # < b>one</b>
These methods repeatedly follow an object 's previous member , gathering Tag or NavigableText objects that match the criteria you specify .
In terms of the document above :
lastPTag = soup ('p ' ) [ - 1 ] lastPTag.findAllPrevious(text=True ) # [ u '.' , u'one ' , u' This is paragraph ' , u'Page title ' ]
#
Note the reverse order ! lastPTag.findPrevious ('p ') # < p id =" firstpara " align= " center " >
This is paragraph < b> one </b>.</p> lastPTag.findPrevious ('b ') # < b>one</b>
These methods repeatedly follow an object 's parent member , gathering Tag or NavigableText objects that match the criteria you specify .
They do n't take a text argument , because there 's no way any object can have a NavigableString for a parent .
In terms of the document above :
b Tag = soup.find ('b ') [ tag.name for tag in b Tag.findParents ( ) ] # [ u'p ' , u'body ' , u'html ' , '[ document ] ' ]
# NOTE : " u' [ document ] ' " means that that the parser object itself matched .
b Tag.findParent ( ' body ' ) . name # u'body '
Modifying the Parse Tree
Now you know how to find things in the parse tree .
But maybe you want to modify it and print it back out .
You can just rip an element out of its parent 's contents , but the rest of the document will still have references to the thing you ripped out .
Beautiful Soup offers several methods that let you modify the parse tree while maintaining its internal consistency .
Changing attribute values
You can use dictionary assignment to modify the attribute values of Tag objects .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " < b id = " 2 " > Argh !</b > " ) print soup # < b id = " 2 " > Argh !</b> b = soup.b b[ 'id ' ] = 10 print soup # < b id = " 10 " > Argh !</b> b [ 'id ' ] = " ten " print soup # < b id = " ten " > Argh !</b> b [ 'id ' ] = ' one " million " ' print soup # < b id='one " million " '> Argh !</b>
You can also delete attribute values , and add new ones :
del ( b [ ' id ' ] ) print soup # < b> Argh !</b> b[ ' class ' ] = " extra bold and brassy ! " print soup # < b class = " extra bold and brassy ! " >
Argh !</b>
Removing elements
Once you have a reference to an element , you can rip it out of the tree with the extract method .
This code removes all the comments from a document :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup , Comment soup = BeautifulSoup ( " " " 1<!-- The loneliest number --> <a>2<!-- Can be as bad as one --> < b > 3 " " " ) comments = soup.findAll(text=lambda text:isinstance ( text , Comment ) ) [ comment.extract ( ) for comment in comments ] print soup # 1 # <a>2<b>3</b></a>
This code removes a whole subtree from a document :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " < a1></a1><a>< b> Amazing content<c ><d ></a><a2></a2 > " ) soup.a1.nextSibling # <a>< b> Amazing content<c ><d ></d></c></b></a> soup.a2.previousSibling # <a>< b> Amazing content<c ><d ></d></c></b></a> subtree = soup.a subtree.extract ( ) print soup #
<a1></a1><a2></a2 > soup.a1.nextSibling # <a2></a2 > soup.a2.previousSibling # <a1></a1 >
The extract method turns one parse tree into two disjoint trees .
The navigation members are changed so that it looks like the trees had never been together :
soup.a1.nextSibling # <a2></a2 > soup.a2.previousSibling # <a1></a1 > subtree.previousSibling == None #
True subtree . parent == None # True
Replacing one Element with Another
The replaceWith method extracts one page element and replaces it with a different one .
The new element can be a Tag ( possibly with a whole parse tree beneath it ) or a NavigableString .
If you pass a plain old string into replaceWith , it gets turned into a NavigableString .
The navigation members are changed as though the document had been parsed that way in the first place .
Here 's a simple example :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " < b> Argh !</b > " ) soup.find ( text = " Argh ! " ).replaceWith ( " Hooray ! " ) print soup # < b> Hooray !</b> newText = soup.find ( text = " Hooray ! " ) newText.previous # < b> Hooray !</b> newText.previous.next # u' Hooray !' newText.parent # < b> Hooray !</b> soup.b.contents # [ u' Hooray ! ' ]
Here 's a more complex example that replaces one tag with another :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup , Tag soup = BeautifulSoup ( " < b> Argh ! <a> Foo</a></b><i> Blah !</i> " ) tag = Tag ( soup , " newTag " , [ ( " id " , 1 ) ] ) tag.insert( 0 , " Hooray ! " ) soup.a.replaceWith( tag ) print soup # < b> Argh!<newTag id = " 1 " > Hooray!</newTag></b><i>Blah!</i>
You can even rip out an element from one part of the document and stick it in another part :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup text = " < html > There 's < b> no </b> business like < b> show </b> business </ html > " soup = BeautifulSoup ( text ) no , show = soup.findAll ('b ' ) show.replaceWith( no ) print soup # < html > There 's business like < b > no </b> business </ html >
Adding a Brand New Element
The Tag class and the parser classes support a method called insert .
It works just like a Python list 's insert method : it takes an index to the tag 's contents member , and sticks a new element in that slot .
This was demonstrated in the previous section , when we replaced a tag in the document with a brand new tag .
You can use insert to build up an entire parse tree from scratch :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup , Tag , NavigableString soup = BeautifulSoup ( ) tag1 = Tag ( soup , " mytag " ) tag2 = Tag ( soup , " myOtherTag " ) tag3 = Tag ( soup , " myThirdTag " ) soup.insert(0 , tag1 ) tag1.insert ( 0 , tag2 ) tag1.insert ( 1 , tag3 ) print soup # < mytag >< myOtherTag></myOtherTag><myThirdTag></myThirdTag></mytag> text = NavigableString ( " Hello ! " ) tag3.insert ( 0 , text ) print soup # < mytag >< myOtherTag></myOtherTag><myThirdTag>Hello!</myThirdTag></mytag >
An element can occur in only one place in one parse tree .
If you give insert an element that 's already connected to a soup object , it gets disconnected ( with extract ) before it gets connected elsewhere .
In this example , I try to insert my NavigableString into a second part of the soup , but it does n't get inserted again .
It gets moved :
tag2.insert(0 , text ) print soup # < mytag >< myOtherTag>Hello!</myOtherTag><myThirdTag></myThirdTag></mytag >
This happens even if the element previously belonged to a completely different soup object .
An element can only have one parent , one nextSibling , et cetera , so it can only be in one place at a time .
Troubleshooting
This section covers common problems people have with Beautiful Soup .
Why ca n't Beautiful Soup print out the non-ASCII characters I gave it ?
If you 're getting errors that say : " ' ascii ' codec ca n't encode character ' x ' in position y : ordinal not in range ( 128 ) " , the problem is probably with your Python installation rather than with Beautiful Soup .
Try printing out the non-ASCII characters without running them through Beautiful Soup and you should have the same problem .
For instance , try running code like this :
latin1word = ' Sacr\xe9 bleu ! ' unicodeword = unicode ( latin1word , ' latin - 1 ' ) print unicodeword
If this works but Beautiful Soup does n't , there 's probably a bug in Beautiful Soup .
However , if this does n't work , the problem 's with your Python setup .
Python is playing it safe and not sending non-ASCII characters to your terminal .
There are two ways to override this behavior .
The easy way is to remap standard output to a converter that 's not afraid to send ISO - Latin - 1 or UTF - 8 characters to the terminal .
import codecs import sys streamWriter = codecs.lookup ( 'utf - 8 ' ) [ - 1 ] sys.stdout = streamWriter(sys.stdout ) codecs.lookup returns a number of bound methods and other objects related to a codec .
The last one is a StreamWriter object capable of wrapping an output stream .
The hard way is to create a sitecustomize .py file in your Python installation which sets the default encoding to ISO - Latin - 1 or to UTF - 8 .
Then all your Python programs will use that encoding for standard output , without you having to do something for each program .
In my installation , I have a / usr / lib / python / sitecustomize .py which looks like this : import sys sys.setdefaultencoding ( " utf - 8 " )
For more information about Python 's Unicode support , look at Unicode for Programmers or End to End Unicode Web Applications in Python .
Recipes 1.20 and 1.21 in the Python cookbook are also very helpful .
Remember , even if your terminal display is restricted to ASCII , you can still use Beautiful Soup to parse , process , and write documents in UTF - 8 and other encodings .
You just can't print certain strings with print .
Beautiful Soup loses the data I fed it !
Why ?
WHY ?????
Beautiful Soup can handle poorly - structured SGML , but sometimes it loses data when it gets stuff that 's not SGML at all .
This is not nearly as common as poorly - structured markup , but if you 're building a web crawler or something you 'll surely run into it .
The only solution is to sanitize the data ahead of time with a regular expression .
Here are some examples that I and Beautiful Soup users have discovered :
Beautiful Soup treats ill - formed XML definitions as data .
However , it loses well - formed XML definitions that do n't actually exist : from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup ( " < ! FOO @= > " ) # < ! FOO @=> BeautifulSoup ( " <b><!FOO >!</b > " )
# <b>!</b>
If your document starts a declaration and never finishes it , Beautiful Soup assumes the rest of your document is part of the declaration .
If the document ends in the middle of the declaration , Beautiful Soup ignores the declaration totally .
A couple examples : from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup ( " foo <! bar " ) # foo soup = BeautifulSoup ( " < html>foo<!bar </html > " ) print soup.prettify ( ) # < html > # foo<!bar</html> # </html >
There are a couple ways to fix this ; one is detailed here .
Beautiful Soup also ignores an entity reference that 's not finished by the end of the document : BeautifulSoup ( " < foo > " ) # < foo I 've never seen this in real web pages , but it 's probably out there somewhere .
A malformed comment will make Beautiful Soup ignore the rest of the document .
This is covered as the example in Sanitizing Bad Data with Regexps .
The parse tree built by the BeautifulSoup class offends my senses !
To get your markup parsed differently , check out Other Built - In Parsers , or else build a custom parser .
Beautiful Soup is too slow !
Beautiful Soup will never run as fast as ElementTree or a custom - built SGMLParser subclass .
ElementTree is written in C , and SGMLParser lets you write your own mini-Beautiful Soup that only does what you want .
The point of Beautiful Soup is to save programmer time , not processor time .
That said , you can speed up Beautiful Soup quite a lot by only parsing the parts of the document you need , and you can make unneeded objects get garbage - collected by using extract or decompose .
Advanced Topics
That does it for the basic usage of Beautiful Soup .
But HTML and XML are tricky , and in the real world they 're even trickier .
So Beautiful Soup keeps some extra tricks of its own up its sleeve .
Generators
The search methods described above are driven by generator methods .
You can use these methods yourself : they 're called nextGenerator , previousGenerator , nextSiblingGenerator , previousSiblingGenerator , and parentGenerator .
Tag and parser objects also have childGenerator and recursiveChildGenerator available .
Here 's a simple example that strips HTML tags out of a document by iterating over the document and collecting all the strings .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " " " < div > You < i> bet </i > < a href= " http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ ">BeautifulSoup</a> rocks !</div > " " " ) ''. join ( [e for e in soup.recursiveChildGenerator( ) if isinstance ( e, unicode ) ] ) # u' You bet
BeautifulSoup
rocks !'
Of course , you do n't really need a generator to find only the text beneath a tag .
That code does the same thing as .findAll ( text =True ) .
' '.join(soup.findAll(text=True ) ) # u' You bet
BeautifulSoup
rocks !'
Here 's a more complex example that uses recursiveChildGenerator to iterate over the elements of a document , printing each one as it gets it .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup ( " 1<a >2< b> 3 " ) g = soup.recursiveChildGenerator ( ) while True : try : print g.next ( ) except StopIteration : break # 1 # <a>2<b>3</b></a> # 2 # < b>3</b> # 3
Other Built - In Parsers
Beautiful Soup comes with three parser classes besides BeautifulSoup and BeautifulStoneSoup :
MinimalSoup is a subclass of BeautifulSoup .
It knows most facts about HTML like which tags are self - closing , the special behavior of the < SCRIPT > tag , the possibility of an encoding mentioned in a < META > tag , etc .
But it has no nesting heuristics at all .
So it does n't know that < LI > tags go underneath < UL > tags and not the other way around .
It 's useful for parsing pathologically bad markup , and for subclassing .
ICantBelieveItsBeautifulSoup is also a subclass of BeautifulSoup .
It has HTML heuristics that conform more closely to the HTML standard , but ignore how HTML is used in the real world .
For instance , it 's valid HTML to nest < B > tags , but in the real world a nested < B > tag almost always means that the author forgot to close the first < B > tag .
If you run into someone who actually nests < B > tags , then you can use ICantBelieveItsBeautifulSoup .
BeautifulSOAP is a subclass of BeautifulStoneSoup .
It 's useful for parsing documents like SOAP messages , which use a subelement when they could just use an attribute of the parent element .
Here 's an example : from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup , BeautifulSOAP xml = " < doc>< tag> subelement </tag></doc > " print BeautifulStoneSoup( xml ) # < doc><tag>subelement</tag></doc > print BeautifulSOAP ( xml ) < doc tag= " subelement " >< tag> subelement</tag></doc >
With BeautifulSOAP
you can access the contents of the < TAG > tag without descending into the tag .
Customizing the Parser
When the built - in parser classes wo n't do the job , you need to customize .
This usually means customizing the lists of nestable and self - closing tags .
You can customize the list of self - closing tags by passing a selfClosingTags argument into the soup constructor .
To customize the lists of nestable tags , though , you 'll have to subclass .
The most useful classes to subclass are MinimalSoup ( for HTML ) and BeautifulStoneSoup ( for XML ) .
I 'm going to show you how to override RESET_NESTING_TAGS and NESTABLE_TAGS in a subclass .
This is the most complicated part of Beautiful Soup and I 'm not going to explain it very well here , but I 'll get something written and then I can improve it with feedback .
When Beautiful Soup is parsing a document , it keeps a stack of open tags .
Whenever it sees a new start tag , it tosses that tag on top of the stack .
But before it does , it might close some of the open tags and remove them from the stack .
Which tags it closes depends on the qualities of tag it just found , and the qualities of the tags in the stack .
The best way to explain it is through example .
Let 's say the stack looks like [ ' html ' , 'p ' , 'b ' ] , and Beautiful Soup encounters a < P > tag .
If it just tossed another ' p ' onto the stack , this would imply that the second < P > tag is within the first < P > tag , not to mention the open < B > tag .
But that 's not the way < P > tags work .
You ca n't stick a < P > tag inside another < P > tag .
A < P > tag is n't " nestable " at all .
So when Beautiful Soup encounters a < P > tag , it closes and pops all the tags up to and including the previously encountered tag of the same type .
This is the default behavior , and this is how BeautifulStoneSoup treats every tag .
It 's what you get when a tag is not mentioned in either NESTABLE_TAGS or RESET_NESTING_TAGS .
It 's also what you get when a tag shows up in RESET_NESTING_TAGS but has no entry in NESTABLE_TAGS , the way the < P > tag does .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup.RESET_NESTING_TAGS ['p ' ] == None # True BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS.has_key ('p ' ) # False print BeautifulSoup ( " < html > < p> Para < b> one < p> Para two " ) # < html >< p> Para<b> one</b></p><p>Para two</p></html>
# ^---^--The second < p > tag made those two tags get closed
Let 's say the stack looks like [ ' html ' , ' span ' , ' b ' ] , and Beautiful Soup encounters a < SPAN > tag .
Now , < SPAN > tags can contain other < SPAN > tags without limit , so there 's no need to pop up to the previous < SPAN > tag when you encounter one .
This is represented by mapping the tag name to an empty list in NESTABLE_TAGS .
This kind of tag should not be mentioned in RESET_NESTING_TAGS : there are no circumstances when encountering a < SPAN > tag would cause any tags to be popped .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [' span ' ] # [ ]
BeautifulSoup.RESET_NESTING_TAGS.has_key( ' span ') # False print BeautifulSoup ( " < html >< span > Span < b> one < span > Span two " ) # < html >< span> Span<b>one< span >Span two</ span></b></span></html>
Third example : suppose the stack looks like [ ' ol ' , ' li ' , 'ul ' ] : that is , we 've got an ordered list , the first element of which contains an unordered list .
Now suppose Beautiful Soup encounters a < LI > tag .
It should n't pop up to the first < LI > tag , because this new < LI > tag is part of the unordered sublist .
It 's okay for an < LI > tag to be inside another < LI > tag , so long as there 's a < UL > or < OL > tag in the way .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup print BeautifulSoup ( " < ol > < li >1 < ul > < li > A " ) . prettify ( ) # < ol > # < li > # 1 # < ul > # < li > # A # </li > # </ul > # </li> # </ol >
But if there is no intervening < UL > or < OL > , then one < LI > tag can't be underneath another :
print BeautifulSoup ( " < ol > < li >1 < li > A " ) . prettify ( ) # < ol > # < li > # 1 # </li > # < li > # A # </li > # </ol >
We tell Beautiful Soup to treat < LI > tags this way by putting " li " in RESET_NESTING_TAGS , and by giving " li " a NESTABLE_TAGS entry showing list of tags under which it can nest .
BeautifulSoup.RESET_NESTING_TAGS.has_key( 'li ') # True BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [ ' li ' ] # [ 'ul ' , ' ol ' ]
This is also how we handle the nesting of table tags :
BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS
[ 'td ' ] # [ ' tr ' ]
BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [ ' tr ' ] # [ ' table ' , ' tbody ' , ' tfoot ' , ' thead ' ]
BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [' tbody '] # [ ' table ' ]
BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [' thead ' ] # [ ' table ' ]
BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [' tfoot ' ] # [ ' table ' ] BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS [' table ' ] # [ ]
That is : < TD > tags can be nested within < TR > tags .
< TR > tags can be nested within < TABLE > , < TBODY > , < TFOOT > , and < THEAD > tags .
< TBODY > , < TFOOT > , and < THEAD > tags can be nested in < TABLE > tags , and < TABLE > tags can be nested in other < TABLE > tags .
If you know about HTML tables , these rules should already make sense to you .
One more example .
Say the stack looks like [ ' html ' , 'p ' , ' table ' ] and Beautiful Soup encounters a < P > tag .
At first glance , this looks just like the example where the stack is [ ' html ' , 'p ' , ' b ' ] and Beautiful Soup encounters a < P > tag .
In that example , we closed the < B > and < P > tags , because you can't have one paragraph inside another .
Except ... you can have a paragraph that contains a table , and then the table contains a paragraph .
So the right thing to do is to not close any of these tags .
Beautiful Soup does the right thing :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup print BeautifulSoup ( " < p> Para 1 < b>< p> Para 2 " ) # < p > # Para 1 # < b> # </b> # </p> # < p > # Para 2 # </p> print BeautifulSoup ( " < p> Para 1 < table >< p> Para 2 " ) .prettify ( ) # < p > # Para 1 # < table > # < p > # Para 2 # </ p> # </table > # </ p >
What 's the difference ?
The difference is that < TABLE > is in RESET_NESTING_TAGS and < B > is not .
A tag that 's in RESET_NESTING_TAGS does n't get popped off the stack as easily as a tag that 's not .
Okay , hopefully you get the idea .
Here 's the NESTABLE_TAGS for the BeautifulSoup class .
Correlate this with what you know about HTML , and you should be able to create your own NESTABLE_TAGS for bizarre HTML documents that do n't follow the normal rules , and for other XML dialects that have different nesting rules .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup nestKeys = BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS.keys( ) nestKeys.sort( ) for key in nestKeys : print " %s : %s " % ( key , BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS[key ] ) # bdo : [ ] # blockquote : [ ] # center : [ ] # dd : [ ' dl ' ] # del : [ ] # div : [ ] # dl : [ ] # dt : [ 'dl ' ] # fieldset : [ ] # font : [ ] # ins : [ ] # li : [ 'ul ' , ' ol ' ] # object : [ ] # ol : [ ] # q : [ ] # span : [ ] # sub : [ ] # sup : [ ] # table : [ ] # tbody : [ ' table ' ] # td : [ 'tr ' ] # tfoot : [ ' table ' ] # th : [ 'tr ' ] # thead : [ ' table ' ] # tr : [ ' table ' , ' tbody ' , ' tfoot ' , ' thead ' ] # ul : [ ]
And here 's BeautifulSoup 's RESET_NESTING_TAGS .
Only the keys are important : RESET_NESTING_TAGS
is actually a list , put into the form of a dictionary for quick random access .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup resetKeys = BeautifulSoup.RESET_NESTING_TAGS.keys( ) resetKeys.sort ( ) resetKeys # [ ' address ' , ' blockquote ' , ' dd ' , ' del ' , ' div ' , ' dl ' , ' dt ' , ' fieldset ' , # ' form ' , ' ins ' , ' li ' , ' noscript ' , ' ol ' , 'p ' , ' pre ' , ' table ' , ' tbody ' , # ' td ' , ' tfoot ' , ' th ' , ' thead ' , ' tr ' , 'ul ' ]
Since you 're subclassing anyway , you might as well override SELF_CLOSING_TAGS while you 're at it .
It 's a dictionary that maps self - closing tag names to any values at all ( like RESET_NESTING_TAGS , it 's actually a list in the form of a dictionary ) .
Then you wo n't have to pass that list in to the constructor ( as selfClosingTags ) every time you instantiate your subclass .
Entity Conversion
When you parse a document , you can convert HTML or XML entity references to the corresponding Unicode characters .
This code converts the HTML entity " é " to the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE , and the numeric entity " e " to the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER E .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup BeautifulStoneSoup ( " Sacré bleu ! " , convertEntities=BeautifulStoneSoup.HTML_ENTITIES ).contents [ 0 ] # u' Sacr\xe9 bleu !'
That 's if you use HTML_ENTITIES ( which is just the string " html " ) .
If you use XML_ENTITIES ( or the string " xml " ) , then only numeric entities and the five XML entities ( " " " , " ' " , " > " , " < " , and " & " ) get converted .
If you use ALL_ENTITIES ( or the list [ " xml " , " html " ] ) , then both kinds of entities will be converted .
This last one is neccessary because ' is an XML entity but not an HTML entity .
BeautifulStoneSoup ( " Sacré bleu ! " , convertEntities=BeautifulStoneSoup.XML_ENTITIES )
# Sacré bleu !
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup BeautifulStoneSoup
( " Il a dit , << Sacré bleu ! > > " , convertEntities=BeautifulStoneSoup.XML_ENTITIES ) # Il a dit , << Sacré bleu ! >>
If you tell Beautiful Soup to convert XML or HTML entities into the corresponding Unicode characters , then Windows - 1252 characters ( like Microsoft smart quotes ) also get transformed into Unicode characters .
This happens even if you told Beautiful Soup to convert those characters to entities .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup smartQuotesAndEntities =
" Il a dit , \x8BSacré bleu!\x9 b " BeautifulStoneSoup(smartQuotesAndEntities , smartQuotesTo= " html " ) .contents [ 0 ] # u'
Il a dit , ‹ Sacré bleu ! ›'
BeautifulStoneSoup(smartQuotesAndEntities , convertEntities = " html " , smartQuotesTo= " html " ) .contents [ 0 ] # u'
Il a dit , \u2039 Sacr\xe9 bleu!\u203a' BeautifulStoneSoup(smartQuotesAndEntities , convertEntities = " xml " , smartQuotesTo= " xml " ) .contents [ 0 ] # u'
Il a dit , \u2039 Sacré bleu!\u203a'
It does n't make sense to create new HTML / XML entities while you 're busy turning all the existing entities into Unicode characters .
Sanitizing Bad Data with Regexps
Beautiful Soup does pretty well at handling bad markup when " bad markup " means tags in the wrong places .
But sometimes the markup is just malformed , and the underlying parser can't handle it .
So Beautiful Soup runs regular expressions against an input document before trying to parse it .
By default , Beautiful Soup uses regular expressions and replacement functions to do search - and - replace on input documents .
It finds self - closing tags that look like < BR / > , and changes them to look like < BR />.
It finds declarations that have extraneous whitespace , like <! -- Comment --> , and removes the whitespace : <!-- Comment-->.
If you have bad markup that needs fixing in some other way , you can pass your own list of ( regular expression , replacement function ) tuples into the soup constructor , as the markupMassage argument .
Let 's take an example : a page that has a malformed comment .
The underlying SGML parser can't cope with this , and ignores the comment and everything afterwards :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup badString = " Foo < !- This comment is malformed .--> Bar<br /> Baz " BeautifulSoup ( badString ) # Foo
Let 's fix it up with a regular expression and a function :
import re myMassage = [ ( re.compile ( ' <!-([ ^-] ) ' ) , lambda match : '<!--' + match.group ( 1 ) ) ] BeautifulSoup ( badString , markupMassage=myMassage ) # Foo<!-- This comment is malformed .-->
Bar
Oops , we 're still missing the < BR > tag .
Our markupMassage overrides the parser 's default massage , so the default search - and - replace functions do n't get run .
The parser makes it past the comment , but it dies at the malformed self - closing tag .
Let 's add our new massage function to the default list , so we run all the functions .
import copy myNewMassage = copy.copy( BeautifulSoup.MARKUP_MASSAGE ) myNewMassage.extend(myMassage ) BeautifulSoup ( badString , markupMassage=myNewMassage ) # Foo<!-- This comment is malformed .--> Bar<br />
Baz
Now we 've got it all .
If you know for a fact that your markup does n't need any regular expressions run on it , you can get a faster startup time by passing in False for markupMassage .
Fun With SoupStrainer s
Recall that all the search methods take more or less the same arguments .
Behind the scenes , your arguments to a search method get transformed into a SoupStrainer object .
If you call one of the methods that returns a list ( like findAll ) , the SoupStrainer object is made available as the source property of the resulting list .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup xml = '< person name = " Bob " >< parent rel= " mother " name = " Alice " >' xmlSoup = BeautifulStoneSoup ( xml ) results = xmlSoup.findAll( rel='mother ') results .
source # < BeautifulSoup.SoupStrainer instance at 0xb7e0158c > str( results.source ) # " None| { 'rel ' : ' mother '} "
The SoupStrainer constructor takes most of the same arguments as find : name , attrs , text , and ** kwargs .
You can pass in a SoupStrainer as the name argument to any search method :
xmlSoup.findAll(results.source ) == results # True custom Strainer = BeautifulSoup.SoupStrainer(rel='mother ') xmlSoup.findAll(customStrainer ) == results # True
Yeah , who cares , right ?
You can carry around a method call 's arguments in many other ways .
But another thing you can do with SoupStrainer is pass it into the soup constructor to restrict the parts of the document that actually get parsed .
That brings us to the next section : Improving Performance by Parsing Only Part of the Document
Beautiful Soup turns every element of a document into a Python object and connects it to a bunch of other Python objects .
If you only need a subset of the document , this is really slow .
But you can pass in a SoupStrainer as the parseOnlyThese argument to the soup constructor .
Beautiful Soup checks each element against the SoupStrainer , and only if it matches is the element turned into a Tag or NavigableText , and added to the tree .
If an element is added to to the tree , then so are its children — even if they would n't have matched the SoupStrainer on their own .
This lets you parse only the chunks of a document that contain the data you want .
Here 's a pretty varied document :
doc = ' ' ' Bob reports < a href = " http://www.bob.com/ " >success</a> with his plasma breeding < a href = " http://www.bob.com/plasma ">experiments</a>. < i>
Do n't get any on us , Bob ! </i> < br >< br>
Ever hear of annular fusion ?
The folks at < a href = " http://www.boogabooga.net/ " >BoogaBooga </a> sure seem obsessed with it .
Secret project , or < b> WEB MADNESS ?</b>
You decide !'''
Here are several different ways of parsing the document into soup , depending on which parts you want .
All of these are faster and use less memory than parsing the whole document and then using the same SoupStrainer to pick out the parts you want .
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup , SoupStrainer import re links = SoupStrainer ( 'a ' ) [ tag for tag in BeautifulSoup ( doc , parseOnlyThese=links ) ] # [ < a href = " http://www.bob.com/ " >success</a> , # < a href= " http://www.bob.com/plasma ">experiments</a> , # < a href= " http://www.boogabooga.net/ "
>BoogaBooga</a >] linksToBob = SoupStrainer ( 'a ' , href=re.compile('bob.com /' ) ) [ tag for tag in BeautifulSoup ( doc , parseOnlyThese=linksToBob ) ] # [ < a href = " http://www.bob.com/ " >success</a> , # < a href= " http://www.bob.com/plasma ">experiments</a>] mentionsOfBob = SoupStrainer ( text=re.compile ( " Bob " ) ) [ text for text in BeautifulSoup ( doc , parseOnlyThese=mentionsOfBob ) ] # [ u ' Bob reports ' , u" Do n't get any on
us , Bob ! " ] allCaps = SoupStrainer ( text=lambda(t ) : t.upper ( ) ==t ) [ text for text in BeautifulSoup ( doc , parseOnlyThese=allCaps ) ] # [ u '. ' , u '
' , u'WEB MADNESS ? ']
There is one major difference between the SoupStrainer you pass into a search method and the one you pass into a soup constructor .
Recall that the name argument can take a function whose argument is a Tag object .
You ca n't do this for a SoupStrainer 's name , because the SoupStrainer is used to decide whether or not a Tag object should be created in the first place .
You can pass in a function for a SoupStrainer 's name , but it can't take a Tag object : it can only take the tag name and a map of arguments .
shortWithNoAttrs = SoupStrainer ( lambda name , attrs : \ len( name ) == 1 and not attrs ) [ tag for tag in BeautifulSoup ( doc , parseOnlyThese=shortWithNoAttrs ) ] # [< i>
Do n't get any on us , Bob ! </i> , # < b>WEB MADNESS ?</b >]
Improving Memory Usage with extract
When Beautiful Soup parses a document , it loads into memory a large , densely connected data structure .
If you just need a string from that data structure , you might think that you can grab the string and leave the rest of it to be garbage collected .
Not so .
That string is a NavigableString object .
It 's got a parent member that points to a Tag object , which points to other Tag objects , and so on .
So long as you hold on to any part of the tree , you 're keeping the whole thing in memory .
The extract method breaks those connections .
If you call extract on the string you need , it gets disconnected from the rest of the parse tree .
The rest of the tree can then go out of scope and be garbage collected , while you use the string for something else .
If you just need a small part of the tree , you can call extract on its top - level Tag and let the rest of the tree get garbage collected .
This works the other way , too .
If there 's a big chunk of the document you do n't need , you can call extract to rip it out of the tree , then abandon it to be garbage collected while retaining control of the ( smaller ) tree .
If extract does n't work for you , you can try Tag.decompose .
It 's slower than extract but more thorough .
It recursively disassembles a Tag and its contents , disconnecting every part of a tree from every other part .
If you find yourself destroying big chunks of the tree , you might have been able to save time by not parsing that part of the tree in the first place .
See Also Applications that use Beautiful Soup
Lots of real - world applications use Beautiful Soup .
Here are the publicly visible applications that I know about :
Similar libraries
I 've found several other parsers for various languages that can handle bad markup , do tree traversal for you , or are otherwise more useful than your average parser .
I 've ported Beautiful Soup to Ruby .
The result is Rubyful Soup .
Hpricot is giving Rubyful Soup a run for its money .
ElementTree is a fast Python XML parser with a bad attitude .
I love it .
Tag Soup is an XML / HTML parser written in Java which rewrites bad HTML into parseable HTML .
HtmlPrag is a Scheme library for parsing bad HTML .
xmltramp is a nice take on a ' standard ' XML / XHTML parser .
Like most parsers , it makes you traverse the tree yourself , but it 's easy to use .
pullparser includes a tree - traversal method .
Mike Foord did n't like the way Beautiful Soup can change HTML if you write the tree back out , so he wrote HTML Scraper .
It 's basically a version of HTMLParser that can handle bad HTML .
It might be obsolete with the release of Beautiful Soup 3.0 , though ; I 'm not sure .
Ka-Ping
Yee 's scrape .py combines page scraping with URL opening .
Conclusion
That 's it !

( CNN ) --
On a Tuesday night in a San Francisco nightclub , Torrie Dorrell makes a very personal revelation to the gathered crowd : " I 'm a full - on gamer , and my husband hates me . "
" Cassie " is one of the characters who occupies the online world of " The Agency . " more photos »
In fact , Dorrell spends so much time gaming , she has risen to the level of " officer " in a " guild " playing " EverQuest 2 " online .
More and more , husbands and boyfriends are playing second fiddle to computers and consoles as 38 percent of gamers are female , spending an average of 7.4 hours a week playing , according to the Entertainment Software Association .
Dorrell is n't just one of these female gamers , she also works in the industry .
As the senior vice president of global sales and marketing for Sony Online Entertainment , she has made a career out of her passion for games .
" Women are out there in significant numbers playing MMOs , action games , first - person shooters , " Dorrell explains .
" What is lacking in the equation are women behind these games . "
In an effort to balance that equation , Dorrell and her colleagues at SOE have created G.I.R.L. , Gamers In Real Life , a scholarship program to attract more young women to careers in game development .
" Go to any video game convention and it appears quite obviously that there are more men than women in the industry , " says Courtney Simmons , public relations director for SOE , who helped spearhead the G.I.R.L. program at the company 's San Diego headquarters .
Speaking to an invitation - only crowd at that San Francisco bar , in town for the recent Game Developers Conference , Simmons was joined by several other women from SOE to announce the details of the program , a partnership with The Art Institutes .
The program , the first of its kind , would give the winning female student currently enrolled at an Art Institute school $ 10,000 toward her tuition and a paid internship at one of SOE 's development studios .
However , this is not the first time the issue of women in the video game industry has been addressed .
Simmons , who enjoys playing video games with her three children , believes that women are being " gamed down to , " because , she says , " there is a lack of understanding about how women play . "
Studies and sales data have shown that women are more likely to play hand - held casual games , such as the Nintendo DS , along with social oriented games such as " The Sims , " where women make up more than 55 percent of players .
Though the number of women who play games is high , they represent just under 12 percent of the industry , according to the International Game Developers Association .
By diversifying the work force , developers can create products that appeal to a wider audience .
Simmons wants to see " more women making games , " she says , " making more games that women want to play . "
More than 60 percent of female students enrolled in game design programs at The Art Institutes said they believed male dominance in the industry is a deterrent to women pursuing a career in gaming , according to a survey commissioned by SOE .
It 's a statistic that 's mirrored in the student body at the school 's campus in San Francisco .
" I get excited when there 's , like , two or three girls in my class , " says Nhaty Ngo , a third - year student finishing up her studies at the Art Institute , but she says the numbers appear to be growing with each new freshman class .
The number of women working in the industry is also on the rise .
Sherry Floyd , a game designer at SOE 's Seattle studios , is part of the team developing " The Agency , " an espionage - themed first - person shooter set for release later this year .
" I honestly do n't think it 's a gender issue , " she continues .
" I think it 's a marketing issue . "
Watch the women behind " The Agency " »
Floyd is just one of a number of women who are contributing to nearly every facet of " The Agency 's " development , from modeling and texturing to illustration and animation -- far more than the current industry standard and part of a concerted effort on the part of the game 's lead developer , Matt Wilson .
The game features a strong , female lead character named " Cassie , " who while being as tough as her male counterparts , is also attractive without being as overly - sexualized as other female game characters , such as " Lara Croft . "
" I know everybody is looking for the big ' ingredient ' we need to get [ the female ] market , " says Floyd .
" Honestly , if we just make good product , everybody will play it . "

Majestic Documents Introduction
Majestic Documents.com is a groundbreaking look at the United States UFO program called Majestic and the top secret government documents that tell the story of presidential and military action , authorization , and cover - up regarding UFOs and their alien occupants .
A remarkable work of investigative journalism , this website is the first to authenticate top secret UFO documents that tell a detailed story of the crashed discs , alien bodies , presidential briefings , and superb secrecy .
Special attention is paid to the forensic authentication issues of content , provenance , type , style and chronology .
The story the documents tell leaves the reader with little doubt that the cover - up is real , shocking , and at times unethical .
Operation Majestic - 12 was established by special classified presidential order on September 24 , 1947 at the recommendation of Secretary of Defense James Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush , Chairman of the Joint Research and Development Board .
The goal of the group was to exploit everything they could from recovered alien technology .
Buried in a super - secret “ MAJIC EYES ONLY ” classification that was above TOP SECRET – long before the modern top secret codeword special access programs of today – Major General Leslie R. Groves ( who commanded the Manhattan Project to deliver the atomic bomb ) kept just one copy of the details of crashed alien technology in his safe in Washington , D.C .
Ambitious , elite scientists such as Vannevar Bush , Albert Einstein , and Robert Oppenheimer , and career military people such as Hoyt Vandenberg , Roscoe Hillenkoetter , Leslie Groves , and George Marshall , along with a select cast of other experts , feverishly and secretively labored to understand the alien agenda , technology , and their implications .
Einstein and Oppenheimer were called in to give their opinion , drafting a six - page paper titled - Relationships With Inhabitants Of Celestial Bodies . -
They provided prophetic insight into our modern nuclear strategies and satellites , and expressed agitated urgency that an agreement be reached with the President so that scientists could proceed to study the alien technology .
The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of New Mexico , between July 4 – July 6 , 1947 , caused the Chief of Staff of the Army Air Force -s Interplanetary Phenomena Unit , Scientific and Technical Branch , Counterintelligence Directorate to initiate a thorough investigation .
The special unit was formed in 1942 in response to two crashes in the Los Angeles area in late February 1942 .
The draft summary report begins - At 2332 MST , 3 July 47 , radar stations in east Texas and White Sands Proving Ground , N.M. tracked two unidentified aircraft until they both dropped off radar .
Two crash sites have been located close to the WSPG .
Site LZ - 1 was located at a ranch near Corona , Approx . 75 miles northwest of the town of Roswell .
Site LZ - 2 was located approx .
20 miles southeast of the town of Socorro , at latitude 33 - 40 - 31 and longitude 106-28 -29 - .
The first - ever - known UFO crash retrieval case occurred in 1941 in Cape Girardeau , Missouri .
This crash kicked off early reverse - engineering work , but it did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possible technological gains apart from the Manhattan Project uses .
The debris from the primary field of the 1947 crash 20 miles southeast of Socorro , New Mexico was called ULAT - 1 ( Unidentified Lenticular Aerodyne Technology ) , and it excited metallurgists with its unheard - of tensile and shear strengths .
The fusion nuclear ( called neutronic at that time ) engine used heavy water and deuterium with an oddly arranged series of coils , magnets , and electrodes – descriptions that resemble the - cold fusion - studies of today .
Harry Truman kept the technical briefing documents of September 24 , 1947 for further study , pondering the challenges of creating and funding a secret organization before the CIA existed ( although the Central Intelligence Group or CIG did exist ) and before there was a legal procedure of funding non-war operations .
In April 1954 , a group of senior officers of the U.S. intelligence community and the Armed Forces gathered for one of the most secret and sensational briefings in history .
The subject was Unidentified Flying Objects – not just a discussion of sightings , but how to recover crashed UFOs , where to ship the parts , and how to deal with the occupants .
For example , in the - Special Operations Manual ( SOM1 - 01 ) Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery and Disposal , - MAJESTIC - 12 - red teams - mapped out UFO crash retrieval scenarios with special attention given to press blackouts , body packaging , and live alien transport , isolation , and custody .
Majestic Documents.com is not another rehash of the famous Roswell story – it contains over 500 pages ( and growing ) of newly surfaced documents , many of which date years before the Roswell crash .
Unlike other websites , a central theme of validating authenticity is woven throughout the site while telling the exciting story of the U.S. government ’s work on retrieval and analysis of extraterrestrial hardware and alien life forms from 1941 to present .
Our Compact Disc ( CD ) , The Secret : Evidence That We Are Not Alone , shows 117 pages of - leaked - top secret UFO documents , most of them never before seen by the public .
Some 26 pages were allegedly prepared for a 1954 Special Operations Manual ( SOM1 - 01 ) .
This can be purchased on our website along with two other books that provide both the raw original documents and retyped replicas that are often easier to read .
The CD provides an initial discussion as to why this briefing manual and the other documents are almost certainly authentic .
The Majestic documents tell a mind - boggling story of deception , intelligence and counterintelligence , revolutionary alien technology , missing nuclear weapons , and compartmentalized secrecy spanning in time from the first crashed disc retrieval in 1941 until three days before President Kennedy -s assassination in 1963 .
Our investigation team , led by Robert and Ryan Wood - a father and son team with 50 years of combined UFO study - has applied their skills as both sleuths and scholars .
Painstakingly verifying - deep throat - sources , meticulously analyzing old and controversial documents , they arrive finally at conclusions that are as well grounded in fact as they are stunning in their implications .
UFO - related secret programs have consumed a significant part of America -s black budget since the Manhattan Project .
The 1997 government - disclosed intelligence budget portion alone is $ 26 billion and according to Tim Weiner -s 1990 book Blank Check , the total black - budget was about $ 35 billion in 1990 .
Even the most sensational conspiracy of modern times - the Kennedy assassination - is likely linked to the UFO cover - up and the military cabal , as several of the documents demonstrate .
Overall , the United States UFO program grew out of necessity .
First , to determine the alien threat , second to exploit their advanced technology in any way we could to gain a military , economic or even a psychological advantage and win World War II , and third to maintain power , authority , and control of both technology , governments , and world stability .
Initially , to make the project public would have sent unpredictable turmoil into science , religion , politics , and global economics .
Even the most hardened skeptic , after reviewing the data presented and seeing copies of the original documents , will find it hard to deny the reality of military and government cover - up for over 50 years .
All of the usual questions , which the thoughtful skeptical reader has , have either already been addressed or soon will be in our ongoing research .
We welcome website visitors - comments , criticism , and support .
Remember the iPhone ?
You know , the other one ?
On December 18 last year , Linksys announced a family of cordless phones called the iPhone that connect to VOIP services like Skype over a Wi -Fi connection .
Even though it may seem like Linksys ' iPhones died quiet and unmourned deaths , they 're still on the market .
Linksys is even planning to release new products under the iPhone brand in 2008 .
But do n't get too excited : Linksys wo n't say what they are .
" Linksys does n't disclose products that have n't been released , " said Karen Sohl , a spokesperson for the company , " but we 'll continue to release products under the iPhone name . "
When Linksys announced the Skype- enabled Wi-Fi handset in December 2006 , few remembered that parent company Cisco had snapped up the trademark with the 2001 acquisition of Infogear .
When Apple used the same name a few months later , it led to a legal dispute , which was swiftly settled .
Almost a year has passed since the original announcement , however , and both companies appear quite happy to share the brand .
Apple 's iPhone is the gadget - success story of the year , marching toward 3.5 million sales by the new year , according to estimates by investment bank Piper Jaffray .
While Linksys declined to disclose sales , none of its iPhones are contenders in Amazon 's best - selling electronics category .
The best showing is from the CIT400 model , sitting at rank 742 overall .
Relations with Apple , Sohl said , are good .
" There 's no bad blood , " she said .
" We enjoy working with Apple . "
With Linksys ' clear claim to the name , many were surprised to see Apple CEO Steve Jobs call his company 's handset " iPhone , " even though the press , bloggers and public had called Apple 's handset that all along .
Cisco filed a lawsuit almost immediately .
The two companies settled their differences on February 20 , agreeing to share the mark .
The terms of the agreement were never disclosed but it included language about " interopability . "
A year on , there 's no sign of interoperability between the two ranges .
Apple has yet to outline any official VOIP capabilities for the iPhone , and Linksys had little to say about the issue .
" It 's ongoing , " Sohl said .
" We 're looking at having interoperability , but no details of the specifics have been announced yet . "
Despite the low profile , Linksys ' iPhone models have received decidedly favorable reviews .
Linksys ' iPhone products are marketed as " a new age of communications , " and actually have a high - tech edge shared by few rival products .
The lineup of Wi-Fi handsets , which connect to popular VOIP networks such as Skype and Yahoo Messenger , also include the ability to tap into personal media on local networks – photos , music and video .
Cisco acquired the iPhone trademark in 2000 .
Infogear sold the original iPhone , a combined phone and web - access device , from 1998 .
Though novel , featuring a QWERTY keyboard and an LCD touch screen , it was discontinued in 2001 .
Its trademark application was filed in 1996 .
Apple applied for trademarks on the name in October 2002 , but only Australia and Singapore assigned it .
A Canadian company , Comware , has marketed its own VOIP devices using the iPhone name since 2004 .
It 's a legal mess that extends to the marketplace .
Mike Olson , an analyst with Piper Jaffray said trying to latch its VOIP lineup to the iPhone brand makes it hard for Linksys ' products to forge their own identity .
" It serves only to confuse people , " he said .
" When you 're building a category around technology that consumers do n't fully understand , like VOIP , naming a product after something hugely successful in another category will only confuse people further . "
" No one equates Linksys with iPhone , and they never did , " Olson continued .
" This was true even when Linksys was the only company out with an iPhone .
It comes down to wanting to be involved , somehow , with the juggernaut . "
At this point it is ridiculous to claim that Hillary cannot win , but her chances are overestimated .
I apply what I call The Angry Ape Test to the candidates .
Imagine each mimicking an angry ape , and ask how pretty or appealing the resulting picture is .
Most swing voters perceive America as being at war and so they demand toughness .
They demand An Angry Ape , if not at every moment in time , at least in principle .
Most Americans do n’t find an angry Hillary to be a pleasant Hillary , whereas an angry , raging Giuliana fits his basic image .
Americans claim not to be biased , but at their core they do n’t much like angry women ; being female remains Hillary ’s biggest barrier , even when explicit prejudice is absent .
Related prejudicial forces will keep Barack Obama from the presidency .
Being black , he is supposed to sound reasonable and intelligent all the time .
He is not allowed to mimic An Angry Ape .
Americans want their first women President to be like Margaret Thatcher — firm , no -nonsense schoolmarmish strength without much radiation of anger — and they want their first black President to be like Colin Powell .
We will allow " Magisterial " — I ’m too strong to need to throw a tantrum — to trump Angry Ape , but Hillary ca n’t play that card .
Barack is too young , too inexperienced , and does n’t have the military record .
Mitt Romney also ca n’t do The Angry Ape .
This same hypothesis suggests McCain still has some chance , though obviously his path to the top is no longer clear , given his limited resources .
He can at least do The Ape .
This is the main reason why I still think Giuliani will win .
Under this theory foreign policy disasters , no matter who caused them , will help the Republican candidate .
We will demand An Angrier Ape .
SACRAMENTO --
Crews were racing Thursday to mop up 58,000 gallons of fuel that spilled after a cargo ship bumped into the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge .
Spread by the tides , the fuel slick from Wednesday ’s accident shut down several beaches and threatened shorebirds , seals and other marine mammals that make a home in the bay .
By Thursday afternoon , 26 oil - covered birds had been rescued by wildlife crews , while six birds were found dead .
Hundreds more had been caught in the spreading slick , said Steve Edinger , assistant chief for the California Department of Fish and Game .
The slick had also spread outside the bay , as far as Tennessee Point in Marin County , 10 miles north of the Golden Gate .

“ This is a significant event , ” Edinger said .
“ This is one we ’re very concerned about . ”
He said the last major oil spill in the bay occurred in 1996 , when 10,000 gallons oozed out of a ship in a repair facility .
Melissa Hauck of the U.S. Coast Guard said eight oil - skimming boats were working to clean up the slick .
By late afternoon , 9,500 gallons had been collected , as well as 3 cubic yards of oil in gel or solid form .
The spill was of bunker fuel , a viscous fuel used on ships that is heavy and can be difficult to clean up .
Authorities also laid 11,000 feet of log booms around the 810 - foot container ship Cosco Busan , which was towed to an anchorage off Candlestick Point in San Francisco after it nudged the Bay Bridge in morning fog .
No more fuel was leaking from the vessel , Hauck said .

The ship struck a steel and concrete buttress that protects one of the suspension bridge ’s massive support towers about 8:30 a.m.
Wednesday , gouging the hull on the front port side above the water line .
Authorities said the bridge piling was not damaged and that the protective shield would be repaired .
Coast Guard officials said the Cosco Busan was being guided out of the bay by a pilot familiar with the waters when the accident occurred .
The spill in the bay is relatively small .
The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil off Prince William Sound .
A spill in 2001 off the Galapagos Islands spread more than 160,000 gallons through the ecologically fragile archipelago .
Still , public officials voiced criticism that the Coast Guard initially underestimated it .
Advertisement
Hours after the accident , Coast Guard officials described the fuel leak as a relatively insignificant 140 gallons .
But by Thursday morning , the estimate had skyrocketed to nearly 60,000 gallons .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) released a letter she wrote Thursday to the head of the Coast Guard , expressing dismay over the delay in accurately assessing the risk as well as questioning the investigation into the cause .
“ Many questions remain as to why it took an entire day to determine the gravity of this spill , and whether the Coast Guard took appropriate measures to conduct drug and alcohol tests on the ship ’s pilot and navigators in a timely fashion , ” Boxer wrote to Adm .
Thad W. Allen .
Coast Guard officials said the investigation was ongoing .
Advertisement
The fuel slick soiled at least nine beaches and parks : Muir Beach , Kirby Cove , Rodeo Beach , Black Sand Beach , Baker Beach , Crissy Field , China Beach , Angel Island and Fort Point .
Thirteen state and federal agencies set up a command center at Fort Mason in San Francisco and were meeting to discuss the mop-up .
Oil slicks create problems for shorebirds by coating their feathers , robbing them of their natural ability to stay warm in the chilly bay water .
“ It ’s sort of like a rip in a wetsuit , ” Edinger said .
“ They get cold , they beach themselves and they start preening their feathers .
They can ingest oil , and that shuts down their digestive system .
They lose energy and the ability to take on water and moisture . ”
Advertisement
Birds that escape the slick can fall prey to a different peril :
They ca n’t find food , become debilitated and may die .
Edinger said most birds being treated were surf scoters , but there were reports of gulls and other shorebirds being affected .
He said the next two or three days could see the numbers of imperiled birds jump significantly .
Experts from the Oiled Wildlife Care Network , a UC Davis program , have been called in by Fish and Game .

Use cProfile .
This is for people who still wonder what they should use every time .
cProfile was added in Python 2.5 after much discussion about the downsides of existing profilers .
hotshot does not time C calls .
If your code does a lot of work with built - in methods , like sorting lists , hotshot wo n’t report it .
It has an option to record line events — how much time is spent on each line of code in your source file ; however , this information is lost when the log is loaded into pstats .
Stats , Python ’s class for printing profile data .
, Python ’s class for printing profile data .
hotshot generates huge log files that take about as long to load as the profile took to run .
That eleven minute profiling session in my previous post generated a 625 M log file with hotshot .
cProfile ’s was 52 K and more useful .
Use cProfile like this :
If you just want to print the results immediately :
import cProfile cProfile.run ( " test_function( a , b , c ) " , sort=1 )
sort=1 will sort by the “ tottime ” column , which is normally the most sensible way to find out what your code is spending time on .
If your statement contains free variables ( references names that are defined in your interpreter but not in the string to execute ) , use runctx :
cProfile.runctx (" test_function ( a , b , c ) " , globals ( ) , locals ( ) )
Use the filename argument to log results to a file :
cProfile.run ( " test_function ( ) " , filename=" test_function.cprof " )
And load saved results like so :
import pstats stats = pstats .
Stats ( " test_function.cprof " ) stats.print_stats ()
You will almost always want to manipulate and trim down the output like so ( the top 20 items by tottime , in this case ) :
LOS ANGELES , Jan 25 ( Reuters ) - The Federal Communications Commission on Friday said it plans to fine the Walt Disney Co's DIS.N ABC network $ 1.4 million for airing an episode of " NYPD Blue " in 2003 that showed a woman 's nude buttocks .
The company said it opposes the fine and plans to appeal .
In a notice filed on Friday , the agency said 52 television ABC stations in the Central and Mountain time zones had aired the scene at 9 p.m. in violation of federal restrictions against broadcasting “ obscene material ” between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m .
The agency said it received “ numerous complaints ” about the scene , in which a young boy walks in on a nude woman about to take a shower .
Stations in the Eastern and Pacific time zones were exempt because they broadcast the Feb. 25 , 2003 , episode at 10 p.m. local time .
ABC said in a statement that it had broadcast the episode and others from the cop drama , which ran from 1993 to 2005 , with appropriate parental warnings and with V - chip enabled program ratings when they were available .
The network added that the show had been on the air for nearly a decade when the episode in question aired “ and the realistic nature of its storylines was well known to the viewing public . ”
( Reporting by Gina Keating ; Editing by Gary Hill )
A student at Princeton University who said he was beaten unconscious by two black - clad assailants Friday has said that he fabricated the assault , and that he sent e-mail death threats to himself , three other Princeton students , and a prominent conservative professor at Princeton , Robert George , police said today .
No charges have been filed against the student , Francisco Nava , pending further investigation , a spokesman for the Princeton Township Police said .
In an interview , Mr. George earlier described Mr. Nava 's wounds as " severe , " doubting that they could have been self - inflicted .
Over the weekend , Mr. Nava 's jaw was badly swollen , his face was covered with cuts and abrasions , and the inside of his mouth was bleeding , Mr. George said after visiting Mr. Nava in the emergency room .
He survived against all the odds ; now Peng Shulin has astounded doctors by learning to walk again .
When his body was cut in two by a lorry in 1995 , it was little short of a Medical miracle that he lived .
It took a team of nearly 20 doctors to save his life .
Skin was grafted from his head to seal his torso – but the legless Mr Peng was left only 78 cm ( 2ft 6 in ) tall .
Bedridden for years , doctors in China had little hope that he would ever be able to live anything like a normal life again .
I know what you are thinking now , “ Well Mr Robin Bal , what ’s all this got to do with Personal Finance , Investing , Debt Elimination etc . ”
A LOT , go on continue reading , get the message .
Read
But recently , he began exercising his arms , building up the strength to carry out everyday chores such as washing his face and brushing his teeth .
Doctors at the China Rehabilitation Research Centre in Beijing found out about Mr Peng ’s plight late last year and devised a plan to get him up walking again .
They came up with an ingenious way to allow him to walk on his own , creating a sophisticated egg cup - like casing to hold his body with two bionic legs attached to it .
He has been taking his first steps around the center with the aid of his specially adapted legs and a resized walking frame .
Mr Peng , who has to learn how to walk again , is said to be delighted with the device .
Call it Self Confidence , Determination , Personal Development , Goal Achievement or whatever , all these have a lot to do with all departments of your life , leave alone Finances .

She 's just as bad of a liar as Bush and the rest of them .
Of course they will hide behind their positions and " stay the course " as long as we let them .
The fact is there WAS conflicting evidence , and it was never presented to the American people .
Just like with vote fraud , just like with the Sibel Edmonds case , just like with Ron Paul 's presidency , just like with the Israel spy ring .
Just like everything that means anything .
They will pummel us with coverage of Heath Ledger , Brittney Spears , Paris Hilton , local crime , and all sorts of useless crap .

Rice is a better liar than the rest of them .
She keeps talking and keeps talking .
The rules of the game dictate that there is only a limited amount of time that a Congressperson has to question .
So just keep talking about the same thing and you can get away .
This kind of thing is why they had to get rid of Cynthia McKinney .
This very reason .
She was much better at this than Wexler .

I 've never thought Rice was a very good liar .
Just a persistent one .
Reminds me of a recent review of a book by convicted election thief Allen Raymond .
He was hired in a Republican scheme to jam phones of Democratic and neutral offices on election day in New Hampshire in 2002 , during a very close Senate race .
Allen Raymond : Confessions of a Republican Smear Artist
by Joseph A. Palermo
Huffington Post
February 11 , 2008
http://www.huffingtonpos...-confession_b_86039.html
EXCERPT : Raymond also engaged in libel against his Democratic opponents .
He twisted a female Democratic candidate 's legislative record .
She had voted in favor of a mainstream sex education program in the public schools and had voted against a provision in another law that the teachers ' unions opposed .
Raymond produced a 30 - second TV ad that accused her of voting in favor of " teaching first - graders about condoms , " and claimed she had " voted to permit the sale of pornographic videos to children . "
The attack ad also accused her of voting " to allow convicted drug abusers to work in our public schools . " ( p. 105 ) She sued the Republican Party for $ 10 million for libel but she lost the election .
A few years later a Republican judge tossed out her libel case .
" When it came to playing in the gutter , we were the professionals --- the Dems were n't even junior varsity , " Raymond writes .
( p. 68 ) Raymond admits that he did n't realize his activities were anything more than a game or a kind of elaborate joke played on a gullible electorate .
It was not until he found himself sitting in a federal prison cell when he realized that the elections he had helped rig actually had real world consequences that affected real people .
In short , Raymond was a supreme douche bag during his many years with the GOP .
At one point in the book , after lamenting the current state of our nation 's politics , Raymond asks rhetorically : " How did we get here ?
Because election operatives like myself and the kind of politicians who hire us have ensured that idealists can't win elections .
Only the cynics are making the laws . " ( p. 239 ) Raymond describes how the Bush Justice Department essentially obstructed justice by blocking Democratic attempts to depose New Hampshire Republican Party officials about Raymond 's illegal phone - jamming system .
The Department of Justice under Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped the deposition " on the grounds that it would interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation . "
In the years since 2002 , that tactic --- claiming no investigation can be conducted because it might interfere with an ongoing investigation --- has become a Bush staple in covering up crimes ranging from the illegal use of torture and warrantless surveillance , to the leaking of a CIA agent 's identity and the disappearance of White House phone and email logs .
It 's all spin ; the fabled " permanent campaign " in operation .
Although Raymond remains a staunch Republican , he admits that he did n't learn until he was well over 40 that being a lying , rotten , unethical hatchet man might not be all that great .
Surveying the members of the Bush Administration with whom he worked , Raymond concludes : " They lie when they 're in trouble , they lie when they 're safe ; they lie when threatened , they lie when they are threatening ; they lie about lies , they lie about lying about lies .
And if they should happen upon some harmless , well - meaning little truth lying around , they beat it about the face and head until it looks like a lie , and wants to be a lie , and finally does become a lie .
And people say there are no men of vision in Washington . " ( pp. 225-226 )

Russ Michaels here , director of the HBO documentary " Hacking Democracy " .
I applaud Congressman Wexler and it's important to remember the power of filmed testimony .
Condolezza
Rice certainly knows that she and others in the Bush administration suppressed crucial intelligence that contradicted their marketing of the Iraq war .
Tyler Drumheller , one of the CIA 's chief officers in Europe finally spoke out against the White House in 2006 revealing that the CIA tried to bring intelligence from a Saddam Govt .
insider who knew Iraq had no weapons program , but the Bush administration refused to allow this information .
See Mr. Drumheller 's filmed testimony on ' 60 Minutes ' here ...
http://www.cbsnews.com/s...inutes/main1527749.shtml
( Drumheller interviewed by Ed Bradley of CBS ) ...
Drumheller was the CIA 's top man in Europe , the head of covert operations there , until he retired a year ago .
He says he saw firsthand how the White House promoted intelligence it liked and ignored intelligence it did n’t : .... " The idea of going after Iraq was U.S. policy .
It was going to happen one way or the other , " says Drumheller .
.... ....
Meanwhile , the CIA had made a major intelligence breakthrough on Iraq ’s nuclear program .
Naji Sabri , Iraq ’s foreign minister , had made a deal to reveal Iraq ’s military secrets to the CIA .
Drumheller was in charge of the operation .
" This was a very high inner circle of Saddam Hussein .
Someone who would know what he was talking about , " Drumheller says .
" You knew you could trust this guy ? "
Bradley asked .
" We continued to validate him the whole way through , " Drumheller replied .
According to Drumheller , CIA Director George Tenet delivered the news about the Iraqi foreign minister at a high - level meeting at the White House , including the president , the vice president and Secretary of State Rice .
At that meeting , Drumheller says , " They were enthusiastic because they said , they were excited that we had a high - level penetration of Iraqis . "
What did this high - level source tell him ?
" He told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program , " says Drumheller .
" So in the fall of 2002 , before going to war , we had it on good authority from a source within Saddam 's inner circle that he did n't have an active program for weapons of mass destruction ? "
Bradley asked .
" Yes , " Drumheller replied .
He says there was doubt in his mind at all .
" It directly contradicts , though , what the president and his staff were telling us , " Bradley remarked .
" The policy was set , " Drumheller says .
" The war in Iraq was coming .
And they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy , to justify the policy . "

It can be put many ways , but I would put it this way " If her lips are moving she is lying " .
One journalist puts it this way in a nicer form but with the same meaning :
Whadda you mean " we , " Mr. TV Pundit ?
When you say " we " are doing better in Iraq or , even more absurd , that " we " were right to invade that country in the first place , are you putting Joe Blow American in the same bag as the top officers of Exxon , which made $ 40.6 billion in profit last year thanks to the turmoil in the energy markets ?
That royal " we " is good for the royals who control our government , but its persistent use embodies a pernicious lie that betrays the core ideal of representative democracy .

There were so many and some experts resigned from the Bush administration in protest , surely she remembers .

A millionaire Dem with a grudge against Wexler is trying to unseat him and has loads of money for ads .
Wexler is my rep and he truly represents me .
Please contribute to his re-election so we can keep guys like him asking the questions and who do n't believe impeachment should be off the f'in table !!!!

VIDEO : Condoleezza Rice : Liar , Secretary of State , War Criminal Part 1 Wexler asks Rice , is n't it true that you had intelligence that cast doubt on your repeated claims that Iraq did have WMD .
It is worse than even how Wexler characterizes it .
SEE PROOF , that the Bush Administration was committing fraud in order to fool the public into thinking Iraq had WMD .

The RIAA has settled a case against a grandmother in Texas who was accused of sharing music over the KaZaA network .
Both the RIAA and Rhonda Crain , the defendant , agreed to a stipulation of judgment against Crain , but the record labels involved in the suit will not get any damages for any infringement that occurred .
Crain , a grandmother who was displaced by 2005 's Hurricane Rita , was sued for copyright infringement in September 2006 after the RIAA 's investigators flagged user " kcrain@KaZaA " for sharing 572 tracks on the P2P network , including tracks by 50 Cent and Usher .
After Crain denied engaging in file - sharing and rejected the RIAA 's $ 4,500 prelitigation settlement offer , the RIAA filed suit .
Represented by Lone Star Legal Aid , Crain denied engaging in file - sharing and , in a counterclaim , said that the labels had no evidence that she had infringed on their copyrights other than her ISP 's linking of the IP address flagged by SafeNet on KaZaA to her account .
She also accused the labels of extortion , and in a filing this past July , accused the RIAA of using investigators not licensed by the state of Texas in violation of state law .
Crain 's counterclaims were dismissed in September , but late last month , the parties agreed to settle the case .
Under the terms of the settlement , a final judgment has been entered in favor of the RIAA , although Crain does not admit to infringement herself .
She is permanently barred from copyright infringement and is required to delete all of the recordings that " Defendant and / or any third party that has used the Internet connection and / or computer equipment owned or controlled by Defendant . "
That last stipulation may be the reason behind the RIAA 's decision to settle the case without any damage award .
The KaZaA user seen by the RIAA 's investigators was signed on using the screen name kcrain@KaZaA , which may indicate that one of Rhonda Crain 's children or grandchildren was logged into KaZaA at the time and that the defendant 's only " crime " was paying for the Internet account used for file - sharing .
That was what happened in two cases that the record labels came out on the wrong end of .
Debbie Foster and Patricia Santangelo triumphed over the RIAA after the judges in both cases dismissed the lawsuits with prejudice , meaning that they were both the prevailing parties .
In each case , there was evidence that someone in Foster 's and Santangelo 's homes may have been logged into KaZaA , but the RIAA was unable to show that the defendants themselves engaged in file - sharing .
The labels had argued that , even if Foster and Santangelo had not been on KaZaA themselves , they were both liable for " secondary infringement . "
Had the Crain case moved towards a trial , the RIAA would likely have found itself forced to make the same secondary infringement argument .
Judge Lee R. West , who ruled in favor of Debbie Foster , found that the Copyright Act failed to support the RIAA 's secondary infringement allegations .
" The Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another , " wrote Judge Lee . " Under ... common law principles , one infringes a copyright contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging a direct infringement . "
Paying for an Internet account used by someone else did n't rise to that standard .
By settling with the RIAA , Crain moves out from under the legal cloud without admitting infringement and , more importantly , without having to pay any damages to the RIAA .
For its part , the labels avoid the risk of having the case against Crain dismissed and being forced to pay attorneys ' fees , as they had to do in the Foster case ( Santangelo was given the right to seek attorneys ' fees by the judge in that case , but I could find no record of an award one way or another ) .

Cal scientist reflects on Darwin 's genius BERKELEY
Exactly one year shy of Charles Darwin 's 200th birthday , scientists are looking ahead to the anniversary to call for renewed understanding of the scientist 's powerful impact on Western civilization .
None of modern biology , no advances in medical research , nor success for the Human Genome Project , nor the achievements of biotechnology could exist today without the insights first advanced by that reclusive genius of the Victorian era , the scientists agree .
Now , a UC Berkeley paleontologist named Kevin Padian argues that the coming bicentennial is the ideal time " to reflect on just what constitutes Darwin 's enduring greatness in Western thought . "
And this week , the 199th anniversary of Darwin 's birth on Feb. 12 , 1809 , hundreds of public meetings reflecting on his discoveries will be held at " Darwin Day " celebrations around the world .
In a seminal essay published in this week 's issue of the international journal Nature , Padian says of the great Victorian scientist , explorer and meticulous researcher : " Perhaps no individual has had such a sweeping influence on so many facets of social and intellectual life " as Darwin .
At the same time , Padian notes , " Darwin has been invoked as the demon responsible for a variety of heartless ills of society . "
Among them , he Padian lists " atheism , Nazism , communism , abortion , homosexuality , stem cell research , same - sex marriage , and the abridgment of all our natural freedoms . "
Indeed , Darwin has been demonized by many , and his findings contradicted by those who deny the facts of evolution .
His opponents argue that Darwin 's concept of evolution is still merely an untested theory , but hold conflicting views on how life began and humanity arrived on Earth .
There are the creationists , who insist that the Bible 's descriptions of the world 's beginning and the first humans are literally true .
Then , there are more than a few rebel scientists who argue that the infinite varieties of life forms are so complex that they must be the product of some kind of intelligent design .
Padian , a professor of integrative biology at Berkeley , is also president of the Oakland - based National Center for Science Education , a watchdog group that monitors controversies over evolution in the schools and promotes curricula based on the latest science .
Two years ago , he provided key testimony during the widely watched trial against the Dover , Pa. , school board , which ended when a federal judge ruled that promoting intelligent design as science in a public school - as board members sought - was unconstitutional .
The judge concluded that the idea of " design " is not science but merely " an untested alternative hypothesis grounded in religion " and could not be presented in science classrooms as it violated the separation of church and state .
Advocates of intelligent design are the loudest voices today in the attacks on Darwin 's most influential work , " On the Origin of Species , " subtitled " By Means of Natural Selection , " which was published 150 years ago .
A stormy debate over that subtitle began at once and has never stopped .
Believers in intelligent design insist that the tenets of evolutionary theory are deeply flawed and that humans and other animals could never have evolved from more primitive species .
The advocates of intelligent design , or ID , cite the human eye , for example , as an organ so incredibly complex that it could not possibly have evolved step - by - step over millions of years .
Each separate part of an eye must function together in concert , the ID advocates insist , and so the organ must have been assembled fully and completely , like a machine , by some unknown and as - yet - unidentified Designer .
In Padian 's Nature article , the Berkeley scientist notes that Darwin was already well aware of what paleontologists and other scientists call deep time - the " incredible stretch of time " that was needed for major environmental changes to influence the survival of plants and animals so the hardiest could pass on their characteristics , while the least fit would not survive .
" It was no longer possible , " Padian says of Darwin and his day , " to accept that Earth was 6,000 years old , as some biblical scholars estimated . "
Based on Darwin 's discoveries during his five - year voyage around the world as a naturalist aboard the British ship HMS Beagle , and on his research in England , where he scoured the countryside recording the experiences of animal and plant breeders , Darwin also wrote an equally important volume , " The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex . "
As Padian puts it : " Differences between sexes could now be explained as the result of processes of mate choice and territorial competition , not merely of divine design . "
High school students in biology classes whose teachers describe Darwin 's work often recommend his informal and absorbing book , " The Voyage of the Beagle , " in which the young naturalist recalled the varied finches he observed when the Beagle stopped in the Galapagos Islands .
By no means irreligious , the scientist also wrote of the life that arose after the volcanic islands ' emergence from the sea .
" Hence , both in space and time , we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact - that mystery of mysteries - the first appearance of new beings on this earth . "
Says Padian in his Nature essay on Darwin 's work , " Today we can identify groups of plants and their insect predators , vertebrates and their parasites , lichens composed of an alga and a fungus , and many other associations that can only be reasonably explained by co-evolution through diversification over millions of years . "
Genes were unknown in Darwin 's time , so the precise genetic details of how plants and animals changed and evolved were still a mystery .
But today , the genes that regulate the development of animals and humans have been decoded in detail , Padian noted in an interview , and , remarkably , they turn out to be exactly the same in all organisms .
" Finding the genetic basis of evolutionary development is really amazing , " Padian said , " and it vindicates Darwin 's view of the tree of life completely . "
MANY OF THE mentally ill prisoners in Massachusetts live in conditions that evoke an 18th century madhouse .
Even people who believe that prisons exist solely for punishment should not abide a system that forces prisoners with diagnosable mental illnesses to spend 23 hours a day in solitary confinement , where they grow crazier , more desperate , and more dangerous by the day .
A three - part Globe Spotlight series that began yesterday plumbs the decisions and conditions that led to 15 suicides in state prisons since 2005 - triple the average rate in other states .
Some cases may be linked to sadistic treatment by guards .
But of the suicide deaths , and the more than 3,000 suicide attempts and self - inflicted injuries in the past decade , most resulted from a deadly pattern of sloppy communication , poorly - trained officers , and hardbitten attitudes about the needs of sick inmates .
The mentally ill now make up about one - quarter of the state 's 11,000 prisoners .
The Spotlight report provides new and disturbing details about the lives and deaths of suicidal prisoners .
But the overarching problem has been well documented by special prison commissions dating back to 2000 .
With each report , Department of Corrections officials embrace the recommendations and promise more enlightened treatment .
But nothing changes for the prisoners in the notorious 10 - Block at MCI - Cedar Junction and other dead - ends of the prison system .
Now the Disability Law Center is suing DOC in federal court .
It demands the construction of residential treatment centers in the system 's maximum - security prisons , where none now exist .
The DOC says that 60 such beds will come on line soon at the maximum - security prison in Shirley .
A new behavior management unit is also planned for Cedar Junction in Walpole .
But similar promises have been made before .
The best way to ensure that improvements actually happen is for the state to settle the lawsuit , which sensibly calls for 15 hours per week of therapy and rehabilitation for mentally ill prisoners .
The state Department of Mental Health reviews medical records in several DOC facilities .
But it should be given direct oversight of treatment programs as well .
Private contractors who supply mental health services for the prison need to answer to medical professionals , not public safety officials as is now the case .
Privatization has not succeeded in this field .
If DMH can't provide direct services , then it should at least provide more oversight .
There are legislative remedies , as well .
State representatives Ruth Balser and Kay Khan have sponsored important legislation to elevate the treatment standards for prisoners and training requirements for correctional officers .
But so far , the bills have languished .
Like it or not , the prisons are de facto mental institutions .
They can't be run like ancient dungeons .

The DIY Segway made a trip out to Wayland HS , where it was put to the test by some of the designers , who also happen to be the more experienced riders .
The video features some of the things our Swapfest appearance did not get to show off , including performance on an incline , performance on grass ( not great , but with 12.5 " wheels , we were n't expecting to do much off - roading ) , turning in place , and clearing a 2.5 " tall camera , with 2.5 " to spare .
Can your Segway do that ?
MORE PICTURES - 9/14/07
Who are we ?
We are a group of students from Wayland High School , John D. O'Bryant School of Math and Science , and Cambridge Rindge and Latin School working with four MIT students .
We all have worked on FIRST Robotics teams and have some background in engineering .
During the FIRST Robotics competition in Atlanta this year , we had an idea ...
Why ?
FIRST Robotics is a lot of fun .
However , it occupies around eight weeks of any given year , usually .
Eight weeks out of fifty - two leaves plenty of time for other projects .
In Atlanta this year we were brainstorming what strange contraptions we could throw together over the summer .
Although Ed , a technical instructor at MIT who works with our team , suggested a fountain , Shane had been saying it would be easy to build a Segway and we called him on it .
Besides , you can't ride a fountain ...
How does it work ?
When looking at a scooter on two wheels automagically balancing itself , it may seem an almost impossible feat .
However , the way a balancing scooter works is rather simple .
Think of it this way :
When you stumble , you do n't ( usually ) let yourself fall flat on your face .
Instead , you put a foot in front of you to " catch up " with you and get below your center of gravity .
The segway works in the same way -- when it detects you leaning forward , it moves forwards to catch up .
When it detects you leaning backward , it moves backwards to catch up .
Designing a Segway
When designing a segway , there 's a lot to consider .
You have to make sure that the motors you 're using have enough torque to move the weight of a person around and keep them from falling .
You have to be careful that the motor shafts wo n't snap when a person hops onto the scooter .
And of course , you have to make sure it can go fast and look cool .
In addition to all that , we aimed for a few other features in our early design process .
We wanted to :
Have it weigh less than 50 pounds with the battery
Spend less than $ 1000
Be able to ride our scooter through doors
Have " lean steering "
A " bonus feature " :
Construction
Once we designed our DIY Segway , we ordered parts and cut our aluminum baseplate on the waterjet in MIT 's Hobby Shop .
It took us three to four meetings to fully put together our segway , although what required the most tweaking was the damping on our lean steering mechanism .
We tried a few different methods before we finally got that right .
As of now we 're using pieces of lexan that act as leaf springs .
Electronics
The DIY Segway is controlled by a PIC microcontroller board based on the Machine Science XBoard .
It interfaces with a computer for programming the chip or viewing sensor values in real - time .
Note that although a laptop is used for debugging , the segway itself is controlled entirely by the microcontroller .
Its " deadman 's switch " is a magnetic card reader , as pictured below .
For sensors , we used an ADXL203EB accelerometer to sense acceleration due to gravity -- which is a good way to measure the angle -- coupled with an ADXRS401 gyroscope to measure the rate of angular rotation ( how fast the person is falling forward ) .
The Apple iPhone also uses an accelerometer to determine when you tilt it ... but you can't ride an iPhone !
Software
All of the code on - board the DIY Segway was written in C and compiled / loaded with Machine Science 's IDE .
The heavily commented source code can be viewed nicely in a browser here and downloaded here .
If you have any questions about the code or suggestions for improvement , feel free to direct them to this e-mail address .
The code 's main loop currently runs at about one hundred times per second ( 100 Hz ) , which is more than adequate for keeping a person balanced .
It also uses the onboard radio to transmit variables to a laptop for real - time debugging , as shown in the screenshot below .
The DIY Segway goes to Swapfest

We still have a lot to do , including :

Make a better battery holder
Thermoform a cover for the bottom
Code it so that different cards store different settings with the card reader .

Rally turns into ' angry mob ' over tardy Giuliani in Florida Michael Roston
Published : Thursday January 24 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani has insisted that a late victory in Florida will give his campaign the momentum it needs to lock down the Republican nomination .
But a late arrival at a Florida campaign event on Wednesday antagonized some of the very supporters on whom the former New York mayor is relying in order to win the Jan. 29 primary in the Sunshine State .
" A friendly crowd of about 1,000 nearly turned into an angry mob waiting for Rudy Giuliani to appear at a downtown Irish pub in this well - heeled community this evening , " wrote Dara Kam at the Palm Beach Post 's " One More Question " blog .
Kam reports that while Giuliani did not show up until 6 PM , calls from his campaign to supporters advised them to show up early for a 4:30 event , leaving " many elderly supporters wilting in the sun and others jeering as campaign surrogates pled for patience . "
And just as some supporters left the tardy candidate 's rally , polls show Florida voters likely switching to other GOP candidates .
While the firm Strategic Vision on Jan. 23 showed Giuliani in second place behind Senator John McCain but within the margin of error , most other polls point to Giuliani in a more distant second or even third place behind McCain and Mitt Romney .
INTRODUCTION
Cameras are ubiquitous today , and , from a technology perspective , the revolution is just beginning .
Video cameras are becoming smaller and cheaper while the Internet is enabling unlimited live webcasting .
Web camera usage has grown from one in 1991 to hundreds in the mid-1990s to hundreds of thousands today .
Video cameras the size of postage stamps can be procured for under $ 100 , and will certainly become even smaller and cheaper .
To many , this is good news .
Public webcams enable remote users to see what they would otherwise need to visit , and empower local subjects to have a voice and a face to the outside world .
Private webcams empower friends and family to see each other remotely , and to check up on the safety of their homes and their loved ones .
But there is a dark side .
While hidden cameras are clearly an invasion of privacy , visible public cameras can be as well .
A camera placed in a legally valid site can peer into otherwise private spaces .
Their connections to the Internet enable arbitrary numbers of users to watch anonymously .
And telephoto lenses enable cameras far greater vision than that of the human eye .
Imagine looking out your window and seeing someone on top of a building with a large telescope looking down at you .
Now imagine the nightmarish vision of seeing thousands of people on top of the building with telescopes looking down at you .
Laws and conventions acceptable for a single live gaze do not scale for remote multiple ones .
Live image from robotic webcam near Paris aimed by anonymous web user
On a personal note , I 'm a camera - guy .
For over twenty years I 've worked as an artist and researcher exploring new ways to represent place , work which often involved custom - designed cameras for 3D , immersion , and interactivity .
Last fall I moved to a small town in Japan for an artist residency , ostensibly to continue my work with VR and webcams .
But the dark times caught up with me and I felt compelled to ask some deeper questions , like , when cameras are everywhere , is it possible to become invisible from them ?
The more I learned , the more I realized the answer is , well , yes and no .
I began by aiming an inexpensive laser pointer directly into the lens of a video camera .
The results were striking .
The tiny beam neutralized regions of the camera sensor far larger than the actual size of the beam .
Properly aimed , it could block a far - away camera from seeing anything inside of a large window .
Then I looked around the Web .
Relevant articles existed but were highly scattered .
Not surprisingly , a lot of data exists in the military literature ( much of which appears to be getting " re-classified " and disappearing from the Web day by day ) .
I realized that I could more or less cover everything there is to know about camera zapping during my residency , both in terms of practical information and of larger metaphors .
I have some artistic and ethical discomfort with this work .
It 's divided my artist colleagues into those who see a new activist tool and those who liken it to burning canvasses .
Indeed , is an anti-tool a tool ?
Then there 's the question of releasing potentially useful information to criminals and terrorists .
Perhaps , but anyone who really wanted to knock out a camera would n't waste their time with harmless , temporary techniques .
My interest and motivation is to provide the creative community with some stimulating and provoking stuff .
These are stimulating and provoking times .
This is a report of my findings .
BASICS
Cameras
Camera zapping is possible because cameras are not perfect machines .
Two such imperfections are blooming and lens flare .
Blooming is the technical term for when a portion of the camera 's sensor is overloaded , resulting in " leakage " to neighboring regions .
For example , a candle in an otherwise dark setting may cause blobs or " comet tails " around the flame .
Many video cameras today advertise " anti-blooming " capabilities , but it 's ultimately a matter of degree .
Most can indeed handle a candle light without blooming but almost certainly not direct sunlight .
The other relevant imperfection is lens flare , caused by unwanted light bouncing around the glass and metal inside the camera .
Multi-coated optics and good design can minimize lens flare but not completely eliminate it .
For example , it is virtually impossible to eliminate the multi- facet reflection of the lens ' diaphragm blades in today 's cameras when they 're aimed at the sun .
Another imperfection common in digital cameras occurs in the electronics downstream from the camera sensor .
Often , when one small portion of an image is unnaturally brighter than its immediate surroundings , the electronics get confused .
The result may be large digital " blocky " artifacts in the image .
In addition to these imperfections , cameras ' strengths can also contribute to their weakness , for example with long , or telephoto , lenses .
These lenses act as telescopes , allowing the camera to fill its frame with a magnified image .
Since the field of view is small , the amount of light needed by the sensor is proportionally larger .
Consequently , telephoto lenses are typically large , making concealment more difficult and detection easier .
Further , telephoto lenses exhibit a strong retro-reflective effect , the bright reflection caused when viewing such things more or less on - axis with a light source .
Examples include animal eyes viewed with a flashlight ( held close to the observer 's eyes ) , " red eye " in flash photography , and the reflection of car headlights from retro-reflective material common on today 's running shoes .
When a telephoto lens is aimed at you , you will see a " glint " in the lens if you are shining a light in its direction .
Lasers
Lasers are near - perfect monochromatic light sources , in that they emit a single narrow wavelength , one pure color ( actually some lasers emit several pure colors ) .
The first lasers were made of glass tubes with polished mirror ends and had the additional feature of emitting collimated light , a parallel beam so precise that it could be extremely narrow ( and therefore concentrated ) or could converge to a microscopic point .
It is important to understand that a parallel beam of collimated light does not lose any of its brightness travelling through empty space .
Here on earth , the atmosphere has enough density to diffuse and weaken a collimated beam .
But on a clear day or at night , a small bright spot from a well - collimated laser will remain a small bright spot for distances of hundreds of meters .
The solid - state revolution that replaced vacuum tubes with silicon chips had a similar effect on lasers .
Solid - state technology allowed lasers to become smaller , more efficient , and much cheaper .
Useful new industries emerged , such as laser printers and laser - scanning at supermarket checkout counters .
Useless ones appeared as well , such as cheap home laser light shows and laser pointers .
Laser pointer like this can be found for $ 1 on the Web
Laser pointers represent a case study of what happens when technological advancement and high volume production reduce costs so much that a product simply happens , regardless of need or utility .
Laser and other light - based pointing devices were originally made to help a lecturer highlight something on an accompanying projection screen .
So in theory , there need not be more pointers in the world than lecterns or projection screens ( or lecturers ) .
But because laser pointers could be made and sold for a few dollars , they found a market as a novelty item .
Red laser pointers can be bought on the Web today for $ 1 or $ 2 each , while green ones are much more expensive ( $ 200 - $ 400 ) and blue ones are still in commercial development .
Today lasers come in extremely wide varieties of type , wavelength , and power .
( Everything one would ever want to know about lasers can be found on the Web at Sam's Laser FAQ . )
They range from lasers capable of destroying missiles to tiny lasers that create images directly on the human retina .
Laser Safety
Though lasers are often associated with danger ( think Goldfinger ) , their hazard level is related to power , wavelength , and concentration , but primarily to power .
Lasers are classified into four classes ( two of which have sub-classes ) .
These range from " Class I " lasers which are deemed never harmful ( e.g. , laser printers ) , to " Class IV " lasers that can blind , burn , and sometimes cut through steel .
The big dividing line lies between Class IIIa and Class IIIb lasers , with the major criteria being whether or not the laser emits more or less than 5 milliwatts .
Class IIIb and Class IV lasers must be registered in many countries , though a casual Web search suggests it 's pretty easy to buy serious Class IV lasers if one desires .
All off - the - shelf laser pointers are Class IIIa lasers , emitting light from 1 - 5 milliwatts .
The official view is that they cannot burn or damage skin , but can produce " spot blindness " under the right conditions and should have a " danger " label attached .
Spot , or temporary , blindness can indeed be hazardous , for example , while driving a vehicle .
But , contrary to the popular belief , not a single instance of permanent eye damage from laser pointers has been recorded anywhere , according to a report published in the Industrial Safety and Hygiene News in May 2000 .
In addition to spot blindness , laser pointers can get people into other kinds of trouble .
Today , many sports arenas and concert halls ban laser pointers .
Various direct and indirect laws can be used to cite irresponsible use of laser pointers as a misdemeanor .
And since the beam from a laser pointer looks the same as the beam from a laser - sighted firearm , you do n't want to aim your laser pointer at someone carrying a weapon .
In June 2000 , LAPD booked an unarmed juvenile , who aimed a laser pointer at an officer 's torso , for " 602 WIC 417.26 ( c ) P.C. , ( Laser Scope Pointed at a Police Officer ) . "
HISTORY
Art and Activism
Using bright light as an aggressive tool goes back to ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes and the legend that he burned invading Roman ships with large mirrors and reflected sunlight .
The activist art group , Rtmark ( pronounced " arteemark " ) , inspired by the Archimedes legend , distributed 1,000 hand - held mirrors to protesters at the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa , to use against the police by spot blinding them with sunlight .
The proliferation of surveillance cameras has increasingly become a topic of concern in the arts and activist communities .
Rtmark has a Web guide to closed circuit television destruction .
( Though the guide includes laser pointers as a method , it is not recommended , in part because it does n't leave any visible sign of inoperability .
They prefer plastic bags , paint guns , axes , and rocks to make their point . )
Community - made maps showing the locations of surveillance cameras in public spaces are appearing on the Web .
For example , the NYC Surveillance Camera Project has mapped over 2,000 surveillance cameras in Manhattan through a network of volunteers .
The artist / activist group Institute for Applied Autonomy created a web - based application allowing New Yorkers to find walking routes to avoid surveillance cameras .
Other forms of artist activism against surveillance cameras are more light - hearted .
The Surveillance Camera Players , a New York based group , perform unannounced street theater " for the entertainment , amusement and moral edification of the surveilling members of the law enforcement community . "
The SCP organized a protest against surveillance held on September 7 , 2001 , with 22 participating organizations in 6 countries .
Currently the SCP has several satellite groups , including in Italy , Sweden , and Lithuania .
Anti-Surveillance Products
Detecting and stopping cameras turns out to be fundamentally difficult .
Cameras do n't emit anything ( e.g. , the way cellular phones do ) .
With a great deal of surveillance and anti-surveillance products on the Web , virtually none could be found to simply detect and stop cameras .
( Cameras connected to transmitters , perhaps , but cameras alone , no . )
[ October 2002 update : see Laser Dissuader below . ]
A Google search of " anti paparazzi device " yielded two hits , both about near - identical devices called " Eagle Eye " and " Backflash " ( and both unfindable as actual products ) .
These devices apparently couple a light sensor to a flash unit : when a flash of light is detected , the devices instantaneously flash back .
They 're both small , made to be worn , and claim to obscure a portion of the photographic image near them whenever a flash is used ( ostensibly as protection against intruding photographers ) .
If these devices work , they obviously would only work for still , flash photography .
Military
The gold vein of camera zapping material can ( or could ) be found in the military literature .
Indeed , the race to build the first laser ( built in 1960 ) was fueled by DARPA funding .
During the Cold War , both the Pentagon and the Kremlin spent billions of dollars developing high - power laser weapons , which continued during Reagan 's " Star Wars " initiative in the 1980s and continues today .
But as the silicon revolution made lasers smaller and more efficient , the international military community looked into additional opportunities .
Two such opportunities were " antisensor " and " antipersonnel " weapons .
Antisensor lasers are capable of scanning a region looking for " glints " of reflected light coming from lenses aimed at them , then switching to a high energy laser capable of overloading or destroying the sensor ( or whatever ) behind the lens .
The U.S. developed such a system called the Stingray and deployed two tank - based prototypes in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War ( they allegedly were not used ) .
The Stingray 's range of operation is claimed to be several kilometers .
It 's not clear if ( or how ) the Stingray could discriminate between lenses and eyeballs , or between sensors behind a lens and human eyeballs behind a lens .
Antipersonnel lasers are made to " dazzle " ( the technical term for spot - blindness plus its effects , such as disorientation and delay ) .
One such system developed by the U.S. Air Force is the Saber 203 .
It 's designed to fit in the grenade launcher of an M - 16 rifle and emits a beam in - line with the rifle 's scope , with an effective range of 300 meters .
Its 28 milliwatt laser is considerably more powerful than the 5 mw laser pointers , but it is claimed to be below the threshold of eye damage .
The line between antisensor and antipersonnel lasers is vague , since there is nothing preventing a soldier from using a Stingray to permanently blind soldiers in the battlefield .
The Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross led a campaign for a United Nations ban on blinding laser weapons , which was adopted in 1996 .
Some believe this only drove such development further into secrecy .
Rumors persist that Israel acquired U.S. Stingrays after the ban , and that China has been making a cheap version of the Stingray called the ZM - 87 that can blind soldiers 2 miles away and disable soldiers 7 miles away .
At the same time , at least two companies are marketing commercial versions of the laser dazzler developed for the U.S. Military .
The " Laser Dissuader " and the " Laser Dazzler " both claim to be safe , and better alternatives than bullets .
[ October 2002 update : The Laser Dissuader link has changed since last summer to include " SpyFinder , " a new product that appears to detect cameras by aiming a small laser and detecting the retro-reflection from the lens . ]
It remains uncertain whether any 100 % successful antisensor detecting system actually exists .
FIELD TESTS AND PROTOTYPES
First field tests were conducted simply with an inexpensive laser pointer aimed into the lens of a video camera .
At close range ( 1 - 5 meters ) , the beam was easy to aim by hand .
The laser beam almost completely obliterated the image , covering it with a red starburst .
The effect completely disappeared when the laser was aimed away , leaving no trace of any permanent damage .
Inexpensive laser pointer ( 1 mw , 650 nm red )
Laser pointer aimed at video camera from 3 meters away .
This cheap laser pointer emitted an oval - shaped beam ( as is often the case ) that was about 2 mm by 4 mm in diameter at very short distances , and expanded to over 5 cm by 10 cm at 100 meters ( due to cheap collimating optics ) .
In medium and bright light , it was difficult to see with an unaided eye .
The obvious solution was to couple the laser to an optical scope and pre-calibrate them .
Telescopes and binoculars generally do not have cross - hair reticules built in , but rifle scopes do .
Rifle scopes are available at prices upwards of $ 2,000 , but like handguns , most of the market appears targeted at lower - income customers , and cheap rifle scopes can be found for under $ 10 .
All rifle scopes have built - in reticules with some form of cross -hair or dot at the center , which are internally adjustable with set screws .
The only problem is that , unlike telescopes , rifle scopes are made to be viewed with the eye several centimeters from the rear optics , since they are mounted in front of the operator 's face .
( This distance is specified as " eye relief , " and is typically 2 - 5 inches but is never zero . )
A simple prototype system was built with a $ 30 mail order 5 mw red laser ( 635 nm wavelength , which appears much brighter than 670 or 690 nm red ) and a $ 10 rifle scope with a 4X magnification ( Tasco Rimfire , made for small game hunting ) .
The laser and scope were secured together and the cross -hair adjusted to center on the laser beam at 100 meters .

Through the rifle scope , the glint reflected from the lens was indeed apparent , particularly when the camera lens was zoomed in .
It was easy to intermittently hit the lens but difficult to maintain aim by hand .
A second prototype expanded in several directions .
First , it is tripod - based , with a precision head allowing independent adjustment of its 3 axes ( Bogen / Manfrotto " Junior Geared Head , " complete system costs around $ 200 ) .
Then , a larger rifle scope was used for a bigger , brighter image ( Tasco World Class 3 - 9 x zoom , $ 70 ) .
Finally , the cheap laser pointer was replaced with a laser gun sight , which has the same Class IIIa power rating but much better optics , resulting in a more circular and collimated beam ( Beamshot 1001 for $ 110 ) .
These gun sights also have adjustment screws to align the beam , durable metal cases , and many options of mounting hardware .
So , for under $ 400 , a rather serious camera zapper can be assembled .

The system was portable and could be quickly deployed .
Aiming was extremely critical , and at long distances , very careful fine tuning was necessary .
But when the camera was aimed in the direction of the zapper and zoomed in , the glint reflected from the lens was very obvious .
This system can work well for cameras which are visible and stationary .
If either the camera , or target , is moving , then some form of aiming and dynamic tracking is required .
One solution is to do it ourselves .
A third prototype was built to be small and hand - held for near and medium range moving cameras .
Hand - held unit with laser gun sight and golf scope
The result was made with a Beamshot 1001 laser gun sight and a small monocular made for golf range finding ( Tasco Golf Scope , $ 20 ) , basically a small telescope with a grid - like reticule inside .
Unlike a rifle scope , its eye relief distance is zero , which makes it comfortable to use hand - held .
This new system could fit in a pocket and was very easy to use .
It turns out that precise calibration was not necessary , since the beam is easily visible in the scope at near and medium range distances .
If one wanted to scare away a news cameraperson , this system would be ideal .
LIMITATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
It would indeed be a achievement to be able to wear a small device that prevents your image from ever being seen by a camera .
( I once recklessly predicted such a device myself . )
And though it may be possible , it would not be without limitations .
One limitation of using lasers to zap cameras is due to their purity of color , which makes it possible to filter out .
Filtering can be done either optically ( e.g. , using a special green filter to filter a red laser ) or electronically , downstream from the camera sensors .
Neither are perfect solutions , and at best , filtering may provide a recognizable image but without full color .
Original image , zapped , and filtered ( and readjusted by hand ) to show green channel only
Filtering can also be counter - measured .
The best method is to use 3 lasers ( e.g. , red , green , and blue ) .
The next best method is to use a green laser , since most of the signal coming from a color camera sensor is from the green element , the color to which our eyes are most sensitive .
The military solution is to use " wavelength - agile " lasers that can randomly change color , rendering any filtering useless .
Another limitation is how to track a moving camera automatically .
In the long term , this is ( arguably ) solvable using computer vision techniques .
The problem is more solvable if a human operator first constrains the range and an automated system does the fine tuning .
The biggest limitation - and this is where things ultimately get depressing - is detection .
Look out any window and ponder that cameras can be the size of buttons .
Cameras do n't even need lenses ; they can use " pinholes . "
It 's my conclusion that the problem of detecting cameras is ultimately unsolvable : if someone wants to hide a camera , they can hide a camera .
There is good news .
Long , telephoto lenses , whose powers are greater than human vision and therefore of special concern , are detectable .
At least for the foreseeable future , cameras that see far away can also be seen .
So in the end , two applications of camera zapping are immediately possible .
If a camera 's location is known , and can be seen , and is stationary , a tripod / rifle scope / gun sight laser system can successfully zap it , even at distances greater than 100 meters .
If a camera is roving , a golf scope / gun sight laser can intermittently zap it by hand with little effort .
DE - PRESENTATION
The umbrella issue , on top of camera zapping , is perhaps most provocative of all : how does one stop , or at least gain control of , representation of oneself ?
Suppose , for example , you wanted to eliminate every instance of your name that appears in a Google search .
You could , in theory , contact each website and demand they remove your name ( though it 's not clear what , if any , leverage you might have ) .
And of course , it would be naïve to assume that every database with your name in it will be found with a Google search .
One approach is simply to not care about one 's representation .
Another approach is to go through life avoiding cameras , never submitting your name on any form , and only using cash .
( I know of at least two people like this . )
Whatever alternative or optimal approaches may exist , it 's clear that " de- presentation " is as fundamental a force as re-presentation as we approach the brave new world of massive databases and cameras everywhere .
Some new and difficult issues need to be addressed .
Camera zapping may provide a robust metaphor for these deeper issues and help to stimulate and provoke solutions .
Oh , this is rich .
The MPAA 's " University Toolkit , " which is essentially spyware the MPAA asked schools to install on their servers to make sure their students were n't pirating License to Wed when they were supposed to be studying , has been taken down for copyright violation .
Copyright violation !
What a collection of assholes .
The Toolkit is based on the GPL - licensed Xubuntu version of Linux .
Its public license requires that any program written with its code have its source code released and licensed under the GPL , which the MPAA repeatedly refused to do .
So , after repeatedly being ignored by the MPAA , a heroic Ubuntu developer sent a DMCA notice to the MPAAs ISP telling them to take it down .
How 's it feel , MPAA ?
How does it feel ?

Claim : Outdoor temperature can be determined by counting the chirps made by crickets .
Status : True .
Origins : Crickets chirp by rubbing their wings or legs over each other .
Yet it is only the males of the species that make this noise — they do so to attract mates .
Therefore , when you ’re happily listening to the soothing sound of crickets chirping , you ’re actually eavesdropping on a courting ritual meant to warn off other lust - filled male crickets and to draw interested females to the ones doing the
serenading .
The notion that counting the chirps of crickets can serve as an informal way of working out the temperature is not new — in 1897 , physicist Amos Dolbear proposed the reverse of that idea , stating outdoor temperature determined the number of cricket calls one would hear .
Over the years , his way of looking at this relationship was turned around — people now count the chirps to get the temp rather than consult the thermometer to figure out how many cricket calls they will hear .
We ’ve encountered a variety of “ cricket chirp thermometer formulas ” over the years .
One specifies counting the chirps over a 40 - second interval , then adding 38 to that number to achieve the current temperature .
Another says it ’s chirps over 14 seconds then add 38 .
Yet a third says it ’s number of chirps heard in 15 seconds then add 48 .
The formula endorsed by The Old Farmer ’s Almanac seems the most reliable .
Says that esteemed tome :
To convert cricket chirps to degrees Fahrenheit , count number of chirps in 14 seconds then add 40 to get temperature .
To convert cricket chirps to degrees Fahrenheit , count number of chirps inthen add 40 to get temperature .
Example : 30 chirps + 40 = 70° F
To convert cricket chirps to degrees Celsius , count number of chirps in 25 seconds , divide by 3 , then add 4 to get temperature .
Example : 48 chirps ÷ 3 + 4 = 20° C
Dr. Peggy LeMone of The GLOBE Program ( a science education program funded by NASA , NOAA , NSF , and others ) studied the theory during the summer of 2007 at her home in Boulder , Colorado , and posted her findings to her blog on 5 October 2007 .
Greatly simplifying her research , she found that when she counted the chirps during a 15 second span and then added 37 to that number , the resultant figure did closely approximate the actual air temperature ( Graph 1 ) .
However , when she slightly adjusted the formula by recording chirp counts at 13 second intervals , then adding 40 , the results even more closely adhered to the actual air temperature ( Graph 2 ) .
Her findings ( chirps in 13 seconds plus 40 ) confirms The Old Farmer ’s Almanac ’s wisdom ( chirps in 14 seconds plus 40 ) .
Now , granted , this mode of determining the temperature will work only when there are crickets about .
Also , it ’s accurate only down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit or so , because at lower temperatures crickets either are n’t about or are n’t in the mood for love .

Most lenders use FICO ( Fair Isaac Corporation , they developed the FICO , a measure of credit risk , that are the most used credit users in the world ) credit scores to get an objective measure of your creditworthiness .
By understanding the factors that affect your score , you ’ll get an in depth understanding of how creditors view your credit application and how you can bump up your credit standing .
1. Payment history
The factor that has the biggest impact on your score is whether you have paid off the past credit accounts on time or not .
It counts for approximately 35 % of your score .
It should be noted that the recent late payments or missed payments hurt your score more .
It will be reflected on your report whether you are 30 , 60 , or 90 days or more late with a bill payment .
A record of late or missed payments on several accounts will hamper your score more than late payments on a single account .
So , pay off your bills on time , it will definitely have a positive impact on your overall score .
2. Amount owed
It counts for approximately 30 % of your total FICO score .
It shows how well you can manage your credit .
However , it is not just the amount you owe already that influences your FICO score .
Also taken into consideration is the amount of credit available to you .
So , total up all the outstanding balances you have and compare it with the amount of credit that is available to you .
If you are reaching or exceeding the available credit then it will negatively impact your score .
Read
3. Length of credit history
The third factor that makes up 15 % of your total FICO score is the duration of your credit history .
The longer your credit history , you will be considered more creditworthy by the creditors .
Also taken into consideration is how long it has been since you used the credit accounts .
For instance having an idle card for 15 years wo n’t bump your score .
Also remember not to open multiple accounts at once to build a credit history .
4. Types of credit
Another vital factor that influences your score is the type of credit mix that you have .
Your score will reflect your mix of retail accounts , credit cards , and installment loans like car loans and home loans .
Consumers who have a healthy mix of credit have a higher FICO score .
5. Number of new credit applications
The fifth factor that influences your FICO score is the total number of recent credit applications that you fill out .
For instance , if you have recently made multiple credit inquiries then it will negatively influence your score because it will suggest to the creditors that you are financially burdened and might be late on your payments .
There are other factors like employment , salary , duration of stay at current residence , and marital status that lenders look into .
However , these factors do not affect your FICO score .
It 's a good week for black hole news , even if it 's been a little like reading off an interstellar rap sheet .
The first finding of note concerns a star that seems to be cruising at high speeds away from the Milky Way galaxy .
Given the apparent age of the star , researchers have previously been puzzled as to where exactly it could have come from .
Now scientists at the Carnegie Institution for Science say the star , which is moving at the " hyperfast " speed of 1.6 million miles per hour , must have come from Large Magellanic Cloud , a Milky Way neighbor .
Based on the star 's rotation , the researchers say it was likely part of a binary star system , in which one member of the pair was swallowed by a black hole .
This luckier twin was shot into intergalactic space with incredible velocity .
" This is the first observational clue that a massive black hole exists somewhere in the LMC .
We look forward to finding out where this black hole might be , " concluded ( Carnegie astronomer Alceste ) Bonanos .
The second bit of news comes from supercomputing modeling done by researchers at the University of California at Santa Cruz , Jacobs
University in Germany , and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
They 're working with the idea of mid-sized black holes – bigger than those created by the collapse of a single ordinary - sized star , but smaller than the monsters at the center of galaxies – the existence of which remains a matter of speculation .
The team modeled what would happen if a common white dwarf star wandered near one of these medium - sized black holes .
White dwarfs commonly flare up into supernovas when they are able to suck gas from a companion star , but the team found that the presence of a nearby black hole could also reignite the star .
This kind of eruption should have a specific X - ray signature detectable by the Chandra X - ray Observatory , and may help prove the existence of the mid-sized black holes , the researchers say .

More Workers Finding Pink Slips In Their In - Box
Who 's using e-mail to notify workers of layoffs and firings ?
A Harris Interactive survey finds it tends to be firms with 1,000 or more employees .
If you thought getting annoying spam in your in - box was bad , that 's nothing compared to the e-mail some other people get .
How would you like to click on a message and see a pink slip ?
Yes , it 's true .
Hitting new levels of tackiness , some employers use e-mail to layoff and fire workers , according to a new survey conducted by Harris Interactive for Marlin Company , a workplace communications firm .
Of the 752 American workers surveyed , 10 % said their companies have used E - mail to fire or layoff employees .
E-mail is also a tool favored by some employers to deal with other uncomfortable work situations , as well .
Seventeen percent of the survey respondents said their bosses have used e-mail to avoid other difficult face - to - face situations .
So , who 's using e-mail to swing the hatchet ?
It tends to be larger employers with 1,000 or more workers , rather than smaller companies , although they too are occasionally guilty of using electronic copouts .
In fact , last summer RadioShack sent e-mail messages to 400 workers informing them that their positions had been eliminated as part of a workforce reduction .
People in professional management roles were the most likely survey respondents to say their companies have used e-mail for firing and layoffs , followed by clerical and services workers .
Companies that do use e-mail to notify employees that they 've been laid off or fired " do it because it 's easy , " said Frank Kenna , president and CEO of Marlin .
" It 's not the right way to handle it , " he said , especially for situations where a worker is being fired .
As a boss firing via e-mail , " you do n't get the feedback you should be getting " from the axed worker , Kenna said .
With a face - to - face firing , " you might hear things you do n't want to hear , but should " as a boss , he said .
Also , employees who see their co-workers being fired by e-mail are also getting a bad message , he said .
Kenna said he expects that more companies will set policies against using e-mail for layoffs and firings .
It 's not only bosses that are prone to e-mail faux pas .
Indeed , the survey found that one - in - five respondents admitted to sending an e-mail to the wrong person , while nearly 40 % said they 've forgotten to e-mail intended attachments .
Also , 15 % said they 've been the recipients of e-mail sent in anger , while 23 % have received e-mail they consider politically incorrect .
Thirteen percent said they 've gotten flirtatious e-mail and 5 % said they 've received humiliating messages that were copied to others .

I think we are in rats ' alley
Where the dead men lost their bones
� Eliot
We wrote recently here of Bush 's new executive order granting himself and his minions the arbitrary power to seize the entire assets of any American citizen � without warning , without any criminal charges whatsoever � solely by declaring that their victim somehow poses an unspecified threat to " the peace or stability of Iraq " or else is " undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq . "
In other words , Bush now claims the power to strip you of your assets if you oppose American policy in Iraq .
This latest tyrannical outburst from the Outrager - in - Chief has passed largely without notice .
Even some of the Administration 's fiercest critics have downplayed its significance .
The always - admirable Dave Neiwert at Orcinus has been among the skeptics , on the reasonable grounds that right - wing militia groups were forever reading vast conspiracies into ordinary government decrees in the 1990s , and that one should wait for more informed legal analyses before leaping to scarifying conclusions .
Fair enough � although Dave himself has done as much as anyone out there in detailing the extremism of the Bush Regime and its supporters .
To his credit , Dave has kept an open mind on the question , and co-blogger at Orcinus , Sara Robinson , has taken a far darker view of the executive order .
Now Dave has featured a long � and highly disturbing � piece of informed legal analysis of the order from one of his regular commenters , attorney Den Valdron .
who draws out the very dangerous implications of the order 's wording in convincing detail .
Perhaps most disturbing is Valdron 's insight that the executive order does n't even have to be formally invoked in order to have a chilling effect on political dissent .
Just its mere existence � and the ever - present threat of social and legal obliteration that it represents � will be enough to quell all but the hardiest opponents of the Leader 's criminal rampage in Iraq .
You should scoot on ever to Orcinus and read " That Executive Order " in full , but below is an excerpt about the " chill factor " that Valdron identifies :
Essentially , in this Executive Order the President is assuming unbelievably vast powers to simply sidestep normal criminal or civil procedure , and to operate quite explicitly on the basis of guilt by anticipation , guilt by pre-emption , guilt by association and guilt for any reason in the mind of the decider .
There is literally no limitation on authority , except that the person 's actual physical being is unaffected .
However , a person so designated by this Order could be rendered into a non-person literally instantaneously .
They could be stripped of every asset , have every financial or commercial opportunity denied to them .
Worse , this literally creates a power to shun .
Anyone who employs this person , who hires them , who pays them for work , lends them money to tide them over , who rents them an apartment , or allows them to sleep on the couch , who drops them a few coins as they panhandle would be liable to becoming subject to this order .
The only protection would be to fire this person , to not hire them , to not pay them , to not lend them money , evict them from your apartment , kick them off the couch , and look away if you see them begging on the street .
If the potential implications of this make you think of Jews in Nazi Germany , think again .
The Jews pre-war had it good compared to the potential of this .
The most disturbing thing is that this Executive Order need not be actually used .
Consider it as a weapon of intimidation .
Most Americans are not rich .
Most people live in apartments , they may have a house that the bank owns , they may have a car they 're making payments on , they struggle with credit card debt , live paycheque to paycheque .
We all live in these little islands of stability that can be so easy to disrupt .
So imagine that you are a dedicated , committed , politically active person .
You 're donating to the Green Party , perhaps active in local politics , going to demonstrations ... Then one day , a person from the treasury department comes to visit .
He shows you this executive order , and he tells you that you have been identified by your actions and associations as being a ' significant risk to commit acts of violence . '
He says that by their lights , you may already be deemed to have committed acts of violence .
He tells you that it has been concluded that these acts of violence undermine the Iraqi government and the reconstruction campaign ...
You protest of course .
He says it does n't matter , these are the findings of the Secretary of the Treasury under the executive order .
You challenge him to prove what act of violence they think you are about to commit .
He replies that there 's no particular act , only that you 're a ' significant risk . '
Then he tells you , in very clear terms , what they can do .
That they can and will take your house .
That they can and will take your car and your bank account .
That you will be fired from your job .
That you will find it impossible to get another job , or find another place to live .
That anyone who helps you will be similarly punished , so no one will help you .
He tells you that if this is n't enough , they are prepared to take the same tactic against your parents , your children , your girlfriend , your friends , based on their association with you making them a ' significant risk of committing violence ' or of ' providing support to you . '
He asks you if you are prepared to see your life erased ?
Are you really that brave ?
Do you really want to lose your job , your home , your nest , your savings , your income , your retirement ...
And if you are that brave , are you really prepared to see this done to your girlfriend , your parents , whoever is close to you ...
You could take it to court and fight it , of course .
All you need is a lawyer that will work for free , because you wo n't be able to pay him .
And he 'll have to be a lawyer willing to risk winding up in the same situation you 'll be in �Fighting it will take two or three years .
That 's a long time to spend eating out of dumpsters and sleeping on heating grates .
It 's possible of course , that you 'll win and be vindicated .
Or you could lose .
Are you feeling lucky ?
So most people in that situation , what would they do ?
They 'll just shut their mouths , stop making waves , they 'll do their jobs , collect their paycheques and mind their own business .
They 'll stay out of trouble .
But sometimes , when they see the Sheriff driving down the street to evict someone , when there 's a hiccup in their credit card , when they get a call from the bank , or a call into their boss 's office ... well , they 'll get a cold sweat running down their backs , and their stomach will flutter , and they 'll search their memories for anything that they might have done wrong , maybe said the wrong thing to the wrong person , had the wrong friend , went to the wrong place ...
And of course , most times , it 'll turn out to be nothing .
They 'll recover from the scare , their life will go on .
But the fear will remain somewhere , and the cold sweat , and the only choice they have will be to be good little citizens .
This is the dystopian thug - state that the Bush Administration is building before our eyes � often in broad daylight , with little or no pretense of masking their lust , their obsession , with authoritarian power .
Yet every institution in American civic life that might act as a bulwark against these tyrannical encroachments seems completely paralyzed � or else thoroughly complicit in this monstrous mutation .
Bush and his cronies are effecting a wholesale revolution in the American state , despite being one of the most discredited and widely despised administrations in the country 's history .
It 's like a long and vivid nightmare , where you watch some hideous , filth - encrusted beast gnawing your child to pieces , in agonizing slow motion , while you stand mysteriously frozen on the spot , unable to move or scream .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore said on Sunday he was optimistic that a growing “ people - power ” movement would push the world ’s leaders to take action to stop global warming .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The former U.S. vice president likened the campaign to the ban - the - bomb movement of past decades , and urged leaders at a U.N. climate conference in Bali , Indonesia , to issue a mandate for a strong treaty to curb greenhouse gases .
Gore , who shared the 2007 peace prize with the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for raising awareness and advancing climate science , will receive the prize in Oslo on Monday with the IPCC ’s chairman Rajendra Pachauri .
The prize was announced in October .
“ I have one reason for being optimistic , and that is that I see throughout my own country , the United States of America , and throughout the world the rising of the world ’s first people - power movement on a global basis , ” he said .
Gore pointed to an international grassroots nuclear - freeze movement which helped push U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to sign arms controls deals in the late 1980s , and said the climate campaign was even broader .
Gore and Pachauri will travel from Oslo to Bali where governments are meeting to try to launch negotiations towards an environmental treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 .
“ It is my great hope that the meeting in Bali will result in a strong mandate empowering the world to move forward quickly to a meaningful treaty , ” Gore said .
CIVILISATION THREAT
Gore , whose Oscar - winning documentary “ An Inconvenient Truth ” called for immediate action on the environment , urged for curbs on carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for global warming .
“ The engines of our great global civilization are now pouring 70 million tons of global warming pollution into ( the atmosphere ) every single day .
It is having the consequences long predicted by the scientific community , ” he said .
“ It is now abundantly clear that we cannot continue this process , ” he said .
Pachauri , seated next to Gore at Oslo ’s Nobel Institute under ceilings adorned with white peace doves , urged world leaders to consider tough steps to tackle global warming .
“ If we were to carry out this stringent mitigation , one of the scenarios that we have assessed clearly shows that we have a window of nearly seven years , ” Pachauri said .
“ That means by 2015 we will have to see that emissions of greenhouse gases peak no later than that year and start declining thereafter . ”
“ The time for doubting the science is over .
What we need now is action , ” said Pachauri , an Indian who is head of a body of around 2,500 climate scientists from more than 130 nations .
Referring to U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and said “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere , ” Gore said : “ In the same way , CO2 increases anywhere are a threat to the future of civilization everywhere . ”

After a congressional committee requested a copy of an unclassified internal State Department report on corruption in the Iraqi government ( pdf ) , the Department classified the report and declined to provide it .
But the document is in the public domain and widely accessible .
“ The State Department initially informed Committee staff that the reports were designated ‘ sensitive but unclassified ’ , ’ wrote Rep. Henry Waxman , chair of the House Oversight Committee , in a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ( pdf ) .
“ After receiving the Committee ’s inquiry , however , the State Department retroactively classified the documents and refused to provide them voluntarily to the Committee . ”
“ The Committee subpoenaed the documents last week , but they still have not been provided to the Committee in either classified or unclassified form , ” Mr. Waxman complained .
The primary document at issue is an assessment of Iraqi corruption that was prepared by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .
The document was first reported in The Nation magazine last month , and it was published last week on the Federation of American Scientists web site .
“ Obviously , the State Department ’s position on this matter is ludicrous , ” wrote Rep. Waxman .
“ If there is widespread corruption within the Maliki government , this is information that both Congress and the public are entitled to know . ”
But according to State Department officials , “ any information about corruption within the Maliki government must be treated as classified because public discussions could undermine U.S. relations with the Maliki government . ”
Pelosi greeted with “ Impeach ” Bush and Cheney buttons
January 18th , 2008 , filed by Thomas Ferraro – Reuters
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she ’s drawing heat from fellow Democratic lawmakers as well as people across the nation for refusing to move to impeach President George W. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ I go through airports , and people have buttons as if they knew I was coming , ” Pelosi said with a smile , mimicking a protester pointing to an “ Impeach ” button on their chest .
But the California Democrat said she is sticking to her position that trying to remove Bush or Cheney would be divisive , and she added , most likely unsuccessful .
If the House voted to impeach Bush and Cheney , a two - thirds vote would be needed in the closely divided Senate to oust them .
Many Democrats and civil liberties groups have accused the Bush administration of misleading the United States into the Iraq war and violating the rights of U.S. citizens with its warrantless surveillance program .
The White House denies the charges .

Last week , I wrote
a controversial article about resume tips that got a lot of readers fired up .
As a result , I thought it would be worthwhile to go through the entire process of creating a strong resume , step by step .
Step 0 : Do NOT fire up Microsoft Word and use a generic resume template .
Absolutely , positively , do NOT do this , no matter what .
Microsoft
Word is a powerful program , but just firing it up and opening up one of the included resume templates does one thing and one thing alone – make your resume look like everyone else ’s .
You want your resume to look unique and memorable , but classy – Word ’s default templates will not cut the mustard .
Step 1 : Open a plain text document and start listing all of the information you might ever include on a resume
List the details of every job , including every possible relevant accomplishment at each one .
List every organized activity you ’ve ever participated in , and every noteworthy honor you ’ve received in your life .
List everything .
Tip # 1 : If you do n’t know where to start , include the following in this order :
Work experience ( dates , names of employers , location , tasks , accomplishments )
Education ( dates , degrees obtained , location )
Specific skills
Honors and awards
Other activities of note ( professional organizations , special skills , etc. )
This is essentially your “ default resume . ”
You ’re never going to send it to anyone .
Instead , you ’re going to use it to quickly build the real resumes that you will send to potential employers .
Step 2 : Read and research the job you ’re interested in applying for
Once you ’ve found a job that you ’re actually interested in applying for , do a few minutes ’ worth of research .
Find out as much as you can quickly about the job itself and the employer .
If you do n’t understand fully what you ’re applying for and who your employer is going to be , you ’re essentially tossing things at the wall and hoping it will stick .
Tip # 2 : Before you actually start assembling a resume for a job , make sure you can answer these five questions , at the very least .
What is the likely primary function of the job ?
What are you being hired to do ?
This is n’t your job title , but what you will actually be doing .
What is the organization that I ’m applying to ?
Sure , you know the name of the organization , but what is that organization ’s function ?
Do they produce certain products ?
Do they provide certain services ?
What is the reputation of this organization ?
Applying to Google and to “ Joe ’s Desperate Search Engine ” are two completely different things , even though the jobs may appear very similar on paper .
Joe is probably seeking a programmer with very specific skills , while Google is looking for people who exhibit exceptional problem solving skills .
What is my role within this organization ?
If you accept this job , what will your role be ?
Will you be working on developing the product directly , or will you be providing services to the public ?
Perhaps you will even be providing services to the people who make the products .
What skills and attributes point to success with this specific organization in the role I ’m going to fill ?
Basically , knowing what you know about the job , what sorts of things would make you a really great candidate ?
Step 3 : Open a new copy of your default resume and eliminate everything that is n’t highly relevant or impressive
Now that you know what you ’re applying for , you should know the skills and attributes that position would need .
Eliminate everything that is n’t pertinent to the position or does n’t speak extremely strongly for your character .
If you ’re applying for a job as an administrative assistant , your position as a typist is probably very relevant – but if you ’re seeking work as a manager of a department store , it basically just fills out your work history .
Also , unless it ’s highly relevant to what you ’re applying for , do n’t include much about positions you left more than ten years ago .
Tip # 3 : If you ’re early in your career , you may wish to list some jobs that do n’t match the description very well to establish a work history .
That ’s fine , but go minimal on describing them .
What you have now is the information you want to put on the resume .
Now , let ’s polish it up a bit .
Step 4 : Make your accomplishments ring with action
Now it ’s time to polish up the statements about what you ’ve done , focusing on two things : language that indicates that you ’ve performed an action , and selection and modification of these statements to appeal to the organization .
First , go through and change all of the descriptions of your work tasks into action sentences .
Let ’s work through three examples of this .
Bad job attribute : Participated in the development of a data entry program
Better job attribute : Developed a high - throughput data entry program in a team - based environment
Bad job attribute : Chaired three committees
Better job attribute :
Led the creation of new company - wide policies
Bad job attribute : Introduced a new filing system and helped set it up
Better job attribute : Implemented a new document organization system
In each case , the move was towards verbs that indicate more decisive action that led to a desired result .
Employers want actions that lead to results , not participation .
Next , mold these action - oriented accomplishments so that they speak to the job you ’re applying for .
Let ’s look at that data entry program developer .
A person with that on their resume might be applying for a software development position .
In that case , one might want to highlight the code - based accomplishment :
Great job attribute : Wrote 22,000 lines of Java for a data - handling class for a high - throughput data - entry tool
On the other hand , if you ’re looking for a leadership job , you may want something like this :
Great job attribute :
Led a team of seven to develop a high - throughput data entry program
In the end , you want to highlight those parts of the tasks you have done that will make you seem most exciting to the potential employer .
Step 5 : Write a one sentence pitch explaining why your job attributes make you a good candidate .
Your resume should not have an objective on it .
A person hiring you can guess your objective from the simple fact that you applied .
Instead , you should have a statement explaining how your specific skills make you the right person for the job .
Here ’s a good example .
I have nine years experience developing high - throughput Java - based data entry software and leading teams in the implementation of this software .
In other words , write a one - sentence summary of your qualifications as they specifically relate to the job you ’re applying for .
This will go right at the top of the resume .
Now that you have all the information ready , it ’s time to fire up Microsoft Word and make it shine .
Step 6 : Make a polished document out of the material you ’ve created
There are several useful tutorials for just this task .
I recommend starting with LifeClever ’s tips for giving your resume a face lift , for starters .
I strongly recommend using Georgia as your font , as it is fairly distinctive while still quite legible in print , and I also recommend making your line spacing 120 % ( go to Format , choose Paragraph , choose Multiple , and set it to 1.2 ) .
I also recommend putting things in the following order :
Name / address/phone/email
Summary of Qualifications
Work Experience ( unless this is your first “ real ” job )
Professional Organizations ( unless these are slim , the eliminate or move to end )
Honors ( unless these are slim , then eliminate or move to end )
Education
A note indicating that references are available upon request
Ideally , you want this to be as short as possible .
One page , with an additional cover letter , is best .
If you feel the need to include more stuff , feel free , but every time you add something more to the resume , you provide more and more cover for your truly excellent attributes to hide in a sea of merely good attributes .
One strong approach is to create a short resume and a long resume , and include a short URL ( made at TinyURL ) to download the longer one if interested .
I generally encourage people to include reference contact information in their long resume , but not in the short one .
One last thing …
Remember , always , that you ’re trying to sell yourself to the company .
Think of yourself as a product on the shelf , next to many competitors .
How are you going to grab their attention in a positive way , show off your best attributes , and make them at least consider buying you ( i.e. , interview you ) ?
Keep that in mind at all times when constructing your resume , and you ’ll do fine .
The Wikimedia Foundation is in the midst of a two - month long fundraiser , running from October 22 to December 22 .
Direct fundraising from the online community provides the vast majority ( 96 % ) of Wikimedia ’s support .
Given Wikipedia ’s profound reach , it ’s not an inexpensive project to run – the budget for Wikimedia for 2007 - 8 is $ 4.6 million , with approximately $ 2.6 million going towards the servers and bandwidth neccesary to keep the project running .
( Some quick disclaimers , before we get into the meat of this post .
I ’m on the Advisory Board of the Wikimedia Foundation , and am on the mailing list of the Fundraising committee , though I ’ve been a very quiet participant , as I know a lot about fundraising from foundations and basically nothing about direct donations .
That said , there are no secrets in this post – I ’m linking to publicly available statistics .
And yes , I ’ve made a donation to the Wikimedia campaign , and you should too . )
In the past 17 days , the Foundation has raised over $ 478,000 in online gifts .
That ’s a pretty amazing number , on the one hand , and a concerning one , on the other hand .
If Global Voices could raise that much money online in a month , I ’d be out of a job , as our annual budget is not much higher than that sum , and I spend far too much of my time convincing generous individuals , corporations and foundations to support our efforts .
On the other hand , it ’s significantly less money than my local public radio station raised in its last fundraising drive : $ 801,000 .
Those drives are less than a week long , and there are three a year , raising a large percentage of the station ’s annual income .
Wikipedia reports the station ’s listenerbase at 400,000 – 5,874 ( 1.4 % ) of those listeners gave $ 136 each on average in the most recent drive alone .
What ’s Wikimedia ’s audience ?
Alexa estimates that between 8 and 9 % of all Internet users access Wikipedia.org the site in the course of a single day .
Let ’s ignore the vast majority of the internet and focus on the 212 million US internet users , most of whom have credit cards and many of whom have disposeable income .
If 1.4 % of them contributed to Wikimedia , that would be 2.96 million supporters of the project .
If they were as generous as WAMC listeners , that would be over $ 400 million .
If they gave the amount the average Wikimedia donor gives – $ 28.03 – we ’re talking about $ 83.2 million .
If it ’s true that 9 % of the world ’s internet users visit Wikipedia in a day ( and it ’s probably not , as Alexa ’s figures are based on extrapolation from a fairly small sample set which is n’t perfectly geographically distributed ) , that ’s roughly 112 million visitors , 99.999983 % of whom do n’t donate .
( Still have n’t donated ?
Assuage your guilt here . )
Some of the people who do n’t donate probably can’t , either because they lack the funds or because they lack the credit card or checking account to make the gift .
But some very large number of people is choosing not to support the project despite visiting the site .
Why ?
One possibility is that internet users are cheap .
This seems to be the conclusion that many commentators are drawing from Radiohead ’s experiment with allowing fans to choose the price they ’d like to pay for the band ’s latest opus .
38 % paid between $ 0.01 and over $ 200 for the ten mp3s , while 62 % chose to pay nothing at all .
The average price paid was $ 6 , significantly below what a conventional CD would cost …
Other artists have had better luck with downloadable albums with adjustable pricing – avant - folk artist Jane Siberry has offered music from her website for the last couple of years , suggesting prices per track , but inviting users to pay more , less or accept the track as “ a gift from the artist ” .
Only 19 % of her listeners chose this option – 79 % of those who paid gave the asking price , and 15 % chose to pay more than the asking price .
One possible explanation for the difference in Siberry and Radiohead ’s experiences is that one prompted a price , while the other did n’t .
The average price paid for Radiohead ’s album may reflect what people think a CD should cost , even if the music industry would like it to be three times as much – perhaps paying $ 6 is a type of protest , asking for fairer pricing in music .
Another possibility is that a lot more people heard about Radiohead ’s policy than about Siberry ’s and visited their site to find free music .
Users coming to Siberry ’s site are already fans and might be more likely to pay than listeners who do n’t know Radiohead but know they can get a new album for free .
Looking Wikimedia ’s fundraising from two years ago suggests that there might be something to this theory .
Two years ago , Wikimedia raised almost $ 400,000 in 21 days … pretty close to the results the current fund drive is having , despite the fact that Wikipedia ’s reach is vastly larger now than it was then .
( Alexa suggests that roughly 2 % of a slightly smaller internet visited Wikipedia by the end of 2005 .
With 1.01 billion net users in December 2005 and 2 % daily share , that ’s 20.2 million visitors , versus 112 million . )
It ’s possible that Wikimedia is supported by a small core of users who donate to support the site , and that expanding the userbase of a site wo n’t necessarily expand the donor base .
This should n’t be a major problem for ad supported sites .
As a site gets more traffic , it shows more ad banners and , one presumes , gets more clicks and therefore more revenue .
But Wikimedia does n’t sell advertising .
As more people use the resource , bandwidth and server bills go up , and free riders become a real problem .
When public radio stations in the US run fund drives , they spend a good deal of their airtime reminding listeners of their economic model .
Despite the name “ public radio ” , most of a station ’s funding comes from listener giving and local underwriting – part of getting listeners to give is reminding ( haranguing , nagging ) them of their responsibility to the station to ensure its continued survival .
The internet , on the other hand , appears to be moving inexorably towards a model where everything is free and ad supported .
My friend danah boyd , talking about teens use of social networking software , noted that most users are apparently not turned off by ads on MySpace or Facebook .
On the contrary , they assume “ If it ’s got ads on it , it will be free forever ! ”
In a world where nearly everything is free due to ad support , it ’s quite likely that a casual user may not know that Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects are supported almost exclusively by user donation , and a banner on top of pages may not be sufficient to challenge the paradigm that everything on the internet is free .
In fact , charitable giving is now free as well .
Sort of .
A new site called FreeRice is generating a lot of attention from web users and has been growing quickly .
The site invites you to participate in a multiple - choice vocabulary quiz and awards you ten grains of rice for each word you get correct .
The rice is given to the World Food Programme , which gives it to people in need .
You do n’t pay with anything but your attention – the money for the rice is given by the advertisers whose banners feature on each page of the site .
FreeRice claims 73,566,480 grains of rice donated so far today … which sounds like a lot , until you realize that there are between 35,000 and 50,000 grains of rice in a kilogram .
1471 kilograms of rice donated in a day does n’t sound like nearly as much .
Especially when you discover that prevailing world prices for rice run at about $ 12 a hundredweight , or 45.5 kilos .
73 million grains might run about $ 387 .
To donate 73 million grains of rice , FreeRice is serving roughly 10 million pages ( 10 grains for a successful answer , and some percentage of answers are going to be incorrect ) , most with three ads on them .
perigee on LiveJournal takes a crack at estimating revenue from FreeRice and argues that the site profits between $ 4.44 and $ 17.99 for every 150 page impressions .
I think his estimates are hugely optimistic in terms of what ads sell for these days – he suggests a cost per 1000 ads ( CPM ) of between $ 10 and $ 40 .
We rarely were able to sell ads for that much in the good old days ( 1998 ) , and now advertisers have wised up and are only paying for clicks on ads .
If 100 page impressions equals 1000 grains of rice ( I ’m good at vocabulary ) , that ’s about half a cent donated to the World Food Programme .
If I click on one ad , I might make somewhere between five and twenty cents for the site administrator .
Did I mention that FreeRice.com is n’t a charity ?
It ’s the latest project of John Breen , the programmer who created The Hunger Site , a for - profit company that encouraged visitors to click on a button on the site to donate food to charity – it too is ad supported .
The Hunger Site is no longer run by Breen , but by CharityUSA , a for - profit company that runs over a dozen “ click to give ” sites .
There ’s nothing wrong with running for - profit websites , and certainly nothing wrong with for - profit companies giving to charity .
But FreeRice is far from transparent about what percentage of its money gets given to charity and what percent supports its operation , or is revenue for the site ’s creator – perigee has asked Mr. Breen to go on the record on these issues .
My point is n’t to trash FreeRice or the people who feel good about giving to it , though I certainly think there are better models for projects like this one .
It certainly would n’t be hard for FreeRice to include links to stories about hunger and food security if their concern is getting people to understand more about the issue .
Or as Hannah Farber at jspot points out , they could just urge people to give real money directly to charities that work on these issues .
No , what interests me about FreeRice is the reinforcement it gives to Internet users that their attention is a valuable currency .
In an economy where all anyone wants is a moment of your attention , it ’s possible for many things to be free , so long as they ’re sufficiently popular , and so long as their creators are comfortable monetizing them by being willing to share their attention with an advertiser .
Wikimedia , god bless them , is n’t playing the game , and they may find themselves in an increasingly difficult spot as they reach more and more users who do n’t understand that they ’re supposed to help pay for the content , not just use it .
My friend Chad Orzel has a useful reaction to this post over at his excellent blog , Uncertain Principles .
Only a few days left to Double your gift
With growing numbers of scientists declaring that the global climate crisis is approaching a point of no return , there is a huge and bewildering disconnect between our physical world and our political environment .
Our government ’s response to the prospect of runaway climate impacts is one of paralysis .
The negligence of the Bush administration is understandable .
The White House has become the East Coast branch office of ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy .
The fossil - fuel lobby is essentially writing the administration ’s climate and energy policies .
As a result , climate change has become the preeminent case study of the contamination of our political system by money .
This is not political conservatism .
This is corruption disguised as conservatism .
The case of Congress , however , seems a bit different .
The inaction of Congress in the face of a civilization - shattering threat seems less like corruption and more like simple , old - fashioned , bipartisan cowardice .
Several Republican senators and representatives are offering puny efforts to address the climate crisis — all of them lame given the urgency and magnitude of the challenge .
Congressional Democrats , given their widespread support for the Iraq war and the War on Terror , should be using climate change as a key issue to distinguish themselves from their Republican counterparts .
But their equally ineffective approaches testify to the failure of our political system to effectively engage nature ’s challenge .
Even those congressional Democrats who acknowledge the threat seem petrified by the prospect of any meaningful action .
For starters , virtually all their proposals center on market - based “ cap and trade ” mechanisms , which are dismally inadequate in the face of the problem .
We can not trade our way to deep cuts in our emissions .
Carbon trading is most useful as a fine - tuning instrument — to help countries achieve the last 10 or 15 percent of their obligations .
It is not the workhorse vehicle to propel a 70 percent energy transition .
We cannot finesse nature with accounting tricks .
What is missing from all of their deliberations is the sense of desperation and helplessness shared by all of us who are shaken by each new terrifying report about our increasingly unstable climate .
One group is trying to shake Congress out of its lethargy .
The Climate Crisis Coalition is launching a drive called ClimateUSA to put the issue of global climate change squarely on the agenda of the November elections .
The goal : to get as many congressional incumbents and challengers as possible to take a visible public position on the issue .
The group is drawing on the volunteer energy of the more than 40,000 people who have signed a web - based People ’s Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
Those volunteers will present candidates in a number of key districts with the group ’s platform .
The candidates , in turn , will be asked either to endorse that platform or to put forth their own positions on the climate issue .
The group ’s three - part platform calls for :
The withdrawal of federal subsidies for coal , oil , and natural - gas development — as well as the withdrawal of some subsidies for carbon - intensive agriculture — and the establishment of subsidies to jump - start a renewable - energy economy based on wind , solar , tidal power , biomass , small - scale hydropower , and other sustainable energy and agricultural technologies .
The ratification by Congress of the Kyoto Protocol and the formulation of a post - Kyoto framework that would result in a rapid worldwide transition away from fossil fuels to clean - energy technologies .
The enactment , as a preliminary step , of the non-nuclear version of the McCain - Lieberman Climate Stewardship
Act to begin reducing carbon - dioxide emissions .
As the positions of both incumbents and challengers are collected , they will be posted on the ClimateUSA website so voters will know where candidates stand .
This is , at best , a very small step toward the very large goal of preserving a hospitable planet .
It is understandable that ExxonMobil , Peabody , and their allies — both in and out of Washington — are deploying immense resources to fight off a clean - energy transition .
After all , such a transition threatens the survival of their multibillion - dollar industries .
It is much less understandable why our elected representatives are willing allies in a process that will soon drag the rest of us straight to the bottom of climate hell .
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) --
Workers found vials believed to contain the poison gas phosgene at a U.N. office building in New York , U.N. officials said Thursday .
U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe said U.N. chemical weapons experts quickly secured the toxic material .
U.N. archivists for UNMOVIC , the U.N. chemical weapons agency , unexpectedly turned up samples of material from an Iraqi chemical weapons plant in old files on Friday , U.N. officials said .
The samples were in weapons inspectors ' files dating back to the 1990s , but the substance is not believed to pose any immediate danger , the officials said .
The building where the samples turned up is several blocks away from main U.N. Secretariat building along New York 's East River .
Tests found no toxic vapors in the offices , U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe said .
Watch how the chemical scare unfolded »
Phosgene is an industrial chemical used to make plastics and pesticides , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
At room temperature , it is a poisonous gas , but can be stored and shipped under cooling and pressure .
Phosgene was used extensively during World War I as a choking agent and caused a majority of the war 's gas deaths , according to the CDC .
Phosgene gas and liquid are irritants that can damage the skin , eyes , nose , throat and lungs , the CDC said .
The material was taken from al - Muthanna chemical weapons plant north of Baghdad .
The samples are sealed and have been there since 1996 .
The samples were in containers that ranged in size " from small vials to tubes the length of a pen , " Okabe said .
Ewan Buchanan , a spokesman for UNMOVIC , said the substances are in a sealed metal box and wrapped in a plastic bag , " so there is no immediate danger . "
Inspectors from UNMOVIC and its predecessor agency UNSCOM were responsible for verifying Iraq 's compliance with U.N. resolutions requiring it to abandon its pursuit of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
The material collected normally would have been destroyed after analysis , UNMOVIC said .
UNMOVIC 's mandate ended this year , and its offices are being packed up and moved out , State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said .
The FBI 's Hazardous Materials Response Unit is coordinating with New York police and other agencies to remove and dispose of the material , FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said .
" There is no hazard to the people of New York from this incident , " Kolko added .
An FBI team was on its way to the UNMOVIC offices where the samples were found .
They will be taken to a U.S. facility in Maryland where previous chemical samples from Iraq 's weapons inspections were destroyed , Buchanan said .

All About United Nations
With Link 's Crossbow Training hitting store shelves this month , we 've got Link on the brain lately at IGN Stars .
We sure do love us some Link here , you see , so a stroll down memory lane seems in order .
The star of the Legend of Zelda series has certainly seen a variety of incarnations over the years , and IGN Stars has grouped them all together for your reading and viewing pleasure .
Read on then for a flashback to some of the major looks the character has had since his debut some 20 years ago .
And then send this link to your friends !
( Get it !? )
Circa 1986 - 1987 Famicom Disk System , Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe title that introduced us to the one and only Link , The Legend of Zelda 's old - school graphics certainly did n't leave much room for intricate character design .
As a result , our boy from Hyrule is mostly a teensy , bitmappy chunk of color here , though what would become his traditional hues of green and brown are clearly in evidence .
Still , our best shot of Link from this era was actually from the game 's promotional materials , where he struck an almost girlish appearance .
Circa 1987 -1988 Famicom Disk System , Nintendo Entertainment SystemAs he would prove wont to do during his various incarnations , Link underwent some changes in his second adventure -- in concept if not much in design .
The new game switched between a 3 / 4 top view of the action and a side - scroller view , though Link himself is still looking relatively primitive here .
Again , the illustrated version of him from the game 's manual is much more satisfying -- he even looks more manly this time out , or at least elven - manly .
Circa 1989
Nintendo's ZL - 65 Game & Watch
The first handheld Zelda game offers up a tiny little LCD Link , of course , but his characterized representation on the device 's cover is interesting for a more rotund and squat hero of Hyrule than we had previously seen .
Another mini version of Link 's adventures could be found in the Zelda Game Watch of this era , which was not to be confused with the Game & Watch .
“ It ’s easy to be critical , but had she won Iowa , none of this would have mattered .
It would n’t have mattered what she spent because money would have come pouring in , ” said Hank Sheinkopf , a Democratic political consultant and a veteran of Mr. Clinton ’s successful 1996 re-election bid .
“ But the fact that she did not has made everyone focus on where the dollars went  and where they think the money should ’ve gone . ”
Mrs. Clinton came into January with a cash advantage over Mr. Obama , with about $ 19 million available for the primary , compared with about $ 13 million for him .
She wound up spending at roughly the same rate as Mr. Obama , about a million dollars a day , but because she performed dismally compared to him in raising money , she ended the month essentially in the red and was forced to lend her campaign $ 5 million , while he had $ 19 million for the coming contests .
Over all , Mrs. Clinton has spent more than $ 35 million on media , polling and consulting .
A comparison with Mr. Obama ’s spending is difficult because of the ways the campaigns labeled expenses , but it appears he spent about $ 40 million in those areas .
In other notable expenditures during the lean month of January , Mrs. Clinton paid $ 275,000 to Sunrise Communications , a South Carolina firm that was supposed to turn out black voters for her and collected nearly $ 800,000 in total .
She lost that state to Mr. Obama by a wide margin .
Even small expenses piled up in January : the campaign spent more than $ 11,000 on pizza and $ 1,200 on Dunkin ’ Donuts runs .
Mr. Penn , the chief strategist , said in an interview that , since 2001 , he no longer owned any of the political consulting firm of Penn , Schoen and Berland Associates .
He said the firm ’s fees were capped at $ 20,000 a month and that the “ great bulk ” of the payments went for direct mail .
Joe Trippi , who was a senior adviser to John Edwards ’s presidential campaign , said he believed that the Clinton team had made two fundamental errors .
First , he argued , Mrs. Clinton built a top - down fund - raising operation that relied on a core group of donors to write checks early on for the maximum amount , $ 4,600 for the primary and the general election , which left few of them to go back to when money became tight .
Mr. Obama , by contrast , focused on building a network of small donors whose continued ability to give has been essential to his success this winter .
The year 2008 marked the beginning of God ’s final warnings to mankind about catastrophic end - time events .
Those warnings are now nearing their completion and will largely end once the prophesied nuclear war begins .
This final countdown for bringing about the collapse of man ’s self - rule has already begun .
On December 14 , 2008 , the First Trumpet of the Seventh Seal of the Book of Revelation sounded , which announced the beginning for the collapse of the economy of the United States and great destruction that will follow .
The effect of the next three trumpet blasts will result in the total collapse of the United States , and once the Fifth Trumpet sounds the world will be thrust into WWIII .
As of 8 this morning the starting points for this year 's Idiotarod had already been changed twice .

Man Fired for Posting ' Dilbert ' Comic at Work Scott Adams helps man fire back at bosses unamused by " drunken lemur " joke .
Feb. 21 , 2008  --
An Iowa man fired for posting a " Dilbert " comic strip at work that made fun of bosses is getting the last laugh — with the help of " Dilbert 's " creator .
In the fall , Dave Steward posted the comic strip on an office bulletin board at the Catfish Bend Casino in Iowa .
In the comic , Dilbert asks , " Why does it seem as if most of the decisions in my workplace are made by drunken lemurs ? "
" I wanted to try to boost the morale for the employees , " Steward said .
His bosses , however , did n't find the joke so funny .
They did n't like the implication that they were the drunken lemurs in this scenario .
Using surveillance video , his bosses identified Steward as the comic culprit and fired him .
Scott Adams , " Dilbert 's " creator , got wind of Steward 's predicament , and this week Adams launched a plotline for the strip that is very similar to Steward 's plight .
In one panel , the boss asks : " Do you think drunken lemurs are like managers ? "
" No , " the character Wally replies .
" Some lemurs can hold their liquor . "
In today 's strip , the boss says , " Wally , I have to fire you for posting a comic comparing managers to drunken lemurs . "
While Adams is clearly defending Steward , he has some advice : " Stick with ' Garfield . '
No one ever got fired for loving lasagna . "
And Steward , who is still searching for a new job , has this advice for all the bosses out there : " You need to have a sense of humor . "
Fergie and Josh Duhamel Expecting a Baby
Since the announcement of their engagement , andhave been under close scrutiny for a baby bump .
The rumor mill is swirling again about Fergie and Josh having a baby on the way .
The couple were seen at Clive Davis ' pre-Grammy bash at the Beverly Hilton and word is , they were talking about moving their wedding date up so that no baby bumps were showing at the ceremony .
Not only that , but Fergie was said that have purchased her wedding dress while in New York during Fashion Week .
Time and photos will tell .
We will keep you posted !
Michael Chertoff told the BBC that the US increasingly saw Europe as a " platform " for a terrorist attack and he blamed the current visa waiver programme for European citizens as a reason for America 's vulnerability .
His remarks came as the BBC reported a posting to a known Islamic extremist website which talked about founding a branch of al - Qaida in the UK .
The posting , which was taken down after a day earlier this month , also talked about killing British politicians , including Gordon Brown .
In an interview recorded before that report , Chertoff said : " We have watched the rise of home - grown terrorism .
We are obviously mindful of the Madrid bombings and the attempted bombings in Germany , and that suggests to us that the terrorists are increasingly looking to Europe as both a target and a platform for terrorist attacks . "
He added : " When I lift my eyes and I look around the world and I look at what happens in Britain , in Germany , in Spain , in Bali , in Pakistan , I do n't see terrorism going away .
I see an al - Qaida that 's evolving . "
Chertoff also explained his unease about lax border control arrangements for Europeans .
" We have the visa waiver programme which allows most Europeans who come to be tourists to come without visas .
That means the first time we encounter them is when they arrive in the United States , and that creates a very small window of opportunity to check them out , " he said .
New travel restrictions were signalled by Chertoff .
" What we are trying to do is find a way to better vet people coming in from Europe without impeding the flow of travel or trade which has been a very important part of our economy , " he said .
Last May , the New York Times reported that Chertoff wanted to impose restrictions on British citizens of Pakistani origin .
It claimed he had suggested to the British government that British Pakistanis would have to apply for visas before travelling to the US .
At the time , the Foreign Office said it would resist the controversial idea .
Mozilla add - on ninja Justin Scott has revealed that Firefox and Thunderbird users have downloaded over 600 million addons from the addons.mozilla.org ( AMO ) web site .
Scott also notes that AMO receives over 100 million addon update pings every single day , a statistic that provides some insight into the total number of addon users .
AMO hosts over 4,000 individual addons and facilitates between 800,000 and 1 million addon downloads every day .
The site itself gets about 4.5 million daily page views .
Support for addons is often cited as one of the most compelling features of the Firefox browser .
The inherent flexibility of Firefox 's XUL user interface system provides addon developers with a lot of power and extensive control over the manner in which the program operates .
This has led to a rich ecosystem of useful third - party addons that offer a wide range of specialized features .
Although addons add a lot of value to Firefox , they are also a liability in some ways because , for instance , conflicting addons can create performance and stability problems that are difficult to troubleshoot .
Mozilla also published a breakdown of the update ping information by version , revealing that 93 percent of all update pings come from Firefox 2 users , 2 percent come from Firefox 1 users , 1 percent come from Firefox 3 users , and 4 percent are from Thunderbird users .
In another recent blog entry , Scott notes that the Rock Your Firefox app for Facebook , which allows users to share their favorite Firefox customizations with friends , has over 4,400 current users .

In the last few years , a handful of intrepid scholars have decided it ’s time to try to understand why kids lie .
For a study to assess the extent of teenage dissembling , Dr. Nancy Darling , then at Penn State University , recruited a special research team of a dozen undergraduate students , all under the age of 21 .
Using gift certificates for free CDs as bait , Darling ’s Mod Squad persuaded high - school students to spend a few hours with them in the local pizzeria .
Each student was handed a deck of 36 cards , and each card in this deck listed a topic teens sometimes lie about to their parents .
Over a slice and a Coke , the teen and two researchers worked through the deck , learning what things the kid was lying to his parents about , and why .
“ They began the interviews saying that parents give you everything and yes , you should tell them everything , ” Darling observes .
By the end of the interview , the kids saw for the first time how much they were lying and how many of the family ’s rules they had broken .
Darling says 98 percent of the teens reported lying to their parents .
Out of the 36 topics , the average teen was lying to his parents about twelve of them .
The teens lied about what they spent their allowances on , and whether they ’d started dating , and what clothes they put on away from the house .
They lied about what movie they went to , and whom they went with .
They lied about alcohol and drug use , and they lied about whether they were hanging out with friends their parents disapproved of .
They lied about how they spent their afternoons while their parents were at work .
They lied about whether chaperones were in attendance at a party or whether they rode in cars driven by drunken teens .
Being an honors student did n’t change these numbers by much ; nor did being an overscheduled kid .
No kid , apparently , was too busy to break a few rules .
And lest you wonder if these numbers apply only to teens in State College , Pennsylvania , the teens in Darling ’s sample were compared to national averages on a bevy of statistics , from academics to extracurriculars .
“ We had a very normal , representative sample , ” Darling says .
For two decades , parents have rated “ honesty ” as the trait they most wanted in their children .
Other traits , such as confidence or good judgment , do n’t even come close .
On paper , the kids are getting this message .
In surveys , 98 percent said that trust and honesty were essential in a personal relationship .
Depending on their ages , 96 to 98 percent said lying is morally wrong .
So when do the 98 percent who think lying is wrong become the 98 percent who lie ?
It starts very young .
Indeed , bright kids — those who do better on other academic indicators — are able to start lying at 2 or 3 .
“ Lying is related to intelligence , ” explains Dr. Victoria Talwar , an assistant professor at Montreal ’s McGill University and a leading expert on children ’s lying behavior .
Although we think of truthfulness as a young child ’s paramount virtue , it turns out that lying is the more advanced skill .
A child who is going to lie must recognize the truth , intellectually conceive of an alternate reality , and be able to convincingly sell that new reality to someone else .
Therefore , lying demands both advanced cognitive development and social skills that honesty simply does n’t require .
“ It ’s a developmental milestone , ” Talwar has concluded .
This puts parents in the position of being either damned or blessed , depending on how they choose to look at it .
If your 4 - year - old is a good liar , it ’s a strong sign she ’s got brains .
And it ’s the smart , savvy kid who ’s most at risk of becoming a habitual liar .
By their 4th birthday , almost all kids will start experimenting with lying in order to avoid punishment .
Because of that , they lie indiscriminately — whenever punishment seems to be a possibility .
A 3 - year - old will say , “ I did n’t hit my sister , ” even if a parent witnessed the child ’s hitting her sibling .
Most parents hear their child lie and assume he ’s too young to understand what lies are or that lying ’s wrong .
They presume their child will stop when he gets older and learns those distinctions .
Talwar has found the opposite to be true — kids who grasp early the nuances between lies and truth use this knowledge to their advantage , making them more prone to lie when given the chance .
Many parenting Websites and books advise parents to just let lies go — they ’ll grow out of it .
The truth , according to Talwar , is that kids grow into it .
In studies where children are observed in their natural environment , a 4 - year - old will lie once every two hours , while a 6 - year - old will lie about once every hour and a half .
Few kids are exceptions .

By the time a child reaches school age , the reasons for lying become more complex .
Avoiding punishment is still a primary catalyst for lying , but lying also becomes a way to increase a child ’s power and sense of control — by manipulating friends with teasing , by bragging to assert status , and by learning he can fool his parents .
Thrown into elementary school , many kids begin lying to their peers as a coping mechanism , as a way to vent frustration or get attention .
Any sudden spate of lying , or dramatic increase in lying , is a danger sign : Something has changed in that child ’s life , in a way that troubles him .
“ Lying is a symptom — often of a bigger problem behavior , ” explains Talwar .
“ It ’s a strategy to keep themselves afloat . ”
In longitudinal studies , a majority of 6 - year - olds who frequently lie have it socialized out of them by age 7 .
But if lying has become a successful strategy for handling difficult social situations , a child will stick with it .
About half of all kids do — and if they ’re still lying a lot at 7 , then it seems likely to continue for the rest of childhood .
They ’re hooked .
“ My son does n’t lie , ” insisted Steve , a slightly frazzled father in his mid-thirties , as he watched Nick , his eager 6 - year - old , enthralled in a game of marbles with a student researcher in Talwar ’s Montreal lab .
Steve was quite proud of his son , describing him as easygoing and very social .
He had Nick bark out an impressive series of addition problems the boy had memorized , as if that was somehow proof of Nick ’s sincerity .
Steve then took his assertion down a notch .
“ Well , I ’ve never heard him lie . ”
Perhaps that , too , was a little strong .
“ I ’m sure he must lie some , but when I hear it , I ’ll still be surprised . ”
He had brought his son to the lab after seeing an advertisement in a Montreal parenting magazine that asked , “ Can Your Child Tell the Difference Between the Truth and a Lie ? ”
Steve was curious to find out if Nick would lie , but he was n’t sure he wanted to know the answer .
The idea of his son ’s being dishonest with him was profoundly troubling .
But I knew for a fact his son did lie .
Nick cheated , then he lied , and then he lied again .
He did so unhesitatingly , without a single glimmer of remorse .
Nick thought he ’d spent the hour playing a series of games with a couple of nice women .
He had won two prizes , a cool toy car and a bag of plastic dinosaurs , and everyone said he did very well .
What the first - grader did n’t know was that those games were really a battery of psychological tests , and the women were Talwar ’s trained researchers working toward doctorates in child psychology .
One of Talwar ’s experiments , a variation on a classic experiment called the temptation - resistance paradigm , is known in the lab as “ the Peeking Game . ”
Through a hidden camera , I ’d watched Nick play it with another one of Talwar ’s students , Cindy Arruda .
She told Nick they were going to play a guessing game .
Nick was to sit facing the wall and try to guess the identity of a toy Arruda brought out , based on the sound it made .
If he was right three times , he ’d win a prize .
The first two were easy : a police car and a crying baby doll .
Nick bounced in his chair with excitement when he got the answers right .
Then Arruda brought out a soft , stuffed soccer ball and placed it on top of a greeting card that played music .
She cracked the card , triggering it to play a music - box jingle of Beethoven ’s Für Elise .
Nick , of course , was stumped .
Arruda suddenly said she had to leave the room for a bit , promising to be right back .
She admonished Nick not to peek at the toy while she was gone .
Nick struggled not to , but at thirteen seconds , he gave in and looked .
When Arruda returned , she could barely come through the door before Nick — facing the wall again — triumphantly announced , “ A soccer ball ! ” Arruda told Nick to wait for her to get seated .
Suddenly realizing he should sound unsure of his answer , he hesitantly asked , “ A soccer ball ? ”
Arruda said Nick was right , and when he turned to face her , he acted very pleased .
Arruda asked Nick if he had peeked .
“ No , ” he said quickly .
Then a big smile spread across his face .
Without challenging him , or even a note of suspicion in her voice , Arruda asked Nick how he ’d figured out the sound came from a soccer ball .
Nick cupped his chin in his hands , then said , “ The music had sounded like a ball . ”
Then : “ The ball sounded black and white . ”
Nick added that the music sounded like the soccer balls he played with at school :
They squeaked .
And the music sounded like the squeak he heard when he kicked a ball .
To emphasize this , his winning point , he brushed his hand against the side of the toy ball .

This experiment was not just a test to see if children cheat and lie under temptation .
It was also designed to test a child ’s ability to extend a lie , offering plausible explanations and avoiding what the scientists call “ leakage ” — inconsistencies that reveal the lie for what it is .
Nick ’s whiffs at covering up his lie would be scored later by coders who watched the videotape .
So Arruda accepted without question the fact that soccer balls play Beethoven when they ’re kicked and gave Nick his prize .
He was thrilled .
Seventy - six percent of kids
Nick ’s age take the chance to peek during the game , and when asked if they peeked , 95 percent lie about it .
But sometimes the researcher will read the child a short storybook before she asks about the peeking .
One story read aloud is The Boy Who Cried Wolf — the version in which both the boy and the sheep get eaten because of his repeated lies .
Alternatively , they read George Washington and the Cherry Tree , in which young George confesses to his father that he chopped down the prized tree with his new hatchet .
The story ends with his father ’s reply : “ George , I ’m glad that you cut down the tree after all .
Hearing you tell the truth instead of a lie is better than if I had a thousand cherry trees . ”
Now , which story do you think reduced lying more ?
When we surveyed 1,300 people , 75 percent thought The Boy Who Cried Wolf would work better .
However , this famous fable actually did not cut down lying at all in Talwar ’s experiments .
In fact , after hearing the story , kids lied even a little more than normal .
Meanwhile , hearing George Washington and the Cherry Tree — even when Washington was replaced with a nondescript character , eliminating the potential that his iconic celebrity might influence older kids — reduced lying a sizable 43 percent in kids .
Although most kids lied in the control situation , the majority hearing George Washington told the truth .
Encouraged to tell so many white lies and hearing so many others , children get comfortable with being disingenuous .
Insincerity becomes a daily occurrence .
The shepherd boy ends up suffering the ultimate punishment , but the fact that lies get punished is not news to children .
Increasing the threat of punishment for lying only makes children hyperaware of the potential personal cost .
It distracts children from learning how their lies affect others .
In studies , scholars find that kids who live in threat of consistent punishment do n’t lie less .
Instead , they become better liars , at an earlier age — learning to get caught less often .
Ultimately , it ’s not fairy tales that stop kids from lying — it ’s the process of socialization .
But the wisdom in The Cherry Tree applies : According to Talwar , parents need to teach kids the worth of honesty , just like George Washington ’s father did , as much as they need to say that lying is wrong .
The most disturbing reason children lie is that parents teach them to .
According to Talwar , they learn it from us .
“ We do n’t explicitly tell them to lie , but they see us do it .
They see us tell the telemarketer , ‘ I ’m just a guest here . ’
They see us boast and lie to smooth social relationships . ”
Consider how we expect a child to act when he opens a gift he does n’t like .
We instruct him to swallow all his honest reactions and put on a polite smile .
Talwar runs an experiment where children play games to win a present , but when they finally receive the present , it ’s a lousy bar of soap .
After giving the kids a moment to overcome the shock , a researcher asks them how they like it .
About a quarter of preschoolers can lie that they like the gift — by elementary school , about half .
Telling this lie makes them extremely uncomfortable , especially when pressed to offer a few reasons why they like the bar of soap .
Kids who shouted with glee when they won the Peeking Game suddenly mumble quietly and fidget .
Meanwhile , the child ’s parent usually cheers when the child comes up with the white lie .
“ Often , the parents are proud that their kids are ‘ polite ’ — they do n’t see it as lying , ” Talwar remarks .
She ’s regularly amazed at parents ’ seeming inability to recognize that white lies are still lies .
When adults are asked to keep diaries of their own lies , they admit to about one lie per every five social interactions , which works out to one per day , on average .
The vast majority of these lies are white lies , lies to protect yourself or others , like telling the guy at work who brought in his wife ’s muffins that they taste great or saying , “ Of course this is my natural hair color . ”
Encouraged to tell so many white lies and hearing so many others , children gradually get comfortable with being disingenuous .
Insincerity becomes , literally , a daily occurrence .
They learn that honesty only creates conflict , and dishonesty is an easy way to avoid conflict .
And while they do n’t confuse white - lie situations with lying to cover their misdeeds , they bring this emotional groundwork from one circumstance to the other .
It becomes easier , psychologically , to lie to a parent .
So if the parent says , “ Where did you get these Pokémon cards ?!
I told you , you ’re not allowed to waste your allowance on Pokémon cards ! ” this may feel to the child very much like a white - lie scenario — he can make his father feel better by telling him the cards were extras from a friend .
Now , compare this with the way children are taught not to tattle .
What grown - ups really mean by “ Do n’t tell ” is that we want children to learn to work it out with one another first .
But tattling has received some scientific interest , and researchers have spent hours observing kids at play .
They ’ve learned that nine out of ten times , when a kid runs up to a parent to tell , that kid is being completely honest .
And while it might seem to a parent that tattling is incessant , to a child that ’s not the case — because for every time a child seeks a parent for help , there are fourteen instances when he was wronged but did not run to the parent for aid .
So when the frustrated child finally comes to tell the parent the truth , he hears , in effect , “ Stop bringing me your problems ! ”
By the middle years of elementary school , a tattler is about the worst thing a kid can be called on the playground .
So a child considering reporting a problem to an adult not only faces peer condemnation as a traitor but also recalls the reprimand “ Work it out on your own . ”
Each year , the problems they deal with grow exponentially .
They watch other kids cut class , vandalize walls , and shoplift .
To tattle is to act like a little kid .
Keeping their mouth shut is easy ; they ’ve been encouraged to do so since they were little .
The era of holding back information from parents has begun .
By withholding details about their lives , adolescents carve out a social domain and identity that are theirs alone , independent from their parents or other adult authority figures .
To seek out a parent for help is , from a teen ’s perspective , a tacit admission that he ’s not mature enough to handle it alone .
Having to tell parents about it can be psychologically emasculating , whether the confession is forced out of him or he volunteers it on his own .
It ’s essential for some things to be “ none of your business . ”
The big surprise in the research is when this need for autonomy is strongest .
It ’s not mild at 12 , moderate at 15 , and most powerful at 18 .
Darling ’s scholarship shows that the objection to parental authority peaks around ages 14 to 15 .
In fact , this resistance is slightly stronger at age 11 than at 18 .
In popular culture , we think of high school as the risk years , but the psychological forces driving deception surge earlier than that .
Many books advise parents to just let lies go — they ’ll grow out of it .
The truth is , kids grow into it .
In her study of teenage students , Darling also mailed survey questionnaires to the parents of the teenagers interviewed , and it was interesting how the two sets of data reflected on each other .
First , she was struck by parents ’ vivid fear of pushing their teens into outright hostile rebellion .
“ Many parents today believe the best way to get teens to disclose is to be more permissive and not set rules , ” Darling says .
Parents imagine a trade - off between being informed and being strict .
Better to hear the truth and be able to help than be kept in the dark .
Darling found that permissive parents do n’t actually learn more about their children ’s lives .
“ Kids who go wild and get in trouble mostly have parents who do n’t set rules or standards .
Their parents are loving and accepting no matter what the kids do .
But the kids take the lack of rules as a sign their parents do n’t care — that their parent does n’t really want this job of being the parent . ”
Pushing a teen into rebellion by having too many rules was a sort of statistical myth .
“ That actually does n’t happen , ” remarks Darling .
She found that most rules - heavy parents do n’t actually enforce them .
“ It ’s too much work , ” says Darling .
“ It ’s a lot harder to enforce three rules than to set twenty rules . ”
A few parents managed to live up to the stereotype of the oppressive parent , with lots of psychological intrusion , but those teens were n’t rebelling .
They were obedient .
And depressed .
“ Ironically , the type of parents who are actually most consistent in enforcing rules are the same parents who are most warm and have the most conversations with their kids , ” Darling observes .
They ’ve set a few rules over certain key spheres of influence , and they ’ve explained why the rules are there .
They expect the child to obey them .
Over life ’s other spheres , they supported the child ’s autonomy , allowing them freedom to make their own decisions .
The kids of these parents lied the least .
Rather than hiding twelve areas from their parents , they might be hiding as few as five .
In the thesaurus , the antonym of honesty is lying , and the opposite of arguing is agreeing .
But in the minds of teenagers , that ’s not how it works .
Really , to an adolescent , arguing is the opposite of lying .
When Nancy Darling ’s researchers interviewed the teenagers from Pennsylvania , they also asked the teens when and why they told the truth to their parents about things they knew their parents disapproved of .
Occasionally they told the truth because they knew a lie would n’t fly — they ’d be caught .
Sometimes they told the truth because they just felt obligated , saying , “ They ’re my parents , I ’m supposed to tell them . ”
But one important motivation that emerged was that many teens told their parents the truth when they were planning on doing something that was against the rules — in hopes their parents might give in and say it was okay .
Usually , this meant an argument ensued , but it was worth it if a parent might budge .
The average Pennsylvania teen was 244 percent more likely to lie than to protest a rule .
In the families where there was less deception , however , there was a much higher ratio of arguing and complaining .
The argument enabled the child to speak honestly .
Certain types of fighting , despite the acrimony , were ultimately signs of respect — not of disrespect .
But most parents do n’t make this distinction in how they perceive arguments with their children .
Dr. Tabitha Holmes of SUNY–New Paltz conducted extensive interviews asking mothers and adolescents , separately , to describe their arguments and how they felt about them .
And there was a big difference .
Forty - six percent of the mothers rated their arguments as being destructive to their relationships with their teens .
Being challenged was stressful , chaotic , and ( in their perception ) disrespectful .
The more frequently they fought , and the more intense the fights were , the more the mother rated the fighting as harmful .
But only 23 percent of the adolescents felt that their arguments were destructive .
Far more believed that fighting strengthened their relationship with their mothers .
“ Their perception of the fighting was really sophisticated , far more than we anticipated for teenagers , ” notes Holmes .
“ They saw fighting as a way to see their parents in a new way , as a result of hearing their mother ’s point of view be articulated . ”
What most surprised Holmes was learning that for the teens , fighting often , or having big fights , did not cause them to rate the fighting as harmful and destructive .
Statistically , it made no difference at all .
Certainly , there is a point in families where there is too much conflict , Holmes notes .
“ But we did n’t have anybody in our study with an extreme amount of conflict . ”
Instead , the variable that seemed to really matter was how the arguments were resolved .
It will be many years before my own children become teenagers , but having lying on my radar screen has changed the way things work around the Bronson household .
No matter how small , lies no longer go unnoticed .
The moments slow down , and I have a better sense of how to handle them .
Just the other day , my 6 - year - old son , Luke , came home from school having learned a new phrase and a new attitude — quipping “ I do n’t care ” snidely , and shrugging his shoulders to everything .
He repeated “ I do n’t care ” so many times I finally got frustrated and demanded to know if someone at school had taught him this dismissive phrase .
He froze .
And I could suddenly intuit the debate running through his head — should he lie to his dad , or rat out his friend ?
Recognizing the conflict , I told him that if he learned the phrase at school , he did not have to tell me who taught him the phrase .
Telling me the truth was not going to get his friends in trouble .
“ Okay , ” he said , relieved .
“ I learned it at school . ”
Then he told me he did care , and he gave me a hug .
I have n’t heard it again .
Does how we deal with a child ’s lies really matter down the road in life ?
The irony of lying is that it ’s both normal and abnormal behavior at the same time .
It ’s to be expected , and yet it ca n’t be disregarded .
Dr. Bella DePaulo of the University of California , Santa Barbara , has devoted much of her career to adult lying .
In one study , she had both college students and community members enter a private room equipped with an audiotape recorder .
Promising them complete confidentiality , DePaulo ’s team instructed the subjects to recall the worst lie they ever told — with all the scintillating details .
“ I was fully expecting serious lies , ” DePaulo remarks .
“ Stories of affairs kept from spouses , stories of squandering money , or being a salesperson and screwing money out of car buyers . ”
And she did hear those kinds of whoppers , including theft and even one murder .
But to her surprise , a lot of the stories told were about when the subject was a mere child — and they were not , at first glance , lies of any great consequence .
“ One told of eating the icing off a cake , then telling her parents the cake came that way .
Another told of stealing some coins from a sibling . ”
As these stories first started trickling in , DePaulo scoffed , thinking , “ C’mon , that ’s the worst lie you ’ve ever told ? ”
But the stories of childhood kept coming , and DePaulo had to create a category in her analysis just for them .
“ I had to reframe my understanding to consider what it must have been like as a child to have told this lie , ” she recalls .
“ For young kids , their lie challenged their self - concept that they were a good child , and that they did the right thing . ”
Many subjects commented on how that momentous lie early in life established a pattern that affected them thereafter .
“ We had some who said , ‘ I told this lie , I got caught , and I felt so badly , I vowed to never do it again . ’
Others said , ‘ Wow , I never realized I ’d be so good at deceiving my father , I can do this all the time . ’
The lies they tell early on are meaningful .
The way parents react can really affect lying . ”
Talwar says parents often entrap their kids , putting them in positions to lie and testing their honesty unnecessarily .
Last week , I put my 3 ½ - year - old daughter in that exact situation .
I noticed she had scribbled on the dining table with a washable marker .
Disapprovingly , I asked , “ Did you draw on the table , Thia ? ”
In the past , she would have just answered honestly , but my tone gave away that she ’d done something wrong .
Immediately , I wished I could retract the question .
I should have just reminded her not to write on the table , slipped newspaper under her coloring book , and washed the ink away .
Instead , I had done just as Talwar had warned against .
“ No , I did n’t , ” my daughter said , lying to me for the first time .
For that stain , I had only myself to blame .

Vageyena Man sightings :

The incredible Sony VAIO VGN - TXN27N laptop .
This beauty is less than 2 ″ thick and weighs 2.8 lbs .
If I add a few ounces of weight with the extended battery ( on the right ) and trick it out , I can get 15 hours of battery life .

The name of the game in world travel is being “ fashionably light . ”
Practice in 30 - plus countries has taught me that packing minimalism can be an art .
I returned from Costa Rica last Wednesday , and have since landed in Maui , where I ’ll stay for one week .
What did I pack and why ?
Check out the video …
[ youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsHXco4KVyY&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1]
I practice what I ’ll label the BIT method of travel : Buy It There .
If you pack for every contingency — better bring the hiking books in case we go hiking , better bring an umbrella in case it rains , better bring dress shoes and slacks in case we go to a nice restaurant , etc. — carrying a mule - worthy load is inevitable .
I ’ve learned to instead allocate $ 50 - 200 per trip to a “ settling fund , ” which I use to buy needed items once they ’re 100 % needed .
This includes cumbersome and hassle items like umbrellas and bottles of sunscreen that love to explode .
Also , never buy if you can borrow .
If you ’re going on a bird watching trip in Costa Rica , you do n’t need to bring binoculars — someone else will have them .
Here ’s the Maui list , listed from top - to - bottom , left - to - right :
- 1 featherweight Marmot Ion jacket ( 3 oz . ! )
- 1 breathable Coolibar long - sleeve shirt .
This saved me in Panama .
- 1 pair of polyester pants .
Polyester is light , wrinkle - resistant , and dries quickly .
Disco dancers and flashpackers dig it .
- 1 Kensington laptop lock , also used to secure all bags to stationary objects .
- 1 single Under Armour sock , used to store sunglasses
- 2 nylon tanktops
- 1 large MSR quick - dry microfiber towel , absorbs up to 7 times its weight in water
- 1 Ziploc bag containing toothbrush , travel toothpaste , and disposable razor
- 1 Fly Clear biometric travel card , which cuts down my airport wait time about 95 %
- 2 pairs of Exofficio lightweight underwear .
Their tagline is “ 17 countries .
6 weeks .
And one pair of underwear . ”
I think I ’ll opt for two , considering they weigh about as much as a handful of Kleenex .
One other nice side - effect of their weight : they ’re much more comfortable than normal cotton underwear .
- 2 pairs of shorts / swimsuits
- 2 books : Lonely Planet Hawaii and The Entrepreneurial Imperative ( the latter comes highly recommended .
Check it out )
- 1 sleeping mask and earplugs
- 1 pair of Reef sandals .
Best to get a pair with removable straps that go around the heel .
- 1 Canon PowerShot SD300 digital camera with extra 2GB SD memory card .
God , I love this camera more than words can describe .
It is the best designed piece of electronics I have ever owned .
I now use it not only for all of my photos and videos , but also as a replacement for my scanner .
I ’m considering testing the newer and cheaper SD1000 .
- 1 coffee harvesting hat to prevent my pale skin from burning off .
- 1 Kiva keychain expandable duffel bag
- 1 Chapstick , 1 Mag - Lite Solitaire flashlight , and 1 roll of athletic tape .
The last is a lifesaver .
It ’s as useful as duct tape for repairing objects but gentle enough to use on injuries , which I am fond of inflicting on myself .
- 1 Lewis and Clark flex lock ( for luggage , lockers , zippers , or whatever I need to lock down / shut / together ) .
Standard mini-padlocks are often too cumbersome to thread through holes on lockers , etc .
- 1 Radio Shack kitchen timer , which I ’ve been using to wake up for about five years .
The problem with using a cell phone alarm to wake up is simple : the phone needs to be on , and even if you use vibrate , people can call and wake you up before you want to wake up .
The second benefit to using a kitchen timer if that you know exactly how much sleep you are — or are n’t — getting , and you can experiment with things like caffeine power naps of different durations … but that ’s another post 😉
What are your favorite must - pack items , multi- purpose tools , and lightweight winners ?

How to Negotiate Convertibles and Luxury Treehouses … and Videos from Costa Rica :
The secret to getting what you want is first asking for what you want , then negotiating if you do n’t get it .
The first part is the most neglected .
Most people never learn to ask for something properly , so they always get push - back and end up negotiating .
I cover dealmaking and negotiating exhaustively in The 4 - Hour Workweek , as well as in the bonus chapter , “ How to Get $ 700,000 in Advertising for $ 10,000 . ”
Let ’s look at how to win the fight before it starts .
I wanted this trip to Maui , my first to Hawai ’i , to be an experience of personal firsts .
Here are a few : driving a convertible sports car on the Hana Highway , flying in a helicopter , sleeping in a full - size treehouse , and scuba diving the back wall of Molokini crater .
I fulfilled all of them in the first 72 hours .
How I got a Mustang turbo convertible for $ 278 ( gas included ) instead of $ 542 ( gas not included ) :
I bought my plane ticket to Maui about 24 hours before I left , so I landed in luau land with no reservations of any kind .
There was only one rental company , so I had to get my convertible from them .
Here are the pointers that got me from $ 542 to $ 278 :
1 . The first representative at the desk would n’t play ball with discounts , so I told her that I need to take a phone call outside , took a 5 - minute walk , and came back to test another rep .
Choosing the person on the other side of the table — just like choosing a slot machine vs. playing slots well — is more important than negotiating technique .
2 . People who get what they want , just like good negotiators or PR folk , are good conversationalists .
Here ’s what I said :
“ Hey , man .
How goes it ?
I ’m so excited to be here .
[ After giving him my license and info ]
If you have any discounts I can use — AAA , student , magic elf , or anything at all — I ’d really , really appreciate it .
I ’m on a budget , so whatever you can do would be awesome . ”
Notice that I ’m asking for what I want without asking at all .
The result : $ 278 with gas included instead of $ 542 without gas .
How I got a sold - out luxury treehouse for free :
This one is even better .
It ’s the high tourist season in Maui .
It ’s so popular to drive from Kahalui to Hana for coastline and waterfalls that my local helicopter pilot said : “ Thinking of staying over in Hana ?
Forget about it .
You ’ll never get a room . ”
Well , I had thought about it , and I wanted nothing more than to stay in one of the famous full - size treehouses in the rain forest .
Doing this in the high season is something like showing up for the last game of the World Series and asking for box seats at the door .
So I called the treehouse gods and here ’s how it went down :
Me : “ Hi . I ’m really , really hoping that you have vacancies for tonight .
Please say yes . ”
Goddess of the Treehouses : “ Nope .
Totally booked . ”
Me : “ Oh , no .
My dream is crushed .
Are you sure ?
Do you have anything at all ?
Even a dilapidated and unsafe one ?
[ I pause while she first takes me seriously , then laughs ]
Hmmm …
Is there anything at all I can do ? ”
Goddess : [ long pause ]
“ Well … how about a work trade ? ”
Me : “ Sounds like fun .
What do you mean ? ”
Goddess : “ Moving some dirt . ”
Me : “ For sure !
I love it .
How long would it take ? ” [ Note : I actually do love hard manual labor .
It demands full attention , and the repetitive motion is like repeating a mantra .
Call me crazy . ]
Goddess : “ About an hour . ”
We talk for another 20 minutes , and she decides that she would feel guilty if she forced me to shovel while on vacation .
I was secretly disappointed , but no matter : she and I met up at the treehouse , and after a trip to a small alcove beach together and much conversation , my stay ended up being free .
Not only that , but I was adopted by a wild dog — the cutest puppy you ’ve ever seen — who then played companion for the entire time .
Dig it .
Be a joker when you can , be pitiful when needed , and learn to get a laugh as you field test the most valuable skill in the world : asking for what you want .
If all else fails in Hawai ’i , just tell them “ Kama aina , ” which means you ’re a local .
It should get you an automatic 15 - 20 % off in most places .
Do n’t tell them I told you 😉

The Tim Ferriss
Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than 500 million downloads .
It has been selected for " Best of Apple Podcasts " three times , it is often the # 1 interview podcast across all of Apple Podcasts , and it 's been ranked # 1 out of 400,000 + podcasts on many occasions .
To listen to any of the past episodes for free , check out this page .
I ’ve talked quite a lot before about buying or selling links that pass PageRank .
Today I wanted to walk through a concrete example of paid posts and show why the major search engines do n’t want to be affected by links within paid posts .
The problem is best illustrated by a serious example : suppose you just visited your doctor and got a scary surprise : you or a member of your family have a tumor .
The doctor is throwing around words like steroids , surgery , chemo , and radiosurgery .
Much of what the doctor says washes over you , but you remember the word “ radiosurgery ” and resolve to find out more when you get home .
At home , you fire up a search engine and type “ radiosurgery . ”
If you go to Google and search for [ radiosurgery ] , the results give a pretty good overview of what radiosurgery is ( focused radiation that targets tumors ) .
In the first several results , you have balanced information from the International RadioSurgery Association , an overview page on Wikipedia , a great background page from Radiology Info , even an introductory - level essay on radiosurgery from the Mayo Clinic .
If you came back from the doctor and wanted to get an overview of radiosurgery , I hope you ’d find the results useful .
Now , think about how you would feel if your medical search was influenced by pages like this :
The posts themselves do n’t mention it , but entries like these often turn out to be what are known as “ paid posts . ”
That is , someone paid money in order to receive a review , and the paid review includes a link with the word “ radiosurgery , ” for example .
There ’s no disclosure inside these entries whether these posts are paid , nor do the posts use the nofollow attribute or some other mechanism so that search engines are n’t affected .
Now I ’m going to ask you to put on your regular user hat .
If you ’ve just learned that you or a family member have a tumor , would you prefer that radiosurgery overview article from the Mayo Clinic , or from a site which appears to be promoting a specific manufacturer of medical equipment via paid posts ?
My guess is that you ’d prefer the Mayo Clinic .
In the example above , notice that the post says “ I myself had never heard of this treatment process until now . ”
On a subject as serious as brain tumors , it ’s troubling if someone is getting paid to review and link to a site , especially if it appears that they were n’t aware of this treatment until they were paid to write about the subject .
In researching this incident , we saw lots of people doing paid posts about brain tumors who admitted that they were n’t familiar with the subject beforehand .
Sometimes posts were even more inaccurate :
“ Is there any new medical breakthrough in the treatment of brain tumore [ sic ] ? ”
If the paid poster had researched their subject more , they would have discovered that this particular treatment has been around for two decades .
In fact , the promoted site mentions that one of the main reasons to use their technique is because it ’s well - established , not brand - new .
If someone does n’t do enough research for a paid post to know that a treatment is well - established instead of brand - new , how can you trust their opinion about brain tumors ?
Here ’s another post that claims this treatment technique is new :
“ happy and proud to introduce the GAMMA KNIFE ” ?
Again , this is not a new treatment technique .
In fact , anyone who read the first page on the promoted site would have realized that one of the selling points of the device is that the technology is well - established .
But there are more noticeable mistakes than calling the technique new when it ’s actually been around for decades .
Sometimes the posts do n’t even get the name of the treatment right :
Notice that this post consistently refers to the “ Lesksell Gamma Knife ” treatment .
The correct name is Leksell .
I also saw one person call it the “ Gama Knife ” treatment , and someone else called it the “ Gamma Knive ” treatment .
If you ’re getting paid to write a review , should n’t you at least perform the basic research to get the product name right ?
I have a lot more snapshots I could show , but I hope these examples help explain my point .
For this very important ( potentially even life - or - death ) medical topic , we saw paid reviewers admit that they knew nothing about a treatment before getting paid to post about it , or who did n’t research the subject enough to know that a treatment was decades old instead of brand - new .
We saw people writing about brain tumors who did n’t even spell “ tumor ” correctly , and we saw people who got the name of the sponsor wrong .
If you put your user hat back on , I hope you ’ll agree that you would n’t want a serious medical search for brain tumor treatments to be affected by inaccurate or uninformed posts .
In fact , if you stumbled across these entries on the web , you might not know whether someone got paid for writing these posts .
In the same way that a regular surfer would want disclosure to know if a post were paid , all the major search engines also want to make sure that paid posts are adequately disclosed to search engines as well .
Google ’s documentation for webmasters gives examples of how to do that .
I believe the vast majority of our users do n’t want our organic search results for something as serious as brain tumors to be affected by links in paid posts .
I hope these examples help to explain the motivation for our quality guidelines , and how those guidelines ensure a better experience for users .
To read more about this subject , you can start at Google ’s quality guidelines .
Where you see the guideline “ Do n’t participate in link schemes designed to increase your site ’s ranking or PageRank ” you can click on “ participate in link schemes ” to get more guidance .
That page specifically mentions “ Buying or selling links that pass PageRank ” as being against our quality guidelines , and it ’s also clickable so that you can read more about buying or selling links in our HTML documentation .
( Just as a side - note : I do n’t normally send my blog posts to Google ’s public relations or legal folks before posting .
For this entry , I did get this post approved by Google ’s PR / legal department first to make sure that what I said was an accurate reflection of Google ’s opinion on this subject .
If you ’re concerned because this is a post on my personal blog , we also did an official blog post about this issue today . )
What would you do if someone stole something valuable and personal from you ?
What if , at the same time , they targeted your business and crippled your income ?
What if you also discovered that this happened due to a Google security infection that can affect any Gmail user ?
That 's what has happened to me .
Read on and I 'll tell you about the web pirates threatening my livelihood , and how to check Gmail to make sure it does n’t happen to you .
On November 20th 2007 I left the UK to spend a month in India .
I 'd planned the break for about a year , and was looking forward to taking my girlfriend on our first foreign trip together .
Before leaving , I published a brief post to say I 'd be away and that the blog would be quiet in my absence .
All my clients were informed , bills paid , etc. , and off we went for an adventure .
We arrived in Mumbai on November 21st , and on the journey from the airport to the Colaba district , was punched in the face through the open window of my taxi , but that 's another story .
I 'd not be checking email much during the next month — only to keep in touch with family .
This was a break from work and computers .
Everything was fine until just a few days before we were to return to the UK .
I was in a net cafe in Goa and read some worrying emails from friends .
My website had disappeared and my domain name was redirecting to a site I 'd never heard of — bebu.net .
I got anxious .
What happened ?
The only thing I could think of was that somehow the domain name had expired without any notification or warning , and a poacher had snapped it up before I could renew .
My site had been attracting more than 2,000 unique daily visits .
So not a massive amount .
But for a one - man business , 700,000 + annual visitors can generate a decent amount of new clients .
So I ran a WHOIS check on the domain , hoping to find an email address for the new owner .
The search yielded this email address : DAVIDAIREY.COM@domainsbyproxy.com and here 's the email I sent :
" Hello , please can I purchase my old domain name from you .
It seems it expired without my knowledge .
www.davidairey.com.
Kind regards , David "
I found it hard to believe that I 'd let my domain name expire , but thought it a good idea to send an email nonetheless .
On the very same day , I received a reply .
It came from one supposed Peyam Irvani , telling me the following :
" Hello , please send me your high offer !
Regards "
By this stage I 'd had some back and forth email discussions with close friends , wondering what exactly could have happened .
I also contacted my web host , ICDSoft , asking for help .
They originally sold me the domain name .
Should n't they have informed me ?
This is when I found a disturbing ticket in my web host support panel .
It was supposedly from me , addressed to ICDSoft 's support team , and was created on November 20th , the exact date of my departure from the UK .
It read :
" Subject : Davidairey.com Transfer " Hello , I want to transfer davidairey .com to another registrar please unlock it and send me the EPP transfer code .
Kind regards , David "
Within just one minute ( ICDSoft 's support team are very fast ) the following response had been supplied :
" Hello , we unlocked your domain name as requested .
Here is its EPP code : Domain name : davidairey.com - Auth / EPP key : 6835892AE0087D66 . Best Regards , Support "
I immediately typed a reply asking what I could do to resolve the situation .
Here 's what the support team said :
" Unfortunately , the domain name has been transferred successfully , and it can not be reverted .
The current registrar may be able to give you more information .
The original ticket message was sent from this IP address : 207.36.162.100 .
The person who posted it must have had access to your email , too , because transfers have to be approved by the administrative contact in order to be successful . "
What ?
Not only did the hacker gain access to my web host control panel , but they also squirmed their way into my email account ?
This is when I began to get very worried .
I kept a lot of personal emails behind my username and password , and this was a real invasion of privacy .
For a few minutes I sat in the net café and did n't know what to think .
I emailed GoDaddy where my domain had been illegally transferred to , and asked them to prevent any further transfers .
I wanted the domain in one place while I investigated .
GoDaddy said :
" Unfortunately if a transfer request is made and completed we will not be able to prevent this unless we receive the notice from a court or arbitration forum ...
I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . "
Okay , so GoDaddy can't help until the matter is taken to court .
This process ran over a few days of my holiday , as GoDaddy took over 48 hours to respond .
At this point , on December 19th ( four days after my first email to the thief ' Peyam ' ) , I thought I 'd reply :
" Hello Peyam , well , congrats on your hack .
I 'd love to know how you did it .
" Before this moves through the courts , in order to settle the dispute , I do n't suppose you'd be so kind to give me my domain back ?
It 'd really save me a lot of hassle , but if that 's what it takes , so be it . "
No point in being aggressive .
Again , that same day , I received a response :
" : ) )
Im sorry to say but its not possible to have it or it take about 1 month if you try hard to have it again :) ) and you lose your visitor .... hahaha
" You can purchase it for 650 $ And we will use escrow sevices ;) that will done in less than 2 days ! "
Now my domain name was being held to ransom and I was being taunted .
What I had spent more than a year building into a sound marketing plan had been severed at the knees .
I 'm not the type to give money to a criminal , so I did n't reply , and focused on stopping the hacker from stealing anything else of mine .
How was I being hacked ?
After some research I found this exposé into Google 's Gmail deficiencies : Google Gmail E-mail Hijack Technique
It details the exact Gmail hijack that I have just found applied to my account ( right while writing this post ) .
Here 's an excerpt :
" The victim visits a page while being logged into Gmail .
Upon execution , the page performs a multipart / form - data POST to one of the Gmail interfaces and injects a filter into the victim ’s filter list .
In the example above , the attacker writes a filter , which simply looks for emails with attachments and forwards them to an email of their choice .
This filter will automatically transfer all emails matching the rule .
Keep in mind that future emails will be forwarded as well .
The attack will remain present for as long as the victim has the filter within their filter list , even if the initial vulnerability , which was the cause of the injection , is fixed by Google . "
And here 's a three step illustration of just how this threat works ( click each image for a larger version ) :
Images courtesy of GNUCITIZEN
I took a look at the " filter " option in my own Gmail settings , and it turns out that you can easily set incoming emails containing specific words to be forwarded automatically .
For example , if you want any emails containing the word password to be sent to another address , no problem .
It also appears that the filter can delete the email from your Gmail inbox as soon as it has been forwarded , so you'd be none the wiser if a hacker was playing havoc with your incoming mail .
Important :
If you use Gmail , it 's vital that you check your account settings now .
Here 's what to do :
When logged into Gmail , click on the " settings " tab in the upper right of the screen .
Then check both the " filters " and the " forwarding and POP " sections .
This is what I just found in my filters tab :
" The following filters are applied to all incoming mail : " Matches : transfer-approval.com
" Do this : Forward to ba_marame_pooli@yahoo.com , Skip Inbox , Delete it " Matches : from :( transfer-approval.com )
" Do this : Forward to ba_marame_pooli@yahoo.com , Skip Inbox , Delete it "
I have no idea who 's email address that is , but it seems that some of my personal emails were bypassing my inbox entirely , instead being forwarded to the yahoo.com address .
The Gmail security issue is seemingly fixed ( link removed due to expired domain — 09 April 2010 ) , but that wo n't remove any previously installed filters from your Gmail account .
What do I know about the thief ?
There ’s the Gmail address , pay.irv@gmail.com , and what ’s probably a fake name , Peyam Irvani .
There ’s also the Yahoo address that my emails were being forwarded to via the Gmail filer , ba_marame_pooli@yahoo.com .
ICDSoft gave me the IP address from where the fraudulent support ticket originated ( 207.36.162.100 ) .
According to IP Global Positioning the IP is in the United States — Fort Lauderdale , Florida , to be precise — and the Internet Service Provider is Cybergate INC , based in Mississippi .
I 'm not sure how much this information can help me , if at all .
Then , unexpectedly , I got a third email from ' Peyam ' on December 21st :
" Helli David , we can use escrow and you can have your domain name again :)
Only for 250 $ !
Do you want it ?!
Its special christmas offer !
haha
I like to see you have that domain name again :) "
I do n't care if it costs two cents .
I do n’t pay thieves .
So you might be wondering what I did to resurrect my website .
You 're reading this post on davidairey .com after all .
Before the theft , I owned both davidairey.com and davidairey .
co.uk , with the .co.uk permanently redirecting to the .com ( I thought it made sense to use the .com as my main address because as easier to remember ) .
I 'm now using the .co.uk domain as my main address .
That means all my organic search results have been reset to zero .
Whereas once I was on the first page of search results for graphic designer , I 'm now nowhere .
It also means that the detail on my business cards is incorrect , and my email addresses too .
So quite an expense , but I 'd rather fight in the courts than give a penny to the person responsible .
Help with domain name disputes
This is the stage I 'm at , weighing up options before it comes to paying legal fees .
This is also where I 'm calling on your valued help .
I know that many of you are much more clued up on this than I am , and if you can spare some advice in the comments here I 'd be very appreciative .
In my emails with GoDaddy ( the company where my .com domain name is now registered ) , a representative said :
" Should we receive notice of a pending dispute from a court or arbitration forum , we will lock the domain name so it cannot be transferred or have the registrant information modified .
Likewise , when we receive a decision from the legal body , we will update the domain name accordingly . "
They then directed me to the WIPO website ( World Intellectual Property Organization , domain.disputes@wipo.int ) where there 's a section for domain name dispute resolution resources , including the following :
It seems I have to pay a minimum of $ 1,500 for the pleasure of initiating a court case .
All fees are listed here .
It 's not clear how long the process lasts .
What should I do ?
From what I understand , the only option is to proceed with legal action ( again , I 'm not paying the thief one penny ) .
Do you know any different ?
Do I have a good case to proceed with ?
Is there any other information available online about the pirate who is blackmailing me ?
If you can provide any of these answers , it would mean a lot .
Thank you
Thank you so much to those of you who kindly emailed me at the start of this situation : Vivien , Ben , Tammy , Armen , Dawud , Ed and Jamie .
I know that more of you tried , but that I did n't receive your emails because my accounts no longer existed .
Thank you also , to everyone who is lending their support in the comments of my previous blog post , David Airey.com hacked .
Many of you have also published my news on your own blogs , and this really lifts my spirits , showing just how great the people in the blog world are :
Here 's a snippet of your kind help :
It 's fantastic that you 'd go to this effort .
If there 's anything I can do in return , do let me know .

Wednesday , 31 October 2007 Happy Halloween
I need someone to remind me of where I stole this image from .
It could have been Lucy or Maru .
I was listening to Thom Hartmann earlier and John Edwards came on and talked to him .
Ordinarily , the only legislator
Thom talks to ( every Friday ) is Bernie Sanders , because he 's the only one who will agree to unscripted questions .
So , John Edwards just got big points from me .
( Listen here for the continuous loop of the most recent Hartmann show - and do n't forget to throw some cash to The White Rose Society . )
Some people suspect that it's because they actually believe the same things the Republicans do , but Chris Bowers believes it really is mere fear that makes the Democratic leadership behave the way it does .

Chuck Dupree wonders why a city like San Francisco has such crummy representatives - such as Tom Lantos , who managed to say many appalling things recently to some Dutch legislators who had visited Guantanamo .
" Europe was not as outraged by Auschwitz as by Guantanamo Bay , " for example .
And , " You have to help us , because if it was not for us you would now be a province of Nazi Germany . "
Yeah , that 's tellin ' 'em .
When couples want to adopt a child , they look to poorer countries where women have low access to contraception and abortion and where there are few social supports to ease parenting .
Guess the country of choice for the British .

The worst disease " Obama 's gospel mistake " - David Ehrenstein is in the LAT this morning discussing how Obama failed to negotiate the issue of gays in the black community , worth reading for the historical notes alone , but let 's have some of the raw Ehrenstein , too , back at his blog .
" Theocracy Now ! " - Max Blumenthal checked out the Value Voters Summit , and watched a bunch of people going out of their way to show how awful they are .
" Neoconservative activist Frank Gaffney appeared at the Summit as well .
Before a standing room audience , Gaffney exclaimed that " by not being bigoted and not being racist , [ George W. ]
Bush has embraced Islamofascists on several occasions . "
Phyllis Schlaffly echoed Gaffney 's comments , declaring that there are too many mosques in America . "
Some days I think they become conservatives because they know that if they managed to get degrees , then " education " can't mean anything .
( I kept expecting Bush to appoint Schlaffly to replace O'Connor .... )
As usual , I can't get the video to play , so you 'll have to tell me what goes on in it .
( Why is this ?
I never used to have any trouble with Flash . )
Oh , yeah , they 're the party for really stupid gays , too .

Nowhere to hide A while back a friend - another American blogger , but someone who usually avoids any taint of partisanship and rests his work on his expertise - invited me to dinner during a visit to London and took me to a delightful restaurant of a sort I could never afford to dine at on my own .
In between marvelling at the food , he confided to me that he thinks we 've lost the battle and he and his wife are now looking at countries they might move to .
I found out a long time ago that there 's no escaping the United States .
The repercussions of what our country does reach far and wide ; no one is immune .
When I first moved to England , I had to spend a lot of time explaining to people that " landslide " does not mean , " Everyone in America voted for Reagan . "
I thought this was a big hurdle until I realized that , despite the fact that everyone knew Reagan was brain - damaged , his policies were still being held up as models for the rest of the world , even here where he was loathed .
" The Americans are doing it " was all the excuse that was needed to embark on projects that were at best moronic , at worst devastatingly destructive .
And so I watched the long parade of insults to democracy , economic security , and civil liberties that began with Thatcher but only seemed to swell under Blair .
Because , after all , the Americans are doing it !
So now there 's a " new " government .
God , we all hope so .
But , as Henry Porter puts it :
But then the clouds of suspicion began to gather as I watched the Labour commentariat , their expressions resembling nothing so much as the empty rictus of halloween pumpkins .
Surely they see what Brown and Straw are up to .
Both men were members of the Blair cabinet which mounted the greatest attack in peacetime on the people 's rights and liberties .
Having taken what was ours , they now offer it back to us - reduced and compromised - but as though it was somehow their beautiful gift to the people .
They are repackaging our liberty and selling it to us as a new bill of rights and duties .
Nobody points out that the only reason we are now discussing a new bill of rights is because Labour 's villainous laws have made it a political necessity for Brown to win back voters ' confidence .
Few question the addition of responsibilities - or ' duties ' - to a code of rights .
Many of our duties as citizens are already established in law and a Labour government , least of all Jack Straw , has no business defining our responsibilities to each other or , more odiously , to the state .
And let us not forget that duty is primarily a matter of conscience , not coercion .
It seems Labour cannot give something away or , in this case , return a small portion of what was ours without imposing conditions .
Putting Jack Straw in charge of the consultation process on a bill of rights is like turning over a campaign against prostitution to the head of an escort agency .
Such a man can only see a bill of rights as political tool and a way of further entrenching the powers of government and the executive .
Jack Straw was certainly an able steward of the project to remove the rights of Britons throughout the Blair years , and now they 've put him in charge of " giving " them back .
Astonishing .
Technically speaking , I suppose Americans have more rights in law than Brits - at least in theory .
But those rights have to be defended in court - with more and more frequency , these days - if you are allowed to defend them at all , in a judicial system that has been twisted beyond all recognition .
In practice , however , I have somehow managed to retain the ability to prevent most strangers from phoning me constantly in attempts to sell me something , and I do n't have to pay for calls I receive on my cell phone ( which seldom rings , anyway , since I 've only given the number to about three people ) .
But I 'm harmless and white and do n't even trawl the net for pornography , so I 'm unlikely to become a target of most of the deeper offenses to human liberty that have been undertaken in the name of public safety in the time I 've been here .
My campaigning in Britain does n't hurt any major players economically , so they probably wo n't fit me up or try to shoot me .
My neighbors get shot , and my friends who campaign against mining companies get fitted up , but aside from assorted indignities at Heathrow , life at home is generally quiet .
Things would seem nearly perfect , if only I did n't care .

Footnote on Social Security JHB in comments :
Just to highlight how long there has been an effort to manufacture a climate of crisis about Social Security , its worth revisiting some articles by Doug Henwood of the Left Business Observer on the subject , going back thirteen years : 1994 :
" The bankruptcy scenario is based on an assumption that GDP will grow at a rate seen only in depression decades . "
[ Link ] 1998 :
" Rerun the projections with more reasonable -- though still conservative -- projections and the " crisis " largely or fully disappears . "
[ Link ] and 2005 :
" It 's uncanny reading Paul Krugman 's New York Times column these days - his stuff on Social Security sounds like what LBO was saying in 1998 . " [ Link ]
Yes , I remember running into this stuff in the late '90s and being astonished that anyone was even talking about it .
I recall having to explain to an otherwise quite liberal guy that it was all rubbish and anyway all we needed to do if we wanted to make Social Security more solvent is remove the cap .
He did n't know there was a cap , of course , and was even more surprised to hear that that would be enough .
The entire basis of the scam , anyway , is the apparent belief that baby - boomers did not reproduce .
Well , they did .
The baby - boom that started more than 20 years ago is actually bigger than the original post - war boom .
Funny how you seldom hear about that .
The conservatives hate it that Social Security has actually created real security for the middle - class and we do n't have old people dying in the streets .
They hate it that young families are n't more heavily - burdened by trying to take care of aging relatives .
They hate it that ordinary working people actually had a hope of improving their lives .
They have done their best , often successfully , to mitigate this as much as possible , but that one sticky program is dragging them down , and they 're desperate to get rid of it .
So , of course , they lie .
Never forget this :
If conservatives appear to be making sense , they are almost certainly lying . |

Overdue news
For those who came in late , Atrios explains the history of the fight against cat - food accounts .
He also links to an old post from Matthew Yglesias examining the " rationale " for cat - food accounts by " serious " people like Joke Line .
( Basically : the moronic idea that programs that evolved out of the Industrial Age are old - fashioned and we need to " modernize " for the Information Age .
I have long been disgusted with the way many of the neolib / libertarian crowd got hitched to the stupid idea that all natural laws died with the invention of the internet , and thousands of years of historical reality just ceased to be operational because we happened to have a speedier method of communication handy .
These idiots actually believed that " information wants to be free " meant that people would not be vulnerable to arrest for expressing Unauthorized Thoughts because of the magic of the internet , for example .
Some of them openly asserted that censorship was dead just because the net was designed to route around obstruction .
Well , sure , it 's conceivable that your words can proliferate around the net forever , but that does n't mean no one will find out you said them and put you in jail , or that no one will experience the chilling effect of your arrest .
Applying the " everything is changed by the internet " meme to Social Security makes even less sense , since nothing about speedy information changes the fact that private financial facilities are still operated for profit , which in itself adds costs to the program , even if you could eliminate the vastly - higher cost of administration when each person has a different type of account from a different financial institution .
The people who support these ideas are regarded as " serious " because they advocate for destructive programs , not because their ideas are any good . )
Last year when it was announced that the UK would set the clocks back in autumn at the end of October rather than in early November , I was delighted to know that the week of not remembering what time it is in New York would be eliminated - and then I found out the US was going to put the clocks back a week earlier .
But I forgot that Sunday night , so I missed the first hour of Seder on Sunday .
Fortunately , it eventually appeared on the widget , so I managed to hear the discussion of the FISA bill , but I was disappointed to note that Matt and Christy dropped the ball on the question of whether money might have influenced Jay Rockefeller 's decision to put the telecoms above the law .
Sam went out of his way to prime Matt , but he treated it as , " Oh , yes , money is always in there somewhere , " without pointing out that the telecoms recently threw a pile of money at Rockefeller 's campaign and then suddenly Rockefeller became very happy with the get - out - of - jail - free provision for the telecoms .
Apparently , eRobin 's local press gave the demo over the weekend pretty good coverage .
I was amused to note that liberal talk radio host Stephanie Miller , whose father was once the Republican nominee for vice president , got a call from the daughter of the guy who was top of the ticket with a suggestion , so they called their October 27th rally Goldwater - Miller '08 .
Their slogan was , " Family name .
No skills .
Just like W. "

Nuts
Since lately people are giving more serious examination to the fundamental craziness that seems to motivate a lot of anti-terror warriors , I am grateful to Natasha for reminding me once again that John Rogers wrote this two years ago : Tyrone :
And again , I must point out Bush said " the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the Muslim masses , allowing them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region . "
That 's what the militants believe .
They may just be delusional .
He says that himself : " Some might be tempted to dismiss these goals as fanatical or extreme .
Well , they are fanatical and extreme -- and they should not be dismissed .
Our enemy is utterly committed . "
John :
But he 's citing that desire as a basis for our strategy .
You can't cite your enemy 's delusional hopes as a basis for a rational strategy .
Goals do n't exist in a vacuum , they 're linked to capability .
David Koresh was utterly committed to being Jesus Christ .
See how far that got him .
Either Bush is making strategy based on a delusional goal of his opponent , which is idiotic ; or he 's saying he believes his opponent has the capability of achieving this delusional goal , which is idiotic .
Neither bodes well for the republic .
I keep forgetting that Bush actually said this explicitly , it 's not just something that shows up in my comment threads from time to time as an incomprehensible response to criticism of BushCo 's little adventure .
And the thing is , they do n't necessarily specify that they are talking about this , they just drop it as a non-sequitur - you say Bush has made a mess of things and we have to get out of Iraq , and they say something about how the Mullahs wo n't have any tolerance for people like me .
And it 's baffling , because it never occurs to you that they really think a handful of Muslim loonies are going to take over the western world .
( It 's also baffling because it is clear that the handful of loonies who have already taken over the western world also have an eliminationist attitude toward people like me , so what 's so special about other people 's crazies ? )
It 's hard , I know .
So much gibberish comes out of Bush 's mouth that it's hard to know what to take seriously , but somehow I missed the fact that this was hiding in plain sight all along .
I do n't have words for how crazy this all is .
Even Harlan Ellison does n't have language for how crazy it all is . |

Notebook
This is rather astonishing .
Redacted from documents censored for national security , a quote form a Supreme Court decision : " The danger to political dissent is acute where the Government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect ' domestic security . '
Given the difficulty of defining the domestic security interest , the danger of abuse in acting to protect that interest becomes apparent .
" Yeah , they would n't want the enemy to get their hands on that .
The irony is unbearable .
( And thanks to Charles for tipping me off to this lovely folly .
I 'd love to go see the thing .
Maybe someone will invite me up to speak in Wigan . )
Why Senator Bernie Will Vote " No " on Mukasey .
Does anyone know what a " Stay away " is ?
I 'd never heard of it before , but Medea Benjamin and others who were arrested before Condi 's hearing started the other day were given something called a " Stay away " and told they could n't be anywhere on Capitol Hill until further notice .
So , apparently , there are n't too many people from Code Pink who can do any actions there for a while .
( There is a call for more women to join to take up the slack , of course . )
New Rules : " We have become most insecure paranoid superpower ever . "
( And , found in the comment thread , this quote from DDE : " If all that Americans want is security , they can go to prison .
They will have enough to eat , a bed , and a roof over their heads .
But if an American wants to preserve his dignity and his equality as a human being , he must not bow his head to any dictatorial government . " ) |

Why some people should stay off the internet :
The House Judiciary Committee accidentally sent the details of all their whistleblowers out to a huge mailing list that got into the hands of Richard Bruce Cheeny .
( I 'm spelling " Cheney " that way because I heard he loves it that no one knows how to pronounce his name . )
Jamison Foser on Matt Drudge 's Mini- Me , Mickey Kaus , who thinks passing on unsourced rumors from a single alleged ( possibly entirely fabricated ) source is the same thing as what Woodward and Bernstein did : " The fact that Kaus apparently has lower evidentiary standards than Matt Drudge is bad enough .
But he does n't stop there :
He chides journalists who do n't follow him in his race to the bottom and mocks those who think reporters should n't repeat as facts the claims of someone else 's single anonymous source . "
My sources tell me , of course , that Mickey Kaus has sex with Goats .
Just how ludicrous is David Horowitz ?
Sinfonian finds him whining because no one wants to listen to him , and Josh sees he thinks having people disagree with conservatives is like putting a noose at their doors .
Kevin is talking bollocks again .
No , Kevin , the Democrats were not in the wilderness because of liberal policies .
They never did move " to the center " .
They were right - of - center already , and then they moved right , and then they sorta won the presidency for a bit but lost Congress .
Then they so totally failed to fight their corner that they managed to lose the presidency to people who openly deride the Constitution and have hugely unpopular policies .
( The fact that they are even more unpopular now does n't mean they were popular then . )
Trifecta wonders , " Why is it that if a candidate has popular ideas , they are " unelectable " ? " and then presents a fine platform . |

Tip sheet Pruning Shears is suggesting that Dodd 's leadership on FISA is changing the calculus for the Democratic nomination .
Me , I do n't know , but via Buzzflash I see that this interesting poll included some questions about Al Gore , including : DEMOCRATIC CHOICE FOR THE NOMINATION
( Among Democratic primary voters )
Clinton ...37
Gore ...... 32
Obama .....16
Edwards ....7
Gore took support from all the major candidates .
In the first horserace question , which did not explicitly offer Gore as a choice , 2 % of Democratic Primary voters volunteered Gore ’s name .
46 % of registered voters view Al Gore favorably , his highest rating since October , 2000 .
Interestingly , his favorables are as high as they were in 2000 and his unfavorables are much lower than they 've been in previous polls ( and Undecided / Do n't Know is much higher than it was in 2000 ) .
Alas , there is also this : AS PRESIDENT , HOW WOULD THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HANDLE IRAQ ?
( Among Democratic primary voters )
Remove Most Troops From Iraq :
Clinton ..... 65 percent
Obama ....... 54 percent
Edwards ..... 44 percent Keep most troops in Iraq
Clinton ..... 27 percent
Obama ....... 28 percent
Edwards ..... 32 percent * sigh * |

Only words Lambert finds an interesting speech by Steny Hoyer ( Steny Hoyer ! ) in which he stands up for restoring the Constitution .
The speech , delivered a couple days ago at Georgetown Law School , has many fine words about the obligation of legislators such as himself to uphold the Constitution , and these : Simply stated , it would be grossly irresponsible for Congress to grant blanket immunity for companies without even knowing whether their conduct was legal or not .
And , importantly , this view is shared by the Chairman and Ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
I 'm not happy with that " without even knowing whether their conduct was legal or not " - this should n't even be a question .
If they did n't break the law , they do n't need immunity , and if they did ( or do ) , they should n't have immunity .
It 's nice if this phrase is included as a lure to get Bush to give them information , but not if it 's going to be a basis for how they vote ; they should never give them immunity , period .
Hoyer also said :
Let me add that I also believe we made a tremendous mistake in eliminating the right of habeas corpus .
Congress must revisit this issue .
Y'think ?
So , how did that happen ?
How do Democrats just happen to make these stupid mistakes ?
Were you asleep ?
Were you absent that day ?
Did the dog eat your homework ?
* Sigh *
You can call Steny 's office on ( 202 ) 225-4131 and tell him you agree completely and hope to see this sentiment expressed with a complete refusal by Congress to grant any immunity to the telecoms .
Natasha : " In other words , follow closely here , upholding the Constitution is a partisan left position in American politics now .
Utterly disregarding it is the partisan right position .
Deciding that utter disregard for it needs to be smoothed over by special legal dispensation , so we do n't have to settle the question distastefully in court , is centrist . "
In the WaPo , Eugene Robinson talks about Republican Hot Flashes and their unmanly insecurities ( particularly in regard to SCHIP and the Dream Act ) , and Michael Gerson writes an astonishingly inoffensive column about faith and tolerance ( as seen through Harry Potter ) , something I thought it impossible for a Republican to even recall .
Meanwhile , Krazy Krauthammer says the Republicans have a terrific presidential field because , after all , Reagan was really just as crappy .
Well , he does n't exactly use those words , but ....
Actually , I do n't think for a minute that Romney 's Osama / Obama " error " was a mistake .
Perhaps it was said best by the commenter who replied , " Romney ?
Was n't he the Nazi tank commander ? " |

Do the right thing Kevin Drum has a question that should n't need asking : when we blogosphere types complain about this weak - kneed attitude , are we complaining because ( a ) we think the centrists are wrong ; they could keep their seats in marginal districts even if they toed the progressive line on national security issues .
Or ( b ) because we do n't care ; they should do the right thing even if it means losing next November ?
Is it really likely that a huge number of voters are going to reject legislators because they refused to give telecoms immunity after breaking the law ?
I do n't think so .
But legislators are supposed to uphold the Constitution , and if they do n't do it , they should n't be in office .
More importantly , why should I want them in office if they wo n't do it ?
Look , right - wingers are n't going to vote for Democrats , even if they seem almost like Republicans , when they can vote for actual Republicans .
Progressives do n't do much for Democrats who seem almost like Republicans - often , they wo n't even vote .
( Remember Harold Ford ?
He 's the poster child for guys who " had to " run to the right in their reddish districts .
He lost .
Some people want to say it was because he was black , but that 's not why progressives did n't vote for him . )
And it does n't matter what you do , the GOP will still say you do n't support the troops and you hate America and are a far - left moonbat just because you 're a Democrat .
So , if you want to do the wrong thing to get votes , run as a Republican .
If you run as a Democrat , you 'd better be willing to do the right thing , or we have no use for you .
You just make it seem more obvious that " there is no difference between the two parties , " and that means people wo n't get out and vote .
( And Senators who do n't have to run again for another four or six years really should n't be using this as an excuse .
The handful of people who hate you for voting against telecom immunity wo n't even remember it in 2010 or 2012 .
But I would n't make the same bet that progressives will forget your betrayals of the Constitution . ) |

Say it with me : I 'm pro-life , and you 're not .
Amanda Marcotte has a post up at Reality Check , " Anti-Choice Lingo Decoded " , which provides my good quote of the morning :
When an anti-choicer petulantly says , " Sex has consequences , " he usually means , " People are getting away with having sex and we should artificially introduce more risks in order to scare people off of it . "
Bean at Lawyers , Guns and Money adds : Amanda 's right to lift the oh - so - sheer sheet of euphemism to reveal the dirty underbelly of their smart talk .
But what she does n't address -- and what I think is important -- is why their rhetoric is so powerful and ours is , well , not .
They won the war of words .
Think about it : most Americans still use " pro-life " to describe the forced pregnancy movement and still label people who support reproductive justice as pro-abortion ( as in , we love a procedure that can include invasive surgery !
Woo hoo ! ) .
While it 's good to decode their language , it only gets us so far .
What 's next - - and perhaps even more important -- is figuring out how to get away from that language , not only in our happy progressive blog world , but more broadly .
So long as we are not understood to be " pro-life " -- despite the fact that we are actually the only ones in this debate who actually are supportive of life -- we wo n't be able to make any gains .
Blogs would be a good start , though - it has long aggravated me that there are people throughout the liberal community who persist in thoughtlessly identifying the forced - pregnancy movement as " pro-life " .
Look , they are not pro-life , on this or any other issue , and you know it , so why keep doing this ?
They are n't opposing women 's reproductive control because they want to save lives , they are opposing women 's reproductive control because they oppose women 's reproductive control .
They want women to be punished for having sex .
They do n't care if people die .
None of their policies have anything to do with protecting life .
If anything , they deserve to be called the " pro-death " movement , because that 's where their policies go - including their position on reproductive choice .
We are the pro-life movement .
We 're the ones who want to stop war and care for the poor and the sick .
We 're the ones who want to make sure children in our society are taken care of .
And we 're the ones who want to be sure that children are loved and their mothers do n't die having abortions .
The anti-choicers do n't want women to have abortions even when they know that both mother and fetus will die as a result of the pregnancy .
Even when they know that there will never , ever be a live birth .
And if it 's a choice between the mother and the life of a blastocyst , they will always choose against the woman .
Their policies are so punitive that you can't help getting the impression that they enjoy the fact that women will die .
And they certainly do n't worry about all those children their wars are killing .
Nor do they care about all the children who are dying in America because of lack of healthcare .
They are petty and nasty and spiteful and murderous people and it is disgusting that they call themselves " pro-life " .
" Pro-life " is how they want to be identified because it steals the moral high - ground for them .
Do n't help them out , eh ? |

They 're stealing the media
The FCC is trying to sneak one past us again - they suddenly announced that they were going to announce the new rules on media monopoly in a month .
That 's not a lot of time for consultation with the public , is it ?
And it 's clear that they want to do is eliminate the restrictions on media monopolies .
It would become legal for one entity to own all the newspapers , radio stations , television stations , etc. , in an area .
Maybe even the entire country .
Obviously , this is something that has to be stopped , and fast .
Byron Dorgan is leading the charge : U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) predicted Wednesday the Senate will vote to reject efforts to relax media ownership rules .
" If the FCC proceeds on the schedule it is planning , it will be a big mistake , " Dorgan said .
" It 's clear the concentration of media ownership that has already taken place has not been good for our country .
I 'm confident any plan to allow additional concentration of media ownership will be rejected .
"
Dorgan said the rushed schedule the FCC is planning for proposing and voting on the proposed rules change is also unacceptable .
" In a democracy , making sure that citizens are able to get news and information from a variety of independently owned sources is crucial , " Dorgan said .
" We already have too much concentration of media ownership .
Before the FCC moves forward to allow even more , we need to have an informed , reasoned and unrushed discussion about that .
The American people need to be heard . "
I disagree with Dorgan on a number of things , but this is one that he 's right on .
Rachel interviewed him on her show , and as always you can hear it here until it 's replaced with the next show .
Barack Obama has called the FCC 's call for an early vote on the rules change " irresponsible " : " Minority - owned and - operated newspapers and radio stations play a critical role in the African - American and Latino communities and bring minority issues to the forefront of our national discussion , " writes Obama , also a Democratic candidate for president .
" However , the commission has failed to further the goals of diversity in the media and promote localism , and , as a result , it is in no position to justify allowing for increased consolidation of the market . "
Meanwhile , in the continuing story of conservatives buying up local stations that carry Air America Radio and turning them to Christian , sports , or Spanish - language programming ( usually in markets that are already saturated with same ) , despite the fact that AAR gets higher listenership , Austin 's KOKE went dark earlier this month and the local community is trying to get together to get another station to carry AAR . |

Land of the free , continued Steve Bergstein was reading a rather exciting and revealing court decision :
The long and the short of it was that an Egpytian national , Abdallah Higazy , was staying in a hotel in New York City on September 11 and the hotel emptied out when the planes hit the towers .
The hotel later found in the closet of his room a device that allows you to communicate with airline pilots .
Investigators thought this guy had something to do with 9/11 so they questioned him .
According to Higazi , the investigators coerced him into confessing to a role in 9/11 .
Higazi first adamantly denied any involvement with 9/11 and could not believe what was happening to him .
Then , he says , the investigator said his family would go through hell in Egypt , where they torture people like Saddam Hussein .
Higazy then realized he had a choice : he could continue denying the radio was his and his family suffers ungodly torture in Egypt or he confesses and his family is spared .
Of course , by confessing , Higazy 's life is worth garbage at that point , but ... well , that 's why coerced confessions are outlawed in the United States .
So Higazy " confesses " and he 's processed by the criminal justice system .
His future is quite bleak .
Meanwhile , an airline pilot later shows up at the hotel and asks for his radio back .
This is like something out of the movies .
The radio belonged to the pilot , not Higazy , and Higazy was free to go , the victim of horrible timing .
Higazi was innocent !
He next sued the hotel and the FBI agent for coercing his confession .
The bottom line in the Court of Appeals : Higazy has a case and may recover damages for this injustice .
As I read the opinion I realized it was a 44 page epic , too long for me to print out .
I blogged about the opinion while I read it online and then posted the blog as I ate lunch .
Then something strange happened : a few minutes after I posted the blog , the opinion vanished from the Court of Appeals website !
I had never seen this before , and what made all the more strange was that it involved a coerced confession over 9/11 .
What the hell was going on ?
I let some other legal bloggers know about this , particularly the How Appealing blog and Appellate Law and Practice .
They both ran a commentary on the missing opinion .
Then someone sent How Appealing a PDF of the decision ( probably very few of them were floating around since the opinion was posted for a brief period of time ) and How Appealing posted the decision .
Then things got even stranger .
The Court of Appeals actually phoned How Appealing to request that he remove the opinion from his website since it contained classified information .
The Court said that a revised opinion would come out the next day without the classified information .
How Appealing actually refused to remove the opinion .
Through it all , hundreds of people came to my legal blog to see my summary of the opinion .
It was either my blog or printing out and reading a 44 page epic .
The next day , the Court of Appeals reissued the Higazy opinion .
With a redaction .
You should read the whole thing , but the short version is that there was top secret information about how they extract confessions that must n't get into enemy hands - that is , that you can threaten people to get " confessions " out of them .
Because no one would ever think of that , and no one knows we 've already been doing it and it's been in all the papers for several years now .
In other anti-terrorist follies , a judge declares a mistrial in the case of someone who appears to have no ties to terrorism , rather than allow a proper " not guilty " - so the government can waste more money trying the same non-terrorist again .

Checkin ' it out In The New York Times , Adam Liptak is talking about the loss of free speech in America , in " Say What You Like , Just Do n’t Say It Here . "
As we know , foreign academics and even artists are being denied entry to the US because they are critical of our government ( or just Muslims in some cases ) . "
The question before the judges considering the two cases is thus a difficult one .
What role should the First Amendment play when foreigners are doing the talking and the topic may be terror ? "
Of course , this should n't even be a question .
Free speech just is n't a sometimes thing .
( Nor is the topic " terror " just because the government chooses to ignore some kinds of terrorism and focus on others . )
Richard Bruce Cheney gave a speech containing some predictable lies and ginning up war against Iran , and Gregory at Belgravia Dispatch says : " It 's really an appallingly strange time in our country .
We have a singularly powerful Vice - President ( compared to any of his predecessors ) - - openly quite enamored by the tactics employed by the Soviet Union - - our former arch - foe whose human rights standards we derided .
Indeed , we fought a decades - long Cold War so that Western style constitutional freedoms would trump Soviet authoritarianism .
But yes , from this Sovietophile posture , use of torture and black - sites and detention without habeas corpus protections makes all the sense in the world , does n't it ?
Because we have a Vice - President all but openly emulating and cheer - leading the tactics of the KGB , not in the wilds of Wyoming , but to a soi disant sophisticated audience in Washington DC .
Put differently , he is very proud of his world - view , indeed eager to share it with Beltway ' elites ' .
Who will clear this dangerous rot out of Washington and help us restore our good name ?
The stakes are high , that is , the preservation of the American democratic model as a leading force for moderation and rule of law on the world stage .

So , this guy I have n't heard from in a couple of decades sends me an e-mail and says he's in town and can I get up to Kilburn on Sunday night , and he Has A Plan .
Now , I do n't like to go out Sunday nights because that means I miss Sam Seder live on the SammyCam , but I always did like Graham and he 's being all mysterious , so how can I refuse ?
It 's supposedly for dinner but due to some bad timing and messed up trains I missed that part and end up in this little place where P.F. Sloan is playing .
I 've been hooked on PFS since I was 14 but I 've never seen him play .

I hear he was n't that good as a sports reporter , either
It would almost be a decent column about what 's wrong with the line - item veto , a stupid idea that conservatives have been pushing for decades , now , except that , this being George F . Will , he completely fails to mention that his arguments apply equally to the " unitary executive " theory and signing statements , and he also says :
The line - item veto expresses liberalism 's faith in top - down government and the watery Caesarism that has produced today 's inflated presidency .
Liberalism assumes that executive branch experts , free from parochial constituencies , know , as Congress does not , what is good for the nation " as a whole . "
This is contrary to the public philosophy of James Madison 's " extensive " republic with its many regions and myriad interests .
I see .
In the same way that Republicans persistently expand government when they are in power , and then complain that " liberals believe in big government " , we are now being given a new theory of liberalism that is defined by the runaway executive best exemplified by George Bush , Dick Cheney and their authoritarian supporters . |

Only you can save America
As I mentioned earlier , Democratic Party insiders - and I include many good - guys in this - perceive the netroots as people who stay home in front of their computers instead of getting out and doing something .
To a certain extent , this is true - a lot of people are devoting their energies to blogging rather than to public activism , and it seems to have enervating effect for many .
But the netroots do make a difference , as Chris Bowers details here .
Online activism has generated quite a bit more money than you may realize , particularly for candidates who have had little support from the party itself .
As Chris notes , this is especially useful in that it creates challenges that draw resources from the GOP in areas where they thought they would n't have to fight .
And many people who have gotten involved online do indeed get involved in the real world - pay particular attention to Chris ' sixth point , about people who are networked into local party infrastructure via the net .
If you really want to make a difference , use that as an instruction - a lot of positions in local party groups are vacant because they do n't have enough people do to the work .
You can amplify your own voice considerably by getting involved at that level .
But , as I say , getting out there in the streets is important .
The new new mobe to end the war in Iraq is set for Saturday , October 27th , and there are regional demos planned for 11 cities , none of which , I 'm interested to note , is Washington , DC .
I do n't know why that is , but perhaps it would be a good day for hundreds of people to show up at The Washington Post demanding more honest coverage of what 's happening on the Hill .
Perhaps being mobbed would wake them up .
It is unfair to blame the American people for the wretched job our " leaders " are doing ; they 're smarter than legislators who get their cues from the media .
As eRobin says , " I submit that the American people can get their teeth into and their heads around any crisis facing the country if the facts of it are presented to them clearly and repeatedly .
It 's the powers that be behind the corporate media in whom I have no faith .
" Americans have decided without the help of the press that our country is being mismanaged .
Now someone has to tell our " public servants " .
Unfortunately , they read The Washington Post . |

" Mrs. Peel , we 're needed . "
Paul Krugman and MahaBarb both have things to say about how the Democratic Party has been winning back corporate donors and how that may bode ill for progressives , but there has always been a way to counterbalance that , and it 's still true .
After all , in the days before Rove / Bush , business used to give to both parties .
So , when did progressive do better ?
When we put our bodies where our politics were .
One reason why a lot of Democratic Party insiders have a lot of contempt for bloggers is that we are sitting in front of our computers getting fat rather than getting out where it becomes a public affair .
It 's all very well to phone and mail legislatures ( and you should ) , but you need to be out there where people can see you .
Yes , I know people are still shy about being associated with the circus , but visibility matters .
It 's a lot harder for the talking heads to pretend that Bush is still popular and people do n't mind the destruction of the Constitution if they 're being deafened by protests .
And 2007 is not 1968 .
The public is n't freaked out by hippies anymore , it 's freaked out by losing a major American city , and being known as a nation of torturers , and having our money sucked away by an illegal war and assorted con-men in expensive suits .
Thom Hartmann often points out that neither of the Roosevelts ran as progressives , and Lyndon Johnson certainly did n't run on civil rights .
When progressives came to FDR with their program he let them know that he was convinced , but he needed one more thing : " Make me . "
They did it because we made them .
It was n't done just by people sitting at home and writing .
Yes , I know the media seems to find it easy to down - play public action .
That just means there 's a need to get better at being more visible .
Take your demonstrations to the media .
I 'm all for a big demonstration at the doors of The Washington Post , and one the next weekend at NBC , and the next weekend at CBS , and the next weekend at ABC , and the next weekend at The New York Times .
Wear a suit .
Have a simple message :
Stop the war , bring freedom back to America .

Stuff I found
So , the other day I complained that , though Al Gore warned us not to get into Iraq , I had n't heard him say anything about getting out .
Then I learned that Citizen Gore has been making little movies on important topics on Current TV , and he posted one the very next day saying we need to get the troops home as quickly as possible .
He also says we need to be protected against the government spying on us , and that healthcare is a right .
These are n't impassioned or detailed speeches , they 're just concise , plain - language statements of personal views , part of a series of them from users , on various topics .
The WaPo op - ed " The Real Iraq We Knew " does n't say anything you did n't already know , but it 's 12 former Army captains saying it , and they are n't messing around : " There is one way we might be able to succeed in Iraq .
To continue an operation of this intensity and duration , we would have to abandon our volunteer military for compulsory service .
Short of that , our best option is to leave Iraq immediately .
A scaled withdrawal will not prevent a civil war , and it will spend more blood and treasure on a losing proposition .
America , it has been five years .
It 's time to make a choice . "
They say it " might " work , but I think it 's probably too late for that , too .
If it was ever going to work , it would have to have been before BushCo screwed it up .
( via ) New Council of Europe Recommendation fails to uphold online freedom of expression : " European Digital Rights ( EDRI ) wishes to express its serious concerns over the adoption on 26 September 2007 by the Council of Europe ( CoE ) Committee of Ministers of a new Recommendation on ' promoting freedom of expression and information in the new information and communications environment ' ( Rec ( 2007 ) 11 ) .

We consider the result to be promoting opaque " self - regulation " and other soft law instruments driven by private interests and implemented through technical mechanisms .
As a result , we have great concern that the Recommendation will fail to uphold respect for freedom of expression and information in the online world .

Things to see Spencer Ackerman is recommending the PBS Frontline feature Cheney 's Law , and provides a preview .
I have to take issue with the idea that Cheney was only trying to expand a president 's war powers - it 's clear that Cheney makes no distinction between times of war and other times .
For one thing , he started up the FISA violation program before 9/11 .
Greenwald on The conservative vision of America , by National Review : " And what of the fact that the U.S. has managed under every President from Carter to Clinton to defend itself in compliance with this horrendous " probable cause " burden under FISA , even as Ronald Reagan -- as the National Review folklore goes -- heroically vanquished the Soviet Empire ?
According to NR , that all happened before the Greatest and Most Sophisticated Threat Ever Known to Mankind -- small roving bands of stateless and army - less Islamic Terrorists -- Changed the World Forever " See , in the olden days , our opponents were gentlemen , like the commies and Nazis .

Internet nights
The scariest guy in the race is far - left loony John Edwards , judging from the horrors Bill O'Reilly warns of .
Glenn Greenwald is worried , too : " Who could even fathom an America plagued by habeas corpus , search warrants , and a military that fails to beat , freeze and mock - execute its detainees ?
And nothing is more sacred to core American values than branding other countries ' armies as " Terrorists " ( " The [ Revolutionary ] Guard is the SS of Iran " ) . " I bet he reads Marx or something .
Problem is - as Glenn notes - it 's not just the O'Reilly 's that seem to feel this way , but the " serious " folk in the mainstream press , as well .
Not that you did n't already know this , but it 's definitely the right - wingers who are spitting on the troops this time .
Digby discusses .
Paul Krugman on Gore Derangement Syndrome : " What is it about Mr. Gore that drives right - wingers insane ?
Partly it ’s a reaction to what happened in 2000 , when the American people chose Mr. Gore but his opponent somehow ended up in the White House .
Both the personality cult the right tried to build around President Bush and the often hysterical denigration of Mr. Gore were , I believe , largely motivated by the desire to expunge the stain of illegitimacy from the Bush administration .
And now that Mr. Bush has proved himself utterly the wrong man for the job - to be , in fact , the best president Al Qaeda ’s recruiters could have hoped for - the symptoms of Gore derangement syndrome have grown even more extreme .
" Claims that Obama is a practicing Muslim circulated briefly but faded from the mainstream media after Obama stood up and said they were nonsense .
But it turns out they 're still circulating under the radar in e-mail that suggests he 's part of the extremist agenda .

Onward Christian atheist soldiers A funny thing happened at the Freedom from Religion Convention , as PZ Myers reports :
Then it was Hitchens at his most bellicose .
He told us what the most serious threat to the West was ( and you know this line already ) : it was Islam .
Then he accused the audience of being soft on Islam , of being the kind of vague atheists who refuse to see the threat for what it was , a clash of civilizations , and of being too weak to do what was necessary , which was to spill blood to defeat the enemy .
Along the way he told us who his choice for president was right now - Rudy Giuliani - and that Obama was a fool , Clinton was a pandering closet fundamentalist , and that he was less than thrilled about all the support among the FFRF for the Democratic party .
We cannot afford to allow the Iranian theocracy to arm itself with nuclear weapons ( something I entirely sympathize with ) , and that the only solution is to go in there with bombs and marines and blow it all up .
The way to win the war is to kill so many Moslems that they begin to question whether they can bear the mounting casualties .
It was simplistic us - vs. - them thinking at its worst , and the only solution he had to offer was death and destruction of the enemy .
Marvellous .
But it 's not merely that he thinks " we " can defeat an " enemy " that is actually bigger than we are , but he does n't seem to have worked out who " we " are , either :
This whole last third of his talk had me concerned about the first part .
He had just told us in strong terms about the failures of religion and its detrimental effect on our culture , and now he was explaining to us how the solution in the Middle East was to simply kill everyone who disagreed with you .
He did n't relate the two parts of his talk , which was unfortunate .
I 'd like to know whether he thinks the way atheists ought to end religion in America is to start shooting Baptists , or whether he sees other ways to educate and enlighten - in which case I wonder why he does n't see any virtue in applying those same methods to Islam .
I did n't ask the question since the line for the microphone was long , and I had a depressing feeling that the solution would involve sending the Baptists over to Iraq to kill and be killed .
This is not my freethought movement .
The Hitchens solution is not my solution .
Hitchens ' " atheism " turns out to be indistinguishable from everything he 's said is wrong with religion - Jihad , Crusades , and all .

" I 'm sentimental , if you know what I mean " I want to emphasize that my point about Gore is n't that he would n't be the best person for the job , but rather that I think he needs to do more work if he 's going to get the kind of support he needs to beat the machine .
Of course , so do the rest of us - people will need to be prepared to get behind the nominee , whoever it is , in a big way , or the media will take him apart and the Democratic Party leadership will help them .
( Well , the Democratic Party leadership might be willing to get behind Hillary , since they seem determined to make her the nominee and she seems to be doing all the " right " things to please the DLC - unsurprising , since she is still one of them . )
I think Gore really is the best person for the job , you understand .
I do n't mean just that he's " the anti-Bush " , but that we need someone with towering stature in the rest of the world , too , and he 's certainly got that .
Foser - Members of the corporate media seem to be outraged that some Democrats criticized Rush Limbaugh , because it smacks of government censorship , they say - yet they were unfazed by formal condemnation in both houses of Congress of MoveOn .
And , of course , right - wing attacks on Media Matters for America itself continue , including from known GOP shills who say that MM 's work can be dismissed because they are progressive .
But that 's the right wing , for you - they have to attack the messenger because they can't deal with the message .
MahaBarb has an extremely linky post which , among other things , notes some of the whacky responses the wrong - wingers have provided to this weekend 's NYT op - eds .

Of record
In the NYT , Bob Herbert tells the truth : When I heard that Mr. Gore had won the Nobel , my thoughts wandered to the younger Mr. Bush and to Rudolph Giuliani , who is leading the current field of Republican presidential candidates .
Mr. Bush came to mind because , for all of the obvious vulnerabilities he exhibited in 2000 , it was not him but Mr. Gore who was mocked unmercifully by the national media .
And the mockery had nothing to do with the former vice president ’s positions on important policy issues .
He was mocked because of his personality .
In the race for the highest office in the land , we showed the collective maturity of 3 - year - olds .
Notice he says " we " .
And he does n't mean , " all Americans are guilty " in that vague , mistakes - were - made way certain of his colleagues use to wave the thing away .
One of them is Frank Rich , who still has n't apologized for his treatment of Gore , and today is blaming you and me for the fact that BushCo has been literally getting away with murder , not to mention destroying the country .
Yes , I 'm sure we could all be doing a lot more , but the thing that 's supposed to help protect us against this sort of thing is called a " free press " , although at this point it 's only the paid press that seems to be able to break big stories , and I have n't seen them inviting you and me to make our case .
True , the NYT has been a little better these days than it was during 2000 and certainly during the run-up to invasion of Iraq , but it 's still pretty wibbly and moronic a lot of the time , and anyway the broadcasters seem to have developed a preference for The Washington Post , which continues to carry water for the administration .
( I see Face the Nation is devoted today to John McCain , a presidential candidate who has about three supporters left and no one believes is ever going to be president .
The rest of the shows look little better .
Is anyone actually talking about those big stories about BushCo corruption Rich mentions ?
No ?
You can bet O'Reilly and Limbaugh will be giving the administration spin to plenty of listeners .
Where 's Charlie Savage ?
Where 's Glenn Greenwald ? )
Hundreds of people went out and marched and no one paid attention - or else pretended that there are just as many people supporting Bush as opposing him .
Meanwhile , the press encourages Democratic leaders to feel it is safe to ignore the demands of their " crazy " , " left - wing " constituents .
On the bright side , Maureen Dowd , who sort of ( but unconvincingly ) once said , " Forgive me , Al Gore , " after a long record of saying things the rest of us should not forgive her for - and who is doing her best to repeat that performance ( " Obambi " ) this time around - let Stephen Colbert write her column today , which is an improvement .
First , she quotes him from a recent appearance by way of introduction :
He was sneering that Times columns make good " kindling . "
He was ranting that after you throw away the paper , " it takes over a hundred years for the lies to biodegrade . "
I 'm told he added , " And another six months if there 's a Thomas Friedman column in it . "
I like Colbert , but the best thing about this column is that there 's less Dowd in it .

So ... Draft Al Gore ?
In the wake of the ad in the NYT and the awarding of the Nobel , a lot is being said , again , about how much better off we'd be with a president like Al Gore .
Once upon a time , I would have said that , hey , it 's October , it 's still early .
It seems like that was the theory four years ago , and it was probably right .
So , why am I , of all people , suddenly not in the mood to jump on the bandwagon ?
Well , partly , I 'm not sure the groundwork has been completed .
On the two biggest issues underlying all the others , Al Gore has been silent , and that 's not a good thing .
Yes , Al Gore was the first to stand up and explain why we should not invade Iraq , and why the administration 's other policies that violate both the Constitution and all human decency , in the name of " The War On Terror " , are wrong and should be stopped .
He 's been brilliant in that regard .
But he has n't said anything about pulling out .
And he 's said nothing about Iran .
And on the destruction of the American economy , which NAFTA underlies in a big way , Gore has offered only the very vaguest repudiation of precisely the way it has been carried out , but from Al Gore we would need a great deal more than that .
Vice President Gore played a significant role in the passage of NAFTA , and was a major proponent of the belief that " free trade " would be good for America 's economy - and it's pretty clear that Gore was wrong .
There are those who maintain ( and not without justification ) that Gore 's loss in Ohio was directly down to the instinctive recognition by many ordinarily Democratic voters that Ross Perot was right ; it may even be why Clinton was never able to get a majority of the vote .
Al Gore long ago distanced himself from the DLC , but it was largely on the invasion , not on trade .
And the disastrous employment and trade policies that started with Reagan , were stepped up by Clinton , and have gone into overdrive under Bush , must be repudiated and overturned if America is really going to be saved , because an eroded middle - class just is n't strong enough to demand restoration of our democracy .
It 's true that Gore made the very important step of being the first leading Democrat to advocate for single - payer , but he seems to have stopped there .
Healthcare is not our only economic problem .
I think there are still a lot of people who are n't prepared to forgive him for NAFTA , and he has made no moves to court those people .
If , in the course of the last few years , Gore had included in his wonderful speeches one or two about the mistakes we have made - that he made - by allowing our economy to be pirated away as it has been , I would not hesitate to say that he is the person who should be running right now .
But I 'm not so sure , now .
He needs to repudiate NAFTA in a big way , and I 'm not even sure he 's prepared to do that .
There 's no doubt in my mind that he 's been transformed by his bath of fire - his statement on single - payer is proof of that - but he may still feel too wedded to NAFTA to openly treat it as the mistake it was .
For the last seven and a half years , my support for Gore has owed a lot to the fact that he should be president - not in 2008 , but right now .
Because we elected him .
And because eight years of George Walker Bush and Richard Bruce Cheney could never be anything but a disaster .
But right now ...
I 'm feeling twitchy . |

Notations
At long last , it seems that some people who call themselves " pro-life " are actually standing up for the lives of children in a new ad campaign : " I 'm the mother of three children , and I 'm pro-life .
I believe that protecting the lives our children must be our nation 's number one moral priority .
That 's why I 'm concerned that Congressman X says he 's pro-life but votes against health care for poor children .
That 's not pro-life .
That 's not pro-family .
Tell Congressman
X to vote for health care for children .
Call him today at XXXX , that 's XXXXX . "
C&L has the ad .
Now , if only we can get across to these people that abortion bans do n't reduce abortion , they just kill mothers .
My father made his own bumper - sticker saying , " We remember April 15 , 1914 , " with scimitars dripping blood on either side , and stuck it in the back window of his station wagon .
Now , I adored my father , and we were on the same side of most issues , but for a change I had to agree with my mother when she said something like , " Oh , Gary , is that necessary ? "
Still , it pains me to have to say that Bush was right about this :
It was hardly urgent to waste energy insulting Turkey on behalf of Americans of Armenian extraction whose parents raised them to hate the Turks ( like me ) .
It 's worth noting that it took a good deal more than a century before Americans began making a serious effort to recognize the moral horror of our own country 's origins in genocide - and that was perhaps made a bit easier by the fact that many of us had no roots among the early settlers , being from families that had only set foot on American shores in the late 19th or early 20th centuries ( like me ) .
It 's not that I would n't like to see Turkey make a similar re-examination of their past , but I have to agree with those who say that this is not the time , and shoring up a bunch of votes in Fresno is n't a sufficiently compelling cause for it , either .
( And , really , if you can't defend the US Constitution , who are you to judge the Turks ? )
Maybe foreign policy should not be hostage to this sort of thing .
You know , I can't help the feeling that the cool idea the Marines have for wanting to be redeployed to Afghanistan suggests they are n't terribly gung - ho about Iraq .
I mean , why else would they think it would enhance efficiency to go to a land - locked country ?
( And who would want to serve alongside people who actually draw their weapons on US soldiers ? )
Stealing from the best :
It looks like one of Mark Evanier 's readers has found a short - cut for getting the kind of letters he'd like to see into The Washington Times , by the simple expedient of plagiarizing from Mark 's blog .
I can't fault the guy 's choices , but what 's truly remarkable is that they get printed in the Moonie paper .
Honestly , I think we all hope , in the back of our minds , that our smarter insights will be propagated ( although getting credit would be nice ) , but I 'm right there with Mark when he complains , " Y'know , I do n't mind the guy stealing my writing ... but he also stole my father . "
Someone please tell me what this is and why I can't see it .

Suggestion box PERRspectives suggests some conservative Nobel Prizes : " Predictably , the conservative chattering class and its amen corner in the right - wing blogosphere are apoplectic about the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Al Gore .
But their rage and angst about the Nobel Committee 's " politicized awards " for " mass exaggerators " and " deceptive rhetoric " is n't merely a function of the inconvenient truth of the success of Gore 's global warming campaign .
No , the rugged individualists of the right are just hopping mad that they never win prizes designed to recognize contributions to , well , the rest of humanity .

Rush Limbaugh did n't inject an " ideology of hate " into conservatism , he extracted the contemptuous , divisive animosity inherent in the Gingrich doctrine and sugared it up with comedy and his own personal saga for popular consumption .
He , like Clarence Thomas , was just what the Republican overseers ordered .
" Robert Farley : " Quite right .
Rush and Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin are n't aberrations that the Right can explain away ; they are , to borrow Glenn Reynolds phrase , the authentic face of the American Right .
They determine the terms of debate , decide on the points of emphasis , and unleash the bloodthirsty mobs .
They are the literal manifestation of American reactionary ressentiment .
" Ann Coulter 's attack on Jews puts Thom Hartmann in mind another conservative creep : " Similarly , Justice Antonin Scalia turned history on its head several years ago when he attended an Orthodox synagogue in New York and claimed that the Founders intended for their Christianity to play a part in government .
Scalia then went so far as to suggest that the reason Hitler was able to initiate the Holocaust was because of German separation of church and state . [...]
Justice Scalia and Ann Coulter may well benefit from looking back at the photographs that came out of Germany that were all over the newspapers and news magazines at war ’s end .
The photos that can be seen , for instance , at [ link ] of the Catholic Bishops giving the collective Nazi salute .
The annual April 20th celebration , declared by Pope Pius XII , of Hitler ’s birthday .
The belt buckles of the German army , which declared " Gott Mit Uns " ( " God is with us " ) .
The pictures of the 1933 investiture of Bishop Ludwig Müller , the official Bishop of the 1000 - Years - Of - Peace Nazi Reich .
That last photo should be the most problematic for Ann Coulter and Justice Scalia , because Hitler had done exactly what Scalia is recommending - he merged church and state .
" The Founders knew what they were doing .
Some days it seems like wanting accountability is the only thing left that 's illegal : " The director of the Central Intelligence Agency , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , has ordered an unusual internal inquiry into the work of the agency ’s inspector general , whose aggressive investigations of the C.I.A. ’s detention and interrogation programs and other matters have created resentment among agency operatives .

Article 1 Everybody needs one of these : WASHINGTON , Oct. 10 - The way Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky sees it , lawmakers on Capitol Hill and Americans everywhere have forgotten who the Founding Fathers really intended to run the country -- not the President who was more of a Constitutional after - thought but the Congress , the people ’s elected representatives .
Mr. Yarmuth said he and many of the 41 other freshman Democrats in the House had been puzzling for some time over just how to remind voters of this , how to mold a most basic lesson of American civics so that it could be carried far and wide by the modern techniques of political messaging .
And then an idea struck .
Today , on the House floor , Mr. Yarmuth began distributing small buttons , seemingly made of parchment , with the words , " Article 1 " - as in Article 1 of the Constitution , which states , " All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . "
In other words : Mr. President , the Congress would like to remind you , that you , dear pal , are Article 2 .
Of course , if Congress acted like they were familiar with Article 1 , it'd be a lot harder for others to forget .
" All legislative powers are vested in the Congress and , in fact , the Constitution grants very limited powers to the executive branch , " Mr. Yarmuth said .
" We lost sight of that . "
The Article 1 buttons , he said , were " a reminder that we have not just power but responsibility under the Constitution .
Hopefully , if this catches on , the public will see that we understand our power and our responsibility . "
It 's not the button that 'll demonstrate that .
Mr. Yarmuth acknowledged that some of his fellow Democrats were not quite up to speed on Constitutional fine - print .
More than one , he said , had asked " Article 1 ?
Which one is that again ? "
In some cases , he said they confused it with the First Amendment .
And , of course : Some Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , were supportive and accepted a button but did not put it on , apparently unwilling to let the Founding Fathers interfere with fashion .
That 'd be the fashion of pretending there is no Article 1 . |

It 's going around Paul Waldman : " Last Tuesday , a remarkable article appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal , able chronicler of the interests and habits of America 's economic elite .
" GOP Is Losing Grip On Core Business Vote , " it read , no doubt causing more than a few Republican strategists to spit out their morning coffee . " Yep , it 's finally started to come to their attention that conservatives are bad for business .
Jimmy Carter on Dick Cheney : " He 's a militant who avoided any service of his own in the military and he has been most forceful in the last 10 years or more in fulfilling some of his more ancient commitments that the United States has a right to inject its power through military means in other parts of the world , " Carter told the BBC World News America in an interview to air later on Wednesday .
" You know he 's been a disaster for our country , " Carter said .
" I think he 's been overly persuasive on President George Bush and quite often he 's prevailed . "
If you ever doubted that the recording industry has been stiffing its artists , consider the fact that , in the wake of Radiohead 's recent experiment , not only are other bands following their lead , but some leading bands are planning to give their music away for free .
And why not ?
The music companies have always been so stingy about paying royalties that live performance has always been where the real money was for them .
Getting people to hear the music ( for free - just like we first heard Sam Cooke , Stevie Wonder , The Beatles , Cream , the Doors , and Springsteen ) gets them to buy tickets to concerts .
If they pay for downloads , too , that 's just gravy .
But it 's interesting to note that , " Google say that searches for Radiohead have increased tenfold this week as fans log on to the band ’s site , with the majority - according to the band ’s spokesman - spurning the opportunity to download the album for as little as 45 pence and instead signing up for the £ 40 box set , which includes vinyl records , CD and artwork . "
The fans still like to have the physical product in their hands .
The Democratic Daily has a new URL .
Here we go again : " Babel Minute Zéro " is a geopolitical thriller .
It plays in , probably , 2015 , but it is not a sci - fi book : it really just adds a few years of solid perspective on things that are already happening now ... " Man , it 's like Chinese water torture .

It 's no secret Caro brings my attention to this timely cartoon at The Daily Scribble which makes a point that has been bugging me and yet no one really seems to talk about it - the fact that the " state secrets " we 're being told are sufficient to prevent all ordinary United States law from being obeyed and carried out are in fact widely known .
The fact of the matter is that there are now , thanks to the way this administration functions , absolutely no genuine state secrets , because our most vital intelligence is thrown to the press like confetti whenever it serves the administration 's political purposes , or else it is traded away to foreign ( and sometimes hostile ) powers to make money for Bush cronies .
There is not a single matter of national security that is not in the hands of numerous people , including companies registered with foreign ( and sometimes hostile ) governments as well as those governments themselves .
All of our technology has been sold off to other nations who reap the profits without even having to pass a royalty our way , thanks to Reaganomics .
Our economy is controlled to a large degree by other countries that hold our massive IOUs .
What is there to not know ?
Seriously , there is nothing mystical about how they are spying on everyone for any reason that takes their fancy .
There is no mystery to how they are torturing people and getting them to say whatever they want them to say .
The only thing we would learn by exposure in open court of their programs is that they are n't doing it for justifiable reasons .
And , though we already suspect this , what they are hiding is the proof .
That 's the big " state secret " - that the nation is being run by criminals .
And we already know that , too . |

Feeling our way I went a little stir - crazy yesterday from all the endless rain .
Susie Bright 's site may not be entirely work - safe for you , but I really recommend you read her post " Sex at the Margins with Laura Agustín " .
I often have to point out to people that a lot of these sex panic stories are somewhat exaggerated .
Remember in the ' 70s when three hundred thousand children a year were supposedly being kidnapped in the United States in order to make child porn ?
Well , of course , it was n't true .
Now we 're hearing similar claims about sex - trafficking between countries .
It 's not that no one is in bondage - it 's just that these people get a bit carried away when sex is the issue .
( Would that they were capable of the same sort of concern when it 's not about sex . )
Responsible people look for the evidence before demanding that " Something must be done ! "
Back in 2003 I was freaked out by a bombing in Istanbul .
There were a lot of reasons for it , but mainly it was the sense that my worst fears would be realized .
These things are all in the meaning when you warn that the area will be destabilized , and you assume others know what you mean , but they all laughed , did n't they ?
And now that they 've convinced themselves that they are in the war to end all wars between the innately bad religion versus our innately good one , I guess they do n't really mind .
Ezra has a moment , here , about the hideous attacks on the 12 - yr - old kid .
But read the thread , and marvel at the inability of some people to discern the difference between actually behaving monstrously and calling someone a monster for doing it .
( The idiots who do n't understand economics are just a bonus . )
Excellent point from Jim Henley , as well - yes , of course you single people out publicly to hurt them .
The Bush - supporters do n't just disagree with what you say , they want to ruin you for saying it , and make sure no one who disagrees with them dares to speak up .
( And more from Digby , of course . )
Imagine my surprise upon learning that one Republican actually understood , and agreed with , the complaint about Rush Limbaugh , and it was Norm Coleman .

Judicial inactivism
In an editorial - not an op - ed - the Financial Times says , " It is time to speak truth to US power " : Since the attacks of September 11 2001 , the administration of President George W. Bush has sought to cast a cloak of legality over the wrongs that it has committed in the name of fighting terrorism .
Mr Bush seems to think that legal sleight of hand can be used to justify almost any tactic to battle terrorists - including , it emerged last week , simulated drowning and other cruel interrogation techniques that Alberto Gonzales , his former attorney - general , appears to have authorised by secret legal memorandum .
Time and again , Mr Bush has twisted the law to serve his own national security goals .
He has given the rule of law a bad name , and devalued the US constitution - all in the name of protecting the American people .
But now the US Supreme Court has a chance to pierce this veil of spurious legality , and reveal the constitutional and legal abuses inherent in the anti-terrorism crusade - from the treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba , to the torture of terrorism suspects in secret prisons overseas , to the unwarranted surveillance of the phone calls and e-mails of US citizens . [...]
The genius of American democracy is that it gives each branch of government - the executive , the legislature and the judiciary - the power to check abuses by every other branch .
Mr Bush has abused his power , and Congress has failed to hold him to account ; it is time the Supreme Court did so .
Fat chance .
The Supreme Court could n't even be bothered to hear this : Khaled el - Masri , ( also spelled al - Masri ) the 42 year old German shoe salesman and father of five who was plucked off a street in Macedonia while on holiday , beaten and flown to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan where he was held for 5 months until the U.S. and Condoleeza Rice admitted he was picked up by mistake ( a case of mistaken identity ) has had his lawsuit against the U.S. rejected by the Supreme Court today .
If we ever do get a real Congress , I 'd like to see at least the last two SC appointees removed .
But I 'm absolutely certain that Supreme Court justices who fail to recuse themselves from cases in which their own family members have a stake ( Bush v. Gore ) should rightly be impeached . |

I was a fan of the twisted TV show on MTV , The Wildboyz .
Basically , it 's the guys from the show and movie Jackass , traveling the world and performing stupidly dangerous stunts with ( at least semi - ) wild animals .
Once they were taunting a lion , basically sitting in a hammock with raw meat on strings attached , and they fell out .
The lion did a curious half - leap sideways , with a mini-rearing on it's hind legs , and I said , " Where 've I seen that before , oh , that 's right , that 's how my cat pounced . "
It was never more obvious how close Steve - O came to being wild animal chow than that striking parallel between Great Cat and kitty cat .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It was Democratic front - runner Hillary Clinton ’s first turn as a punching bag and her pummeling in a debate at the hands of White House rivals was a clear sign of things to come .
Democratic presidential candidates Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) ( R ) and Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) attend a political debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , October 30 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
With the New York senator holding a huge lead in polls two months before the first votes are cast , the hammering she suffered on Tuesday from John Edwards , Barack Obama and other Democrats was simply the first salvo in a concerted effort to bring her back to the pack .
“ In many ways , that debate was the beginning of the campaign , ” said Phil Noble , a South Carolina Democratic activist and Obama backer .
“ For the first time , the contours of the political landscape for the next 60 days fully showed themselves .
It ’s going to be more of the same -- but probably even sharper , ” he said .
Edwards and Obama took turns attacking Clinton ’s honesty , leadership and ability to win the November 2008 election , and her responses were unlikely to build confidence among her supporters .
Her wandering and unclear answer to a question about driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants -- she never made clear whether she supports or opposes New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer ’s plan to give the licenses -- opened the door for critics to paint her as cautious and calculating .
“ That confusion at the end opened up an argument her opponents want to make about her candor and calculation , ” said Cal Jillson , a political analyst at Southern Methodist University in Texas .
“ They recognize they really need to start landing some heavy blows or she ’ll pull away , ” he said .
“ You will see more and more of this as the first votes get closer . ”
Obama , an Illinois senator who has based his campaign on an upbeat message about the need for a new politics , had promised to toughen his criticism of Clinton .
He jumped quickly on Clinton when she was asked if she would push to make public her communication with her husband Bill when he was president and she said it was “ not my decision to make . ”
But he seemed much less comfortable on the attack than Edwards , a former North Carolina senator who pounded Clinton for flip - flopping on Social Security , trade issues and Iraq and questioned her Senate vote endorsing the labeling of an Iranian military unit as a terrorist group .
Edwards rejected her argument she was trying to pressure President George W. Bush into “ vigorous diplomacy ” to rein in Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ The way you put pressure on this administration is you stand up to them , you say no , ” Edwards said .
Her potential Republican opponents also were happy to pile on the New York senator over her answer on the driver ’s licenses .
Kevin Madden , the spokesman for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , said Clinton ’s answer “ was emblematic of someone who is both dismissive of efforts to enforce our nation ’s immigration laws and entirely unwilling to offer a straight answer to a very direct question . ”
Clinton ’s camp said they expected the attacks and were not surprised .
The campaign released a statement questioning past condemnations of negative politics by Obama and Edwards .
“ With each attack , Senators Obama and Edwards undermined the central premises of their own candidacies , ” the campaign memo said .
WASHINGTON  The U.S. military paid a Florida company nearly $ 32 million to build barracks and offices for Iraqi army units even though nothing was ever built , Pentagon investigators reported .
The project had to be abandoned because the Iraqi Defense Ministry could n't obtain rights to the land where the headquarters were to be built , according to a report released this month by the Defense Department 's Office of Inspector General .
Contracting records show the buildings would have housed one brigade and three battalions of the Iraqi military in Ramadi , a hotbed of the Sunni Muslim insurgency and capital of Anbar province .
Still , the Air Force agency overseeing the project paid contractor Ellis Environmental Group $ 31.9 million of the $ 34.2 million obligated for the project , the report said .
An Air Force spokesman , Michael Hawkins , said in an e-mail that Air Force auditors are reviewing the contract .
Although the inspector general 's report says the Air Force was considering suing the contractor , Hawkins said any talk of a lawsuit was premature until the Air Force audit is complete .
Ellis Environmental Group spokesman Steve Brownstein said the work was reassigned to Ellis World Alliance Corp. , a related company .
Bob Smith , of Ellis World Alliance headquarters in Gainesville , Fla. , said contracting rules barred any official comment .
The Ramadi construction contract is one of many problems Pentagon investigators cited in this month 's report on the military 's oversight of $ 5.2 billion Congress approved in 2005 to help train and equip the Iraqi military and police .
The report says the military did n't keep adequate records of equipment for the Iraqis ranging from generators and garbage trucks to thousands of guns and grenade launchers .
Separately , the United States has launched a criminal investigation into allegations that weapons it bought for the Iraqis ended up in the hands of insurgent and terrorist groups .
The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment near San Antonio manages construction contracts for the Iraqi military assistance program .
In May 2006 , the Air Force center awarded the Ramadi project to Ellis Environmental Group , according to federal contracting records .
The inspector general 's report says vouchers provided by the contractor do n't show purchased materials .
But Hawkins said the Air Force had documentation on about $ 15 million worth of equipment and supplies meant for the Ramadi headquarters .
That gear is in storage and available for other projects in Iraq , Hawkins said .
Hawkins said the contractor set up a camp for construction workers , performed design and engineering work and had begun building roads and an airstrip before the project was halted .
Government investigators have repeatedly faulted U.S. oversight of contracting in Iraq , and more than two dozen people have been charged with corruption related to the war and rebuilding effort .

ABC : Is Cheney too powerful ?
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
ABC News examined the stunning extent of Vice President Dick Cheney 's grab for power over the last six years in a sometimes sardonic yet serious segment on Good Morning America Tuesday morning .
Reporter David Wright says
Cheney is refusing to play by the rules that govern everyone else who works at the White House .
" So almighty and elusive is this vice president , the New Yorker once ran a cartoon in which theologians debated the existence of Cheney , " Wright said .
Noting a proposal in Congress to cut funding for the Vice President 's office , Wright said a Cheney spokeswoman called the proposal political , but she would n't say " because the size of the vice president 's staff is apparently classified . "
Chief Washington Correspondent George Stephanopoulos examined the controversy surrounding Cheney and pronounced the current vice president the most powerful person to occupy the office in history .
Stephanopoulos predicted the next president will pick as his running mate " the anti-Cheney . "
NBC News reported on Monday ( link ) that " Dick Cheney is back in a very uncomfortable place for him : the headlines . "
" Has the vice - president gone too far ? " asked NBC , adding that " the National Archives thinks so , " because Cheney alone in the executive branch has refused to file required reports or permit inspections of his office 's handling of classified material .

Nov. 4 , 2007  -- Iraq and 9/11 , sex trafficking , flu vaccines , widespread autism .
Cognitive biases color our view of these and other issues and can affect our policy choices .
Because they are well - , but not widely understood , I 'd like to briefly mention three of the most common ones and some related new and troubling research about denials .
First the biases .
Three Common Psychological Biases
1 . The " availability heuristic " is the pronounced tendency of people to view any story through the lens of a superficially similar story that comes easily to mind or is psychologically available .
For this reason , much of politics revolves around strengthening this tendency by keeping a preferred narrative uppermost in people 's minds .
It does n't take too keen a political instinct , for example , to realize that some politicians ' incessant invoking of 9/11 is an effort to keep it psychologically available , to help it color every aspect of the political agenda .
2 . Another common psychological failing is called the " anchoring effect " and refers to our tendency to credit and easily become attached to the first number we hear about a particular phenomenon .
If , say , an organization announces that there are X thousand new sufferers from some condition each year , the number may , even if grossly false , take a long time to debunk .
Various groups , for example , announced a few years ago that 50,000 sex slaves were trafficked into the United States annually , and this very disturbing claim was taken up by The New York Times and other media .
Nevertheless , although dozens of task forces and $ 150 million have been devoted to the problem since then , fewer than 1,500 cases have even been registered during the last seven years of effort .
3. " Confirmation bias " refers to the way we check a hypothesis by looking for occurrences that confirm it ( as well as our amazing perspicacity ) and ignoring those that do not .
We " just know " something is true because it 's the only possibility we consider as we search mightily for whatever might confirm our beliefs and pay scant attention to whatever might disconfirm them .
Consider the Iraq war again , dot - com stocks or many medical snap judgments .
New Research on Clarification and Myth - Busting
These and other psychological foibles have been well - known , especially since cognitive psychologists Amos Tversky , Daniel Kahneman and many other researchers began describing and cataloging them more than 30 years ago .
Despite this , a recent study by University of Michigan psychologist Norbert Schwarz is still rather surprising .
As indicated in his article ( see link to it below ) in Advances in Experimental Social Psychology and reported upon by Shankar Vedantam in The Washington Post ( where I first learned of it ) , Schwarz copied a flier put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intended to combat various myths about the flu vaccine .
It listed a number of common beliefs about the vaccine and indicated whether they were true or false .
He then asked volunteers to read the flier .
Some of them were old , some young , but shortly thereafter he found that many of the older people mistakenly remembered almost of a third of the false statements as being true , and after a few days young and old alike misclassified 40 percent of the myths as factual .
Even worse was that people now attributed these false beliefs to the CDC itself !
In an effort to dispel misconceptions about the vaccine , the CDC had inadvertently lent its prestige to them .
In many cases , truth and elucidation can actually strengthen misconceptions and make them more psychologically available .
Related studies by Kimberlee Weaver of Virginia Polytechnic University and others ( link below ) have shown that being repeatedly exposed to information from a single source is often tantamount to hearing it from many sources .
People simply forget where they heard something after a while , and the repetition makes it more psychologically available and hence credible .
In one simple experiment , groups of students were given an e-mail to read , some groups receiving a version that seemed to have a software bug in it since the same crucial paragraph was reprinted two more times at the bottom of the e-mail .
Those students with the repeated information were more persuaded by the e-mail and overestimated the information 's general appeal than did students who had read the non-repetitive e-mail .
Denying and Dispelling Disinformation Is Dangerous
Trying to dispel myths can backfire .
It 's not just confirmation bias that helped sell people on the Iraq War .
When war opponents denied the Bush administration 's repeated assertions that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks , they were probably strengthening , at least in the minds of some , the belief that he was indeed involved .
Likewise , the effect on many in the Arab world of denials that the hijackers were really Westerners , that Jews were warned to stay home , et cetera , also may have been to strengthen that flapdoodle .
The difficulty in processing denials is probably part of the reason for their frequent ineffectiveness .
Complexity and logical connectives get lost in transmission .
( Quick , what does the following sentence mean ?
" It 's not the case that Waldo denied that evidence was lacking that he did in fact fail to do X. " )
In fact , the new research suggests that people quite often mentally transmute a denial into an assertion .
They hear " X is not this bad thing Y , " and soon enough what remains with them is the link between X and Y , which eventually becomes " X is Y . "
These foibles , it should be repeated , affect our beliefs about many disparate phenomena , not just political issues .
Health scares are a rich source for them .
Sticking with the vaccine theme , I note that the denial by medical researchers and scientists of a connection between mercury in childhood vaccines and the increased incidence of autism ( defined now to include Asperger 's syndrome and other " autism spectrum disorders " ) has not quelled the controversy over the vaccines or weakened the belief that mercury was the culprit .
The number of cases cited for all such disorders also serves to anchor our estimate of the prevalence of autism proper .
Being aware of these biases will presumably help us minimize their effects .
One specific lesson from this research seems clear .
Denials of assertions should in general not repeat the assertions .
It 's better to say " X is this good thing Z " rather than " X is not this bad thing Y . "
One Last Issue
Of course , another way to use this research is to exploit our misguided tendencies .
Not just politics , but advertising does this all the time .
With regard to denials , an applied bit of marketing jujitsu suggests one might even sometimes deny what one wants people to believe .
I will thus take this opportunity to modestly deny that my forthcoming book , " Irreligion , a Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don't Add Up , " has already been mentioned as a possible Pulitzer Prize winner .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
In a clear sign that the credit crunch is still affecting the nation 's largest financial institutions , the Federal Reserve agreed this week to bend key banking regulations to help out Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , according to documents posted Friday on the Fed 's web site .
The Aug. 20 letters from the Fed to Citigroup and Bank of America state that the Fed , which regulates large parts of the U.S. financial system , has agreed to exempt both banks from rules that effectively limit the amount of lending that their federally - insured banks can do with their brokerage affiliates .
The exemption , which is temporary , means , for example , that Citigroup 's Citibank entity can substantially increase funding to Citigroup Global Markets , its brokerage subsidiary .
Citigroup and Bank of America requested the exemptions , according to the letters , to provide liquidity to those holding mortgage loans , mortgage - backed securities , and other securities .
This unusual move by the Fed shows that the largest Wall Street firms are continuing to have problems funding operations during the current market difficulties , according to banking industry skeptics .
The Fed 's move appears to support the view that even the biggest brokerages have been caught off guard by the credit crunch and do n't have financing to deal with the resulting dislocation in the markets .
The opposing , less negative view is that the Fed has taken this step merely to increase the speed with which the funds recently borrowed at the Fed 's discount window can flow through to the bond markets , where the mortgage mess has caused a drying up of liquidity .
On Wednesday , Citibank and Bank of America said that they and two other banks accessed $ 500 million in 30 - day financing at the discount window .
A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment .
Bank of America dismissed the notion that Banc of America Securities is not well positioned to fund operations without help from the federally insured bank .
" This is just a technicality to allow us to use our regular channels of business with funds from the Fed 's discount window , " says Bob Stickler , spokesperson for Bank of America .
" We have no current plans to use the discount window beyond the $ 500 million announced earlier this week . "
There is a good chance that other large banks , like J.P. Morgan ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , have been granted similar exemptions .
The Federal Reserve and J.P. Morgan did n't immediately comment .
The regulations in question effectively limit a bank 's funding exposure to an affiliate to 10 % of the bank 's capital .
But the Fed has allowed Citibank and Bank of America to blow through that level .
Citigroup and Bank of America are able to lend up to $ 25 billion apiece under this exemption , according to the Fed .
If Citibank used the full amount , " that represents about 30 % of Citibank 's total regulatory capital , which is no small exemption , " says Charlie Peabody , banks analyst at Portales Partners .
The Fed says that it made the exemption in the public interest , because it allows Citibank to get liquidity to the brokerage in " the most rapid and cost - effective manner possible . "
So , how serious is this rule - bending ?
Very .
One of the central tenets of banking regulation is that banks with federally insured deposits should never be over - exposed to brokerage subsidiaries ; indeed , for decades financial institutions were legally required to keep the two units completely separate .
This move by the Fed eats away at the principle .
Sure , the temporary nature of the move makes it look slightly less serious , but the Fed did n't give a date in the letter for when this exemption will end .
In addition , the sheer size of the potential lending capacity at Citigroup and Bank of America - $ 25 billion each - is a cause for unease .
Indeed , this move to exempt Citigroup casts a whole new light on the discount window borrowing that was revealed earlier this week .
At the time , the gloss put on the discount window advances was that they were orderly and almost symbolic in nature .
But if that were the case , why the need to use these exemptions to rush the funds to the brokerages ?
Expect the discount window borrowings to become a key part of the Fed 's recovery strategy for the financial system .
The Fed 's exemption will almost certainly force its regulatory arm to sharpen its oversight of banks ' balance sheets , which means banks will almost certainly have to mark down asset values to appropriate levels a lot faster now .
That 's because there is no way that the Fed is going to allow easier funding to lead to a further propping up of asset prices .
Do n't forget : The Federal Reserve is in crisis management at the moment .
However , it does n't want to show any signs of panic .
That means no rushed cuts in interest rates .
It also means that it wants banks to quickly take the big charges that will inevitably come from holding toxic debt securities .
And it will do all it can behind the scenes to work with the banks to help them get through this upheaval .
But waiving one of the most important banking regulations can only add nervousness to the market .
And that 's what the Fed did Monday in these disturbing letters to the nation 's two largest banks .

This comment over at the Plank is priceless :
This just goes to show that Obama only wins in states that hold contested elections .
Sure , he wins big in caucus states , he wins big in primary states , he wins big when turnout is low , and he wins big with record - high turnout .
But what the Obama - worshipping media is overlooking is that in each of the 25 state contests Obama has won so far , his name appeared on the ballot .
It 's time to stop giving Obama a pass on this critical issue .
Remember , if Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination , Barack Obama 's name will not be on the ballot in November .
And only Hillary Clinton has demonstrated that she can win when Obama 's name is not on the ballot .
In fact , she 's undefeated in contests where Obama is not on the ballot , making her clearly the more electable general - election candidate .

The Texas jury awards $ 253 million in damages .
CNN 's Allan Chernoff reports on the first lawsuit involving Vioxx . ( August 19 ) Play video
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Merck has been held liable by a Texas jury in the first lawsuit involving its former blockbuster drug Vioxx , in a case that could have a profound effect on thousands of other cases filed against the company .
Plaintiff Carol Ernst has won her lawsuit in Texas Superior Court in Angleton , which blames Vioxx for the 2001 death of her husband , Robert Ernst , a 59 - year - old marathon runner and Wal - Mart worker who was taking the arthritis painkiller at the time of his death .
Ernst died of a heart attack .
The verdict held Merck liable for the death .
Jurors voted 10 - 2 in favor of Ernst .
The jury awarded more than $ 250 million in total damages -- $ 24 million to Carol Ernst for mental anguish and loss of companionship , and $ 229 million in punitive damages .
Ernst 's Houston - based lawyer , Mark Lanier , said the punitive - damages figure was based on " the money Merck made and saved by putting off their product label changes . "
Lanier had been seeking $ 40.4 million in damages , and after the verdict , Lanier said that he expected the punitive - damages award to be reduced according to Texas law .
" Justice is a beautiful thing , is n't it ? "
Lanier told reporters following the verdict .
Merck said it would appeal the decision .
" We believe that the plaintiff did not meet the standard set by Texas law to prove Vioxx caused Mr. Ernst 's death , " said Jonathan Skidmore , a member of Merck 's legal defense team , according to a statement released by Merck .
Merck ( Research ) shares closed down nearly 8 percent on Friday .
Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said that Merck 's appeal " could delay a resolution for several years , and will likely reduce the financial damages signficantly . "
Ryan lowered her price target for the stock to $ 31 from $ 35 but said the dividend " remains secure . "
But David Moskowitz , analyst for Friedman , Billings , Ramsey & Co. , said that if Merck continues to lose cases it will have to settle in order to save the company .
" The squeeze is coming , " said Moskowitz .
" With this number of cases and these types of awards , the stability of the company is at risk . "
Merck has vowed not to settle .
Analyst Christ Shibutani of J.P. Morgan Chase has estimated that Merck 's liabilities could range from $ 8 billion to $ 25 billion .
An emotional trial ; more to come Lanier argued that Merck had concealed information about the health risks associated with the drug in order to protect sales .
Lanier has used colorful analogies in his portrayal of Merck , which he has compared to Saddam Hussein and the three monkeys who see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil .
Carol Ernst , who had divorced her first husband in the early 1980s and raised four children as a single mother , delivered emotional testimony about the death of her second husband , Robert , and said she was taking antidepressants to cope with the loss .
Merck 's defense team had insisted that Vioxx did not cause Ernst 's death , asserting that arrhythmia had not been linked Vioxx in studies .
Merck 's legal battle began after Sept. 30 , 2004 , when the company pulled Vioxx , a arthritis painkiller worth $ 2.5 billion in annual sales and about one - tenth of total company revenue , triggering a one - third slide in the company 's stock value .
Merck pulled the drug after participants in a Vioxx study experienced " adverse cardiovascular events " compared to those taking a placebo .
Nonetheless , Merck never actually conceded there were health risks .
Some 20 million people have used Vioxx .
Since the recall , about 4,200 product liability lawsuits representing about 7,500 plaintiff groups have been filed against Merck .
The battle continues on Sept. 12 , when jury selection begins in the next case in New Jersey Superior Court in Atlantic City under Judge Carol Higbee .
Plaintiffs from all over the country have sued Merck in New Jersey because the company is based in Whitehouse Station .
While the Ernst case was a wrongful death suit , the next plaintiff is a heart attack survivor .
The company will face plaintiff Frederick Humeston of Boise , Idaho , a postal carrier and twice - wounded Vietnam veteran who blames Vioxx for his 2001 heart attack .
Merck 's lawyers say that Vioxx did not cause Humeston 's heart attack and his case presents " little more than guilt by temporal association . "
The outcome of the Humeston case will impact how the rest of the New Jersey cases are organized , in groups or individually .
Merck has vowed to fight them all , one at a time , if necessary .
That could take a while .
Judge Eldon Fallon , who is presiding over all federal cases in New Orleans district court , told reporters in May that lawsuits could ultimately reach 100,000 .
The first federal case begins on Nov. 28 , with a pre-trial conference on Aug. 25 .
Moskowitz does not own Merck stock and his firm does not do business with them .
EL CALABOZ , Texas ( CNN ) -- Eloisa Tamez said she is n't scared anymore , just determined .
" I am not backing down , " she said .
The U.S. government wants to build a border fence like this one .
About 100 landowners are fighting it .
Tamez owns three acres of land along the Texas - Mexico border where the Department of Homeland Security would like to build a border fence .
The property is a remnant of a 12,000 - acre grant from Spain to her family in 1767 , before the United States even existed .
" It is my history .
It is my heritage , " Tamez said .
This week , the Justice Department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land .
Tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon , but she is not intimidated .
Asked how long she will fight , she said , " As long as I have to . "
Michael Chertoff , the Secretary of Homeland Security , said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Tamez .
" Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual ? "
Chertoff told CNN .
" I do n't think I can accept that . "
Watch Chertoff say it's " civic responsibility " to give up land »
Chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs .
He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Patrol agents who have faced increasing violence .
The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Mexican border , including 370 miles of it by the end of this year .
About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year 's end , if the government gets its way .
The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border , but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across .
On the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so .
Piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across .
The swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags .
Then they disappear into the United States .
The Border Patrol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights , and sensors to pick up movement .
A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Patrol vehicles to patrol the area .
Richard Cortez , the mayor of the border town of McAllen , Texas , believes hiring more Border Patrol agents , deepening the Rio Grande , and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence .
Cortez calls the fence " a multibillion - dollar speed bump , " which will slow , but not stop , illegal immigration .
" It is a false sense of security , " he said .
" America will not be safe .
America will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work . "
Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the Texas Border Coalition .
The coalition wrote to Chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence , but this week the Department of Homeland Security turned them down .
While expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials , David Pagan of U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote in an e-mail , " We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings . "
Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence .
And so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners , those like Eloisa Tamez who are standing firm .
" I will not allow them to come and survey my land .
I have an American - given right to protect my property , " she said .

Earlier this month , the parents of 4 - year - old Madeleine McCann , who disappeared in May from a resort in Portugal , were named suspects in their daughter 's disappearance .
Following a public plea for help , tips poured in from everywhere .
A few self - proclaimed psychics even wasted police resources with misinformation .
The case seemed stalled until the parents were re-interviewed and included as suspects .
While many in the public were surprised that the parents were under investigation , police detectives were not .
While rare incidents of children being abused and killed by sex offenders grab headlines , in fact parents are a far greater threat to children .
Studies show that if a child is abducted or killed , the perpetrator is most likely a parent , guardian or close friend .
Each year , hundreds of infants and children are killed by one of their parents , and over all age groups , mothers kill more often than fathers .
According to a 2002 study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a person 's first day on Earth is also the day he or she is most likely to be killed : the risk of homicide for newborns is ten times greater than at any other time in life .
For the vast majority of the newborn victims , the killer is the child 's own mother .
In the first two weeks of September 2007 , at least a dozen babies and children were killed by one of their parents .
On Sept. 5 , for example , a mother in Niagara Falls , New York , smothered her 17 - month - old son to death ; that same day , a Florida mother was charged with drowning her 7 - year - old daughter in a pool .
If an average of one child per day was intentionally killed by any other cause , there would be a national outcry , yet the public takes little notice of parental killings except in high - profile cases .
One example is that of Susan Smith , the mother who in 1994 blamed a black man for abducting her two young sons .
It was later revealed that she drowned her children in a nearby lake .
The parents of murdered Colorado girl JonBenet Ramsey claimed that their daughter was killed by an intruder , though eventually they were suspected of being involved in her death .
That was never proven , however , and the case remains unsolved .
Of course , simply being named a suspect in an investigation by itself means little .
Police must explore all possibilities , and all suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty .
Still , if a child is missing , the odds are that one or both of the parents may be involved .
Madeleine McCann may in fact be alive and well somewhere ; hopefully she — and her parents — beat the odds .

Abramoff fallout has lobbying industry close to crisis Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday January 29 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This With President Bush 's promise to veto earmark - laden legislation that emerges from Congress this year , lobbyists who built their businesses around securing targeted federal dollars for their clients worry they may not survive .
" There is a constant drumbeat that people need to start listening to , and it doesnt seem to be going away ,  former Rep. Henry Bonilla ( R - Texas ) , an Appropriations Committee veteran who is now a lobbyist , told Roll Call .
 People are wondering what kind of future is out there for firms that are focused entirely on appropriations . "
The subscription - only Capitol Hill newspaper reports that firms up and down K Street are reevaluating their business models now that Bush said in his State of the Union address that he would enforce a 50 percent cut in earmarks with his veto pen .
House Republicans also have adopted stricter standards over the spending .
Trouble has been building for earmark lobbyists for years since separate scandals involving earmark improprieties sent lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham ( R - CA ) to jail .
The crackdown on targeted spending projects secreted into appropriations bills seems to be reaching a head , and one lobbyist told Roll Call the industry is " pretty close " to a crisis .
" There s so much uncertainty across the board , " the unnamed lobbyist told the paper 's Tory Newmyer .
" Last year was tough , and the threat still continues . "
While the reforms are seen as thinning the herd of appropriations lobbyists , the industry is hardly in danger of complete collapse .
" Ironically , the more they raise the bar , the more folks like us who are really good are valued , " lobbyist Rich Gold told Newmyer .
Gold heads the lobbying practice at Holland & Knight , where he said business has grown at least 10 percent for the last two years .
Democrats made earmark reform a primary focus after taking over Congress last year , and their focus on increased transparency has resulted in slightly fewer lobbying contracts on budge / appropriations issues -- 1,157 last year compared to 1,259 in 2005 , according to a CQ Moneyline analysis Newmyer cites .
As long as lawmakers continue to rely on voters who like to see federal dollars funded to their hometowns , though , earmarks wo n't disappear completely .
But the new focus has thinned the herd of lobbyists seeking those dollars and has sent them looking for " the next big thing , " Steve Ellis of earmark critic Taxpayers for Common Sense told The Hill last month .
" The earmark market , " he said , " has popped . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized the findings of a CQ Moneyline analysis .
It measured lobbying contracts on budget or appropriations issues , not earmarks
The Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 Overclocking Report
Overclocking over the past few years has become an increasingly popular endeavor for many people .
In a sense , it 's a good thing that our favorite past time here at Tech ARP is reaching out to the masses .
For some people , overclocking is a balance between achieving the impossible and everyday usability .
Yet others can really go nuts on it .
The guys here at Tech ARP are a little bit of both .
Now , there are plenty of articles online that showcase overclocking results of various processors ( be it retail or cherry picked ones ) .
So we have decided to add a decent spin to it all .
What do you get when three contributors ( and really good friends ) from Tech ARP individually decided to go out and buy the same Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 processor for the sole purpose of overclocking ?
Well :
Lunacy Competition
This article
So , this is what the article is all about , ladies and gentlemen .
A three - for - one article that showcases different hardware as well as different styles of overclocking , all based on the hottest processor on the PC hardware scene right now - the Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 processor !
This should be a good read for you guys !

That yellow strip showing the first - down line was put into your TV by Stan Honey .
The viewing enhancement was developed by Honey , 52 , in the Palo Alto Craftsman where he lives with his wife , Sally , two - time U.S. yachtswoman of the year , and two Emmy Awards on the mantel .
" I worked at SRI International in military stuff and did lots of tracking and remote sensing .
In 1983 I started a company called Etak , which pioneered vehicle map displays .
That company was acquired by Rupert Murdoch in ' 89 .
I ended up being head of technologies for News Corp .
I started working with David Hill , who was just then starting Fox Sports .
He had just gotten the rights to ( NHL ) hockey and he asked me if it would be possible to track and highlight the hockey puck in real time .
We built a system so you 'd see a blue highlight around the puck and when the puck was moving fast you 'd see a red trail behind it .
When
Fox lost the contract for hockey , we stopped doing it .
I was able to take the patents and technology out of News Corp. and start Sportvision , in 1998 .
Our objective was to find situations in sport that happened a lot and were important to the game but were hard to see on TV .
The first down in football was a perfect example .
The whole game of football is all about getting first downs .
The way it works is that we have accurate sensors on all the cameras so we 're able to measure the pan , tilt , zoom , focus of each of the broadcast cameras .
If you go to a sporting event and look below every camera you 'll see a gold box that has the Sportvision logo on it .
That 's the sensor .
We also characterize the distortion of the lens and we have to measure the crown of the field .
We know where the first - down line is because that is entered by an operator .
Given all that information , we compute where that line should appear .
The electronic yard line has to lie perfectly parallel to all the regular yard lines to preserve the illusion that it's on the grass .
The system was first introduced in an ESPN Sunday night football game in the fall of ' 98 .
It was n't announced ahead of time .
When we did the hockey puck , it had been announced by Fox as ' the greatest innovation in the history of mankind . '
And of course people thought , ' What about the wheel ? '
The first - down line just went on the air .
There was no pre-announcement at all .
It really did look like it was just yellow chalk on the glass .
The journalists were absolutely stunned , saying , ' How the heck did they do that ? '
They were wondering ' Do they vacuum it up when they 're done ? '
In the beginning it would take a 50 - foot truck full of computers to do it .
Now it 's down to a box of equipment the size of an apartment refrigerator .
In 2004 , I left Sportvision to sail full time professionally .
I 'm now technical director for Team Origin , which is the British America 's Cup team .
The Brits have n't had the cup since they originally lost it to the schooner America 150 years ago .
That 's where the name Team Origin comes from .
I find that now when I 'm watching football on TV I spend more time watching the line on the screen than the play .
That 's a bad habit picked up from going to hundreds of sporting events operating these systems where all you 're focusing on is technical performance .
When I was in the stands at a game , you 'd overhear the occasional conversation of some kid asking his father , ' Where 's the yellow line ? ' "
We are looking for Bay Area people with innovative ideas who have put them to use .

Should the penny be retired ?

YESInflation has so eaten away at the value of the penny that it is no longer useful :
It is simply a nuisance .
The penny has been our lowest - denomination coin since 1857 , when the halfpenny was retired .
( At the time it was retired , the halfpenny was worth more than the equivalent of a dime today . )
Pennies are now worth so little that people often do n't pick them up off the street , despite the lucky - penny adage .
As Harvard professor of economics Gregory Mankiw points out , " When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer , the unit is too small to be useful .
" But what harm is caused by continuing to mint the penny ?
First , it 's a waste of time .
Most cash transactions involve the exchange of pennies , and this increases the time it takes to complete them .
Second , minting pennies is a waste of money .
The U.S. Mint produces about 7 billion pennies a year at a cost of $ 100 million .
Pennies are made of copper and zinc , two metals that have recently soared in price .
Because of the high value of those metals , a penny is worth more melted down than as U.S. currency .
( In fact , the Mint recently announced that it 's illegal to melt down the penny . ) A simple way to retire the penny would be to round each cash transaction to the nearest nickel .
Similar reforms have been successful in other countries , including Australia and the Netherlands .
The U.S. might have already made similar changes if not for lobbying by the zinc industry to keep the penny in circulation .
The penny has outlived its usefulness .
Let 's retire it .-- Jeff Gore Citizens for Retiring the PennyNOAbolishing the penny would hurt both consumers and the economy .
The alternative to the penny is rounding transactions to the nearest nickel .
But that will make goods and services more expensive .
Since the objective of any business is to maximize profits , most prices would be rounded up -- and research suggests that consumers would spend an additional $ 600 million a year as a result .
Inflation from rounding up would in turn have a significant impact on government spending : A report by an economics professor at Penn State estimates that abolishing the penny would result in an extra $ 1 billion in government spending over five years , since payments from many government programs are tied to inflation .
Opponents of the penny argue that no one will miss the penny since few people use cash anyway .
But the majority of purchases of $ 10 or less are still made with cash .
Many low - income Americans do n't have bank accounts or credit cards .
Rounding would hurt all Americans , but the poor and other disadvantaged people would be disproportionately affected .
Abolishing the penny would not save the government money .
Without the penny , the U.S. Mint would produce more nickels .
Due to soaring metal prices , the nickel costs almost 10 cents to produce .
Spending more money to produce more nickels is no way to save money .
According to a recent poll , more than 70 percent of Americans support keeping the penny in use .
There is no need to abolish the penny , especially when the change would hurt consumers and the economy .

The book cover shows Austen without her night - cap
" She was not much of a looker , " said Helen Trayler , managing director of publisher Wordsworth Editions .
Publishers traditionally use a portrait of Austen painted by her sister but Wordsworth have added make - up , hair extensions and removed her cap .
The book is a new edition of a memoir by Austen 's nephew .
The book cover was adapted from this portrait housed at the National Portrait Gallery
" I know you are not supposed to judge a book by its cover .
Sadly people do .
If you look more attractive , you just stand out more , " said Ms Trayler .
The original painting by Cassandra Austen , which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London , is thought by some scholars to be the only authentic portrait of the celebrated author .
But another portrait said to be of Austen is going up for auction at Christie 's in New York on 19 April and is expected to fetch between $ 400,000 ( £ 203,000 ) and $ 800,000 ( £ 406,000 ) .
The oil painting , known as the Rice Portrait of Jane Austen after a former owner , Henry Rice , has been the subject of debate after some scholars said it was not authentic .
The oil painting being auctioned is by society artist Ozias Humphry
The painting by Ozias Humphry first came to prominence in 1884 when it appeared on the front of a first edition of Jane Austen 's letters collection .
Some scholars have argued that the costume Austen is wearing in the picture dates to about 1805 , making her about 30 when it was painted - earlier experts thought the painting dated to 1788 or 1789 , making Austen about 14 .
This has led to doubts about the portrait in some quarters , although a number of academics in recent years have supported the original attribution , as does auction house Christie's .
Jane Austen 's novels include Pride and Prejudice , Sense and Sensibility , Emma and Mansfield Park .
Heroes has proved a ratings winner in both the US and UK
Tim Kring admitted to Entertainment Weekly that mistakes had been made on the choice of storylines , but promised to get the show back on track .
The second series has seen falling ratings in the US , where the programme is now eight episodes in .
Viewers in the UK can see the conclusion of the first series on BBC Two on 5 December .
' Mistake '
The superhero show , starring Hayden Panettiere and Masi Oka , was the top - rated new drama in the US last year .
But recent programmes have seen audiences slip away - with one recent episode placing 30th in the overall ratings .
The drop - off has been attributed to an influx of new characters and sluggish story - telling .
Kring admitted the pace had been too slow .
" We assumed the audience wanted season one - a build up of intrigue about these characters and the discovery of their powers .
They wanted adrenaline .
" We made a mistake - we took too long to get to the big - picture story , " he added .
Heroes won favourite new TV drama at the 2007 People 's Choice Awards
The 50 - year - old writer also told Entertainment Weekly he regretted introducing a number of romantic storylines saying : " In retrospect , I do n't think romance is a natural fit for us . "
The show has been hit by the current writer 's strike in Hollywood and there are only three more shows left to screen in the US before the episodes run out .
Kring said he hoped to begin with a " clean slate " when production resumes .
'" The message is that we 've heard the complaints and we 're doing something about it . "
In the UK , BBC Two struck a deal with NBC to screen future series of the science - fiction drama , including series two .
The station 's terrestrial premiere of the programme attracted an audience of 4.3 million viewers earlier this year .

We suspect this was going to be used to facilitate the murder of Crown Prince ( King ) Abdullah . "
The money , found on a courier stopped at the airport after a tip - off from an informant , was made up of 100 - dollar bills .
But detectives said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against the cash smuggler .
Holmes , whose unit includes officers from British intelligence and the government 's revenue and customs department , said the case showed how money was an essential resource for any active extremist network .
King Abdullah visited Britain as part of a European tour last October -- the first Saudi monarch to do so for two decades -- and met Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Queen Elizabeth II .
But his visit , although high on pomp and ceremony , was also controversial and he faced protests from human rights activists and anti-arms trade campaigners .
Opponents said Britain was turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in the oil - rich Gulf state in order to secure lucrative defense contracts and co-operation countering extremism .
Saudi Arabia has previously accused Libya of being behind a plot to assassinate King Abdullah in 2003 , when he was crown prince .
He pardoned the five Libyan intelligence agents accused of the plot who were detained in Saudi when he became monarch after the death of his half - brother king Fahd .
Festo is known as a top - notch automation hardware manufacturer , but apparently their research division is capable of making very artistic , bio - inspired robots as well .
This post specifically examines their robotic dirigible and submersible manta rays , both of which harbor a life - like gracefulness .
I encourage you to check out the videos below ; the technical specifications are provided for good measure .
In this case , I think the videos are the most compelling .
The dirigible is my personal favorite , as it conjures images of light - weight aerial manta rays serenely swimming in an alien sky ( a notion befitting a scene in sci - fi master Arthur C. Clarke 's Rama series ) .
Regardless , both look very graceful .
Festo Air_Ray Dirigible ( from the Festo website ) :
Air_ray , modelled on the manta ray , is a remote - controlled hybrid construction consisting of a helium - filled ballonet and a beating wing drive .
Its light design makes it possible for it to “ swim ” in the sea of air , boosted by helium , in a similar way to the manta ray in water .
Propulsion is achieved by a beating wing drive .
The servo drive - controlled wing , which can move up and down , utilises the Fin Ray Effect ® and is based on alternate pulling and pushing flanks connected via frames .
When pressure is exerted on one flank , the geometrical structure curves automatically against the direction of the influencing force .
A servo drive pulls the two flanks alternately in the longitudinal direction , thus moving the wing up and down .
The dirigible manta ray has a 4.2 meter wingspan and a mass of 1.6kg .
You can find some other detailed specs here ( in German , sorry ) .
Festo Aqua_Ray Submersible ( from the Festo website ) :
Aqua_ray is a remote - controlled fish driven by water hydraulics , the shape and movements of which have been based on the model of a manta ray .
The central drive and control unit of Aqua_ray takes the form of a Festo Fluidic Muscle .
This is combined with the Fin Ray Effect® , a design based on the functional anatomy of a fish ’s fin that makes it possible to imitate the fin drive of the natural role model almost perfectly .
As the Aqua_ray can be manoeuvred extremely well , and can be operated both as a hydrostatic glider and with an active wing beat , substantial energy savings can be achieved .
Thanks to its shape and method of movement , the Aqua_ray can be used in wide ranging areas of oceanography , without disrupting the natural environment .
You can find detailed specs here ( this one is in English ) .
( UPDATED : Original final paragraphs on 23andMe broken out as a separate post here . )
A few days ago , I noted that deCODEme , the personal - genomics spinoff of Iceland ’s deCODE Genetics , looks to be offering disease - risk predictions based on surprisingly thin evidence .
I looked into it a little more deeply , and while I ’m not a geneticist or even a close approximation thereof , I ’m still a little taken aback by how little deCODEme currently seems to be flying on where many of these conditions are concerned
To recap for a second , deCODEme — like the much better - publicized 23andMe ( more on them in a moment ) — offers a service for an “ introductory ” price of $ 985 that scans customer genomes in a million or so specific locations to yield a rough sense of their genetic inheritance and its potential influence on their health and physical characteristics .
Using gene - chip technology , the company looks specifically for individual DNA “ letters , ” or nucleotides , that are known to vary between individuals .
These single - letter variations , technically called single - nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs , essentially mark genes or other stretches of DNA whose altered function can contribute to ( or protect against ) disease or determine physical characteristics such as eye color .
deCODEme provides its customers with an analysis of SNPs that have been linked to 18 diseases , calculating a risk summary that compares an individual ’s odds of getting sick to those for the population — well , a population — at large .
The trouble , as we noted earlier , is that in many cases deCODEme bases this risk assessment on just one or two SNPs , when most diseases are thought to be influenced by tens or hundreds of different genes .
That means the disease risks deCODEme calculates are very likely to be wildly inaccurate — potentially a serious state of affairs for the folks paying roughly $ 1,000 for this very analysis , even if deCODEme is careful to caution its users not to rely on the data as medical information .
( Exactly what other use it might be is n’t entirely clear to me . )
Since I did n’t originally go through every one of the 18 diseases deCODEme analyzes , I decided take a closer look at the scientific foundation for the company ’s risk assessments .
It turns out that for fully half of those conditions , including colon cancer and heart attack , deCODEme is relying on just one or two SNPs to calculate disease risk .
Risk for three conditions —
Alzheimer ’s disease , asthma and obesity — is based on a single SNP .
( I ’ve put together a chart listing the number of SNPs used to assess risk in all these conditions below the fold . )
In several instances , the very scientific publications that deCODEme uses to justify the use of one SNP also provide evidence for others that deCODEme , for some reason , has so far chosen to overlook .
In Alzheimer ’s disease , for instance , deCODEme cites this publication in support of its choice of a SNP called rs4420638 , which appears to affect the gene that produces apolipoprotein E , or ApoE , a protein linked to Alzheimer ’s susceptibility .
The same study , however , lists four additional SNPs , all meeting criteria of statistical significance .
In heart attack , deCODEme relies upon this New England Journal of Medicine study to implicate a SNP known as rs599839 .
The company , however , overlooks thirteen other SNPs linked to heart disease in the same study , including one called rs1333049 that carried “ the strongest association with coronary artery disease ” in two separate studies involving almost 7,400 patients .
Of course , deCODEme does n’t seem to explain why anywhere on its Web site .
Similarly , the study deCODEme cites to support its use of one of two SNPs in colon cancer notes explicitly that “ [ m]uch of the variation in inherited risk of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is probably due to combinations of common low risk variants ” — which , translated into English , essentially means that the genetic risk of colon cancer is most likely spread across a large number of common genetic variants , each of which increases risk of the disease by a small amount .
Yet deCODEme uses only two SNPs to assess its customers ’ risk of colon cancer , and outside of some boilerplate language , mostly leaves it to individuals themselves to interpret what the service is telling them .
( The company does make “ experts ” available to answer questions , although unsurprisingly that feature is n’t available to demo users . )
To be fair , the whole field of genetic disease analysis is still an imperfect science , not to mention a work in progress .
And there are some conditions — both types of diabetes and Crohn ’s disease , in particular — for which deCODEme bases its calculations on eight or more SNPs , which at least should give a fuller picture of the situation .
That said , though , at the moment the site looks very much like it was thrown up in a hurry ( it launched just a few days before 23andMe ) , which may explain the “ introductory ” pricing and the , well , introductory level of service here .
A chart listing the number of SNPs deCODEme uses for each disease - risk calculation follows after the jump .
NOTE : Links are to the deCODEme “ scientific details ” page for each condition .

Wanna know why Rudy 9iu11ni is still smiling , one thing the gas bags on TeeVee never make clear ?
Rudy can run the table in his home turf and be up 258 to zero in just these five states by Tsunami Tuesday .
1/29 Florida 57 Delegates -- WINNER TAKE ALL 2/5 New York 101 Delegates -- WINNER TAKE ALL 2/5 New Jersey 52 Delegates -- WINNER TAKE ALL 2/5 Connecticut 30 Delegates -- WINNER TAKE ALL 2/5 Deleware 18 Delegates -- WINNER TAKE ALL
( Note , the Arizona poll is obviously old , showing Rudy winning instead of McCain -- which wo n't happen .
Some of the other smaller states did not include Huckabee , let alone Paul , and were done prior to Huckabee 's surprising rise -- and some states never have been polled at all .
Numbers are rounded leaving fractional arithmetic errors we can ignore . )

Right now , Florida is a four - way tie and Rudy is in the lead by one point -- but he only has 21 % of the total support of those expressing a preference .
If he only gets 25 % in each of " his " states , he can walk away sole owner of their 258 delegate because the other 75 % will be divided between the Ron Paul Blimpies , and the three guys who have actually won something so far , Romney , McCain and Huckabee .
That plus a lucky pick up of one or more of the four other states with winner - take - all contests where 202 delegates are at stake , along with a plurality of the rest of states going on Feb.
5th who award delegates as a proportion of the vote count -- Rudy could easily be WAY ahead of the pack -- proclaimed a genius , come - back kid number 3 and frontrunner in one day .
It 's the media 's dream come true .
In fact , as long as Rudy captures his base states , needing only a pathetic 23 % or so to " win " while resoundingly rejected by the vast majority of New York , Florida , Jersey , Deleware and Connecticut Repubicans ; McCain could win all the other winner - take - all states ( W.Va. , Mont. , Utah , Ariz. , Missouri ) , split the other Tsunami Tuesday states and still be behind Rudy .
And McCain wo n't win Utah .
That 's Romney's .
Let 's do the math , just for fun .
( ** Source RCP -- CNN has different delegate counts awarded to date . )
Delegate Awards based on latest poll data from USA Election Polls .
Numbers below represent latest polling percentage of total delegates per state .
Even if Arizona were to pick McCain -- Rudy is still ahead 369 to McCain 's 242 .
Rudy 's advantage is that unlike Romney and Huckabee , everybody knows him .
McCain and Rudy did not have to be introduced to the American public .
Of course , now that introductions are over , the race is on .
Huckabee is sure to do well in Tennessee and Romney will clean up in Massachusetts where we have no polling data .
But that does n't bring 9iu11ani down or help the the guy most likely to catch him , McCain .
Worse news , the next big contest after Feb 5 in Ohio , where Rudy 's ahead by 16 % , although he 's way behind in Texas that same day , March 4 .
But it 's Huckabee plugged in right now to take that winner take all state .
But there 's always movement , for instance , it looks like McCain has found a weakness in the soft underbelly of Rudy 's home turf , New Jersey and Connecticut Florida is of course the key to Rudy 's demise .
If someone edges him out there , even by the slimmest of hanging chads , he gets zero delegates and has no momentum or media buzz ( not any good buzz anyway ) going into Tsunami Tuesday .
If he loses NJ and CT on Feb 5th , my chart 's inaccuracies become to large to ignore because that switches NJ's 52 delegates -- putting Rudy and McCain in spitting distance of each other .
Take FloriDUH out of the mix , awarding those 57 delegates to anyone but Rudy and McCain becomes the dominate player .
If McCain wins Florida -- it 's all over .
Rudy wo n't catch him and Romney can't .
Huckabee 's Dominionists will revolt either way and probably stay home come the general election anyway , and the GOP can't win the presidency without the evangelicals .
So all this is academic -- as is Huckabee 's candidacy -- it was South Carolina or bust with him ( unless he get 's Florida ) .
Obviously this is an approximation of the broadest kind and is in no way a realistic projection of the final results and ignores a substantial undecided voters -- but it give pause to show that state - by - state , disregarding national polling numbers , Rudy 9iu11iani CAN NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED -- Especially if he gets Florida .
Florida , FloriDUH , FLOR-I-FUCKING-DUH
!Fortunately for us Democrats , Rudy the asshole will be crushed by frontrunning Hillary ( Obama or Edwards ... not so much ) .
The difference is Hillary 's edge in the Greater New York Area for the electoral college edge .
Obama and Edwards would have to fight Rudy on that home turf much harder .
St. John of Damascuss Critique of Islam
Webmaster note :
The following passage is from Saint Johns monumental work , the Fount of Knowledge , part two entitled Heresies in Epitome : How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin .
It is usually just cited as Heresies .
The translators introduction points out that Fount of Knowledge is one of the most important single works produced in the Greek patristic period , offering as it does an extensive and lucid synthesis of the Greek theological science of the whole period .
It is the first great Summa of theology to appear in either the East or the West . Saint John (+ 749 ) is considered one of the great Fathers of the Church , and his writings hold a place of high honor in the Church .
His critique of Islam , or  the heresy of the Ishmaelites ,  is especially relevant for our times .
There is also the superstition of the Ishmaelites which to this day prevails and keeps people in error , being a forerunner of the Antichrist .
They are descended from Ishmael , [ who ] was born to Abraham of Agar , and for this reason they are called both Agarenes and Ishmaelites .
They are also called Saracens , which is derived from Sarras kenoi , or destitute of Sara , because of what Agar said to the angel :  Sara hath sent me away destitute .  [ 99 ]
These used to be idolaters and worshiped the morning star and Aphrodite , whom in their own language they called Khabár , which means great . [ 100 ]
And so down to the time of Heraclius they were very great idolaters .
From that time to the present a false prophet named Mohammed has appeared in their midst .
This man , after having chanced upon the Old and New Testaments and likewise , it seems , having conversed with an Arian monk , [ 101 ] devised his own heresy .
Then , having insinuated himself into the good graces of the people by a show of seeming piety , he gave out that a certain book had been sent down to him from heaven .
He had set down some ridiculous compositions in this book of his and he gave it to them as an object of veneration .
He says that there is one God , creator of all things , who has neither been begotten nor has begotten . [ 102 ]
He says that the Christ is the Word of God and His Spirit , but a creature and a servant , and that He was begotten , without seed , of Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron . [ 103 ]
For , he says , the Word and God and the Spirit entered into Mary and she brought forth Jesus , who was a prophet and servant of God .
And he says that the Jews wanted to crucify Him in violation of the law , and that they seized His shadow and crucified this .
But the Christ Himself was not crucified , he says , nor did He die , for God out of His love for Him took Him to Himself into heaven . [ 104 ]
And he says this , that when the Christ had ascended into heaven God asked Him :  O Jesus , didst thou say :  I am the Son of God and God ? 
And Jesus , he says , answered :  Be merciful to me , Lord .
Thou knowest that I did not say this and that I did not scorn to be thy servant .
But sinful men have written that I made this statement , and they have lied about me and have fallen into error . 
And God answered and said to Him :  I know that thou didst not say this word .  [ 105 ]
There are many other extraordinary and quite ridiculous things in this book which he boasts was sent down to him from God .
But when we ask :  And who is there to testify that God gave him the book ?
And which of the prophets foretold that such a prophet would rise up ? they are at a loss .
And we remark that Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai , with God appearing in the sight of all the people in cloud , and fire , and darkness , and storm .
And we say that all the Prophets from Moses on down foretold the coming of Christ and how Christ God ( and incarnate Son of God ) was to come and to be crucified and die and rise again , and how He was to be the judge of the living and dead .
Then , when we say :  How is it that this prophet of yours did not come in the same way , with others bearing witness to him ?
And how is it that God did not in your presence present this man with the book to which you refer , even as He gave the Law to Moses , with the people looking on and the mountain smoking , so that you , too , might have certainty ? they answer that God does as He pleases .
 This ,  we say ,  We know , but we are asking how the book came down to your prophet . 
Then they reply that the book came down to him while he was asleep .
Then we jokingly say to them that , as long as he received the book in his sleep and did not actually sense the operation , then the popular adage applies to him ( which runs : You re spinning me dreams . ) [ 106 ]
When we ask again :  How is it that when he enjoined us in this book of yours not to do anything or receive anything without witnesses , you did not ask him :  First do you show us by witnesses that you are a prophet and that you have come from God , and show us just what Scriptures there are that testify about you they are ashamed and remain silent .
[ Then we continue : ]
 Although you may not marry a wife without witnesses , or buy , or acquire property ; although you neither receive an ass nor possess a beast of burden unwitnessed ; and although you do possess both wives and property and asses and so on through witnesses , yet it is only your faith and your scriptures that you hold unsubstantiated by witnesses .
For he who handed this down to you has no warranty from any source , nor is there anyone known who testified about him before he came .
On the contrary , he received it while he was asleep . 
Moreover , they call us Hetaeriasts , or Associators , because , they say , we introduce an associate with God by declaring Christ to the Son of God and God .
We say to them in rejoinder :  The Prophets and the Scriptures have delivered this to us , and you , as you persistently maintain , accept the Prophets .
So , if we wrongly declare Christ to be the Son of God , it is they who taught this and handed it on to us . 
But some of them say that it is by misinterpretation that we have represented the Prophets as saying such things , while others say that the Hebrews hated us and deceived us by writing in the name of the Prophets so that we might be lost .
And again we say to them :  As long as you say that Christ is the Word of God and Spirit , why do you accuse us of being Hetaeriasts ?
For the word , and the spirit , is inseparable from that in which it naturally has existence .
Therefore , if the Word of God is in God , then it is obvious that He is God .
If , however , He is outside of God , then , according to you , God is without word and without spirit .
Consequently , by avoiding the introduction of an associate with God you have mutilated Him .
It would be far better for you to say that He has an associate than to mutilate Him , as if you were dealing with a stone or a piece of wood or some other inanimate object .
Thus , you speak untruly when you call us Hetaeriasts ; we retort by calling you Mutilators of God . 
They furthermore accuse us of being idolaters , because we venerate the cross , which they abominate .
And we answer them :  How is it , then , that you rub yourselves against a stone in your Kaba [ 107 ] and kiss and embrace it ?
Then some of them say that Abraham had relations with Agar upon it , but others say that he tied the camel to it , when he was going to sacrifice Isaac .
And we answer them :  Since Scripture says that the mountain was wooded and had trees from which Abraham cut wood for the holocaust and laid it upon Isaac , [ 108 ] and then he left the asses behind with the two young men , why talk nonsense ?
For in that place neither is it thick with trees nor is there passage for asses . 
And they are embarrassed , but they still assert that the stone is Abrahams .
Then we say :  Let it be Abrahams , as you so foolishly say .
Then , just because Abraham had relations with a woman on it or tied a camel to it , you are not ashamed to kiss it , yet you blame us for venerating the cross of Christ by which the power of the demons and the deceit of the Devil was destroyed .
This stone that they talk about is a head of that Aphrodite whom they used to worship and whom they called Khabár .
Even to the present day , traces of the carving are visible on it to careful observers .
As has been related , this Mohammed wrote many ridiculous books , to each one of which he set a title .
For example , there is the book On Woman , [ 109 ] in which he plainly makes legal provision for taking four wives and , if it be possible , a thousand concubines as many as one can maintain , besides the four wives .
He also made it legal to put away whichever wife one might wish , and , should one so wish , to take to oneself another in the same way .
Mohammed had a friend named Zeid .
This man had a beautiful wife with whom Mohammed fell in love .
Once , when they were sitting together , Mohammed said :  Oh , by the way , God has commanded me to take your wife . 
The other answered :  You are an apostle .
Do as God has told you and take my wife .
Rather to tell the story over from the beginning he said to him :  God has given me the command that you put away your wife . 
And he put her away .
Then several days later :  Now ,  he said ,  God has commanded me to take her . 
Then , after he had taken her and committed adultery with her , he made this law :  Let him who will put away his wife .
And if , after having put her away , he should return to her , let another marry her .
For it is not lawful to take her unless she have been married by another .
Furthermore , if a brother puts away his wife , let his brother marry her , should he so wish .  [ 110 ]
In the same book he gives such precepts as this :  Work the land which God hath given thee and beautify it .
And do this , and do it in such a manner  [ 111 ] not to repeat all the obscene things that he did .
Then there is the book of The Camel of God . [ 112 ]
About this camel he says that there was a camel from God and that she drank the whole river and could not pass through two mountains , because there was not room enough .
There were people in that place , he says , and they used to drink the water on one day , while the camel would drink it on the next .
Moreover , by drinking the water she furnished them with nourishment , because she supplied them with milk instead of water .
Then , because these men were evil , they rose up , he says , and killed the camel .
However , she had an offspring , a little camel , which , he says , when the mother had been done away with , called upon God and God took it to Himself .
Then we say to them :  Where did that camel come from ? 
And they say that it was from God .
Then we say :  Was there another camel coupled with this one ? 
And they say :  No . 
 Then how ,  we say , was it begotten ?
For we see that your camel is without father and without mother and without genealogy , and that the one that begot it suffered evil .
Neither is it evident who bred her .
And also , this little camel was taken up .
So why did not your prophet , with whom , according to what you say , God spoke , find out about the camel where it grazed , and who got milk by milking it ?
Or did she possibly , like her mother , meet with evil people and get destroyed ?
Or did she enter into paradise before you , so that you might have the river of milk that you so foolishly talk about ?
For you say that you have three rivers flowing in paradiseone of water , one of wine , and one of milk .
If your forerunner the camel is outside of paradise , it is obvious that she has dried up from hunger and thirst , or that others have the benefit of her milk and so your prophet is boasting idly of having conversed with God , because God did not reveal to him the mystery of the camel .
But if she is in paradise , she is drinking water still , and you for lack of water will dry up in the midst of the paradise of delight .
And if , there being no water , because the camel will have drunk it all up , you thirst for wine from the river of wine that is flowing by , you will become intoxicated from drinking pure wine and collapse under the influence of the strong drink and fall asleep .
Then , suffering from a heavy head after sleeping and being sick from the wine , you will miss the pleasures of paradise .
How , then , did it not enter into the mind of your prophet that this might happen to you in the paradise of delight ?
He never had any idea of what the camel is leading to now , yet you did not even ask him , when he held forth to you with his dreams on the subject of the three rivers .
We plainly assure you that this wonderful camel of yours has preceded you into the souls of asses , where you , too , like beasts are destined to go .
And there is the exterior darkness and everlasting punishment , roaring fire , sleepless worms , and hellish demons . 
Again , in the book of The Table , Mohammed says that the Christ asked God for a table and that it was given Him .
For God , he says , said to Him :  I have given to thee and thine an incorruptible table .  [ 113 ]
And again , in the book of The Heifer , [ 114 ] he says some other stupid and ridiculous things , which , because of their great number , I think must be passed over .
He made it a law that they be circumcised and the women , too , and he ordered them not to keep the Sabbath and not to be baptized .
And , while he ordered them to eat some of the things forbidden by the Law , he ordered them to abstain from others .
He furthermore absolutely forbade the drinking of wine .

Posted 26 March , 2006 .
In June of 2004 , a neo-crazy media sycophant at Reuters ( Charbonneau ) reported that unidentified " diplomats and nuclear experts " had told him that " an experimental high - tech intelligence technique developed by the United States " had detected what sounded like the whine of gas - centrifuges , spinning at supersonic speeds , operating " somewhere " in Syria .
Furthermore , the unidentified " diplomats " had told him such gas - centrifuges , operating supersonically , in cascades , are effectively required in order to enrich large quantities of uranium to weapons - grade quality , and " could only have come from " the AQ Khan network .
( It is , perhaps , possible that Bonkers Bolton was not one of the unidentified " diplomats " telling these outrageous tales . )
True , metallurgist AQ Khan had returned to Pakistan in 1978 , with stolen Urenco industrial secrets , and established a uranium - enrichment program at Kahuta , based upon his P - 1 gas - centrifuge , a modification of Urenco ’s first generation , subsonic aluminum - rotor design .
But Khan had trouble producing aluminum rotors which would pass even the subsonic reliability “ spin ” test .
So , in the 1990s , Khan developed the P - 2 , his modification of Urenco ’s second - generation design , which had maraging steel rotors , capable of sustained operation at supersonic speeds .
According to Jane ’s Defense Weekly , by the time Pakistan held its first international arms bazaar in 2000 , there was available at the booth of Khan Research Laboratories a brochure for the KRL - developed second - generation , supersonic , maraging steel rotor P - 2 , as well as an associated 10 - page catalog of specialty vacuum pumps , gauges , high - voltage switches , power supplies , and other equipment .
According to KRL representatives , all the listed items were available for sale and had been approved for export by the Pakistan government .
And , by the time of the high - pitched whine in Syria , Iran had signed  and begun complying with in advance of its ratification  an Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Hence , Iran voluntarily shared with Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei its nuclear acquisition records , which included  in addition to all the P - 1 aluminum - rotor junk  some P - 2 components and design information .
ElBaradei was very interested to know everything possible about what Iran had done with those P - 2 designs / components .
The Iranians claimed that they turned them over , circa 1995 , to a private - sector entity in Tehran , who got nowhere because he was unable to obtain ( because of U.S. sanctions on Iran ) any maraging steel with which to fabricate the rotors .
But , last week an unidentified " diplomat " told another Reuters neo-crazy media sycophant ( Heinrich ) , Iran is now mechanically testing  not yet having introduced into them any uranium - hexafluoride feedstock  upgraded P - 2 supersonic gas centrifuges , reportedly employing third - generation " composite " rotors , at its Natanz plant .
ElBaradei is expected to report the details  voluntarily provided him by the Iranians  of the Iranian P - 2 research and development program to the IAEA Board of Governors later this month .
Okay , now back to Syria .
The Israelis apparently were unable to find , in 2004 , whatever it was that was alleged to be somewhere in Syria , giving off a high - pitched whine .
But , according to Seymour Hersh ,
" Sometime after midnight on September 6 , 2007 , at least four low - flying Israeli Air Force fighters crossed into Syrian airspace and carried out a secret bombing mission on the banks of the Euphrates River , about ninety miles north of the Iraq border .
The seemingly unprovoked bombing , which came after months of heightened tension between Israel and Syria over military exercises and troop buildups by both sides along the Golan Heights , was , by almost any definition , an act of war . "
Hersh spent the next three months , attempting to find out what was bombed and why  making several trips to Syria and Israel , interviewing military , intelligence and other government officials in both those countries , and in the United States .
Within weeks of the disclosure by the Syrians of the seemingly unprovoked bombing , neo-crazy media sycophants at the New York Times and the Washington Post were " reporting " that U.S. and Israeli officials had concluded that the North Koreans were constructing at the site a weapons - grade plutonium - producing nuclear reactor  similar to the one constructed for the Koreans by the Soviets at Yongbyon .
Someone apparently then commissioned David Albright ( who claims to be a " physicist " and a former " UN inspector " in Iraq ) to " analyze " the satelitte photo - imagery of a 2000 square kilometer area of Syria , in an attempt to identify a site that was consistent with the earlier Times and Post nuclear - reactor site reports .
Quoth Albright ;
" The fact that we independently found this site by searching for a reactor either is one of the world ’s most remarkable coincidences or is further evidence that the site could be a reactor . "
However , ElBaradei insists
" Our [ IAEA ] experts who have carefully analyzed the satellite imagery say it is unlikely that this building was a nuclear facility . "
Nevertheless , Hersh reports that ;
" On October 3rd , the London Spectator , citing much of the same information , published an overheated account of the September 6th raid , claiming that it ‘ may have saved the world from a devastating threat , ’ and that ‘ a very senior British ministerial source ’ had warned , ‘ If people had known how close we came to World War Three that day there ’d have been mass panic . ’
" However , in three months of reporting for this article , I was repeatedly told by current and former intelligence , diplomatic , and congressional officials that they were not aware of any solid evidence of ongoing nuclear - weapons programs in Syria . "
Now , Albright has taken issue with Hersh ’s article , claiming that he took one quote " out of its original context , " and used it to imply that Albright had " backed away " from his original identification of the site as almost certainly a nuclear reactor under construction .
But , Albright did not take issue with Hersh ’s attribution of this absolutely mind - blowing quote to Albright ;
" I can understand the Israeli point of view , given the history with Iran and Algeria ,
" Both nations had nuclear - weapons programs and , after being caught cheating , declared their reactors to be civil reactors , for peacetime use .
" The international groups , like the U.N. and the I.A.E.A , never shut them down . "
Both Algeria and Iran had nuclear weapons programs ?
Involving IAEA - Safeguarded nuclear reactors ?
Both were " caught cheating " ?
Caught doing what ?
Caught by whom ?
One last question : did Bonkers Bolton commission Albright ’s search for that Syrian " reactor " site ?
彼氏に浮気された …
どちらかと言えば貧乳派って言ってたくせに、なんで私より胸大きい人と浮気するんだよ！( T_T)
結局そのまま別れたものの、色々負けた気がしてなんだか釈然としません。
「 こうなったらバストアップして見返してやろう」
そう思ってバストアップ方法を調べていたら【リゾレーヌ
サプリ】というバストアップサプリを見つけました。
どうやら最近人気のバストアップサプリみたいです。
バストアップサプリって副作用が話題になってたけど、リゾレーヌ
サプリはその原因になった成分を使ってないらしい…。
… 本当に ？ ( 笑 )
試したいという反面、本当に効果があるのかと疑っている自分がいます。
ですのでまずはリゾレーヌ サプリについて詳しく調べてみることにしました。
リゾレーヌ サプリでバストアップした人の良い口コ ミ
口コミを見てダメだったら調べる意味もないだろうなと思ったので、まずはリゾレーヌ サプリの口コミを調べます。
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲んでバストアップできた人っているのでしょうか？
検索してみるとバストアップに成功した人の口コミがたくさん見つかりました。
B →Dになりました！
以前バストアップに取り組んだときは、毎日豆乳を飲んだりキャベツを食べたり…そんな生活に嫌気がさして1ヶ月すらも続けられませんでした。もちろんサイズは変わらず…。でも諦めたくなかったのでリゾレーヌ
サプリを試してみたんです。サッと水で飲むだけで簡単だし、飽き性の私でも続けられました。そのおかげでなんとB→Dに！サプリなんてと思わないで何でも試してみるものだと思いました。
順調に成長していま す
バストアップサプリは副作用が気になってなかなか手を出せないでいました。でもリゾレーヌ
サプリは副作用の原因になるプエラリアやブラックコホシュが使われていないと知って、思い切って注文してみたんです。体調を崩したりもなく、順調に胸が成長してきています。1カップ上がったみたいでブラがきつくなってきたので、今週末には新しいブラを買いに行こうと思います。出費は痛いけど嬉しい出費でした。
まさか自分 がDに…
まさか自分がDカップになる日がくるとは思っても見ませんでした。だって27歳ですよ？完全に成長期終わってますよ(笑)美容にも良いみたいだからって試してみて良かったです。彼氏も嬉しそうなのがちょっとアレですが…(笑)巨乳だと男性が優しくなると思っていましたが、実際は女性も優しくなりますね。なんだか得した気分です。
複数サプリを飲むのが面倒な人にオススメします
リゾレーヌ サプリはバストアップ以外にも、美容やダイエットにも効果が期待できるっていうのに惹かれました。複数サプリを飲むのって面倒なので、できるだけ1つにまとめたかったんですよね。肌の調子も良いですし、今ではリゾレーヌ
サプリと+2種類だけになりました。ちなみに肝心のバストアップはすごいですよ、先日測ったらEカップに到達していました。
目指せメリハリボディ！
メリハリのある身体になりたくてリゾレーヌ
サプリを購入しました。お腹の脂肪は運動すればどうにかなりますが、バストは努力してどうにかなる気がしなかったので…。バストアップマッサージやエクササイズも頑張っていたおかげか、2ヶ月で1カップ上がりました！大きくなるのにはもっと時間がかかると思っていたので本当に嬉しいです。体は引き締まってきているので、この調子でモデルみたいな体型を目指します！
ついに脱まな板 …！
Aカップのまな板がずっとコンプレックスでした。20歳くらいのときはまだ希望を持ってたんですけど…。ですのでリゾレーヌ
サプリを飲んで大きくなったときは本当に感動しました。ようやくパットを使えるレベルの胸になれたんだって。もうすぐCカップになります。脱まな板できてよかったです。
良くても1カップ上がるくらいだろうと思っていたら、結構2カップ上がった人もいるみたい！
これなら私も試してみる価値があるかも！
でも良い口コミだけ見て勢いで買っちゃうのは危ないですよね。
ですので次は悪い口コミも調べてみます。
リゾレーヌ サプリでバストアップできなかった人の悪い口コミ
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲んだ人の中には、バストアップできなかった人もいるみたいです。
とは言っても、さほど気にする必要はないかなという印象でした。
モチベーションが続かない
すぐに巨乳になれると思ってリゾレーヌ サプリを飲み始めたけど、成長するのに結構時間かかりますね。個人差があるのは仕方ないと思うけど。1ヶ月経つのに1カップも変わらないのはモチベーションが続きません。
美容やダイエットにはイマイチかも
バストアップはできましたが、美容やダイエットにはイマイチでした。これといって変化がないし。まだ飲み始めたばかりだから時間がかかるのかな？ちょっと期待はずれです。
面倒になって続かなかった
たしかにリゾレーヌ サプリはラクでした。水で飲むだけで大した手間にもなりません。でも手軽すぎて逆に面倒になって続きませんでした。飲む時間も適当になってしまったし、私には合わなかったです。
まぁ成長までにかかる時間って個人差があるでしょうしね。
生活リズムも違えば食生活も違う、当然成長するスピードも違うでしょう。
ですので短い期間でバストアップできたらラッキーくらいに飲み始めるのが良いかと思います。
リゾレーヌ サプリに は3つの効果があります
リゾレーヌ サプリの口コミを見ていたら、バストアップ以外にも効果が期待できるみたい！
でも具体的にはどんな効果があるのでしょうか？
正直公式サイトを見てもよくわからなかったので、私が調べてまとめ直してみました。
バストアップ効 果
リゾレーヌ サプリにはバストアップ効果があります 。
一番メインの効果ですね 。
一時期話題になったバストアップサプリの副作用、その原因になったプエラリアやブラックコホシュは使われていません。
代わりにボロンやイソフラボンといった成分が使われています。
イソフラボンはバストアップ成分として有名ですね。
ボロンはキャベツやナッツに含まれる成分で、最近バストアップ成分として注目されています。
じゃあキャベツと豆乳を毎日摂れば良いんじゃないの？って思う人もいるかもしれませんが…その生活って結構地獄ですよ？
そもそも食事で摂取できる量って微量らしいので、リゾレーヌ
サプリで効率よく摂取した方が良いと思います。
我慢して続けるのってストレスも溜まりますし、美容のことを考えるとメリットが無いと思うんですよね…。
美容効果
リゾレーヌ サプリには美容効果があります 。
プラセンタや白きくらげなど、美容効果が期待できる成分が豊富に使われています。
アミノ酸の働きを助けるピオチンも含まれているので、肌の衰えを感じている人に良さそうですね。
美容のためにアミノ酸を意識して摂ることはあっても、その働きを助ける成分ってあまり意識しませんよね。
ですので他のサプリと併用しながらリゾレーヌ サプリを摂るのも効果的かと思います。
またバストアップに加えて美容サプリ、ダイエットサプリと飲むのは結構面倒です。
リゾレーヌ サプリの効果を考えると複数飲む手間を省けそうですし、口コミにもそのような投稿がありました。
ですので人によってはサプリの量を減らせるかもしれませんね。
めぐりを整える効 果
リゾレーヌ サプリにはめぐりを整える効果があります 。
女性のめぐりバランスが崩れると、気分がしずみがちになったり、体調にも影響があります。
めぐりは精神的な要因であったり、生活サイクルによっても崩れてしまいます。
自分ではなかなかコントロールしにくいものですので、リゾレーヌ
サプリのようにめぐりをサポートするのが良いですね。
自分でどうにもならない部分は、外部のちからを借りてラクをしましょう！(笑)
まためぐりを整える働きによってバストアップも促されます。
成長しやすい環境を整える意味合いもありますので、毎日続けて飲むのが良さそうですね。
リゾレーヌ サプリの飲み方を調べまし た
リゾレーヌ サプリを購入する前に、飲み方についての記載を見つけたのでまとめておきます。
飲み方ってちゃんと読まないから適当になっちゃうんですよね(笑)
ですので自分への確認用だと思ってください。
リゾレーヌ サプリは1日に1～2粒を目安に飲みます。
タイミングに決まりはなく、毎日継続して飲める時間に飲めばOKだそうです。
… さほど気にする必要は無さそうですが、予め飲むタイミングは決めて置いた方が良さそうですね。
飲み忘れにくいタイミングを考えると、起床後もしくは食後が候補としてあげられます。
1日2粒であれば、食後よりも起床後が良さそうですね。
あ と1回は就寝前であったり、好きなタイミングに飲めば良さそうです。
洗面台のところに置いておけば歯磨きした流れで飲めるから忘れにくいかな？
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲んでバストアップに挑戦 ！
気になったことは一通り調べ尽くして、効果も問題無さそう！
ですのでリゾレーヌ サプリを注文してみました ！
これだけ調べておいて飲まないなんて選択肢はないですよ、私も本気でバストアップしたいので(笑)
リゾレーヌ サプリは公式サイトが一番安いっぽかったので、公式サイトで注文！
まだ届いていないので、また届いたら更新していきますね。
リゾレーヌ サプリが届きまし た
注文していたリゾレーヌ サプリが届きました ！
Amazonとか楽天以外の通販を使ったのは初めてだったのですが、思っていたよりも早く届きますね。
梱包は中身がわからないようにという気配りからか、無地の箱で送り状にも商品名の記載はありませんでした。
ですので家族と住んでいる人でも安心だと思いました。
( 先に開封されたらどうしようもありませんが…)
さっそく開封してみると赤色のパッケージが入っていました。
リゾレーヌ サプリ は5色のパッケージからランダムで届けられるので、これはちょっとしたお楽しみ要素ですね(笑)
サプリ自体は大きすぎず小さすぎず、水で簡単に流し込める大きさです。
当然味はありません(笑)
噛み潰したら味もあると思うんですけど、噛み潰して美味しかったことって無いのでやめておきます。
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲み始め て1 ヶ月が経ちました
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲み始めてか ら1ヶ月経過！
32日目とかちょっと日数過ぎてるとかツッコミはいりませんよ！(笑)
バストアップの方は思っていたよりも順調です。
毎日バストアップマッサージをしているのでよくわかるのですが、膨らみが大きくなったように実感しています。
この調子で続ければボン・キュッ・ボンの体型も夢じゃないかも…。
でもリゾレーヌ サプリだけに頼るっていうのは違う気もするので、他にもできそうなバストアップ方法があれば試していこうと思います。
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲ん でEカップに！
つい にEカップになりました！
それこそ最初 はCカップしかなかった私がですよ？
成長期終わってからでも諦めなければ巨乳になれるんだと喜んでいます。
本当 はDに上がった時点で結構満足だったんですけど、どうせならもっと上を目指してみたいじゃないですか(笑)
その結果 がEカップです。
ちなみにバストアップマッサージ以外には、大胸筋を鍛えること、睡眠はしっかりとることを実践していました。
バストの土台になる大胸筋が発達していないと大きくならないって聞くし、体は寝ている間に成長するっていうので大事なのはこの2つかなと思いまして。
リゾレーヌ サプリが手軽に続けやすい分、他のバストアップ方法との合せ技で取り組んだのが良かったのでしょうね。
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲むメリットとデメリッ ト
リゾレーヌ サプリを買うかどうかで踏ん切りがつかない人もいるかと思います。
ですので私がリゾレーヌ サプリを飲んで感じたメリットとデメリットをまとめておきます。
リゾレーヌ サプリのメリッ ト
リゾレーヌ サプリのメリットは続けやすいことです 。
バストアップの方法で王道なのは、キャベツや豆乳を毎日摂る、バストアップマッサージです。
でもキャベツと豆乳って毎日続けるのはつらいですよね。
そもそもそんなに美味しいものでもありませんから…。
ですので味がなくてサッと水で飲むだけでOKのリゾレーヌ
サプリは、続けやすいというだけで大きなアドバンテージがあります。
当然ですが、リゾレーヌ サプリを飲んでいるからと言って他の方法を実践してはいけないなんてこともありません。
私も他の方法を併用しながらリゾレーヌ サプリを飲んでいましたし、複数のバストアップ方法を組み合わせるのが効果的です。
リゾレーヌ サプリのデメリッ ト
リゾレーヌ サプリのデメリットは成長に時間がかかることです。
飲んですぐに大きくなるわけではないので、モチベーションが続くかがカギになります。
というのも手軽にできるものほど、面倒だと感じたらモチベーションが一気になくなるからです。
「 イマイチ変化がわからないしもういいや」など、思い当たるフシはありませんか？
私はすごくありますよ、ダイエットサプリを飲んでいたときがそうでしたから…。
個人差があることを考えると、数ヶ月で効果を判断するのは時期尚早です。
ですのでできるだけ長く続けるのがオススメです。
美容であったり体を引き締めるのに必要な成分が配合されているので、バストアップのためだけに飲んでいるというより、バストアップ・美容・ダイエットすべてのために飲んでいる認識でいた方が良いでしょう。
リゾレーヌ サプリの効果を高めるためのコツ・ポイントは？
リゾレーヌ サプリを飲むにしても、少しでもバストアップは早い方が良いですよね。
ですのでリゾレーヌ サプリの効果を高めるためのコツ・ポイントをまとめておきます。
バストアップマッサージをする
バストアップマッサージをしましょう。
マッサージすることでめぐりが良くなりますので、バストに栄養が運ばれやすくなります。
リゾレーヌ サプリはバストアップに必要な栄養素を簡単に摂れますので、より効果を高めるには手っ取り早い方法です。
特に気温の下がる時期は、血管が収縮して血流が悪くなりがちです。
ですので寒い時期は毎日マッサージするように心がけたいですね。
入浴時にマッサージすれば寒くないので手軽に続けられますよ。
入浴時以外だとどうしても面倒になって数日でやめてしまいがちです。
マッサージクリームを用意しても続けられずにやめる人が多いので、基本的には入浴時をオススメします。
大胸筋を鍛え る
バストアップするために大胸筋を鍛えましょう。
大胸筋は胸の筋肉ですね。
両手を胸の前に合わせてぐっと力を入れた状態を維持するような筋トレでOKです。
胸を支えるための筋肉がなければ、大きくなるものも大きくなりません。
土台が無いのにどうやって大きくするんだって話です。
ですので適度に大胸筋を鍛える必要があります。
筋トレは空腹時を避けて行いましょう。
お腹が空いている状態で筋トレをすると、筋肉が分解されてエネルギーとして使われます。
… これでは本末転倒ですよね 。
夕食後のテレビを見ているときなど、お腹は空いていなくて暇な時間を上手く活用するのがオススメです。
しっかりと睡眠をと る
リゾレーヌ サプリの効果を高めるために、しっかりと睡眠をとりましょう。
体は寝ている間に成長します。
それは胸も同じことです。
改めて1日の行動を見直してみると、無駄な時間は必ず見つかります。
たとえば就寝前のスマホやテレビですね。
睡眠時間を削ってまで見なければならないような情報も番組もありません。
それはこれまでの人生を振り返ってみればよくわかりますよね。
早く寝れば体力も回復しやすいですし、日中のぼーっとした感覚も減ります。
ずっと早寝は難しいですので、まずは3日間続けることから始めましょう。
寝る前にダラダラしたい気持ちもわからなくはないですが無駄な時間です。
今日からでもできることですので、すぐに実践しましょう。
リゾレーヌ サプリに副作用はある ？
以前バストアップサプリが副作用で話題になったことがありましたね。
ですので私もリゾレーヌ サプリに副作用がないか心配でした。
だからこそこれだけ時間をかけて詳しく調べたというのもあります。
副作用で話題になったバストアップサプリには、プエラリアとブラックコホシュという成分が使われていました。
こ の2つの成分は厚生労働省から注意喚起されている成分でもあります。
リゾレーヌ サプリの成分を調べてみると、プエラリアとブラックコホシュは使われていませんでした。
ですので以前話題になったような健康被害の心配はないと思って良いでしょう。
でも注意したいのが過剰摂取！
どんな成分でも過剰摂取すれば副作用を起こす可能性はあります。
ですので目安を大きく上回るような、常識を超えた飲み方はやめましょう。
もったいないのでさすがにそんな飲み方をする人はいないと思いますが…世の中いろいろな人がいますからね…。
用法用量を守って飲めば過剰に心配する必要はないと思います。
リゾレーヌ サプリの販売価格をまとめま す
体験談を付きしたりしてたら結構な長さになりましたね…。
でも最後まで読んでくれてありがとうございます！
せっかくですので私がリゾレーヌ サプリを買うときに調べた価格の情報も記載しておきますね。
リゾレーヌ サプリを購入するときの参考にしてください 。
リゾレーヌ サプリを最安値で買うには ？
リゾレーヌ サプリを最安値で手に入れたい 。
誰しもそう考えると思います。
私もできるだけ出費を抑えたかったので最安値で販売しているところを探しました。
結論から言うと公式サイトが最安値でした。
実店舗だと取り扱っているお店を見つけられず、時間と交通費を浪費しただけ。
通販サイト はAmazonも楽天も取り扱っていませんでした。
また販売されたばかりというのも理由なのでしょうね。
今後取り扱いが始まる可能性もありますが、待ってる時間がもったいない！
ですのでリゾレーヌ サプリは公式サイトで購入しました 。
あともう1つ、理由があります。
それは比べるまでもなく、公式サイトがブッチギリで最安値だと思ったからなんです。
リゾレーヌ サプリの価 格
リゾレーヌ サプリは公式サイトで【初 回100 円 】で販売されています。
送料無料ですのでワンコインですね。
定期コースではあるものの、定価8,800円が100円は破格だと思います。
2回目以降は30%オフの【6,160円】で購入できます。
バストアップするためにはある程度続ける必要がありますし、毎回定価で購入するのは出費が大きくなるのでもったいない…。
ですのでリゾレーヌ サプリは公式サイトの定期コースを利用して手に入れるのが賢い選択だと思います。
It ’s FISA Day in your Senate – amazing how this was scheduled for Potomac Primary Day , huh ? – and Matt Browner Hamlin has the agenda up at Holdfast .
My big issue is item # 4 : retroactive immunity for telecoms .
Verizon and AT&T have done all they can to pretend that they had no idea that their participation in warrantless wiretapping might be , you know , a full - monty assault on the Constitution itself .
I mean , shucks , they wuz just doing what the president wanted them to , and if you ca n’t trust the White House who can you trust ?
Here ’s what Sen. Russ Feingold had to say on the matter :
Let ’s pay close attention to this part :
The telephone companies and the government have been operating under this simple framework for 30 years .
The companies have experienced , highly trained , and highly compensated lawyers who know this law inside and out .
In view of this history , it is inconceivable that any telephone companies that allegedly cooperated with the administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program did not know what their obligations were .
And it is just as implausible that those companies believed they were entitled to simply assume the lawfulness of a government request for assistance .
This whole effort to obtain retroactive immunity is based on an assumption that does n’t hold water .
I ’d give anything to have a transcript of the conversations that went on in the respective telco legal departments over this , because I ’ve dealt with corporate lawyers .
Even more to the point , I worked in a telco and dealt with telco lawyers .
I ’m with Feingold – I call bullshit .
Of all the lies that the American public has been asked to endure since early 2001 , this is easily one of the biggest .
In terms of plausibility , this far surpasses the whole Iraq / WMD debacle , because in that case there was actually evidence to be fudged .
Here we ’re simply asked to accept that some of the nation ’s finest corporate lawyers saw nothing remotely wrong with a program that a pre-law student with middling marks at a third - rate community college could tell you was iffy at best .
Two responses ought to quickly lay this parade of foolishness to rest .
First , I ’ve seen telecom lawyers throw up roadblocks over innocuous official communications due to little more than arguments over comma placement .
Legal departments in these kinds of companies are legendary in their aversion to risk , and they can imagine risk in places that would n’t bother a textbook paranoid schizophrenic .
Second , Joe Nacchio realized it was illegal and politely declined .
Let me repeat : Joe Freakin’ Nacchio , a guy whose epic lust for power and cash has him facing prison and brazilians of dollars in fines .
When a deal is too crooked for the devil himself , I do n’t want to hear a damned word about how Legal thought it was all kittens and rainbows .
The Senate needs to nard - stomp this immunity crap and then start summoning attorneys at Verizon and AT&T .
Bring a stick , too .
Somebody will eventually sing , and once you get one on record the dominoes will start to fall .
Meanwhile , stop insulting our intelligence .
Larry Page , Google 's billionaire co-founder , is set to marry his girlfriend , Lucy Southworth , on a tiny Caribbean island this weekend , a source familiar with the wedding arrangements said .
The impending nuptials will create an instant billionaire out of Southworth , who will share in Page 's estimated $ 21 billion fortune .
The couple will hold the ceremony on an island enclave owned by Richard Branson , the billionaire owner of Virgin Group , who will act as best man to Larry , the source said .
Turkmen children now spend longer at school , and are allowed to learn foreign languages
A year after his death , the BBC's Natalia Antelava visited the country and found that the curtain is beginning to rise , revealing a nation that seems to defy all expectations .
Under the huge golden statue of their deceased ruler , two dozen people danced and sang in celebration .
The air filled with the beat of drums and excited screams .
Girls laughed as young men , twisting and twirling , threw themselves on the ground .
We have peace , we have stability and we know what will happen tomorrow
Tatyana
Turkmenistan resident
It is a tradition in Turkmenistan for wedding parties to visit the monument of Niyazov , the man known as Turkmenbashi - Father of the Turkmen - who turned his energy - rich nation into one of the most isolated corners of our planet .
His eccentric decrees and bizarre laws have always made headlines - he brought fame to Turkmenistan by banning opera and ballet , outlawing beards and renaming months of the year after himself and his family members .
The flamboyant weirdness of his rule often took the global media 's attention away from the real issues - political oppression and total lack of freedom .
Blinded by Niyazov 's eccentricity , the world seems to have ignored the normal side of Turkmenistan .
And a year on since Niyazov 's death , that is the side that seems to be thriving .
Brighter place
Tatyana , an attractive , 36 - year - old single woman , told me why she would never want to leave the country .
" Look at our neighbours - in Afghanistan , there is chaos and bloodshed .
Iran can get bombed any minute .
Uzbekistan is so poor , people are fleeing the country .
Turkmen couples still meet beneath golden statues of Niyazov
" Here we have peace , we have stability and we know what will happen tomorrow . "
And now , she added , there is more hope and optimism here than ever before .
A year since Niyazov 's death , Turkmenistan is a brighter place .
The change brought by the new President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has been slow but steady .
It is now easier to travel , the internet is no longer banned , schools teach foreign languages , and the government is talking about opening up the country 's enormous natural gas reserves to foreign investors .
The new president has reopened rural libraries , which were banned in Niyazov 's time - people in the villages , the late leader used to say , did not read books anyway .
' Revolutionary change '
Niyazov also reduced the number of years children went to school , which meant their qualifications were not enough to allow them to enter foreign universities .
But in 2007 , not a single student in Turkmenistan graduated from high school - instead each was required to do an extra year which has been put back on the curriculum .
Perhaps an autocracy that works is better than democracy that does n't
Turkmen journalist
" For Turkmenistan , these are revolutionary changes , " said a senior Western diplomat in the capital Ashgabat .
But none of it means that this country is about to embrace Western - style democracy .
Mr Berdymukhamedov has promised to preserve Mr Niyazov 's Soviet - style autocracy intact .
And it seems that is exactly what many people want .
Brainwashing ?
Political freedom may be scarce in Turkmenistan , but it costs less than $ 1 to fill a car tank with petrol .
Electricity , gas , water and even public transport are , in effect , free .
Niyazov did not use all of his country 's riches to build golden statues for himself , he also subsidised its economy .
And for many , that is much more tangible than political freedom , much more real than a foreign concept of democracy .
" Perhaps an autocracy that works is better than democracy that doesn't , " a Turkmen journalist said as we drove through the wide tree - lined avenues of Ashgabat .
But what about all the brainwashing ?
What about having to learn the Rukhnama - Niyazov 's book , which became the basis of the country 's education system ?
I asked Irina , a young student who has lived in the United States and who , unlike most people in Turkmenistan , knows what life is like outside the country .
" So what ? "
Irina shrugged , " Rukhnama is just part of history . "
In the Soviet days , she added , her parents had to study plenty more books by Lenin and Marx .
Irina and her friends disagree with the bad press that Turkmenistan has been getting in the West .
" It really upsets me , and I think it 's unfair because people who write all these things do n't live here .
" We know better what life is like , and what opportunities we have , and I do n't think my country deserves the kind of criticism it gets , " Irina said .

The door swings open before I have a chance to knock , and I get my first glimpse of the man known to thousands only as Ted .
At 6 ' 5 " in socks , he is squeezed into the door frame of his midtown Manhattan loft .
He 's got a shaved head , thick - rimmed black Prada glasses , and a small bag of Chips Ahoy !
cookies .
" Come in , " he says , grinning toothily .
It has taken four weeks to arrange this meeting .
Four weeks during which I spoke with Ted , the pseudonymous founder of TheFunded.com , nearly every day .
He refused to give me his phone number , calling me — almost always late at night — whenever he decided it was time to talk .
If I needed to reach him , I sent a note to his Gmail account .
He usually called back from a blocked number within an hour or two .
Until now he had rebuffed my suggestions of a face - to - face meeting .
First he said he was too busy overseeing the sale of his technology company .
Then an unexpected family crisis took all his time and energy .
Finally , just as I began to think Ted was avoiding me , I received another email : " 4:40 pm , OK ? "
And about an hour later , here I am , staring at the most mysterious Web celebrity since Fake Steve Jobs .
I get the sense that Ted enjoys this cloak - and - dagger routine .
After all , he 's been playing it since the beginning of the year , when he launched TheFunded.com , a community site for startups to anonymously review and rank venture capital firms .
In effect , it has given entrepreneurs a peek into the secretive VC industry and a chance to dish about some of the unseemly behavior they 've witnessed there .
" We have seen distinctive pieces of our business plan end up in marketing materials of a competitor , " reads one testimony .
" The senior guy was arrogant , rude , and dismissive , " reads another .
" He had his feet up on the table the whole time he was telling us how bad our business is . "
Visitors to TheFunded can pore over tales of VCs who overwhelm a founder 's influence , who change deal terms at the last minute , and who find out what other VCs offered a company to weaken its bargaining position .
The Funded has also become something of a support group for its 3,150 members ; when one recent poster asked whether he should accept a deal that would give a VC the sole right to sell his company , he received 19 responses , including " AVOID " and " Run ! "
Ted says that he 's not out to punish venture capitalists .
He just wants to refocus them on what should be their goal : " backing savvy entrepreneurs to move the fundamental technologies of humanity forward . "
And some of The Funded 's readers say they get more out of the site than a mere chance to vent .
Stephen Bell , founder of a video - shopping site called ShangBy , says he used TheFunded to research VCs before meeting them .
TheFunded.com's Adeo Ressi .
Photo : Rainer Hosch ; grooming : Khela TysonNevertheless , neither Ted nor TheFunded is exactly beloved by the venture capital community , which is more accustomed to CEOs kissing its butt than kicking its ass .
" VCs are taken aback , " says Bill Burnham , a former managing partner at Mobius Venture Capital and now a hedge fund manager .
" The peasants have revolted against them . "
Mike Brown , a principal at Foundation Capital , says , " People are worried about it .
There is the sense that Big Brother is watching . "
As a result , according to one venture capitalist who refused to be named , most VCs look at Ted " with disgust . "
Or they would if they knew who he was .
Ted has refused to disclose his identity , even as it has become one of the tech industry 's most tantalizing secrets .
Until now , that is .
After nine months of anonymity , rumors have begun circling — in the pages of Inc. magazine , on the tech - rumor blog Valleywag — and Ted assumes he 'll be unmasked before long .
He wants to manage the unveiling , which is why he has invited Wired into his home .
Ted is not Kevin Rose of Digg or Nick Denton of Gawker Media or Jason Calacanis of Weblogs , Inc. , all of whom have been named as suspects .
He 's not Shawn Gold , a vice president at MySpace , although Gold is a good friend of Ted 's and officiated at his wedding .
Ted did n't found Netscape or Twitter , but he is active in the Valley , a serial entrepreneur who has launched and sold three companies .
Ted is Adeo Ressi .
If pushed , Ressi , 35 , will admit that he 's not exactly a household name .
It must pain him — self - promotion appears to be his default setting ( his bio has him " pioneering the early adoption of the World Wide Web , " " investing in the birth of private space exploration , " and " cultivating mass market adoption of casual games " ) .
Ressi always considered himself the type to change the world .
While other New York City kids went to summer camp , Ressi begged his parents to send him to Arcosanti , an experimental city being built in the Arizona desert .
( He spent four summers as the commune 's youngest working resident , which meant cleaning a lot of sewage pipes . )
As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania , he started the Social Revolutionary Club , and today he sits on the board of the X Prize Foundation .
Ressi is of the utopian mindset that believes in the wisdom of crowds and the democratizing nature of the Internet to spark change .
In other words , he 's the perfect candidate to lead an entrepreneurial uprising .
Ressi was first radicalized around the time he was seeking a second round of funding for Game Trust , an online gaming platform he founded in 2002 .
Ressi considered himself a seasoned entrepreneur :
He had already launched and sold two successful companies .
In 1994 , he created an online city guide called Total New York , which was later purchased for an undisclosed amount and eventually redubbed AOL Digital City .
And in 2000 , he sold methodfive , a Web development firm , to Xceed for $ 88 million .
He had closed a first round of funding for Game Trust during the postbubble downturn in 2003 , scoring investments from Intel Capital and Silicon Alley Venture Partners .
And at first , his Series B round seemed to be proceeding smoothly , with a promise of $ 10 million from SoftBank Capital .
Then , Ressi says , in February 2005 , on the day the deal was supposed to be finalized , his contact at SoftBank called him to say they were pulling out , citing concerns with Game Trust 's management , model , and market .
Because Ressi had signed a standard no - shop provision while negotiating with the fund , his company was left with dwindling cash and no other financing options .
( A SoftBank spokesperson confirmed that they had a term sheet but declined to provide details , citing a confidentiality agreement . )
Game
Trust was forced to take another loan from its investors .
By fall it had closed a $ 9 million round that included $ 3 million from a smaller firm called TWJ Capital , but that relationship soured in late summer 2006 , after an unprofitable development project caused Game Trust to miss its quarterly revenue targets .
In response , the board voted off one of Game Trust 's directors , Elon Musk — the PayPal cofounder who was once Ressi 's housemate at the University of Pennsylvania — and replaced him with the son of TWJ founder Thomas Jones .
With narrow control of the board , Ressi says , Jones launched a bid to take over the company and sack the management team .
( Jones declined to comment , citing confidentiality obligations . )
These efforts by Jones would eventually fail , but at the time , Ressi expected the worst .
Shut out from his firm , waiting to get fired , he got mad .
Like many entrepreneurs , he had chosen his investors based on reputation and hearsay .
Now , instead of concentrating on building his business , Ressi was spending most of his time battling those funders .
" You 've got to hang on for life to maintain control , and all the while VCs are beating you with a stick , " Ressi says .
" And then they dispose of you like garbage . "
( He 's not wrong about being disposable ; nearly two - thirds of venture - backed CEOs are replaced .
VCs say it 's done to maximize value and that entrepreneurs are naive not to expect it . )
So , over the 2006 Christmas holiday , Ressi built TheFunded.com .
The site was initially intended as a personal project to keep track of his experiences with VCs and for his CEO friends to add their own feedback , in case Ressi needed to raise money again .
" I did n't want to make the same mistake twice , " he says .
He unveiled the site during a New Year 's Eve celebration in Puerto Rico , showing it to a close circle of confidants .
The response , he says , was overwhelming : " Everyone seemed to have their own difficult trials in dealing with venture capitalists , and many of the stories were worse than my own . "
Michael Diamant , who runs a baby - products company called Skip Hop , recounted the time he flew from New York to Palo Alto , only to be stood up .
Another —
Ressi wo n't divulge his name — spoke of investors who unceremoniously stripped him of his CEO post .
Scott Heiferman , cofounder of Meetup , immediately saw value in TheFunded .
" It 's hard to deal in the world of VCs , " he says .
" We know they are in touch with each other .
I 'm sure they trade notes on entrepreneurs . "
Ressi wanted to give entrepreneurs the same power .
In all , Ressi signed up a dozen or so of his friends , including Calacanis and Gold , to serve as original members of the site , seeding it with its first wave of opinions and rankings .
The group , wary of retribution from funders , posted anonymously and pledged never to identify one another .
They even voted on Ressi 's pseudonym , the first name of a nemesis .
( " They did it to spite me , " Ressi chuckles . )
The Funded started as an invitation - only site , but before long Ressi decided that CEOs outside of his network should be able to apply for access .
To protect the integrity of the site 's information , he instituted a four - point vetting system : Successful applicants needed to file their names and titles , email addresses at their company domains , bios on their sites , and a persuasive reason for joining TheFunded .
Anyone could visit , but only members could rate or review firms or have access to more - detailed posts flagged as private .
For the first couple of weeks , TheFunded was the online equivalent of an unmarked bar — no one but the truly connected knew it even existed — and membership grew to about 50 .
But then , on March 14 , someone leaked its existence to TechCrunch , the widely read Silicon Valley blog .
By the time Ressi awoke and flipped on his BlackBerry , he had already received scores of new applications .
Throughout the day , they kept pouring in , about 10 a minute , he says .
Ressi rejected most of them , and at the end of March membership was at about 100 .
But by May , it had grown to 1,000 .
Meanwhile , TheFunded 's reputation had spread throughout the VC industry .
Investors in venture funds — endowments , pension funds , wealth - management institutions — wanted to tap into the collective wisdom of TheFunded 's members .
And consultants , advisers , and attorneys who worked with entrepreneurs also wanted access .
( Ressi would later offer paid subscriptions at $ 250 per year for applicants who did n't meet his criteria but wanted access to all the site 's features .
About 150 have subscribed .
" I can't believe people signed up for it , " he marvels . )
Entrepreneurs and investors were n't the only ones flocking to the site ; so were VCs , and they were n't happy with what they saw .
" You can go on and say something horrible , and there 's no accountability , " says Pascal Levensohn , a managing partner at Levensohn Venture Partners .
Josh Kopelman , a partner at First Round Capital , says that many of the people who post on TheFunded may have an ax to grind .
" We have looked at 2,000 businesses and said no to 1,980 of them .
It 's like having a Zagat guide where 90 percent of the people who are writing reviews can't get a restaurant reservation . "
( Ironically , both Kopelman and Levensohn have garnered mostly positive comments on the site . )
Ressi retorts that more than 80 percent of TheFunded 's members have received venture capital , are starting their second or third venture - backed company , and have had at least one liquidity event .
He also points out that members are asked , though not required , to disclose their past and present relationships with the funds they review on the site .
Venture capitalists were n't keeping their gripes to themselves ; they were grousing on blogs and even sending angry notes to Ted .
To help assuage some of the criticism and prevent the site from erupting into a nonstop flamefest , Ressi invited VCs to post " certified " profiles in which they could tell entrepreneurs about their funds in their own words .
More than 200 venture firms , including Benchmark Capital , Sequoia Capital , and Hummer Winblad Venture Partners , have done so .
But many VCs were n't satisfied and began to ask the companies they 'd funded — and any entrepreneurs they 'd met — to submit reviews , in attempts to boost their profiles .
" We 're trying to build up a collection of rankings that ( we hope ! ) will signal to entrepreneurs the quality of our firm and our people , " one VC said to an entrepreneur in an email obtained by Wired .
Ressi's own investors even called him and asked him to post some reviews to the site ; of course , they did n't realize that he was the angry founder who had started it in the first place .
By May , the gaming had gotten out of hand , and Ressi realized he had to launch , as he puts it , a " full - on war . "
He locked down the site so a firm could receive only one new comment every 48 hours , and he rejected applications from anyone he suspected of being a shill .
The VCs went bonkers over the restrictions .
Howard Hartenbaum , a partner at Draper Richards who was particularly offended by some of the posts about him ( for instance , that he was " really conceited " and " made me want to vomit " ) , says a VC friend suggested that they hire an attorney together to " make life miserable " for Ted .
" I have no clue who he is , but he wields more power than he realizes , " says Hartenbaum , who professes to have changed the way he delivers feedback to entrepreneurs as a result of what he 's read on Ressi 's site .
" He can negatively impact investors and can keep them from getting deals because he has a grudge . "
It may seem odd that venture capitalists should care what a gaggle of lowly entrepreneurs have to say about them .
After all , for the past couple of decades VCs have been the kingmakers of Silicon Valley , rendering judgment on an endless stream of CEOs who beg and scrape for their approval .
But in recent years , that dynamic has begun to shift .
" VCs used to have a lot more of the power , " says William Sahlman , an entrepreneurial management professor at Harvard Business School .
" They do n't have complete control anymore . "
For one thing , venture capitalists are not the only source for entrepreneurs seeking funding .
Angel investors , individuals who tend to take smaller stakes in early - stage companies , are growing more organized .
Fifteen years ago , they began forming organizations to pool revenue and exchange information on deals ; today there are more than 200 such groups .
Last year , angel investors and venture capitalists each invested about $ 26 billion in startup companies .
But since 2002 , the amount that angels have invested has grown three times as fast as the amount from VC firms , according to the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire .
( And angel investments do n't include " friends and family " contributions , an even more viable early - funding source . )
Meanwhile , " superangels " — startup godfathers like Ron Conway , Pierre Omidyar , and Peter Thiel — offer some of the same experience and insight as VCs but usually on friendlier terms .
Shawn Gold says Weblogs , of which he was president , got bankrolled with $ 300,000 from billionaire Mark Cuban .
" We did n't need VC money , " he says .
" It was profitable in four months and we sold it for $ 25 million in 16 months . "
Hedge funds — unregulated investment funds available only to the very wealthy — have also entered the startup arena .
Russell Tencer , CEO of Parker Boston , a company - and - financing matchmaking firm in New York , says that hedge funds are less meddlesome than VCs ; of the six hedge - fund deals he brokered last year , none of the investors requested board seats .
And hedge funds do n't impose the same bureaucracy as VCs .
When Seth Lippert and Sergio Fernández de Córdova wanted to raise upwards of $ 70 million for Fuel Outdoor , their national outdoor advertising company , they spoke with hundreds of investors before settling on a hedge fund .
" These guys move on a dime , " Fernández de Córdova says .
" We closed an acquisition of more than $ 6 million in five days .
They are a sophisticated group that gets it , and that gives us a competitive edge . "
Meanwhile , venture capitalists are finding themselves with more money to spend .
As institutional investors like pension funds have looked to ride the startup wave , they 've poured money into venture funds .
In 2006 , the average established fund raised $ 218 million , almost double the $ 113.5 million average raised in 2002 .
That 's a lot of scratch burning holes in VCs ' pockets , and they 've got to find ways to spend it — a task that is growing increasingly difficult .
Some venture funds usually wo n't invest less than $ 5 million in a young company , and they prefer to invest more than $ 10 million .
But thanks to overseas coders , on - demand services , and the falling cost of software and hardware , fewer startups need that much — or want to dilute their ownership by accepting such a large sum .
Former entrepreneur Josh Kopelman 's startup experience illustrates the trend :
In 1991 , he needed $ 5 million for his first company to launch its product ; in 1999 , he started another company with $ 2.5 million ; and in 2003 , he took just $ 750,000 for a third business .
( Today , as a VC , Kopelman specializes in small , early - stage investments . )
None of this is to say that the venture capital model is dead .
" Get real , " says digital media luminary Esther Dyson .
" It 's still the VCs that have the money , and they do n't forget that , and neither have the entrepreneurs . "
And John Taylor , vice president of research at the National Venture Capital Association , says VCs offer more than other investors : " They help with everything from hiring to developing products to getting them tested . "
But if anyone understands the laws of supply and demand , it 's VCs — and now fundable businesses , not capital , are in short supply and high demand .
That 's why many VCs have begun to refer to entrepreneurs as " customers . "
That 's why TheFunded , which has the power to destroy a firm 's reputation , is seen as such a threat .
And that 's why many firms have begun posting crow - eating mea culpas on the site .
" I am really disappointed and embarrassed you had such a crappy experience , " one VC wrote in response to a scathing review .
" Do me a favor and give me a call on my cell phone or shoot me an email and we 'll make sure you get some good feedback on your business and that you feel more positive ...
Give us a chance to make amends . "
To hear Ressi tell it , it 's too late for him to make his own amends .
We 're in his apartment , which has exploded into activity .
His wife has returned from the hospital , where her father is in critical condition .
His 20 - month - old daughter , Kali , named for the Indian goddess of destruction , is scampering around wearing his wife 's jewelry .
And his BlackBerry wo n't stop ringing .
Today the news leaked that he has agreed to sell Game Trust to RealNetworks .
Soon , he 'll no longer be a CEO .
And thanks to TheFunded , Ressi claims , he may never be one again .
He says he expects to be blackballed by the venture world .
" There will be a thousand and one requests from people wanting me to take down different features , " he says .
" There will be lawsuits and bribes .
It 's going to suck . "
In fact , Ressi 's woe - is - me routine may be a bit overdone .
When I spoke with David Stern , a partner at Clearstone Venture Partners , he said he did n't know Ted 's identity but considered him " a pretty savvy Web entrepreneur who would be an interesting talent to back in his next endeavor . "
Even Hartenbaum , the disgruntled VC at Draper Richards , says he has spoken to Ted — without knowing his identity — and found him to be " a pretty smart guy " ( although Hartenbaum also says that Ted " does n't listen well " ) .
Toward the end of my visit , Ressi tells me that he is moving in a few months ; he has scheduled a pack date and has already picked out a new preschool for Kali .
He 's been so cagey that I do n't expect an answer , but I ask him where he 's headed .
His eyes go big and bright , and I realize Ressi , the scourge of Sand Hill Road , has been gaming this all along .
" We 'll be in Palo Alto , " he says , smiling .

Software errors cost the U.S. economy $ 60 billion annually in rework , lost productivity and actual damages .
We all know software bugs can be annoying , but faulty software can also be expensive , embarrassing , destructive and deadly .
Following are 20 famous software “ disasters ” in chronological order :
1. Mariner Bugs Out ( 1962 )
Cost : $ 18.5 million
Disaster : The Mariner 1 rocket with a space probe headed for Venus diverted from its intended flight path shortly after launch .
Mission Control destroyed the rocket 293 seconds after liftoff .
Cause :
A programmer incorrectly transcribed a handwritten formula into computer code , missing a single superscript bar .
Without the smoothing function indicated by the bar , the software treated normal variations of velocity as if they were serious , causing faulty corrections that sent the rocket off course .
( more )
2. Hartford Coliseum Collapse ( 1978 )
Cost : $ 70 million , plus another $ 20 million damage to the local economy
Disaster : Just hours after thousands of fans had left the Hartford Coliseum , the steel - latticed roof collapsed under the weight of wet snow .
Cause :
The programmer of the CAD software used to design the coliseum incorrectly assumed the steel roof supports would only face pure compression .
But when one of the supports unexpectedly buckled from the snow , it set off a chain reaction that brought down the other roof sections like dominoes .

3. CIA Gives the Soviets Gas ( 1982 )
Cost : Millions of dollars , significant damage to Soviet economy
Disaster : Control software went haywire and produced intense pressure in the Trans - Siberian gas pipeline , resulting in the largest man-made non-nuclear explosion in Earth ’s history .
Cause : CIA operatives allegedly planted a bug in a Canadian computer system purchased by the Soviets to control their gas pipelines .
The purchase was part of a strategic Soviet plan to steal or covertly obtain sensitive U.S. technology .
When the CIA discovered the purchase , they sabotaged the software so that it would pass Soviet inspection but fail in operation .

4. World War III … Almost ( 1983 )
Cost : Nearly all of humanity
Disaster : The Soviet early warning system falsely indicated the United States had launched five ballistic missiles .
Fortunately the Soviet duty officer had a “ funny feeling in my gut ” and reasoned if the U.S. was really attacking they would launch more than five missiles , so he reported the apparent attack as a false alarm .
Cause : A bug in the Soviet software failed to filter out false missile detections caused by sunlight reflecting off cloud - tops . ( more )
5. Medical Machine Kills ( 1985 )
Cost :
Three people dead , three people critically injured
Disaster : Canada ’s Therac - 25 radiation therapy machine malfunctioned and delivered lethal radiation doses to patients .
Cause : Because of a subtle bug called a race condition , a technician could accidentally configure Therac - 25 so the electron beam would fire in high - power mode without the proper patient shielding .

has spent a staggering £ 1 m - to save newts .
The taxpayer - owned airport has paid out the money over the last five years to protect newts living around Runway 2 .
But even before the £ 172 m runway opened in February 2001 , more than £ 3 m was spent re-homing 4,500 great crested newts and more than 30,000 other amphibians .
Another £ 1/2 m has been spent since 2005 protecting newts , bats and other rare species across Greater Manchester and Cheshire .
The cash has been paid out to comply with European laws .
Cheshire spent £ 61,000 in just 10 months on great crested newts alone and Stockport paid out £ 20,000 creating a home for newts while building work was carried out on a school .
Other Greater Manchester councils said they had not had to pay for measures over the five - year period .
But the total bill for protecting newts and other protected species is likely to be much higher as these figures do not include the thousands spent by private developers across the region .
They face hefty fines if they fail to relocate the animals when their habitats are put at risk by planning applications .
The M.E.N. compiled the figures after Cheshire county council revealed its £ 60,000 bill to relocate four great crested newts to make way for developments at a Macclesfield school .
European law makes it an offence to deliberately capture , injure or kill a protected species or damage or destroy its breeding or resting place .
Cheshire councillor Barrie Hardern is appealing to Brussels to review the law .
He said : " I will be asking European ministers to consider a fairer option which would see areas where there is a higher population given the opportunity to invest in the environment and wildlife in another way . "
A Manchester Airport spokesman said : " We have a 15 year plan to maintain and protect all ecological species - especially protected great crested newts , bats and badgers . "
While record labels ' retreat from digital rights management software is designed to give consumers the ability to play songs on any device , music fans will likely be trapped in a DRM - filled world for years to come .
" In the big picture , we 're probably 10 years into a 20 - year evolutionary process here , from going to the store ( and ) buying a CD to downloading all music in the MP3 format on your computer , " said Christopher Allen , chief operating officer of Napster .
The music industry is in the fledgling stages of an anti-DRM experiment that until recently seemed unlikely .
With Apple 's iTunes Store dominating the booming market for digital music sales , the Big Four record labels – Sony BMG , Warner Music Group , Universal Music Group and EMI Music – are scrambling for fresh ways to peddle their wares , even as they face creative new competitors .
On Monday , for example , Sony BMG announced it will release a mishmash of 37 albums in the unrestricted MP3 format , confirming last week 's report that the label would ditch DRM .
Under Sony 's new plan , consumers would purchase a credit - card - like ticket from Best Buy , Target , Fred 's , Winn - Dixie or other outlets .
The cards will have a number that must be entered into the MusicPass site , where the full album can be downloaded .
" The MP3 files delivered through MusicPass play on computers , as well as on all MP3 players , including iPods , " said Thomas Hesse , a Sony BMG sales president .
" This makes them a simple , easy - to - use solution that will appeal to fans who already access their music on the internet , as well as to consumers who are just getting into the digital realm . "
Nearly two weeks ago , Warner Music Group , another of the Big Four music concerns , announced it would make its entire selection available on Amazon.com in the MP3 format .
That followed other DRM - removal announcements earlier in 2007 from Universal Music Group and EMI , which licensed its catalog to Apple 's iTunes Store to sell in the unrestricted MP3 format .
Still , more than 80 percent of the digital music market remains encoded with DRM , despite the announcements from the big labels .
That 's because of the highly popular iTunes Store , and Apple 's iPod and iPhone .
Those devices , with more than 100 million units sold , only play music protected by Apple 's proprietary FairPlay DRM technology , or music that is n't protected at all .
Apple , since 2003 , has sold more than 3 billion music downloads , capturing more than 80 percent of the market .
Apple chairman Steve Jobs has repeatedly balked at licensing FairPlay for use on competing download services or devices – meaning music companies had to choose between using iTunes or going DRM - free if they wanted the songs to play on the all - important iPods .
The industry stood by and allowed most of its music - download sales to come from Apple , but that is slowly changing .
Napster , the online music service that nearly a decade ago was synonymous with music piracy , announced Monday it was looking to strike unrestricted licensing arrangements with the Big Four .
Right now , the subscription - based service 's millions of downloads are not compatible with the iPod , which Warner chief Edgar Bronfman Jr. in September labeled the " default device " in the digital music scene .
" Talks are currently in progress with the labels , " said Napster 's Allen .
He said the company anticipates selling unprotected music from the Big Four sometime in the second quarter .
" The move to MP3s is certainly a step in clearing up some of the dysfunction , and Apple 's hermetically sealed proprietary system , " Allen said .
Apple , which encodes digital downloads with DRM as a licensing condition , declined comment on whether it would begin removing DRM .
The bulk of Apple 's songs for sale contain the FairPlay DRM coding .
Yet the removal of DRM dramatically expands the music industry 's marketing capabilities .
Sony BMG's new campaign would have been impossible had the 37 albums been encoded with DRM .
Digital rights management allows downloads to expire , or to be shared and played only a limited number of times or on certain devices .
" Physical products like this will be another way for Best Buy to deliver music and entertainment to our customers in a manner that suits their needs , whether it is an impulse purchase , gift or collectible , " said Jennifer Johnston Schaidler , a Best Buy vice president .
" Digital music does n't need to be restricted to online environments . "
Sony spokesman John McKay declined to say whether the company would demand that Apple remove its FairPlay technology from Sony 's digital downloads .
McKay also declined to say why just a few dozen albums – from big artists such as Alicia Keys , Bob Dylan , Celine Dion and Tony Bennett – were available in the unrestricted format , or when others would be made available .
Individual Sony BMG songs are not available , he said .
This chart compares the body mass index ( BMI ) of superheroes in Marvel comics with those of typical American women and men .
Researchers Karen Healey and Terry Johnson used physical stats from Marvel 's Web site to show that the vast majority of female superheroes are underweight , though the males are mostly normal .
Just to remind you , in the BMI scale , below 18.5 is underweight , 18.5 - 24.9 is normal , and over 25 is overweight .
Healey 's analysis of what this means is hilarious and thought - provoking .
Healey writes :
The BMI range of Marvel women is much less varied than that of all other groups and tends to the low end of the " normal " BMI range .
This result is surprising , considering that many of the women sampled are martial artists or extremely capable physically and should , if anything , have a BMI that indicates a higher body fat level than is actually present .
The BMI range of Marvel men is more varied and tends to just over the upper limit of the " normal " BMI range .
However , it is still less varied than that of the " real world " male and female groups .
We stress that given the physical and biological vagaries of the Marvel Universe and the relatively small sample sizes involved , these results are not conclusive .
Data comparing male and female athletes from both world might provide more accurate comparative results , and we suggest this as a point for further research .
However , advance data indicates that Marvel women are portrayed as having a disturbingly low BMI compared to the healthy BMI range of their male counterparts .
Furthermore , the range of body types expressed by Marvel women is surprisingly small .
The distribution of BMIs in Figure 1 is by far the sharpest , with little variation from the mean compared to Marvel men , and far less variation than we see in actual men and women .
This is true to a lesser extent for males in the Marvel universe as well .
The Marvel male is predisposed to be on the heavy side of healthy , which can be explained by the increased muscle mass of intense physical acitvity .
The average Marvel female is approaching underweight despite a presumably active lifestyle .
This may corroborate sociological and literary observations that in the Marvel Universe , women must fulfil criteria for being attractive by Western standards before fulfilling the criteria of biological realism .

The abortion drug RU486 is illegal to sell without prescription
Abortion has been legal in Britain for 40 years - under certain conditions a woman can terminate a pregnancy up to 24 weeks .
But the BBC has discovered pills for getting rid of unwanted pregnancies are readily available on the black market .
The BBC Radio 5 Live Report followed up on internet chat room messages left by women asking for abortion advice .
" Special herbs "
One online discussion centred on special Chinese herbs being sold in East London .
A BBC undercover reporter posing as an illegal immigrant visited several Chinese herbal shops , claiming she was six weeks ' pregnant .
The third shop she went into , the Shanghai Herbal and Acupuncture Centre on Kingsland Road in east London , offered to help .
It was clear from the start that the staff - Dr Shen and Dr Wang - knew what they were doing was wrong .
" You come in this shop , you are lucky .
Do you understand .
My boss does't like me to do this treatment , my boss thinks it is a risk .
So my boss does n't know .
You understand ? " the reporter was told .
The staff sold her a herbal remedy for £ 40 - a mixture to drink three times a day to start a miscarriage .
Risky
A Manchester doctor told the programme that his team regularly came across patients with extensive bleeding after taking herbs .
The Chinese herbalists also advised the undercover reporter to buy another " special tablet " in case the herbs did n't work .
" If you see the bleeding , come out , that 's fine , some people do n't .
I need to call another company , from China , [ they will ] deliver it to here , you understand ? "
Our reporter paid £ 100 for this pill which turned out to be the abortion drug RU486 - illegal to sell without prescription .
Community health workers told us the issue of illegal abortion affects many women - from young British teenagers who do not trust their doctor to people who are here illegally and are frightened of being found out .
Another reason women seek out illegal terminations is cost .
Backstreet
Abortion is not free on the NHS for every woman .
If a woman 's home country does not have a reciprocal NHS agreement , or she is here illegally - then she faces bill of between £ 500 and £ 1,500 .
In addition to herbs , the 5 Live Report found other ways of getting hold of abortion drugs , for instance misoprostol ( Cytotec ) .
Our reporter met a Polish man called Robert in a West London café .
She told him she was eight weeks pregnant and wanted an abortion .
As Robert handed over the pills he told her how he got them .
" They come either from Fiji islands or Turkey .
The ones I have now are from Turkey , they are sent to Poland and then I have a courier who brings them from Poland to here " .
He told our undercover reporter that this was not just a one - off transaction , boasting that he had smuggled the drug in many times before .
One side effect of taking abortion drugs is extensive bleeding , which if unsupervised can be dangerous .
But Robert was keen to point out that the drugs would be untraceable .
" If something happened and you had to go to hospital , the doctor will think that everything happened naturally . "
The BBC reporter paid £ 30 for 14 tablets .
This man had acted entirely illegally - not only had he peddled prescription drugs , he had broken the abortion law by aiding an abortion without a licence .
However , Robert hung up the phone when the Radio 5 Live called him to put to him the accusation .
Our investigation suggests illegal abortion activity may be widespread .
A health worker in east London health worker told us she was routinely asked to get abortion drugs without prescription .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said : " We have no evidence that illegal abortions are being performed . "

Cops use indymedia , myspace , and blogs as a source of information to investigate you .
Yes .
They do .
Do they follow links and take note of connections ?
Yes , of course .
Myspace , blogs , and online networks are like a dream for police investigators .
Where they used to have to go out and interview people , check records , walk the street , now they merely have to go online .
Investigation from the convenience of their offices .
I took part in a demonstration and was arrested .
Afterward , the police contacted my employer to suggest that they check up on me .
I got a copy of the police report yesterday and was surprised to find that the police had gone beyond just the basic facts of my arrest .
They had tracked down the website for my band , followed a link to our myspace page , and from there tracked down my personal myspace page .
In my profile I had some pretty cheeky anti-authoritarian hyperbole and that was quoted in the report .
" Subject says in his myspace profile that he is ' looking for someone to turn over and burn police cars with , ' " a dumb comment that had been part of my online profile for many years .
There was a print out of my entire myspace profile , band website , etc .
All of this info had been passed on to my employer .
Why this should surprise me , I 'm not sure .
It is something I should totally be aware of by now .
And while I was n't arrested while burning police cars , nor was there any suspicion along those lines , my employer sure takes such things seriously , especially coupled with a heads - up from the local police .
The implication and insinuation that someone is involved in something gnarlier than they are can be easily made .
Just because you are non-violent ( and even law - abiding ) does n't mean you can't be charged with something violent .
Imagine what might be said about your myspace profile : " Subject lists as their myspace friends ' Support ALF , ' the Animal Liberation Front , a group whose members have been convicted of arson and long watched by the FBI as a serious potential terrorist threat . "
Bullshit and circumstantial connections notwithstanding , the implication is there for a prosecutor to use .
This goes beyond myspace and Indymedia to other online communities , facebook , blogs , tribe.net , friendster , etc .
Cops look at these public sites and use the information they find .
And while I do n't imagine that local law enforcement has the time or resources to randomly surf online sites in order to make connections , they do investigate people who 've come to their attention .
Local cops have told me that they read Indymedia daily .
And it is certainly not beyond the means of the feds to map out networks of connections and involvement .
Online profiles and blogs have definitely been used against people in criminal cases .
So not to make anyone paranoid , but just a word to be cautious and careful .
In general , internet security is non-existent .
And if you are truly and deeply concerned about it , you should not be using the internet at all .
But if you do , some simple principles might keep you safer ( or at least make it harder for law enforcement to keep tabs on us ) :
NEVER discuss illegal things online .
Be careful about cheeky hyperbolic braggadocio ( lesson learned ! )
Be aware how much one can gather about your connections to others
Do n't provide identifying information that makes it easy to make connections ( far from fool proof )
Limit who has access to your personal info if possible
There are probably a lot of great resources for keeping yourself and others safer .
Goggle for " security culture " and you 'll find stuff .
Here 's a good one I found : CrimethInc Primer on Security Culutre
A large - scale , coordinated campaign to steer users toward malware - spewing Web sites from Google search results is under way , security researchers said Tuesday .
Users searching Google with any of hundreds of legitimate phrases -- from the technical " how to cisco router vpn dial in " to the heart - tugging " how to teach a dog to play fetch " -- will see links near the top of the results listings that lead directly to malicious sites hosting a mountain of malware .
" This is huge , " said Alex Eckelberry , Sunbelt Software 's CEO .
" So far we 've found 27 different domains , each with up to 1,499 [ malicious ] pages .
That 's 40,000 possible pages . "
Those pages have had their Google ranking boosted by crooked tactics that include " comment spam " and " blog spam , " where bots inundate the comment areas of sites with links or mass large numbers of them as bogus blog posts .
Attackers may be using bots to plug links into any Web form that requests a URL , added Sunbelt malware researcher Adam Thomas .
There 's no evidence that the criminals bought Google search keywords , however , nor that they 've compromised legitimate sites .
Instead , they 've gamed Google 's ranking system and registered their own sites .
" They get themselves on to Google , then redirect people to their malware pages , " said Eckelberry .
Most users would n't suspect anything 's amiss with the rogue results , although the ultra - wary might be suspicious because many of the malicious URLs are just a jumble of characters , with China 's .cn top - level domain at their ends .
Once shunted to a malware - hosting site , the user might face a fake codec installation dialog .
If the user does n't bite , the page 's IFRAME will get him , said Thomas .
" This is what 's doing the most damage , " he said .
" It 's loaded with every piece of malware you can think of , including fake toolbars , rogue software and scareware . "
One site that Thomas encountered tried to install more than 25 separate pieces of malware , including numerous Trojan horses , a spam bot , a full - blown rootkit , and a pair of password stealers .
All the malicious code pitched at users is well - known to security vendors , and can only exploit PCs that are n't up - to - date on their patches .
" I ran into one , and it hosed my VM [ virtual machine ] , " said Eckelberry .
" Completely hosed it . "
While Eckelberry called the scam " impressive " in scope , Thomas echoed his boss in describing the attack 's magnitude .
" It 's like they 've colored any possible search term you can think of , " said Thomas .
" There are tens of thousands of [ malicious ] pages out there . "
Sunbelt 's company blog sports screen shots of several Google search results lists , with malware - infecting sites identified , as well as images of the bogus codec installation dialogs and the code of one of the malicious IFRAMEs .
This story , " Search Google , Click to Massive Malware Attacks ? " was originally published by Computerworld .
Why is this important ?
Well , some economists think that the economy is already in a recession .
Earlier this month , the Merrill Lynch economist David A. Rosenberg said that recent employment data suggested the economy might have slipped into a recession at the end of last year .
If it did , that could turn out to be reasonably good news for the equity markets now .
Keep in mind that in three of the last four recessions , stocks did n’t simply hold steady  they actually gained ground .
In the recession from July 1990 to March 1991 , for instance , the S.& P. 500 rose 2.5 percent , despite a severe sell - off in the summer of 1990 .
And in the recession from January to July of 1980 , stocks climbed nearly 6 percent .
There is something else to consider .
If the economy is already in recession , the Fed will probably have more impetus to cut short - term interest rates to fuel economic activity .
And as Nick Raich , director of equity research at the National City Private Client Group in Cleveland , said , “ if the Fed is going to get aggressive from here , it could give a boost to stocks later in the year . ”
Aggressive rate cuts could also shorten the duration or severity of a slowdown .
In most cases , stocks tend to rebound as the economy emerges from a recession .
The S.& P. study found that after 10 of the last 11 recessions , stocks soared in the ensuing six months .
On average , the S.& P. index gained 12.1 percent .
If you measure the market ’s performance from recession lows , rebounds are even more compelling .
Ned Davis Research looked at the last 10 recessions and found that stocks rose 24 percent , on average , in the six months after hitting a recession low .
That is why Tim Hayes , chief investment strategist at Ned Davis , said that while a recession could continue to pressure the stock market , “ it could also lead to a great buying opportunity . ”
Of course , there are no guarantees that the market will hit bottom in the middle of this slowdown .
For instance , after the last recession ended in November 2001 , stocks fell 18 percent over the next 12 months .
Still , there are reasons to believe that this will not be a repeat of the bear market of 2000 - 2 .
For starters , Mr. Stovall said , “ valuations in the market lead me to believe that this market decline will end up being either a correction or a very light bear market . ”
Although the price - to - earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500 approached 40 in the final stages of the 2001 recession , the ratio today is only around half of that , indicating that stocks are n’t nearly as pricey .
Moreover , Mr. Raich noted that while profits were likely to take a hit in an actual recession , the weakness in earnings in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 would make for relatively favorable comparisons in the second half of 2008 .
“ So there are some bright spots for the market , ” he said .
“ They ’re just being overshadowed right now by all this recession talk . ”
Harriet Harman wants to make it illegal to buy sex .
Call me an autistic economist , but I 'm with Rachel and Not Saussure on this - not only should buying sex not be illegal , but prostitution should be much less restricted than it currently is .
The first rule of economics is that trade benefits both parties - that 's why people do it .
So , why is the trade in sex different ?
I do n't find the arguments persuasive .
1 . " Prostitutes are forced into the business by their poverty , drug addiction or by gangsters who control the trade in illegal immigrants . "
There 's much truth in this .
But this is not an argument for criminalizing prostitution .
It 's an argument for giving women more options .
The solutions instead are : a citizen 's basic income ; cheaper drugs - through legalizing that trade too ; help for addicts ; or freer immigration .
In the absence of sensible policies to help desperate women , prostitution is their least bad option .
Why deprive them of the chance to make the most of it ?
2. " Prostitution exploits women . "
It does , insofar as it takes advantage of desperate people .
But so do many other capitalist acts between consenting adults .
Ordinary employers exploit people 's need to earn a living .
The difference between my renting my brain to my employer and a prostitute renting her body is only a matter of degree .
3 . " The only thing that separates having sex with a prostitute from rape is a cash transaction . "
Yes , this clown really said this .
But this is just absurd .
The only thing that separates shopping from theft is a cash transaction .
4 . " Prostitution embodies a view of women which is intrinsically brutalising , dehumanising and predatory .
That is why the violence to which it gives rise is routine .
That is why it is so appalling that anyone should be arguing that it should be regularised and thus condoned . "
( Mel P )
It 's probably true that the men who visit prostitutes are disproportionately likely to regard them as mere objects , and thus disproportionately likely to assault them .
But criminalizing prostitution exacerbates this problem in three ways .
It deters more law - abiding , moral , men from visting prostitutes , thus exposing the latter to more dangerous men .
It stigmatizes prostitutes , thus helping to legitimize violence towards them in the perverted eyes of their attackers .
And it deters prostitutes from reporting their attackers to the police .
5 . " Prostitution devalues the true and special meaning of sex . "
I do n't get this .
Lots of things are very special and valuable : music , art and intellectual endeavour .
But we see no problem in paying musicians , artists and intellectuals .
So , I suspect hostility to prostitution owes more to mere taste - what Alvin Roth calls repugnance ( pdf ) - than to a rational assessment of the costs and benefits of the business .
On the contrary , I think moving would be a pain .
Could you imagine trying to remember how it goes back together 4 - 5 years later ?
Think of the arguments .
" You 're wrong .
It 's the 5 - tier stand , broken into 5 pieces and THEN the stool . "
" No , YOU'RE wrong .
The stand goes after you 've packed the desk and added the coffee table on top of THAT . "
You 'd end up moving the individual pieces just to keep peace in the household .
Damn clever idea though , eh ?

Dr. Tegmark maintains that we are part of a mathematical structure , albeit one gorgeously more complicated than a hexagon , a multiplication table or even the multidimensional symmetries that describe modern particle physics .
Other mathematical structures , he predicts , exist as their own universes in a sort of cosmic Pythagorean democracy , although not all of them would necessarily prove to be as rich as our own .
“ Everything in our world is purely mathematical  including you , ” he wrote in New Scientist .
This would explain why math works so well in describing the cosmos .
It also suggests an answer to the question that Stephen Hawking , the English cosmologist , asked in his book , “ A Brief History of Time ” : “ What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe ? ”
Mathematics itself is on fire .

Not every physicist pledges allegiance to Plato .
Pressed , these scientists will describe the laws more pragmatically as a kind of shorthand for nature ’s regularity .
Sean Carroll , a cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology , put it this way : “ A law of physics is a pattern that nature obeys without exception . ”
Plato and the whole idea of an independent reality , moreover , took a shot to the mouth in the 1920s with the advent of quantum mechanics .
According to that weird theory , which , among other things , explains why our computers turn on every morning , there is an irreducible randomness at the microscopic heart of reality that leaves an elementary particle , an electron , say , in a sort of fog of being everywhere or anywhere , or being a wave or a particle , until some measurement fixes it in place .
In that case , according to the standard interpretation of the subject , physics is not about the world at all , but about only the outcomes of experiments , of our clumsy interactions with that world .
But 75 years later , those are still fighting words .
Einstein grumbled about God not playing dice .
Steven Weinstein , a philosopher of science at the University of Waterloo , in Ontario , termed the phrase “ law of nature ” as “ a kind of honorific ” bestowed on principles that seem suitably general , useful and deep .
How general and deep the laws really are , he said , is partly up to nature and partly up to us , since we are the ones who have to use them .
More thoughts on Eric Turkheimer 's research :
The more I think about it , the more convinced I am Turkheimer 's work is one of the keys to unraveling the Race - IQ debate .
His argument goes something like this :
Right now , there are two conflicting pieces of evidence , each of which is seized upon by each side in the debate .
On the one hand , there are twin studies .
You look at twins , raised in very different adoptive families , and you find that their IQs are very similar .
That suggests IQ is largely heritable , and that environment plays only a modest role .
On the other hand , there are studies showing that if a child of a very poor family , adopted at birth into a wealthy family , will have a much higher IQ than his or her siblings , or his or her parents , who remain in poverty .
This is , obviously , not a trivial disagreement .
Someone like Charles Murray , who takes the former position , uses it as explanation for why he think social programs -- like Head Start - - are a waste of time and money .
It is also why he thinks that the gap that presently exists between white and black average IQ scores will likely persist , regardless of what kind of steps we take as a society .
Liberals , meanwhile , use the latter evidence to justify the idea of an aggressive social policy .
So who 's right ?
Turkkeimer would say , both sides are .
He used a very large data set -- the National Collaborative Perinatal Project -- and found that the relationship between socio-economic status and IQ was non-linear .
Children moving from poverty to the middle class see their IQ 's jump : IQ at that end of the socio- economic scale is highly sensitive to environmental improvements .
But the kinds of twins studies usually relied upon by IQ fundamentalists and that yield such high genetic effects , are much more likely to involve comparisons among middle and upper middle class environments -- and that end of the scale , Turkheimer 's data suggests , environment does n't play a big role .
In other words , the lawyer who plays Mozart in the crib for his daughter , in order to raise her IQ , is wasting his time .
But dramatically increasing the educational resources available to inner city kids makes a lot of sense .
This , I think , helps to clarify a lot of what drives so many of us crazy about Charles Murray and his ilk .
We 're not disputing the importance of IQ .
And we 're not disputing that genes play a huge role in determining IQ .
We 're just saying that it 's hopelessly naive to assume that the same rules apply to suburban , middle - class whites as apply to , say , urban , inner-city black families .
MIT researchers have uncovered a critical difference between flu viruses that infect birds and humans , a discovery that could help scientists monitor the evolution of avian flu strains and aid in the development of vaccines against a deadly flu pandemic .
The researchers found that a virus 's ability to infect humans depends on whether it can bind to one specific shape of receptor on the surface of human respiratory cells .
" Now that we know what to look for , this could help us not only monitor the bird flu virus , but it can aid in the development of potentially improved therapeutic interventions for both avian and seasonal flu , " said Ram Sasisekharan , MIT Underwood Prescott Professor of Biological Engineering and Health Sciences and Technology , and the senior author of a paper on the work that appears in the Jan. 6 issue of Nature Biotechnology .
Flu viruses come in many strains , and not all of them can infect humans .
Strains known as H1 or H3 have " jumped " from birds to humans and hence are tailored to attack cells of the human upper respiratory tract .
H5 strains are usually confined to birds , but when they do infect humans they can have very high fatality rates .
In the past decade , isolated outbreaks of avian flu ( H5N1 ) in humans have raised concerns that a deadly pandemic could arise if the avian flu evolves to a form that can easily infect humans and pass from person to person .
Some scientists believe such an outbreak could rival the 1918 " Spanish flu " that killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide .
Scientists already knew that whether an influenza virus infects humans depends on whether its hemagglutinin , a protein found on the virus surface , can bind to sugar ( or glycan ) receptors in the respiratory tract .
Human respiratory cells have glycan receptors classified as alpha 2 - 6 ; avian respiratory cells ' glycan receptors are known as alpha 2 - 3 .
This classification is based on how the sugars are linked together when they are displayed on cells .
Until now , scientists had believed that a genetic switch that allows the virus to bind to alpha 2 - 6 receptors instead of alpha 2 - 3 receptors is responsible for avian viruses ' ability to jump to humans .
The MIT study shows that that view does not adequately explain how viruses evolve to infect humans .
The new work reveals that , more specifically , it is the ability of a flu virus to bind to a certain shape , or topology , of specific alpha 2 - 6 glycan receptor that determines whether it will infect humans .
Alpha 2 - 6 glycan receptors come in two shapes -- one that resembles an umbrella , and another that resembles a cone .
The MIT team found that to infect humans , flu viruses must bind to the umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptor .
Thus , Sasisekharan and his team have redefined the host receptor for influenza and the criteria for how H5N1 can jump to humans .
They did so by showing that the shape of the sugars -- and not the type of linkage -- is the key determinant for human adaptation of these deadly viruses .
This new interpretation explains inconsistencies that plagued the previous model , according to Sasisekharan .
For example , some flu strains that can bind to alpha 2 - 6 receptors do not infect humans very well .
It turns out that those viruses bind to cone - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors , which are present in the human respiratory tract but in much smaller numbers than umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors .
This new paradigm should help researchers develop a better way to track the evolution of avian flu leading to human adaptation , Sasisekharan said .
Now , they know to look for avian viruses that have evolved the ability to bind to umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors .
That knowledge could help them create vaccines tailored to combat a potential pandemic .
Similarly , these findings will help in the development of more effective strategies for seasonal flu , which still is a leading cause of death .
" Subtle changes in influenza viruses over time can dramatically influence the likelihood that these viruses will be able to infect human populations , and this is a huge concern , " said Jeremy Berg , director of the National Institute for General Medical Sciences , which funded the research .
" This work enables researchers to look at flu viruses in an entirely new way .
Dr. Sasisekharan 's team achieved this through a multifaceted approach that combines laboratory experiments with the ' mining ' of NIH - supported databases , leading to new insights into how the flu virus can adapt to a human host . "

Getting fired is humiliating and frustrating .
It ’s a blow to
your ego and self - worth , not to mention bad news for the future of your
career .
But does a termination forever banish you to the fringes of the working world ?
Using it to Your Advantage
Being fired is n’t all bad , experts say , and it does n’t have to disqualify you from future jobs–so long as you approach the topic with savvy .
Negotiating coach Jim Camp says it ’s critical to put it on the table immediately , and explain why you were fired and how much you learned from the experience , vowing never to repeat the mistakes that led to your termination .
This way , he says , you make the interviewer comfortable , and he or she can decide whether to continue .
Do You Know What You 're Worth ?
GET A FREE PAY REPORT
I want to be up front and I want to control what I can manage , and that ’s myself .
I want to be sure I give myself every opportunity for a vision of effectiveness for the interview , every opportunity for the interviewer to perceive me as effective .
The effective person always deals with the real problem .
Ignoring , avoiding or glossing over a termination is a big mistake , Camp explains , because it paints you in a negative light .
When it comes to your resume , it ’s not necessary to note a termination there ; just describe the length and nature of your work as you would for any other position , Camp says .
If the interviewer is skeptical after you ’ve explained , all is n’t lost .
Camp suggests a strategy he calls the negative " strip line " :
It ’s used to deal with a negative mindset .
For example , the interviewer says , " Why would we hire you after you were fired ? "
If I take the positive step and say I ’m a very good employee , I ’m better than you might realize , I ’ve done all these wonderful things and I ’m really a good person , then they say , " We just do n’t hire fired people . "
What happens is , in that situation , they end up pushing back harder because you are positive–and they ’re going more negative .
They ’re getting madder at you for pushing back .
The strip line would sound something like this : " At first glance , I probably would n’t hire me either .
Hiring someone that ’s been terminated does n’t appear on the surface to make much sense .
But I ’ve learned so much in my experiences and how I handle certain situations ; even though I ’ve been terminated , I ’ve grown a great deal and I think I can be a real asset . "
So instead of an argument , I ’m working to create vision for the interviewer , I ’m effective .
I ’ve created a vision of a person who ’s learning .
Camp ’s strategy is a smart one .
He ’s vying to put you in a position of power , one where you learn to work ostensibly bad things into good .
You ca n’t control what potential employers do or think when they realize you have a termination in your work history .
But you can control how you think about it and ultimately , what you do with it .
The Best and Brightest Get Fired , Too
According to the book " We Got Fired ! … And It ’s the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Us " by Harvey Mackay , a writer , speaker and entrepreneur , a host of rich - and - famous people were fired at some point in their careers .
For example :
Katie Couric was " fired " from doing on - air work by CNN after the network ’s president said he never wanted to see her face on a TV screen again .
Joanne Kathleen Rowling , aka J.K. Rowling , was fired from some secretarial jobs because she was found writing creative stories on her computer .
She used her severance to write Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone while her daughter took naps .
When she ran out of money , she received a grant to finish the book .
And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fired from Salomon Brothers , an investment firm–albeit with a $ 10 million goodbye - gift .
By Andrew Gumbel , The Independent UK
The United States military announced yesterday that it was bringing death penalty charges against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and five other men suspected of orchestrating the September 11 attacks , and intended to try them under the Bush administration ’s much - criticised military tribunal system , which is subject only to partial oversight by the civilian appeals system .
The decision to use Mohammed and the others as guinea - pigs in a constitutionally dubious legal proceeding is likely to trigger a firestorm of anti-American sentiment in the Islamic world and spark a fractious domestic debate in an already highly charged presidential election year .
… While few doubts have been raised , domestically or internationally , about the men ’s involvement in the attacks on New York and Washington , just about everything else about their treatment has been bitterly contested and is likely to continue to be contested , inside the courtroom and out .
Everything is laden with potential controversy – the decision to try the six men together rather than individually , the proposed venue at Guantanamo Bay , where all six are being held , the threatened use of the death penalty , and perhaps the most controversial question of all : the admissibility of evidence gathered through waterboarding and other coercive techniques generally defined as torture .

While the network neutrality debate can sometimes feel a bit theoretical in the US , it 's a live issue in Europe , and this week it hit the pages of newspapers across the UK .
What made news was a set of demands by UK ISPs , which banded together to tell the BBC that the ISPs would start to throttle the Corporation 's new iPlayer service because it could overwhelm their networks .
Unless the BBC pays up , of course .
Tiscali appears to be leading the charge , though ISPs like BT and Carphone Warehouse are also said to be involved .
Tiscali UK CEO Mary Turner told the Financial Times , " The Internet was not set up with a view to distributing video .
We have been improving our capacity , but the bandwidth we have is not infinite .
If the iPlayer really takes off , consumers accessing the Internet will get very slow service and call their ISPs to complain . "
The answer , from the ISP perspective , is to start throttling bandwidth used to download content to the iPlayer " catch - up " service .
UK users will soon be able to download complete BBC shows for up to a week after they first air ; other broadcasters like Channel 4 already offer similar services .
Because the BBC 's offering is expected to be so popular , ISPs are now concerned that iPlayer traffic will degrade the experience for all users of their networks .
But traffic shaping could be avoided should the BBC agree to pay the ISPs cash to help cover the cost of upgrading their networks .
Negotiations on the issue are continuing .
Who pays the piper ?
The underlying premise of many of the ISP comments are that the BBC is passing its distribution costs onto someone else — an obvious echo of arguments heard in the US that Google and other popular sites are n't " paying their fair share . "
Typically companies like the BBC have to at least pay for the bandwidth their servers use , and could even opt to pay partner ISPs through peering arrangements between networks to optimize performance .
This later option is rarely taken ( most peering arrangements are free of cost ) , which leaves the BBC to worry about the costs of running their own services .
But the iPlayer is n't a direct - download service ; instead , the BBC has chosen to use peer - to - peer networking as a way to cope with heavy loads and massive files .
It 's this aspect of the iPlayer that has ISPs up in arms , as local computers throughout their own networks become the servers for the BBC 's content , and the ISPs wo n't recoup payment through normal peering arrangements .
This could certainly be a problem in the short term .
While debates continue to rage about whether traffic shaping or simply expanding raw capacity are cheaper ways to solve the bandwidth crunch , the reality is that ISPs right now are having problems .
Vodafone Iceland , for instance , just announced this week that it hooked up some deep packet inspection gear to its underseas Internet links to diagnose traffic slowdowns .
It found that P2P was accounting for 60 percent of incoming traffic and 80 percent of outgoing traffic , and as soon as it began to throttle the total bandwidth available to P2P users , the network performed far better .
" Less than an hour [ after hooking up the equipment ] , not only could we chart that 80 percent of the congesting traffic was P2P , but the traffic policy we activated instantly gave our on - line gamers and business users very high Quality of Experience , " said network manager Palmi Sigurdsson .
Such traffic shaping is common in Europe ; Tiscali , for instance , already employs it on its own network .
When it comes to the long term , however , highly desirable and bandwidth - intensive services would seem to be a boon to ISPs , not a problem .
They drive up demand for Internet access , make that access in increasingly valuable to consumers , and provide plenty of opportunities for ISPs to charge more money for higher tiers of service .
If people only browse the web , how many would feel it essential to upgrade to a 20 M bps link ?
But the moment that services like iPlayer become essential , those higher speeds are much easier to advertise and sell .

The Raelians have championed some strange causes in the movement 's 25 - year history , including aliens and human clones , but now they are going to bat for a body part – the clitoris .
The cult 's leader , Rael , whose real name is Claude Vorilhon , has become outraged by the custom of female genital cutting , the primarily African practice in which part of a girl 's genitalia is sliced away .
Now the Raelian Movement has resolved to build a hospital in the West African country of Burkina Faso , where women could come to have their clitorises " reconstructed . "
" Rael thought this is a crime against humanity , " says Lara Terstenjak , a spokeswoman for Clitoraid , a nonprofit set up by the Raelians to sponsor genital surgeries .
Female circumcision is surprisingly prevalent throughout the world , particularly in Africa , where in some communities it is performed on 98 percent of the female population , despite legal prohibition .
Coming as it does from the group that claimed to have produced the first human clone , the Raelians ' boast that they 're sponsoring clitoris reconstruction seems open to question .
Yet the group has reputable doctors on its side .
The Raelians have recruited Marci Bowers , who runs a thriving sex - change clinic in Trinidad , Colorado , and has been called the " rock star " of transgender surgery .
Bowers is a post - op transsexual herself .
Bowers flew to Paris last April ( on her own dime ) to train with Pierre Foldes , an Ob - Gyn in Paris who reportedly invented the technique of clitoris reconstruction after many years of treating women in Africa .
Foldes performs about 200 of these surgeries each year .
According to Terstenjak , Foldes declined to get involved directly with Clitoraid , but he agreed to perform the surgery on women sponsored by the Raelians , and to instruct other doctors in his technique .
Terstenjak says Clitoraid has sponsored six women so far , including several from Burkina Faso who were flown to Paris to have the surgery done .
Foldes did not return a phone call from Wired.com , but Bowers confirms that the doctor worked on the six women helped by the cult .
When Bowers first started talking with the Raelians , her " working theory " was that they were a little bit nuts , she says .
But after a long , leisurely dinner in Paris with 10 cultured and international Raelians , she declared herself charmed .
" They were n't anything different .
It 's just that they bought into this philosophy involving extraterrestrial beings on earth , " she says .
" I do n't have to buy into the whole concept to do the work . "
During Bowers ' training with Foldes , they operated on 15 women in one day .
Bowers remembers one of the young women they saw on the operating table .
She was about 19 years old , and she and her twin sister had both had the genital - cutting procedure when they were little girls living in Mauritania .
Her twin sister had died , the woman said , because the cut was too deep , and they could n't stop the bleeding .
Bowers recalls that the woman had the most severe form of genital cutting , called infibulation , in which the clitoris and inner lips of the vulva are completely removed , and the outer lips are sewn partially shut to leave only a small hole .
Surgeries to " reverse " this kind of genital cutting have become fairly common in Europe as African immigrants become more westernized .
However , Foldes is currently the only doctor who attempts to go the extra step , not just dividing the sewn - together skin , but also constructing a new clitoris .
" It 's not terribly invasive , " Bowers says .
She explains that the surgeon first removes the scar tissue , and then looks for what the cutting procedure left behind .
The clitoris , Bowers says , " is almost like a snail .
Most of it is curled up behind the pubic bone , but there 's one tip pointed out , and that 's the clitoris .
So you 're first exposing the remaining stump of the clitoris , and then bringing it forward with some suturing . "
Foldes performs the surgeries for free and in addition to his regular hospital work , Bowers says , and she expects to do the same .
She plans to start seeing patients at her Colorado offices , and will fly to Burkina Faso for a month of surgeries as soon as the Raelians get the hospital built .
She does n't mind donating her time to the cause , and has also donated some money to help with the hospital : " This is building karma , " she says .
While construction of what the Raelians call " the pleasure hospital " has been delayed , Terstenjak insists the building will rise within the next year .
The group says it has bought a piece of land in a suburb of Bobo Dioulasso , Burkina Faso 's second - largest city .
" Here 's a beautiful piece of information , " Terstenjak says .
" There actually have been women coming out , known ( genital - cutting ) victims , and they want to help .
They 've put themselves forward to the construction team , saying , we 've never done anything like this , but we 'll carry bricks , we 'll dig holes , whatever needs to be done . "
Terstenjak claims that more than 100 women are on a waiting list for the procedure in Burkina Faso , and that there 's no requirement that these women join the Raelian Movement .
However , one of the women who Clitoraid sponsored for the procedure is referred to as a " guide , " a term used in the Raelian hierarchy .
There have been allegations that the Raelian Movement uses its doctrine of free love to attract recruits ( such as this 2005 article from Wired.com ) , and sensual massage is reportedly a key part of their seminars .
" Some people say they were first attracted to the movement because they thought they would get laid , " says Susan Palmer , a professor of religious studies at Montreal 's Dawson College who wrote a book on the Raelians .
" But more than recruiting , it 's a way for people within the movement to bond , " she says .
So could Clitoraid 's effort to bring new clitorises to African women be a recruiting technique ?
Palmer laughs at the suggestion .
" That would be an extremely expensive and round - about way to do it , " she says .
" They could just give them some food .
Like the Christian missionaries – they just feed people , and they flock to their churches . "
But that would be an old - school way of proselytizing .
The Raelian Movement , as it prepares a better Earth for the extraterrestrial 's return ( expected before 2035 ) , is nothing if not forward - thinking .
" What amazes me , " Palmer says with a tone of respect , " is that they are so inventive . "
People wondering why Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suddenly moved to reduce the bank borrowing rate by three quarters of a point should know that in private he has expressed growing pessimism about the economy .
Whispers has learned that has told people in recent weeks that the economic situation some see falling into recession will be much worse than he has admitted to publicly .
We 're told by those who 've heard him that he says the first six months of this year will be " bad , " an adjective that some interpret this as signaling there is better than a 50 - 50 chance for a recession .
Even worse , the former Princeton prof believes the ensuing recovery will be " weak " because of persistent problems in the housing market that will result in subdued consumer spending .
We checked in with his office , which says it does n't comment on what the boss says in private .
But it 's certainly not comforting news considering that his recent public testimony was a bummer , like when he told Congress last week , " Recently , incoming information has suggested that the baseline outlook for real activity in 2008 has worsened and that the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced ... in particular , a number of factors , including continuing increases in energy prices , lower equity prices , and softening home values , seem likely to weigh on consumer spending as we move into 2008 .

Randall Jeppesen and Courtney Orton reportingA man who made it his business to edit sexually explicit material from Hollywood films has been arrested for paying underage girls for sexual favors .
The man used to own four Clean Flicks franchises and now owns an edited - movie store , where police found a large stash of pornographic videos .
Police are looking at those pornographic videos to see if there are any other underage victims .
They say it 's a good thing the mother of a 14 - year - old girl questioned her daughter about a $ 20 bill when she did .
Orem Police Lt. Doug Edwards says , " It finally came out that she and another girl had been receiving money for sexual favors from older men . "
The men , 24 - year - old Isaac Lifferth and 31 - year - old Daniel Thompson , are now behind bars .
The girls had been hooked up with Lifferth by one of their 16 - year - old girlfriends as a way to make some easy money .
Edwards says , " They did admit to the fact that they felt like they were short of cash and were looking for ways to get cash . "
They exchanged text messages with Lifferth and arranged to meet him .
" He eventually picked them up and took them to a location , an apartment complex , and paid them each $ 20 for sexual favors . "
But that was n't the end of it , the girls called him again .
This time they ended up at an edited - movie store in Orem , where the girls allegedly performed sexual acts on the owner Daniel Thompson .
" Again , $ 20 were paid to each girl for performing sex acts on Mr. Thompson , " said Edwards .
Both men say they thought the girls were 18 .
Edwards says , " Regardless of what these guys say they thought they were , they looked younger than 18 . "
Both men were booked into the Utah County Jail on suspicion of sexual abuse and unlawful sexual activity with a 14 - year - old .
Lifferth also faces charges of patronizing a prostitute , and the 16 - year - old girl could face charges as well .

Dec. 19th , 2007 07:24 pm Computers Fear Me
So a few months ago I decided I wanted to work full - time in Ruby on Rails .
I spent a month unemployed and had to take a pay cut , but finally landed a sweet job at my current employer .
I get to work with some real Rails wizards .
They 're teaching me good stuff and in exchange I bring a broad programming background to the table .
I 'm working on a project that 's really quite clever .
It looks like an installed Windows application .
In reality , it is a Ruby on Rails environment , backed by a SQLite3 database , and accessed by Firefox Portable .
Our lead developer created a plugin for Rails called acts_as_replica that lets this application synchronize its database with a master server on the internet .
The end result is an installable application with the speed of a local program and the agility of a web system .
Since my " broad programming background " includes a lot of years spent programming Windows , I very quickly ended up in charge of maintaining the installer , which is built with a free installer tool called InnoSetup .
I just got my first really hairy problem : sometimes when our application shuts down , the controlling process closes without actually stopping Rails .
It leaves rubyw.exe running , and locks several files on disk , which prevents the uninstaller from deleting files and , more importantly , prevents the updater from replacing them .
InnoSetup gives pretty good value for the money if you do n't need to do anything crazy in your installer .
I can't really complain too much about it because a ) it works and b ) it 's free .
It 's even extensible by scripting if you need to go off - road .
Of course , I would n't be a programmer if I did n't complain about the tools I was given , so I 'll say this up front :
If you need to script the installer , you have to do it in Pascal .
I forgot Pascal 15 years ago .
This is not the same as never having learned it .
For one thing , you mutter under your breath a lot more .
I took this job so I could program Ruby on Rails , but what the heck , it 's just a little Pascal .
And so I unstoppered the bottle labeled ' Drink Me ' , took a giant swig , and down the rabbit hole I went ....
I 'll spare you most of the madness of the next three days , and try to give you a quick A - Team - style montage :
The Pascal scripting has many useful Windows API functions , but none of them were able to suitably identify the rubyw.exe process .
I thought about checking for the locked - files side effect , but the only time setup can be aborted is at the very beginning of time before setup is fully initialized , which is before setup is aware of the install directory ( not even the directory used by previous installs ) .
Okay , it 's time to look at running an external program to detect the process .
It 's very easy to detect from a C program , but I chose not to pursue that path as it would make it impossible for the other developers on my team to build the project , and including the .exe file would make it impossible for them to modify my code .
It 's also very easy to detect from a ruby or python script , but again there 's no way to find the ruby executables from the previous install .
So it was that I sat and thought and thought and thought , about what scripting and programming options are available on every Windows machine , until it hit me : I could use WSH , the Windows Script Host .
Every Windows machine since Windows 98 can run programs written in JScript and VBScript¹ .
Even better , I did n't want to go digging around for wscript.exe on the user 's system , and the Pascal scripting supports ShellExecute ( ) , which lets me try to open " app_status.js " without specifying the program , and Windows finds its own copy of wscript.exe and runs it on the program .
Okay , now we 're cooking with gas .
All I have to do is use the WSH to establish a connection to Windows Management services .
This is packaged as a COM service on Windows , and WSH can create COM objects .
Now all I have to do is ask it about running processes .
I do this by executing a SQL query —
Stop laughing !
I am not making this up for your amusement !
I said stop laughing !
— executing a SQL query on the WMI : ' SELECT * FROM Win32_process ' and loop through the results looking for rubyw.exe .
If I find any , I return an error status , which tells the Pascal script that the ShellExecute failed , which in turn causes InitializeSetup to fail , which displays a friendly message to the user to shut down the application and run setup again .
So yay !
I 'm a Ruby on Rails programmer !
By which I mean
I write Pascal
That shells out to Windows Script Host
So I can write JScript
That calls over COM to the WMI
So I can write SQL
To find out if Rails is running .
I am so horrified by this hack that I can't help but feel just a little bit proud .
I put one comment in the Pascal script :
(* Pascal -> WSH -> JScript -> COM -> WMI -> SQL ->
Rails .
When I said this was a kludge
I WAS NOT KIDDING AROUND . *)
One of my mottos is " Computers fear me " .
And for good reason : if they wo n't give me the data I need , I will rip out their entrails and reroute things until they give me the data I need - - often sobbing at me to please just stop .
¹ No lie .
Try it at home and amaze your friends : open notepad , type
WScript.echo( " Chalain is a big fat dork ! " ) ;
and save it as hello.js ( make sure it does not put . txt at the end ) .
Now double - click the file and see the message box magic !

On the afternoon of November 5 , a camera crew from the " To Catch a Predator " series , produced by investigative reporter Chris Hansen , accompanied a SWAT team to the house of a Texas prosecutor , Louis William Conradt Jr. Since 2004 , the TV program has worked with local police departments and an online watchdog group called Perverted Justice that provides " decoys " -- adults who pose as teenage boys -- to lure suspected pedophiles to so - called sting houses .
Condradt , a five - term district attorney , had been an assistant prosecutor ...
Speaking to reporters today in Indianapolis , John McCain had this to say about the reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post that raised questions about his close ties to lobbyists :
I do n't have any more comment about this issue .
I had a press conference yesterday morning , and I answered every question .
I 'm moving on ... I do not intend to discuss it further .
Not so fast , Mr. Straight Talk .
Just hours after the Times 's story was posted , the McCain campaign issued a point - by - point response that depicted the letters as routine correspondence handled by his staff — and insisted that McCain had never even spoken with anybody from Paxson or Alcalde & Fay about the matter . [...]
But that flat claim seems to be contradicted by an impeccable source : McCain himself .
" I was contacted by Mr. Paxson on this issue , " McCain said in the Sept. 25 , 2002 , deposition obtained by NEWSWEEK . [...] " ... where did you get information of that sort , Senator McCain ? "
McCain replied : " I was briefed by my staff . "
Abrams then followed up : " Do you know were they got the information ? "
" No , " McCain replied .
" But I would add , I was contacted by Mr. Paxson on this issue . "
" You were ? " " Yes . "
So before McCain moves on to the address " the big issues that Americans are concerned about , " perhaps the media can ask McCain about that glaring contradiction .
And maybe even about this McCain statement defending his senior campaign staff being made up of lobbyists :
The right to represent interests or groups of Americans is a constitutional right .
There are people that represent firemen , civil servants , retirees , and those people are legitimate representatives of a variety of interests in America .
If our intrepid press corps has n't been completely cowed by the rightwing attacks on the messenger yesterday , perhaps they could ask Mr. McCain which of his senior staff falls under that category .
Would it be :
His campaign manager , Rick Davis , co-founded a lobbying firm whose clients have included Verizon and SBC Telecommunications .
His chief political adviser , Charles R. Black Jr. , is chairman of one of Washington 's lobbying powerhouses , BKSH and Associates , which has represented AT&T , Alcoa , JPMorgan and U.S. Airways .
Senior advisers Steve Schmidt and Mark McKinnon work for firms that have lobbied for Land O' Lakes , UST Public Affairs , Dell and Fannie Mae .
... or will the media retreat back into the " John McCain is a straight talking maverick " stenography that makes their jobs so much easier ?

ARCHIVES | SEARCH First Rogue Cleaning Tool for Mac Posted by Patrik @ 04:56 GMT
We 've just found the first Mac rogue application and it's called MacSweeper .
It claims to clean your Mac from compromising files and it will always find something to fix / clean but the only way to do so is to buy the program .
Once installed it will also randomly show a big popup window stating that your privacy is compromised and again prompt you to buy the program .
Even more telling that it's a scam is the fact that when you visit the MacSweeper website with a PC and click on " Scan " , it will tell you that you have security vulnerabilities in folders that only exist on Mac like system_root / home .
Fake ?
Oh yeah …
Looking more at their website we found that they have copied the text describing the company directly from Symantec and just changed the name .
Rogue / fake applications ( scareware ) such as this have been around for years on Windows ( WinFixer , SpySheriff , et cetera ) .
They 're designed to trick people into thinking that they have security problems and that the only way to solve it is to buy the software .
Up until now this has been a Windows only problem but that 's not the case anymore .
So what does the first Mac rogue application really mean ?
It means that with Mac 's growing popularity and growing user base comes certain problems that can't be ignored .
Mac users will increasingly come under attack from bad guys and this new rogue application and the constant stream of new variants of DNSChanger is proof of that .
It does n't mean that Mac is becoming less secure in and of itself .
But it does mean that Mac users will have to watch out for social engineering tricks just like Windows users have had to do for years .
MacSweeper 's sibling in the Windows world is called Cleanator .
Editor 's Note — P.S. from Patrik :
Today I spoke with a journalist about MacSweeper and he said something that stuck in my mind .
" I visited the macsweeper.com website .
I know I probably should n't have - but I used a Windows PC so I knew I would n't get infected . "
Now that 's something you do n't hear everyday !
Best Buy sent us the following Cease & Desist letter ( page 1 & page 2 ) in reference to our blog post reporting on the Improv Everywhere Best Buy Blue Polo Shirts .
It ’s so thoughtful of Best Buy to send us this nice gift during the holiday season .
Ongoing coverage :
Improv Everywhere has posted an update , along with the original C & D letter they received from Best Buy .
I just spoke with someone in Best Buy ’s corporate PR department and they are going to check with their legal department regarding the situation .
I was impressed by the conversation we had and their responsiveness to the issue .
One thing I wanted to mention is that before posting this C & D letter , I called the Best Buy attorney who sent it to confirm that they really meant to send it to a blogger who was just reporting on another blog post .
They insisted that I was “ promoting , not reporting ” and that the demand letter was valid .
My question is would they send a C & D to a newspaper or magazine covering the same thing ?
Here ’s my write - up on the original Best Buy Mission organized by Improv Everywhere , which was the inspiration for the shirts .
Just to clarify , there are actually two issues here :
1 ) Best Buy going after Improv Everywhere and Neighborhoodies for creating and selling a t - shirt with a parody of the Best Buy logo .
2 ) Best Buy going after a blogger who wrote about Improv Everywhere and Neighborhoodies creating and selling a t - shirt with a parody of the Best Buy logo .
The C & D letter that Best Buy sent us was regarding issue # 2 .
Great news , Best Buy has just sent us an apology letter regarding the cease and desist letter the originally sent to us .
Maine 's 400 person College of The Atlantic , which you might remember from that time you were flipping through the Best 366 Colleges at Barnes & Noble , has reduced its total greenhouse gas footprint to zero .
The school , which claims to be " life changing , world changing , " is the first among the more than 450 institutions of higher learning that took the " net - zero " pledge to reduce or offset all of their carbon dioxide emissions .
The school was also the first to make the pledge .
They 've achieved neutrality by investing in a Portland , Oregon project that optimizes traffic lights to reduce CO2 emissions from idling cars .
Carbon - neutrality is a bit of a slippery term .
You can reduce emissions through using renewable energy or buy so - called offsets .
In most sustainability circles , the former ( making real changes ) is considered preferable to offsets .
So , buying them is a good first step , but as college president David Hales acknowledged , " [ they ] have much more to do to directly reduce our emissions . "
You can't fault the school for trying though , or doubt that their commitment is real .
The school is considered to be the greenest in the land , at least by Grist , an environmental magazine , .
Now you can keep current with daily impeachment news by adding it to your google home page ( iGoogle ) or by adding a scrolling news widget to your website .

Mr. Giuliani has appeared tired since Monday , when he held an unusually subdued town - hall - style meeting in Durham , N.H .
But he seemed upbeat when he last faced reporters on Wednesday night outside the fund - raiser in Chesterfield .
His illness comes as his campaign has hit a rough patch .
His lead in national polls has been shrinking lately , with several recent polls showing him essentially tied for first place among the Republican candidates after months in which he led more comfortably .
The Giuliani campaign is betting on an unorthodox strategy in which they are not counting on winning the first states that vote , Iowa and New Hampshire , but are instead focusing on winning the Florida primary on Jan. 29 and then trying to win a number of the big states that hold their primaries on Feb .
5 .
Mr. Giuliani never had much support in Iowa , which holds its caucuses on Jan .
3 . And after he failed to lift his standing in New Hampshire polls with a heavy advertising campaign there , he scaled back his efforts in order to marshal resources for later states .
He spent Wednesday campaigning in Missouri , where voters go to the polls some 48 days from now .
The campaign did not immediately alert reporters who were traveling with Mr. Giuliani , but instead they said they sent a bulletin about his admission to hospital to The Associated Press at 1 a.m .
Mr. Giuliani ’s hospitalization capped a day when he had unexpectedly had to drive across Missouri after his private jet broke down .
“ We were going to take an airplane , and when we got on the plane they said , ‘ Oh , one engine just went out , ’ ” Mr. Giuliani told supporters in Columbia , Mo. , Wednesday afternoon after arriving a couple of hours late to his event .
“ We thought it was better not to take the airplane . ”
( CNN ) -- Sen. Larry Craig on Thursday said he was not resigning from the Senate despite a Minnesota judge denying his request to withdraw his guilty plea stemming from his arrest in a sex sting at an airport men's room .
" I am extremely disappointed with the ruling issued today , " Craig said in a statement .
" I am innocent of the charges against me .
I continue to work with my legal team to explore my additional legal options . "
" I will continue to serve Idaho in the United States Senate , and there are several reasons for that , " the Republican said .
Craig 's decision to not resign , despite promising last month to do so if the judge ruled against his motion , was not a surprise to fellow Republican senators , Senate GOP sources told CNN .
No one in the GOP leadership has talked to Craig about his decision , the sources said .
" There has been a sense around the Senate that he was going to stay , " a Senate GOP leadership aide told CNN , saying there was " frustration and fatigue around the issue . "
Craig , however , did get a show of support from fellow Idaho Republican Sen .
Mike Crapo , who said in a statement that " Sen .
Craig has the right to pursue his legal options as does any citizen , and I support his effort . "
Hennepin County District Judge Charles Porter found that Craig had entered the guilty plea to to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge " accurately , voluntarily and intelligently , " and that it was too late to withdraw his admission .
In a sharply worded 27 - page order , the judge found that Craig had freely given his plea after extensive discussions with prosecutors and after waiving his right to an attorney .
" The defendant , a career politician with a college education , is of at least above - average intelligence , " Porter wrote .
" He knew what he was saying , reading and signing . "
Watch a report on the judge 's ruling »
Craig 's lawyer , Billy Martin , said that his client was weighing whether to appeal the judge 's decision .
" We renew our arguments that it is manifestly unjust to deny Sen .
Craig 's request to withdraw his guilty plea .
Sen .
Craig continues his steadfast denial that any inappropriate behavior took place at the airport , " Martin said in a statement .
Craig was arrested in June by Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport police , who accused him of making sexual overtures in an airport men's room to an undercover police officer .
He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in August , entering his plea by mail and paying a $ 500 fine .
View a timeline of the Craig scandal »
Once the guilty plea became public , Craig argued that the plea was a " mistake " and denied having engaged in any inappropriate conduct .
He said he pleaded guilty without legal advice out of fear that the allegations would be made public at a time when a Boise , Idaho , newspaper was investigating long - standing rumors about his sexuality .
" This pressure was entirely perceived by the defendant and was not a result of any action by the police , the prosecutor or the court , " he wrote .
Martin said last week that no judge signed off on the plea -- and , more importantly , that what Craig did in the restroom did not constitute disorderly conduct .
But Porter dismissed that argument , saying the facts police presented " provide a sufficient , supplemental , factual basis for a conviction of disorderly conduct . "
The judge also said the transcript of the dialogue between Craig and the arresting police officer did not show " an improperly aggressive interrogation . "
" There was no manifest injustice in the pressures to plead as perceived by the defendant , " Porter wrote .
Craig had said he would resign from the Senate if he could not get the guilty plea withdrawn by the end of September -- but then said he would await Porter 's ruling before deciding whether to step down .
If Craig stays in the Senate , the chamber 's Ethics Committee has indicated it will investigate his conduct .
Craig , a 62 - year - old , three - term senator , is up for re-election in 2008 , but advisers said he had decided against running for another term before the news of his arrest was made public .
The Idaho Republican , who is married and has aligned himself with conservative groups that oppose gay rights , has denied he is a homosexual .
Sen . Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , who had advocated that Craig fight to withdraw his guilty plea , said he was n't surprised by the judge 's decision .
" It 's a question of law , " Specter said .
" I thought he had a chance .
No doubt it 's difficult to withdraw a guilty plea . "
If he does leave , Idaho Gov. Butch Otter has decided on a replacement for Craig -- but wo n't name his choice until Craig resigns , Otter spokesman Jon Hanian said .
Hanian said the governor has not received a resignation letter from Craig and has not talked to the senator since the ruling .
He denied that Otter -- a longtime friend of the senator -- is pushing Craig to go , saying the governor " just wants to be ready . "
The Republican Senate leadership canceled a scheduled news conference after the judge 's decision was released .

A SURVEY OF HOW MUHAMMAD SPREAD ISLAM
By Samuel Green
How did Islam first spread from Mecca to the whole of Arabia ?
In our world today there seems to be three answers to this question .
Some say it spread through the beauty of Muhammad 's teaching and example .
Others say that Muhammad spread Islam by the sword .
Finally , others will say that they do n't know how Islam spread .
This article provides a brief survey of the different methods Muhammad used to spread Islam .
The survey only consults established Islamic historical sources .
1. TEACHING
Teaching Islam and Reciting the Qur'an
When Muhammad first began to teach about Islam he did so privately and publicly in Mecca .
People began to accept Islam , both men and women , in large numbers until the fame of it was spread throughout Mecca , and it began to be talked about .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 117 ) When the Apostle openly displayed Islam as God ordered him his people did not withdraw or turn against him , so far as I have heard , until he spoke disparagingly of their gods .
When he did that they took great offence and resolved unanimously to treat him as an enemy , except those whom God had protected by Islam from such evil , but they were a despised minority .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 118 ) Narrated Ibn Abbas :
When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu Dhar , he said to his brother , " Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man ( i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven .
Listen to him and then come to me . "
His brother set out till he met the Prophet and listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him , " I have seen him exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry . "
Abu Dhar said , " You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted . "
So , he took his journey - food and a water - skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca , where he went to the Mosque looking for the Prophet , ...
He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very spot .
( Bukhari : vol. 4 , bk. 56 , no.
724 , Khan )
Muhammad also taught publicly at Arabian markets .
( A)t one of the fairs ( markets ) ; and while he ( Muhammad ) was offering himself to the Arab tribes as was his wont he met at al - ' Aqaba a number of the Khazraj whom God intended to benefit .
... ( W ) hen the apostle met them he learned by inquiry that they were of the Khazraj and allies of the Jews .
He invited them to sit with him and expounded to them Islam and recited the Quran to them .
Now God had prepared the way for Islam in that they lived side by side with the Jews who were people of the scriptures and knowledge , while they themselves were polytheists and idolaters .
They had raided them in their district and whenever bad feeling arose the Jews used to say to them , " A prophet will be sent soon .
His day is at hand .
We shall follow him and kill you by his aid as ' Ad and Iram perished . "
So when they heard the apostle 's message they said one to another : " This is the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us .
Do n't let them get to him before us ! "
Thereupon they accepted his teaching and became Muslims .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , pp. 197-198 )
Muhammad taught at the resting places for pilgrims on their way to Mecca .
The Apostle of Allah , may Allah bless him , remained concealed at Makkah in the first three years of his commission to prophethood .
In the fourth year he declared it and invited the people to embrace Islam , continuing it for ten years .
In every season ( of pilgrimage ) he used to approach the pilgrims at their halting places , `Ukaz , Majannah and Dhu al - Majaz , and asked them to protect him so that he might convey to the people the message of his Lord , and in return they would get a place in paradise .
But he did not find anyone to support him or respond to his appeal .
...
None of the Arabian tribes responded to him .
( Ibn Sa'd , Kitab Al - Tabaqat Al - Kabir , vol. 1 , pp. 249-251 )
Through the method of private and public teaching Muhammad spread Islam .
A minority of people accepted him this way .
They were not compelled but were impressed by his teaching and accepted him freely .
In Mecca , his followers were a " despised minority " .
The vast majority of the Arabian tribes did not accept him .
2. THE TOOLS OF EMPIRE
Warfare on Non-Muslims
Some of the tribes in the city of Medinah ( Yathrib ) did accept Muhammad and he moved there for protection .
There he began to rule and formed an army .
Muhammad began to raid those around him .
Narrated Jabir :
The Prophet sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu ' Ubaida to ambush a caravan of the Quraish .
... ( Bukhari : vol. 7 , bk 67 , no .
402 , Khan )
Muhammad was also involved in defensive and offensive battles .
The Arabian tribes who had previously rejected Muhammad were now asked again to submit to him .
For most of the tribes this was done by sending a military delegation .
Before Muhammad 's armies would attack a tribe they would invite them to accept Islam first :
The Apostle of Allah , sent Khalid Ibn al - Walid with four hundred Muslims to Banu al - Harith ...
He ordered him to invite them to Islam three times before fighting .
...
They accepted what he had called them to .
He stayed among them to teach them Islam , its regulations , the Book of Allah and the sunnah of His Prophet .
( Ibn Sa'd , Kitab Al - Tabaqat Al - Kabir , vol. 1 , p. 399 ) ... Ali and Ibn al - Musaffa said : The Apostle of Allah ( peace_be_upon_him ) sent us on an expedition .
When we reached the place of attack , I galloped my horse and outstripped my companions , and the people of that locality received me with a great noise .
I said to them : Say " There is no god but Allah , " and you will be protected .
They said this .
My companions blamed me , saying : You deprived us of the booty .
When we came to the Apostle of Allah ( peace_be_upon_him ) , they told him what I had done .
So he called me , appreciating what I had done , and said : Allah has recorded for you so and so ( a reward ) for every man of them .
( Abu - Dawud : bk. 41 , no .
5062 , Hasan ) Anas b. Malik reported : The Messenger of Allah used to attack the enemy when it was dawn .
He would listen to the Adhan ( Islamic call to prayer ) ; so if he heard an Adhan , he stopped , otherwise made an attack .
( Muslim : bk. 4 , no .
745 , Siddiqui )
Muhammad said that he was commanded by Allah to spread Islam this way :
Narrated Ibn ' Umar : Allah 's Apostle said : " I have been ordered ( by Allah ) to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah 's Apostle , and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity , so if they perform all that , then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning ( accounts ) will be done by Allah . "
( Bukhari : vol. 1 , bk. 2 , no. 24 , Khan )
Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day and do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden -- such men as practise not the religion of truth ...
It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth , that He may uplift it above every religion , though the unbelievers be averse .
( Qur'an 9:29 - 33 , Arberry )
It was easy to become Muhammad 's enemy .
If you did not acknowledge him as your ruler and prophet then you were his enemy .
Those who joined Muhammad joined the fight against those who did not accept Muhammad 's religion :
Surad Ibn ` Abd Allah al - Azdi arrived with about thirteen to nineteen members of his people in a deputation to the Apostle of Allah ...
The Apostle of Allah , may Allah bless him , appointed him ( Surad ) amir of those of his people who had embraced Islam , and enjoined him to wage war against the polytheists of the tribe of Yaman , who were living in the adjoining territories .
He set out and alighted at Jurash which was a strongly fortified city and where the tribes of Yaman had taken shelter .
He ( Surad ) invited them to embrace Islam but they declined .
He besieged them for a month and used to raid their animals and seize them .
Then he retreated to a mountain , called Shakar .
They thought that he had fled , and came out to pursue him .
He arrayed his forces , and attacked them .
Muslims put them to the sword as they liked .
They seized twenty of their horses and fought them all day long .
The people of Jurash had sent two men to the Apostle of Allah , who were waiting for an opportunity to meet him .
The Apostle of Allah , Allah bless him , informed them of this combat and the victory of Surad .
The two men came to their people and informed them of the circumstances , along with other incidents .
So a deputation of them set out , and they waited on the Apostle of Allah , may Allah bless him , and embraced Islam .
( Ibn Sa'd , Kitab Al - Tabaqat Al - Kabir , vol. 1 , pp. 397-398 )
This time of conquest was a great source of pride to Muhammad and his Companions .
Many poems were composed to celebrate their victories .
Here is a section of a poem that Ka'b b. Malik composed before the Islamic conquest of Al - Ta'if .
If you offer peace we will accept it
And make you partners ( with us ) in peace and war .
If you refuse we will fight you doggedly .
...
We shall fight as long as we live
Till you turn to Islam , humbly seeking refuge .
We will fight not caring whom we meet
Whether we destroy ancient holdings or newly gotten gains .
...
And we cut off their noses and ears
With our fine polished Indian swords ,
Driving them violently before us to the command of God and Islam ,
Until religion is established , just and straight .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , pp. 587-588 )
These battles were not self - defence , they were offensive battles whose aim was to spread the Islamic empire and the rule of Muhammad .
This was missionary warfare and violent jihad .
Throughout this period of warfare , Muhammad 's teaching was still very important .
He inspired his soldiers to fight with the promise of paradise .
For those who fought there was the promise of forgiveness , status , virgins , expensive clothes , watered gardens with abundant fruit , rivers of wine , milk and honey , slave boys and beautiful houses .
Consider these verses from the Qur'an :
O You who believe !
Shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you from a painful torment .
That you believe in Allah and His Messenger ( Muhammad SAW ) , and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives , that will be better for you , if you but know !
( If you do so ) He will forgive you your sins , and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow , and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of ' Adn Eternity [ ' Adn ( Edn ) Paradise ] , that is indeed the great success .
( Qur 'an 61:10 - 12 , Al - Hilali & Khan )
This is the similitude of Paradise which the godfearing have been promised : therein are rivers of water unstaling , rivers of milk unchanging in flavour , and rivers of wine -- a delight to the drinkers , rivers , too , of honey purified ; and therein for them is every fruit , and forgiveness from their Lord ( Qur'an 47:15 , Arberry ) Lo ! those who kept their duty will be in a place secure amid gardens and water - springs , attired in silk and silk embroidery , facing one another .
Even so ( it will be ) .
And we shall wed them unto fair ones with wide , lovely eyes .
( Qur 'an 44:51 - 54 , Pickthall )
Surely for the godfearing awaits a place of security , gardens and vineyards and maidens with swelling breasts , like of age , and a cup overflowing .
( Qur'an 78:31 - 33 , Arberry ) Perfectly
We formed them , perfect , and We made them spotless virgins , chastely amorous , like of age for the Companions of the Right .
( Qur'an 56:34 - 35 , Arberry )
And there go round , waiting on them menservants of their own , as they were hidden pearls .
( Qur 'an 52:24 , Pickthall )
There wait on them immortal youths .
( Qur 'an 56:17 , 76:19 , Pickthall )
Those Muslims who did not fight for Muhammad were not equal in status to those who did :
Not equal are those of the believers who sit ( at home ) , except those who are disabled ( by injury or are blind or lame , etc. ) , and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives .
Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit ( at home ) .
Unto each , Allah has promised good ( Paradise ) , but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight , above those who sit ( at home ) by a huge reward ; ( Qur 'an 4:95 , Al - Hilali & Khan )
These promises of Muhammad inspired the Muslims to give their lives towards the spread of the Islamic empire .
Consider the example of ` Umayr b. al - Humam :
Then the apostle went forth to the people and incited them saying , " By God in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad , no man will be slain this day fighting against them with steadfast courage advancing not retreating but God will cause him to enter Paradise . "
` Umayr b. al - Humam brother of B. Salima was eating some dates which he had in his hand .
" Fine , Fine ! " said he , " is there nothing between me and my entering Paradise save to be killed by these men ? "
He flung the dates from his hand , seized his sword , and fought against them till he was slain .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 300 )
Thus warfare and the preaching of paradise were important methods that Muhammad used to spread Islam .
Muhammad did not send out preachers and evangelists instead he sent out armies .
Warfare on Muslims
Muhammad 's use of warfare was not just aimed at non-Muslims .
On some occasions he called for war on Muslims .
This was part of the way he strengthened the hold of Islam on the early Muslims community .
O you who believe !
Observe your duty to Allah , and give up what remains ( due to you ) from usury ( interest ) , if you are ( in truth ) believers .
And if you do not , then be warned of war ( against you ) from Allah and His messenger .
And if you repent , then you have your principal ( without interest ) .
Wrong not , and you shall not be wronged .
( Qur'an 2:278-279 , Pickthall )
The context of the above verses is that some Muslims wanted to get the interest that was still owed to them before they became Muslims .
They are warned that if they seek this interest then Allah and Muhammad will make war on them .
We see a similar command in 9:73 .
O Prophet !
Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites !
Be harsh with them .
Their ultimate abode is hell , a hapless journey 's end .
( Qur 'an 9:73 , Pitckthall )
The context here is that Muhammad is calling the Muslims to Jihad .
Some of the Muslim tribes do not want to fight , therefore , they are called hypocrites and Muhammad is to fight against them until they join the Jihad .
Muhammad had their mosque burnt down .
The owners of the mosque of opposition had come to the apostle as he was preparing for ( to attack ) Tabuk , saying , " We have built a mosque for the sick and needy and for nights of bad weather , and we should like you to come to us and pray for us there . "
He said that he was on the point of travelling , and was preoccupied ... and that when he came back if God willed he would come to them and pray for them in it .
When he stopped in Dhu Awan news of the mosque came to him , and he summoned Malik b. al - Dukhshum ... and Ma'n b. ` Adiy ... and told them to go to the mosque of those evil men and destroy and burn it .
... and then the two of them ran into the mosque where its people were and burned and destroyed it and the people ran away from it .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 609 )
In sura 33 Muslims are again called hypocrites and threatened with war if they continue to question Muhammad 's moral and military judgement .
If the hypocrites , and those in whose hearts is a disease , and the alarmists in the city do not cease , We verily shall urge you on against them , then they will be your neighbours in it but a little while .
Accursed , they will be seized wherever found and slain with a ( fierce ) slaughter .
( Qur 'an 33:60 - 61 , Pitckthall )
In sura 49 Muhammad is commanded to fight Muslims until they " return unto the ordinance of Allah " .
And if two parties of believers fall to fighting , then make peace between them .
And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other , fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah ; then , if it return , make peace between them justly , and act equitably .
Lo !
Allah loveth the equitable .
( Qur 'an 49:9 , Pickthall )
In sura 66 those Muslims who questioned what Muhammad was doing are called hypocrites and were to be treated harshly .
O Prophet !
Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites , and be stern with them .
Hell will be their home , a hapless journey 's end .
( Qur 'an 66:9 , Pickthall )
Muhammad commanded the true Muslims to make war on those Muslims who did not stop using alcohol .
Narrated Daylam al - Himyari : I asked the Prophet ( peace_be_upon_him ) and said : Apostle of Allah !
we live in a cold land in which we do heavy work and we make a liquor from wheat to get strength from it for our work and to stand the cold of our country .
He asked : Is it intoxicating ?
I replied : Yes .
He said : You must avoid it .
I said :
The people will not abandon it .
He said :
If they do not abandon it , fight with them .
( Abu Dawood : bk 26 , no .
3675 , Hasan )
To conclude , Muhammad used warfare on Muslims who questioned him or did not follow the laws he gave .
They were called hypocrites .
In this way Muhammad strengthened and spread the influence on Islam on the newly converted tribes .
Money and Gifts
Warfare was not always the best option for Muhammad .
As he gained wealth he also used money and gifts to spread Islam .
Narrated Anas :
The Prophet gathered some people of Ansar and said , " The People of Quraish are still close to their Pre-lslamic period of ignorance and have suffered a lot , and I want to help them and attract their hearts ( by giving them the war booty ) .
... ( Bukhari : vol. 5 , bk. 59 , no .
623 , Khan ) Narrated Abu Said :
Ali sent a piece of gold to the Prophet who distributed it among four persons : Al - Aqra ' bin Habis Al - Hanzali from the tribe of Mujashi , ' Uyaina bin Badr Al - Fazari , Zaid At - Ta'i who belonged to ( the tribe of ) Bani Nahban , and ' Alqama bin Ulatha Al - ' Amir who belonged to ( the tribe of ) Bani Kilab .
So the Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said , " He ( i.e. the Prophet ) gives the chief of Najd and does not give us . "
The Prophet said , " I give them so as to attract their hearts ( to Islam ) . "
( Bukhari : vol. 4 , bk. 55 , no .
558 , Khan )
The apostle told them to tell Malik that if he came to him as a Muslim he would return his family and property to him and give him a hundred camels .
On hearing this Malik came out ... and rode off to join the apostle ... He ( Muhammad ) gave him back his family and property and gave him a hundred camels .
He became an excellent Muslim .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 593 )
After Muhammad had conquered Mecca he ordered the alms money ( zakat ) be used for certain purposes .
One of these purposes was to encourage people to embrace Islam :
The alms are only for the poor and the needy , and those who collect them , and those whose hearts are to be reconciled ( to Islam ) .
( Qur 'an 9:60 , Pickthall )
Commenting on " those whose hearts are to be reconciled " , Ibn Kathir writes :
There are those who are given alms to embrace Islam .
For instance , the Prophet of Allah gave something to Safwan bin Umayyah ... ( Ibn Kathir , Tafsir Ibn Kathir , vol. 4 , p. 455 ) ...
Allah 's Messenger ( may peace be upon him ) gave one hundred camels to Safwan b. Umayya .
He again gave him one hundred camels , and then again gave him one hundred camels .
Sa'id b. Musayyib said that Safwan told him : ( By Allah ) Allah 's Messenger ( may peace be upon him ) gave me what he gave me ( and my state of mind at that time was ) that he was the most detested person amongst people in my eyes .
But he continued giving to me until now he is the dearest of people to me .
( Muslim : bk. 30 , no .
5730 , Siddiqui )
Thus sometimes Muhammad used money and gifts to spread Islam .
Assassins
Some tribes did not respond to warfare or money .
Ibn Ishaq records how Muhammad used the fear and intimidation generated from assassinations to convert a tribe :
Abu ` Afak ... showed his disaffection when the apostle ( Muhammad ) killed al - Harith b. Samit ...
The apostle said , " Who will deal with this rascal for me ? "
Whereupon Salim b. ` Umayr , ... went forth and killed him .
... ( `Asma d. Marwan ) was of B. Umayya b. Zayd .
When Abu ` Afak had been killed she displayed disaffection .
...
When the apostle heard what she had said , he said , " Who will rid me of Marwan 's daughter ? "
` Umayr b. ` Adiy al - Khatmi who was with him heard him , and that very night he went to her house and killed her .
In the morning he came to the apostle and told him what he had done and he ( Muhammad ) said , " You have helped God and His apostle , O ` Umayr ! "
When he asked if he would have to bear any evil consequences the apostle said , " Two goats wo n't butt their heads about her , " ...
The day after Bint Marwan was killed the men of ( tribe of ) Khatma became Muslims because they saw the power of Islam .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , pp. 675-676 )
Thus , sometimes Muhammad used the method of assassination to convert a tribe to Islam .
Compulsion
Sometimes Muhammad did not use compulsion to spread Islam .
Let there be no compulsion in religion : Truth stands out clear from Error . ( Qur 'an 2:256 , Yusuf Ali )
The apostle sent out troops in the district around Mecca inviting men to God : he did not order them to fight .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 561 )
But on other occasions he did use and approve of compulsion .
He ( Muhammad ) said : " Woe to you , Abu Sufyan , is n't it time that you recognize that I am God 's apostle ? "
He answered , " As to that I still have some doubt . " I ( Abbas ) said to him , " Submit and testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the apostle of God before you lose your head , " so he did so .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 547 ) Abu Bakr said : " You asked me for the best advice that I could give you , and I will tell you .
God sent Muhammad with this religion and he strove for it until men accepted it voluntary or by force . "
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , pp. 668-669 ) ...
When Jarir reached Yemen , there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination .
Someone said to him .
" The messenger of Allah 's Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you , he would chop off your neck . "
One day while he was using them ( i.e. arrows of divination ) , Jarir stopped there and said to him , " Break them ( i.e. the arrows ) and testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah , or else I will chop off your neck . "
So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah .
( Bukhari : vol. 5 , bk. 59 , no .
643 , Khan ) Narrated ' Abdullah : Allah 's Apostle said , " The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle , cannot be shed except in three cases :
In Qisas for murder , a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam ( apostate ) and leaves the Muslims . "
( Bukhari : vol. 9 , bk. 83 , no. 17 , Khan )
Thus on some occasions Muhammad used and approved of compulsion to spread and keep people in Islam .
Torture
Muhammad needed a lot of money to finance the expansion of his religion and empire .
One of the richest cities in the region was the Jewish city of Khaybar .
The Jews there did not accept Muhammad as a prophet or his claim to rule over them .
After Muhammad had conquered Khaybar we read what he did to get their riches to finance his jihad .
Kinana b. al - Rabi` , who had the custody of the treasure ( of Kaybar ) , ... was brought to the apostle who asked him about it .
He denied that he knew where it was .
A Jew came ... to the apostle and said that he had seen Kinana going round a certain ruin every morning early .
When the apostle said to Kinana , " Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you ? " he said Yes .
The apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be excavated and some of the treasure was found .
When he asked him about the rest he refused to produce it , so the apostle gave orders to al - Zubayr b. al - `Awwam , " Torture him until you extract what he has , " so he kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 515 )
Thus Muhammad sometimes used torture to finance the spread of his religion and empire .
3. REMOVING OPTIONS
Destroying the Ka'bas and Shrines
The Ka'ba in Mecca was not the only ka'ba in Arabia .
There were other ka'bas and shrines that the Arabs would make pilgrimage to during the year .
Muhammad spread Islam by destroying these other ka'bas and making the Islamic worship at Mecca the only option for the Arabs .
Jarir bin ' Abdullah narrated :
There was a house called Dhul - Khalasa in the Pre-lslamic Period and it was also called Al - Ka'ba Al - Yamaniya or Al - Ka'ba Ash - Shamiya .
Allah 's Apostle said to me , " Will you relieve me from Dhul - Khalasa ? "
So I left for it with 150 cavalrymen from the tribe of Ahmas and then we destroyed it and killed whoever we found there .
Then we came to the Prophet and informed him about it .
He invoked good upon us and upon the tribe of Ahmas .
( Bukhari : vol. 5 , bk. 58 , no .
160 , Khan )
Then the apostle sent Khalid to al - `Uzza which was in Nakhla .
It was a temple which this tribe of Quraysh and Kinana and all Mudar used to venerate .
...
When Khalid arrived he destroyed her and returned to the apostle .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 565 )
Destroying Independent Mosques
Muhammad commissioned the construction of many mosques .
However , on one occasion an independent group built a mosque and invited Muhammad to it .
These Muslims did not want to fight in Muhammad 's Jihad .
Muhammad had their mosque destroyed .
The owners of the mosque of opposition had come to the apostle as he was preparing for ( to attack ) Tabuk , saying , " We have built a mosque for the sick and needy and for nights of bad weather , and we should like you to come to us and pray for us there . "
He said that he was on the point of travelling , and was preoccupied ... and that when he came back if God willed he would come to them and pray for them in it .
When he stopped in Dhu Awan news of the mosque came to him , and he summoned Malik b. al - Dukhshum ... and Ma'n b. ` Adiy ... and told them to go to the mosque of those evil men and destroy and burn it .
... and then the two of them ran into the mosque where its people were and burned and destroyed it and the people ran away from it .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasul Allah , p. 609 )
Thus Muhammad spread his Islam by making his mosques the only option .
Rejecting Other Prophets
At the same time that Muhammad was claiming to be a prophet there were men from other tribes who claimed to be prophets too .
These men and their tribes accepted Muhammad as a prophet but Muhammad did not accept these men as prophets .
During this time these tribes had two prophets : Muhammad plus their own .
During his life Muhammad as not able to kill these other prophets but when he died his followers killed them .
This will be shown in section 5 .
Thus Islam spread by making Muhammad the only option for a prophet .
4. INCORPORATING THE PRE -ISLAMIC RELIGION
Muhammad spread Islam by making the transition from the pre-Islamic religion to Islam easy .
He did this by making very few changes to it .
The idols were removed and people now had to submit to him , but nearly all of the other practices remained the same .
In practice Islam is very similar to the pre-Islamic religion .
Here are a few examples .
Fasting
Muhammad initially continued the pre-Islamic time for fasting :
Narrated ' Aisha : ' Ashura ' ( i.e. the tenth of Muharram ) was a day on which the tribe of Quraish used to fast in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance .
The Prophet also used to fast on this day .
So when he migrated to Medina , he fasted on it and ordered ( the Muslims ) to fast on it .
When the fasting of Ramadan was enjoined , it became optional for the people to fast or not to fast on the day of Ashura .
( Bukhari : vol. 5 , bk. 58 , no .
172 , Khan )
As -Safa and Al - Marwa
The pre-Islamic religion also had a special walk that was done between the mountains of Safa and Marwa in Mecca .
Muhammad continued this practice too .
Again , some of the early Muslims were uncomfortable with this and thought that this pagan practice should be stopped .
Later Muhammad transformed the meaning of these mountains to be " symbols of Allah " :
Narrated ' Asim : I asked Anas bin Malik : " Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa ? "
He said , " Yes , as it was of the ceremonies of the days of the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance , till Allah revealed : ' Verily !
( The two mountains ) As - Safa and Al - Marwa are among the symbols of Allah .
It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka'ba , or performs ' Umra , to perform Tawaf between them . ' "
( 2.158 ) ( Bukhari : vol. 2 , bk. 26 , no .
710 , Khan )
The Black Stone
The pre-Islamic religion was animistic with special attention to sacred stones .
Narrated Abu Raja Al - Utaridi :
We used to worship stones , and when we found a better stone than the first one , we would throw the first one and take the latter , but if we could not get a stone then we would collect some earth ( i.e. soil ) and then bring a sheep and milk that sheep over it , and perform the Tawaf around it .
... ( Bukhari : vol. 5 , bk. 59 , no .
661 , Khan )
The most sacred stone in the pre-Islamic religion was the Black Stone .
It was part of the Ka'ba in Mecca .
Even though the worship of stones is animistic Muhammad continued this practice .
Some of the early reformer Muslims found this very uncomfortable .
Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father who said : " Umar bin Al - Khattab addressed the Corner ( Black Stone ) saying , ' By Allah !
I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit nor harm .
Had I not seen the Prophet touching ( and kissing ) you , I would never have touched ( and kissed ) you . '
Then he kissed it and said , ' There is no reason for us to do Ramal ( a special style of walking ) ( in Tawaf ) except that we wanted to show off before the pagans , and now Allah has destroyed them . '
' Umar added , '( Nevertheless ) , the Prophet did that and we do not want to leave it ( i.e. Ramal ) . ' "
( Bukhar : vol. 2 , bk. 26 , no .
675 , Khan )
But for the majority of the early Muslims being able to continue their previous practice of venerating the Black Stone made it easy for them to accept Islam and so Islam spread .
Incantations
Incantations were part of the animistic pre-Islamic religion .
Muhammad allowed this practice to continue as long as the incantations were transformed to be Islamic :
' Auf b. Malik Ashja 'i reported
We practised incantation in the pre-Islamic days and we said : Allah 's Messenger , what is your opinion about it ?
He said : Let me know your incantation and said :
There is no harm in the incantation which does not smack of polytheism .
( Muslim : bk. 26 , no .
5457 , Siddiqui )
Thus Muhammad spread Islam by making an easy transition from the pre-Islamic religion to Islam .
He did this by retaining most of the animistic pre-Islamic practices .
Narrated ' Aisha : Whenever Allah 's Apostle ordered the Muslims to do something , he used to order them deeds which were easy for them to do ... ( Bukhari : vol. 1 , bk. 2 , no. 19 , Khan )
Animistic Blessings
Many hadiths record that Muhammad and his followers believed that substances from his body had special powers to bless people .
This is a pre-Islamic animistic belief .
The early Muslims venerated Muhammad 's saliva , ablution water , sweat , hair and possibly even his urine ( 1 , 2 ) .
... ( I ) f he ( Muhammad ) spat , the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them ( i.e. the Prophet 's companions ) who would rub it on his face and skin ... ( Bukhari : vol. 3 , bk. 50 , no .
891 , Khan ) Narrated Mahmud bin Ar - Rabi ' : I remember Allah's Apostle and also the mouthful of water which he took from a bucket in our house and ejected ( spat on me ) .
... ( Bukhari : vol. 1 , bk. 12 , no .
801 , Khan ) Narrated Abu Juhaifa : I saw Allah 's Apostle in a red leather tent and I saw Bilal taking the remaining water with which the Prophet had performed ablution .
I saw the people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoever got some of it rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the moisture from the others ' hands .
... ( Bukhari : vol. 1 , bk. 8 , no .
373 , Khan ) Narrated Abu Hazim : ... A man among his companions , seeing him ( Muhammad ) wearing it ( a sheet ) , said , " O Allah 's Apostle !
Please give it to me to wear . "
The Prophet said , " Yes . " ( and gave him that sheet ) .
...
That man said , " I just wanted to have its blessings as the Prophet had put it on , so I hoped that I might be shrouded in it . "
( Bukhari : vol. 8 , bk. 73 , no. 62 , Khan ) Anas b. Malik reported that Allah 's Apostle ( may peace be upon him ) came to the house of Umm Sulaim and slept in her bed while she was away from her house .
...
She came and found him sweating and his sweat falling on the leather cloth spread on her bed .
She opened her scent - bag and began to fill the bottles with it .
Allah 's Apostle ( may peace be upon him ) was startled and woke up and said : Umm Sulaim , what are you doing ?
She said : Allah 's Messenger , we seek blessings for our children through it .
Thereupon he said :
You have done something right .
( Muslim : bk. 30 , no .
5762 , Siddique ) Abu Bakr reported : ( Muhammad called for ) the barber and , pointing towards the right side of his head , said : ( Start from ) here , and then distributed his hair among those who were near him .
( Muslims : bk. 7 , no .
2992 , Siddique )
Muhammad continued the practice of venerating the marabout ( holy man ) with himself being the object of veneration .
This practice is often mistakenly said to be " folk Islam " and not genuine Islam , however , Muhammad clearly accepted his veneration .
This was part of the way Muhammad spread Islam .
Venerated in Prayer
Though Muhammad is dead he is venerated and addressed in the Islamic prayer ( salaat ) .
As Salaamu ' alaika ayyuhan nabiyyu wa rahmatul laahi wa barakaatuh
Greetings to you , O Prophet , and the mercy and blessings of Allah .
( Salaat )
Venerating saints / marabouts was a pre-Islamic practice that Muhammad continued with himself .
This made Islam easy for his followers and helped to spread it .
5. AFTER MUHAMMAD'S DEATH
( Immediately after the death of Muhammad ) The situation that Abu Bakr faced on assuming the caliphate was very grim .
Many tribes apostatised from Islam and refused to pay Zakat .
Many false prophets rose throughout the length and breadth of Arabia , and many people offered allegiance to them .
The argument that weighed with them was that a living prophet was to be preferred to one who was dead .
( Prof. Masud ul - Hasan , The History of Islam , vol. 1 , p. 97 )
The following is a summary of Prof.
Hasan 's account of the wars against these apostate Arab tribes .
The Arab tribes around Medina were prepared to stay Muslim but they did not want to pay the Zakat ( tax ) to the Islamic authorities .
These tribes tried to attack Medina but were repelled .
Abu Bakr chased and conquered them and took their land .
Abu Bakr then turned his attention to the rest of the Arabian Peninsula , much of which had now chosen to leave Islam .
To the north of Medina was the tribe of Asad .
They followed their prophet Taleaha .
The Muslim forces marched against them and defeated them at Buzakha .
They then returned to Islam .
Next the Muslim forces marched to the tribe of Fazara and fought at Zafar .
The Muslims won and the defeated tribe offered submission and was readmitted to Islam .
The tribe of Sulaim were attacked by the Muslim forces and defeated .
Their leader Abu Shajra was captured and taken to Medina were he accepted Islam .
The Muslims force marched against the tribe of Tamim .
This tribe offered no resistance nor did they offer submission .
Their leader was killed and his wife married by the Islamic general , Khalid .
The tribe then accepted Islam .
The tribe of Hanifa was led by the prophet Musaylima .
The Muslims fought hard against this tribe and finally won though they suffered a great number of casualties .
Once Musaylima was killed and the tribe subdued they accepted Islam .
After this battle Abu Bakr sent an army to Bahrain .
In Bahrain a new king had come to power and he rejected Islam .
There was much internal fighting .
The Muslims tried to conquer them but were not successful until reinforcements arrived .
Having been defeated , the people of Bahrain repented and were admitted to the fold of Islam .
In Oman , Laquit ibn Malik was the prophet .
A Muslim force was sent against him .
Laquit and ten thousand of his followers were killed .
Then the people of Oman reconverted to Islam .
In Mahrah there was civil war with the death of Muhammad .
The Muslims sided with the weaker party and fought with them .
When this region was conquered the people of Mahrah repented , and were reconverted to Islam .
In Yemen there was a prophet called Aswad Ansi .
He had a large following .
The Muslim forces marched against them , defeated them and killed Aswad .
Once defeated , this region returned to Islam .
At Hadramaut the people resisted Islamic rule .
The Muslim forces conquered them and they were readmitted to the fold of Islam .
The apostasy campaigns began in August 632 C.E. and these operations were over by February 633 C.E.
Within the short space of six months , Abu Bakr succeeded in exterminating apostasy and winning back all the tribes in Arabia to the fold of Islam .
( Prof. Masud ul - Hasan , The History of Islam , vol. 1 , p. 102 )
Thus when Muhammad died the Islamic empire fragmented and many of the Arab tribes left Islam .
They did this for various reasons .
Some did n't want to pay tax to Mecca / Medinah , others wanted to follow their own prophet for they did not see Muhammad as the final prophet .
Muhammad 's companions compelled these tribes to return to Islam .
This is how Islam spread and established itself in Arabia .
CONCLUSION
How did Muhammad spread Islam ?
As this survey demonstrates he used many methods .
These included teaching Islam , reciting the Qur'an , warfare , money and gifts , assassinations , compulsion , torture , removing other religious options and incorporating much of the pre-Islamic religion into Islam .
After Muhammad 's death his companions continued some of these methods .
It is wrong to exaggerate any one of these methods ; Muhammad used all of them to spread Islam .

Using concentrated solar energy to reverse combustion , a research team from Sandia National Laboratories is building a prototype device intended to chemically “ reenergize ” carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using concentrated solar power .
The carbon monoxide could then be used to make hydrogen or serve as a building block to synthesize a liquid combustible fuel , such as methanol or even gasoline , diesel and jet fuel .
The prototype device , called the Counter Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator ( CR5 , for short ) , will break a carbon - oxygen bond in the carbon dioxide to form carbon monoxide and oxygen in two distinct steps .
It is a major piece of an approach to converting carbon dioxide into fuel from sunlight .
The Sandia research team calls this approach “ Sunshine to Petrol ” ( S2P ) .
“ Liquid Solar Fuel ” is the end product — the methanol , gasoline , or other liquid fuel made from water and the carbon monoxide produced using solar energy .
CR5 inventor Rich Diver says the original idea for the device was to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen could then fuel a potential hydrogen economy .
The Sandia researchers came up with the idea to use the CR5 to break down carbon dioxide , just as it would water .
Over the past year they have shown proof of concept and are completing a prototype device that will use concentrated solar energy to reenergize carbon dioxide or water , the products of combustion .
This will form carbon monoxide , hydrogen , and oxygen , which ultimately could be used to synthesize liquid fuels in an integrated S2P system .
Coresearchers on the project are Jim E. Miller and Nathan Siegel .
Project champion is Ellen B. Stechel , manager of Sandia ’s Fuels and Energy Transitions Department .
Stechel says that researchers have known for a long time that theoretically it might be possible to recycle carbon dioxide , but many thought it could not be made practical , either technically or economically .
“ Hence , it has not been pursued with much vigor , ” she says .
“ Not only did we think it was possible , the team has developed a prototype that they fully anticipate will successfully break down carbon dioxide in a clever and viable two - step process . ”
Stechel notes that one driver for the invention is the need to reduce greenhouse gases .
“ This invention , though probably a good 15 to 20 years away from being on the market , holds a real promise of being able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while preserving options to keep using fuels we know and love , ” she says .
“ Recycling carbon dioxide into fuels provides an attractive alternative to burying it . ”
Providing funding for Sunshine to Petrol is Sandia ’s internal Laboratory Directed Research and Development ( LDRD ) program .
The research has also attracted interest and some funding from DoD / DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) .
“ What ’s exciting about this invention is that it will result in fossil fuels being used at least twice , meaning less carbon dioxide being put into the atmosphere and a reduction of the rate that fossil fuels are pulled out of the ground , ” Diver says .
As an example , he says , coal would be burned at a clean coal power plant .
The carbon dioxide from the burning of the coal would be captured and reduced to carbon monoxide in the CR5 .
The carbon monoxide would then be the starting point of making gasoline , jet fuel , methanol , or almost any type of liquid fuel .
The prospect of a liquid fuel is significant because it fits in with the current gasoline and oil infrastructure .
After the synthesized fuel is made from the carbon monoxide , it could be transported through a pipeline or put in a truck and hauled to a gas station , just like gasoline refined from petroleum is now .
Plus it would work in ordinary gasoline and diesel engine vehicles .
Miller says that while the first step would be to capture the carbon dioxide from sources where it is concentrated — e.g. , power plants , smokestacks , and breweries — the ultimate goal would be to snatch it out of the air .
A S2P system that includes atmospheric carbon dioxide capture could produce carbon - neutral liquid fuels .
“ Our overall objective with this prototype is to demonstrate the practicality of the CR5 concept and to determine how test results from small - scale testing can be expanded to work in real devices , ” Miller says .
“ The design is conservative compared to what might eventually be developed . ”
Diver says the prototype should be completed by early next year .
He hand - built the precision device in a shop at Sandia ’s National Solar Thermal Test Facility and is now waiting on a few parts to finalize it .
Initial tests will break down water into hydrogen and oxygen .
That will be followed by tests that similarly break down carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and oxygen .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
" What do you call an economist with a prediction ?
Wrong . "
That was the headline of a Business Week column in late 1999 , just months before the 2000 dot - com crash .
Yes , wrong : Conservative supply - siders , balanced - budget centrists and liberal Keynesian stimulators , too .
All wrong !
And the 2000 to 2002 recession proved it .
Unfortunately , everybody thinks they 're an economist today , even politicians .
But they 're bad at it , too .
So we need to update the headline to fit the mortgage bailout and other quick - fix solutions to America 's problems .
First , the context : Fortune magazine recently put CEOs such as Citi's Prince and Merrill 's O'Neill under the microscope : " What Were They Smoking ? "
The best - and - brightest lost $ 165 billion , but exited rich , with hundreds of millions .
Now we need to ask guys like Paulson , Bernanke and their Beltway buddies : " What are you guys still smoking ? " Bailout ?
Freeze ?
Voluntary ?
They must be smoking hundred dollar bills from lobbyists because this government intervention scheme smells bad .
Why ?
Because all these solutions are being dreamed up by the same political and financial geniuses who got us into the problems in the first place .
The same guys who failed to act before the economy spun out of control .
Trusting those same guys makes absolutely no sense !
They were clueless going in .
They 're clueless about the solutions .
So , a new rule : " What do you call a politician with a prediction ?
Wrong ! "
Though you may disagree with Dick Cheney , this time he 's the only guy inside the Beltway who 's got it right .
Fortune says " the staunchly free - market Vice President can be expected to resist any impulse to soften the blow with government action . "
His position : " The markets work , and they are working . "
But unfortunately , Bush , Paulson , Bernanke and the Democrats are out - voting Cheney .
They 're all pushing government programs predicted to slow the record number of home foreclosures and " ease the damage from the housing recession , " as USAToday described the short - term goals .
What are they still smoking ?
Reminds me of Viking King Canute sitting on his throne at the shore commanding the tide to stop .
Folks , tides and recessions come and go .
And wishful - thinking , fairy - tale solutions wo n't stop the inevitable , any more than proclaiming this plan will " ease the damage of the recession , " but it 's " not a bailout , nor a silver bullet . "
So let 's step back and look at the facts objectively and rationally .
Let 's look at the 13 reasons why all the bailout fixes are just cosmetic PR that politicians and lobbyists spin for the masses , to gloss over Wall Street 's greed and stupidity during the latest bull run-up , while pandering to voter naiveté , undermining America 's long - term needs , and proving once again that our leaders cannot manage our nation effectively .
Here are 13 reasons :
1 . No bailout for sock puppets ... and not for junk mortgages
Remember all the shareholders who invested in Wall Street 's last fiasco , those bizarre , no-earnings , dot - com schemes like Pets.com and its cute sock puppet ?
Nobody bailed them out after the 2000 crash that triggered a 30 - month recession and wiped out $ 8 trillion in market - cap .
This time Washington 's just trying to salvage an out - of - control Wall Street .
2. U.S. dollar loses more credibility
Can it get worse ?
Yes , the dollar will sink lower .
Martin Feldman , former chairman of Reagan 's Council of Economic Advisers , recommends doing nothing in a Wall Street Journal OpEd piece : " Arbitrarily changing the terms of mortgages held by investors around the world would destroy the credibility of American private debt . "
But they 're doing it anyway .
They got greedy , sold junk .
Now people do n't trust us anymore .
3. Supply - side hypocrisy
It 's almost funny .
Supply - siders pretend to trust the free market to work out problems .
Yet the elite of the conservative free - market supply - siders on Wall Street , at the Federal Reserve and ( except for the Veep ) in the White House , pushed for and got government intervention to minimize mortgage credit losses created by Wall Street 's excessive greed .
4. PR stunt and photo - op
Washington knows this is just a PR photo - op pandering to Middle America 's fears .
But " it 's too little , too late and too voluntary " says a New York Times editorial .
" Only an estimated 250,000 borrowers , at best , will benefit " from the mortgage - rate freeze .
" From mid-2007 to now , some 800,000 have entered foreclosure .
From 2008 through mid-2010 ... there will be an estimated 3.5 million loan defaults . "
Free market politicians know it wo n't work .
5 . Undermines responsible mortgagees
Many worry the biggest losers may profit most , like speculators .
Even junk mortgagees who are able to pay excessive reset rates may get no breaks .
Moreover , the damage will spill - over to the tens of millions of responsible homeowners who are current on their mortgages .
Plus , they will be indirectly penalized ; for example , if they have to sell , they 'll compete against mortgagees getting bailout benefits and tax breaks in a down market .
6 . Taxpayer revolution coming
Wall Street got too greedy , made mega-billions .
The average managing director made $ 2.52 million repackaging mortgages .
Bubble pops .
Housing collapses .
Defaults .
Foreclosures .
Local revenues dropping .
Federal , too .
A Wall Street Journal editorial put it bluntly : " More than 95 % of homeowners are making payments on time , and they believe it is unfair to pay more taxes to assist those who 've been less responsible . "
Still , it 's happening and they 're angry .
Expect a rebellion .
This is Wall Street 's problem , not the taxpayers .
7. Déjà vu Spitzer and Enron
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has already subpoenaed Wall Street .
Next : Congress , the SEC and other state regulators will demand answers , such as why was Goldman shorting the SIVs they were selling , many of which quickly went into default ?
What did they fail to disclose ?
Sounds like a massive conflict of interest with major liabilities .
These hearings could drag on a long time , further undermining the international credibility of the dollar .
8. Washington was hiding the truth
As recently as August , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke both proclaimed that our subprime / credit problems were " contained . "
Then , suddenly , they were a " contagion " enflaming recession fears .
The truth : Both had the data long before August , and mislead us .
One is a former chief of a leading Wall Street bank packaging the SIVs .
The other is our Fed boss with a staff of thousands of economists and data - crunchers .
They knew the truth many months ago , and did nothing .
9. Washington 's priority ?
Wall Street
Remember , Paulson 's first response in August was not to help the two million subprime mortgage holders .
No , Paulson 's first response was to create a $ 100 billion bailout fund to help his old Wall Street cronies keep all those junk mortgage credits off their balance sheets .
More conflicts ?
You bet .
Enough to make Chris Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , threaten a formal investigation of Paulson .
10 . American economy unmanageable
Maybe America's $ 13 trillion economy is just too darn big and complex to understand , let alone manage .
Remember Bush Sr.'s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , Michael Boskin ?
He miscalculated U.S. tax revenues by $ 12 trillion a few years ago .
Remember the low - ball estimates of drug entitlements ?
Or the estimates on Iraq war costs ?
We 're in denial , unable to see or admit to -- let alone deal with -- big issues such as Social Security , until too late .
Worse , our political quick - fixes handicap future generations .
11 . Law of unintended consequences
Remember how everyone thought biofuels would make America oil - independent ?
Instead , feed prices shot up , and then the price of meat , as distribution costs soared .
Today , we know it was all payback to corporate agribusiness for campaign contributions .
Same here : Wall Street 's a huge campaign donor .
Too many unknowns can trigger blowback .
12 . Prolonging recession pain
Washington 's trapped in short - term solutions again , ignoring the future .
Rate freezes will drag out the recession , ultimately making it worse .
Property values will drop further , new home construction will be delayed , equity - to - mortgage ratios will fall , but the income of junk mortgage owners wo n't improve in a recession .
13 . America needs a good recession
Deep down , Washington and Wall Street know you can't stop the coming downturn .
Recessions are natural , inevitable , essential ; a positive way of cleaning out the excesses of a prior bull market .
So stop whining .
It will flush itself !
Stop fighting , go with the flow .
When I was at Morgan Stanley , the Dow was around 1000 .
We lived through the brutal 1970s recession .
We 've grown stronger through a few recessions since .
We 're now above 13,000 .
We 'll live through the 2008 - 2009 recession .
And we 'll come out even stronger .
I was reading some recent headlines about Yucca Mountain , claiming the federal government will face heavy penalties and judgments if the project is n’t finished .
Read beyond the headlines my friends , “ we ” fund the government , the money comes from our pockets , and it is n’t chicken feed .
The latest estimates are , that if Yucca Mountain is n’t finished until 2017 , “ we ” will owe the utilities an estimated $ 7 billion in penalties , provided by law , because the repository is n’t finished .
Bump completion time up another 3 years , and the bill goes up to about $ 11 billion .
When this repository thing started some 30 years ago , the feds agreed to dispose of spent fuel created by nuclear power stations .
I ’m sure there were some very good reasons for that decision , not the least of which retaining control over the stuff , which could fall into the wrong hands and become something very dangerous .
So the government and the nuclear industry agreed that if the repository was n’t finished by a certain date , the government would pay the power stations for having to store their own waste until it was completed .
Sweet deal , they create high - level , radioactive waste and taxpayers stand the expense of putting it away for millennia .
What that means Mr. and Mrs. taxpayer , and utility rate payer , is the federal government promised to have the Yucca Mountain repository finished ten years ago .
Each day that goes by , the ante goes up for the utilities , and if the project is scrubbed , then what , will the settlement option still be on the table until a repository is completed ?
Another 20 years maybe ?
Well shucks , why should n’t we help make the nuclear energy folks wealthy , after all , they ’re providing a service we ca n’t do without .
As a matter of fact , they want to build more facilities and create more waste .
You know what that means , “ we ” get stuck with providing a “ nuclear dump ” and they get paid if it is n’t ready .
This is a ludicrous situation at best .
Nevada does n’t want the thing and I doubt any state would want it , but every thing ’s gotta be somewhere , and since they ’ve dug a five mile long hole in the mountain , they might as well fill it up with nuclear waste as planned .
So every time Nevada Senator Harry Reid ( D - NV ) pressures Congress to dump Yucca , I wonder whose side he ’s really on .
Ward Sproat , director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management for the DOE , told me in a podcast interview ( Why Has It Taken So Long ? ) that nuclear utility rate payers are charged a fraction of a penny per kilowatt hour of electricity they use , to help fund construction of the Yucca Mountain repository .
That fund now stands at an estimated $ 21 billion , and Sproat told the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners that the project ’s budget is $ 400 million a year .
He is quoted as saying , “ we are never , ever going to build this repository with that kind of cash flow funding ; it just ai n’t going to happen . ”
He believes that over time , construction costs will rise to about $ 1 billion a year until , and if the project is completed .
Mr. Sproat also told me that he was required by law to send a report to Congress later this year , outlining the need for a second nuclear waste repository .
That ’s “ second ” , not a replacement for Yucca Mountain .
He said the report will go to congress with a recommendation that another site be chosen and developed .
My cynical nature makes me wonder if that $ 21 billion is even there anymore , considering the way our representatives have been throwing money at the war in Iraq and God only knows what other excuses have been used to raid the fund .
Could that be one of the reasons the budget is so low ?
Face it , “ we ” ( taxpayers and ratepayers ) are subsidizing nuclear facilities , as well as paying the going rate for service , and will continue to do so until either a repository is completed , or there ’s a major change in the law .
Of course proponents of nuclear power generation wo n’t have a problem with paying the extra dollars , after all , it ’s a part of doing business .
I think it ’s an abomination and it ’s time to get off the pot , tell Congress to set the wheels in motion to finish the Yucca Mountain project as soon as possible and get that stuff out of backyards in 39 states .
Yes , this is a reversal of my earlier comments on Yucca Mountain .
It took that interview with Mr. Sproat to wake me up to the reality of what ’s happening to the “ little guys and gals ” , you and me .
What do you think ?

There are a lot of arguments against waterboarding -- it is immoral , it is unreliable , it encourages in - kind reprisals , etc .
But for those who are unconvined by these moral or strategic reasons , at least think about this from a self - preservation perspective .
According to Darius Rejali , a professor at Reed College in Oregon and author of a new book , Torture and Democracy :
Waterboarding reached the U.S. via a circuitous route .
The Spanish exported the practice to the Philippines , which they colonized for centuries .
It was then adapted by U.S. forces there at the start of the 20th century and , eventually , adopted by some police forces in the U.S. NPR article .
.... many decommissioned solders , when they came back to the United States brought with them knowledge of these techniques .
When a soldier gets decommissioned end up becoming a policemen , many of these tortures appear then in the South especially as well as military prison lockups for conscientious objectors during World War I .
[ Second paragraph transcribed from All Things Considered 11/3/07 ]
One day , our tired and frustrated soldiers , national guardsmen , and Blackwater contractors will come home to become police officers , rent - a- cops , and crossing guards .
Do we want them to have memories of having tortured another human being and the knowledge that our society , through our silence , sanctioned such torture ?
There are some lines you cannot uncross .
Scientists have reprogrammed skin cells into various types of cells , including heart , muscle and brain tissue . *
Image : Cell Press *
In an unprecedented feat of biological alchemy , researchers have turned human skin cells into stem cells that hold the same medical promise as controversial embryonic stem cells .
Two teams of researchers – one led by Kyoto University 's Shinya Yamanaka , the other by the University of Wisconsin 's Junying
Yu – used a virus to add four new genes to skin cells .
Thus transformed , the reprogrammed cells became capable of changing into nearly any cell type in the human body .
Embryonic stem cells also have this ability , and may someday be used to cure degenerative diseases , grow new organs and even replace limbs .
" It 's a new era for stem cells , " said Robert Lanza , chief science officer of Advanced Cell Technologies , a cloning company in California .
" It 's the holy grail .
It 's like turning lead into gold . "
Scientists have hailed embryonic stem cells as one of the most promising research fields in medicine , saying they could lead to myriad therapies .
But currently , many stem cells are derived from embryos , which is a lightning rod issue that crosses political and religious lines .
The new technique could sidestep ethical issues involving the destruction of embryos and collection of human eggs .
If the new method proves successful , " we can disconnect the whole stem cell debate from the culture war , from battles over embryo politics and abortion rights , " said Marcy Darnovsky , associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society .
In a field accustomed to breathless proclamations of breakthroughs , the research – published Tuesday in two papers appearing in the journals Cell and Science – has provoked wonder among many scientists .
They say the advance is more significant to medical research than last week 's announcement that scientists had cloned the first monkey embryo .
Even Ian Wilmut of Dolly - the - sheep cloning fame said he 's abandoning cloning with the prospect of this new research .
The technique essentially reverts mature cells to an embryo - like state .
Normally , skin and other mature adult cells are locked into their biological fate .
Scientists say the cells have " differentiated . "
But in the new research , scientists added genes to mature cells that turned back their cellular clocks , or dedifferentiated them , restoring them to an immature , unprogrammed state .
" Nobody knows exactly what happens , but when we introduce the genes , it basically changes gene expression inside the cell , and that changes the fate of the skin cells , " Yu said .
" Some eventually turn into stem cells . "
Yamanaka and Yu say they must now learn to guide their cells ' development .
So far , the reprogrammed cells have been successfully turned into heart , muscle and brain tissue .
Embryonic stem cell research is a lightning rod issue that crosses political and religious lines .
Many anti-abortion activists oppose embryonic stem cell research , because it requires the destruction of four - day - old embryos .
Women 's health advocates protest because therapeutic cloning – one method of deriving embryonic stem cells – requires a supply of human eggs , and getting them relies on potentially risky hormone treatments .
President Bush 's first veto of his presidency was for a bill that would have expanded federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
In 2001 , he announced a strict plan for limiting government - funded research only to cells ( from pre-existing lines ) approved by the National Institutes of Health .
It does have some unlikely supporters , including conservatives like Sens. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) and Arlen Specter ( R - Pennsylvania ) support embryonic stem cell research , saying an embryo so young and existing only in a petri dish is not yet a human life .
Lanza of Advanced Cell Technologies tempered his enthusiasm for the new technique with a warning that it's too soon to know whether cell reprogramming will provide medical benefits .
" This is early - stage research .
We should not abandon other areas of stem cell research .
It 's by no means certain they 'll differentiate in the same way as a normal embryonic stem cell , " he said .
Because adding new genes may cause unsafe mutations , the researchers must also figure out how to make the new genes delete themselves during cellular division .
But they believe the hardest part is behind them .
" It could take years , but compared to identifying the deprogamming genes , we consider this much less of a problem , " said Yu .

The aforementioned presidential candidate is Dennis Kucinich .
Democracy reveres fairness and equality , but in America it 's the rich candidates who get to advertise , and unlike presumed front runners Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards , Kucinich refuses corporate donations .
( Edit : John Edwards gets most of his money from lawyers , Democrats , retired , securities and investment , and real estate . )
34 of the 50 states are holding their Democratic primaries either next month or in February .
Think American voters deserve to hear more about Kucinich soon ?
Well , there 's a massive one - day donation on December 15 to help Kucinich be heard more broadly across America , and you can be a part of it : http://www.december152007.com .
The following press release explains the event in detail .
DENNIS KUCINICH GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION AIMS TO SHATTER ONE-DAY FUNDRAISING RECORD WITH $ 10,000,000 DECEMBER 15TH
" Money Bombs " the key to successful campaigning for bold candidates .
Los Angeles , Ca. ( December 3 , 2007 ) – Grassroots supporters of Dennis Kucinich have organized an ambitious $ 10,000,000 one - day fundraiser " Money Bomb " designed to shatter the previous record of $ 4,200,000 .
Kucinich supporters are mobilizing for December 15th , the date of the first Kucinich Money Bomb .
" Our goal is ambitious , " said William Scott Hunter , the organizer of December 152007.com , " but it has to be in order to have the impact Kucinich deserves .
In America , candidates are considered ‘ electable ’ or ‘ unelectable ’ based on their bank accounts .
It ’s pretty hard to argue that a guy who can raise $ 10,000,000 in one day is unelectable . "
December152007.com is all about grassroots support .
Hunter says he would prefer to collect money from individual donors , rather than corporate interests .
" We want our fundraising to come from Americans , not special interests .
Dennis is n’t going to get elected by corporations – he ’s going to get elected by people . "
With all of the focus on big money , Hunter wants to focus attention on the voters .
" A corporation can coordinate the bundling of contributions totaling amounts much larger than what the average American can match – but there ’s one thing they can’t contribute : votes .
We like to think that each of our donations comes with the most important contribution : a vote . "
With people signing up around the clock , Kucinich ’s Money Bomb is shaping up to be more successful than Democratic front - runner Barack Obama ’s , whose recent attempt raised a paltry $ 4,600 .
" Kucinich is the real deal – a Democrat who will lead and put Americans first .
There ’s a reason he ’s been winning poll after poll after poll . "
December152007.com looks to capitalize on Kucinich ’s popularity at social news sites such as Digg.com and Reddit.com , where thousands of supporters get their news .
" If we succeed , it will be because of the excellent infrastructure that Kucinich supporters have built on sites like Reddit and MySpace , " says Hunter .
" The key is to get the word out .
If you want change in Washington , Dennis is your candidate .
He ’s only a long shot if you let him be . "
The date , December 15th , is symbolic .
December 15th , 1791 was the date that the Bill of Rights became law .
In the current political climate , where the Constitution is treated as a nuisance by our elected leaders , there is no better time to reflect on the meaning and significance of that precious document .
" We need a leader who respects our tradition of laws – Dennis ’ voting record , policies and statements consistently show his commitment to true American values , " said Hunter .
December152007.com plans to build support through mailing lists and social networks in the next two weeks .
When the big day comes , it will be as simple as logging onto the site for an easy guide to making a contribution .
" We ’ve seen in the past how Money Bombs can affect morale and news coverage .
Overnight , Ron Paul went from nowhere to a front - runner in the Republican election .
Dennis already has the politics for victory – now he just needs the money and the exposure . "

Facebook CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP )  President Hugo Chavez urged supporters to approve constitutional changes that he said could keep him in power for life and threatened to cut off oil exports to the United States if it tries to meddle in Sunday 's vote .
Speaking to more than 200,000 supporters on Friday , Chavez warned that his opponents at home could try to sabotage the vote with backing from Washington through violent protests on the night of the vote .
POWER PLAY : Venezuelan leader has echoes of Castro " If ' yes ' wins on Sunday and the Venezuelan oligarchy , the violent Venezuelans — the ones who play the ( U.S. ) empire 's game — unleash violence with the tale that there was fraud ... minister , that very Monday you order a halt to the shipments of oil to the United States , " Chavez said , addressing his oil minister , Rafael Ramirez .
" Oil will not go out to the United States , " Chavez said , warning the opposition if they take to streets to deny a legitimate victory , " they 're going to regret it . "
Venezuela was the fourth largest oil exporter to the United States in 2006 .
Chavez dismissed Venezuelans who oppose the constitutional changes as beholden to U.S. interests .
" Anyone who votes ' No ' is voting for George W. Bush , " he said .
" Our real enemy is called the U.S. empire , and on Sunday , Dec. 2 , we 're going to give another knockout to Bush , so no one forgets that is the battlefield . "
Chavez 's opponents have called for close monitoring of results in what they expect to be a tight contest , raising tensions ahead of a vote on sweeping changes that would left Chavez seek re-election in 2012 and indefinitely .
His opponents have called for close monitoring of results in what they expect to be a tight contest , raising tensions ahead of a vote on sweeping changes to the constitution that would left Chavez seek re-election in 2012 and indefinitely .
" If God gives me life and help , " Chavez said , " I will be at the head of the government until 2050 ! " — when he would be 95 years old .
" To the Venezuelan oligarchy and the U.S. empire , from here I 'm warning them that they wo n't be able to stop the car of the Bolivarian Revolution , because on Sunday we will approve the constitutional reform , " Chavez said .
There were no independent crowd estimates , but reporters estimated the crowd at more than 200,000 .
The government cites polls showing Chavez leading ahead of the referendum , while other polls have predicted a close race .
Pollster Luis Vicente Leon , whose firm Datanalisis found the " no " option leading in a poll earlier this month , said Friday that two other later tracking polls by his firm found Chavez had closed the gap and the two sides were statistically about even .
" We do n't know who 's going to win , " Leon said .
" The result will depend on the level of abstention that ends up happening .
Whoever has the greatest weight to achieve turnout among their voters at the polls is going to win . "
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States hopes the referendum will be " a free and fair contest in which the will and desire of the Venezuelan people is reflected . "
Speaking to the crowd from a stage , Chavez said : " Venezuela is going to be a world power , no matter whom it hurts ! "
The pro-Chavez rally came a day after opposition supporters filled the same avenue promising to defeat revisions that would also extend presidential terms from six to seven years , create new forms of communal property and expand Chavez 's powers to reshape Venezuela as a socialist state .
" Chavez has become a father for us , " said Xiomi Diaz , a 34 - year - old farmer .
" He 's a father of the poor . "
She and others traveled from across the country in hundreds of buses , and chanted : " Ooh , Ah ! Chavez is n't going anywhere ! "
Chavez , who was first elected in 1998 , denies he is trying to amass power , saying the changes are necessary to give the people a greater voice in government and to move toward a socialist system .
Human Rights
Watch warned the reforms would threaten fundamental rights , citing one revision allowing the president to declare indefinite states of emergency during which the government could detain citizens without charge and censor the media .
" These amendments would enable President Chavez to suspend basic rights indefinitely by maintaining a perpetual state of emergency , " said Jose Miguel Vivanco of the New York - based group .
Chavez 's opponents also have questioned the National Electoral Council 's impartiality , especially after Chavez named its former chief , Jorge Rodriguez , as his vice president in January .
But in contrast to past elections , when the opposition has boycotted votes or been split on whether to participate , this time many opposition leaders are emboldened and urging voters to turn out in large numbers .
University students have led protests and occasionally clashed with police and Chavista groups .
One man was shot dead Monday while trying to get through a road blocked by protesters .
The opposition also has been heartened by some recent defections from Chavez 's movement , including former Defense Minister Gen. Raul Baduel .
Even Chavez 's ex-wife , Marisabel Rodriguez , has urged Venezuelans to vote " no . "
About 100 electoral observers from 39 countries in Latin America , Europe and the United States are on hand , plus hundreds of Venezuelan observers , the National Electoral Council said .
Yet , absent this time are the Organization of American States and the European Union , which have monitored past votes .
Among those attending are observers from the National Lawyers Guild and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Chavez 's opponents have been suspicious of electronic voting machines made by Boca Raton , Florida - based Smartmatic Inc. , which is primarily owned by three Venezuelans .
But Luis Enrique Lander of the Venezuelan vote - monitoring group Ojo Electoral said his team is satisfied with vote preparations and safeguards .
Chavez also threatened to expel journalists for the CNN international news network if they assisted in any plot to overthrow his government .
If CNN " came here to lend its correspondents to an imperialist operation , they will be thrown from the country , " Chavez said .
On Tuesday , he accused the network of promoting his assassination , after CNN en Espanol aired a picture of him and his Colombian counterpart Alvaro Uribe with the words " And who killed him ? " superimposed .
CNN said the airing , which lasted a few seconds , was a mistake , and the text corresponded to another news item that had nothing to do with the presidents ' images .

So I wrote this :
You may have noticed that there are a whole bunch of " celebrity poker " shows on television these days , where a group of famous people sit around playing cards and being snarky at each other , and they film the whole thing .
I can't imagine too many things more boring than watching someone else play cards , but I guess fishing has a rich TV history too ...
Anyway , I have an idea , and hopefully one of my many readers in the entertainment industry will make it a reality :
Celebrity Dungeons and Dragons .
I want to see a TV show where the flying camera crane zips around the table where Wil Wheaton , Puff Daddy , Michael Madsen , and Lindsay Lohan play D&D.
I would totally watch that .
" Yo , I 'm - a gonna get all up in that orc 's face with my Magic Missile .
Jack you up , orc ! "
Then then announcers banter , " oh , Magic Missle !
A bold choice , he might need that later .
Here comes the roll ... "
It would be GLORIOUS .

The Always Africa Campaign : The Red Tent Sisters Weigh In
There ’s been an Always ad on television lately regarding how “ girls living in sub-Saharan Africa can miss up to four days of school each month because they lack the basic necessity of sanitary protection and other resources to manage their periods . ”
Apparently , Always maxi pads aims to do something about this .
This struck me as an odd initiative , but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went online to hunt down the P&G ( Always ’ parent company ) news release on the subject :
According to research , 1 in 10 school - age African girls do not attend school during menstruation or drop out at puberty because of the lack of clean and private sanitation facilities in schools .
And , if a girl has no access to protective materials or if the materials she has are unreliable and cause embarrassment , she may be forced to stay at home while menstruating .
This absence of approximately 4 days every 4 weeks may result in the girl missing 10 to 20 percent of her school days .
The Protecting Futures program will provide products and services to help keep girls in school as well as help foster the overall health and well - being of every child in the targeted school communities .
The bloggers at Red Tent Sisters ( a fantastic Toronto - based business dedicated to serving the reproductive and sexual health needs of women ) weigh in on the Always campaign , its pros and cons : 1 ) I think it ’s great that they ’re going to be improving the sanitation facilities , providing nutritious feeding programs [ using local , sustainable food sources ? ] , and providing health support .
2 ) I do n’t have a problem with education and hopefully increasing openness about women ’s reproductive and sexual health but I do have concerns about mainstream menstrual product companies doing it !
Ellen Macro , the resident blogger at Red Tent Sisters , continues on to share the following concerns : 3 ) If only 1/10 girls miss school , what are the other 9/10 doing already ?
4 ) Not only is P&G going to “ help ” the 1/10 girls but they are probably going to influence the other girls who already have sustainable methods of “ managing ” their menses .
5 ) P&G is going to make all / most girls reliant on imported products which cost money , drain resources , pollute the environment when produced and create a nightmare for disposal .
The blog entry is certainly worth a read because it explores “ the whole question of it being a BAD thing that young women are missing some time from school during their menstruation ” and suggests “ a world in which women ’s cycles are honoured and respected . ”

One day last December , a Brooklyn prosecutor called the Police Department laboratory to check on a test of drugs that had been seized six weeks earlier .
The drugs were nowhere to be found in the laboratory .
As officials hunted for the evidence in that case , they made a startling discovery :
The drugs seized in 42 other arrests made in Brooklyn that same day , Oct. 20 , 2006 , also had vanished without a trace .
In short , all the evidence from every narcotics arrest in Brooklyn that day was gone .
“ A search was conducted , disclosing that an entire bundle of narcotics , 43 in total , which should have been submitted to the laboratory for examination was not present , ” Dr. Peter Pizzola , the director of the laboratory , wrote in a letter in April to an organization that oversees forensic laboratories .
“ Additionally , all paperwork associated with this delivery was also missing . ”
Despite an inquiry that began over a year ago , officials still cannot say whether the drugs were lost , stolen or thrown away .
Investigators believe that a police officer serving as a courier took several large plastic bags of drugs as far as the laboratory .
There , the trail goes cold .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
Pingpong helped thaw relations between China and the United States more than three decades ago .
Now the catalyst of that thaw wonders whether music can do the same for the U.S. and North Korea .
Zhuang Zedong shows the Time magazine cover from April 26 , 1971 , with the U.S. table tennis team in China .
Zhuang Zedong , a three - time world champion in table tennis , also known as pingpong , faced a quandary one April day 37 years ago .
He was sitting at the back of his Chinese team 's bus , waiting to drive to the stadium during the 1971 world championship in Japan .
Perhaps by mistake , a longhaired athlete got on the bus with the Chinese team .
When the door closed and he turned around , the Chinese noticed the three letters on the back of the athlete 's uniform : USA .
Glenn Cowan , a 19 - year - old Santa Monica College student , sat in the packed bus for 10 minutes and no one dared talk to him .
" We were all tense , " Zhuang recalls .
" Our team had been advised not to speak to Americans , not to shake their hands , and not to exchange gifts with them . "
Zhuang did n't want to get into trouble , but he thought snubbing the American went against China 's tradition of hospitality .
For about 10 minutes , he considered his options .
Do n't Miss Philharmonic arrives in North Korea
" I looked at him , thinking , 'he is not the one who makes national policies , he is just an athlete , an ordinary American ' , " he recalls .
Defying political correctness , he walked up to Cowan and struck a conversation through a translator .
He even gave the hippie - looking American silk brocade as a gift .
The next day , Cowan gave him a T - shirt emblazoned with a peace sign and the words " LET IT BE . "
Pictures of the meeting were all over the papers the next day .
Soon , the news reached Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing .
" Zhuang Zedong is not only good at pingpong , he is good at diplomacy too , " Mao reportedly remarked .
Later that night , he ordered the Foreign Ministry to invite the American team to China .
Days later , in the midst of the Cold War and the Vietnam War , Cowan and 14 companions visited Beijing .
The team , accompanied by a gaggle of American reporters , was treated royally .
During their visit , the U.S. announced the end of a 20 - year trade embargo against the People 's Republic .
Their journey turned out to be the first public move in a rapprochement between the two bitter enemies .
" The ping heard round the world , " Time magazine intoned in its cover story .
" Probably never before in history has a sport been used so effectively as a tool of international diplomacy . "
President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 , and relations between the two countries were normalized in 1979 .
" Chairman Mao used the small ball to push a big ball forward , " Zhuang gushes .
Zhuang , 68 , is now retired .
His hair is balding but he remains energetic and quick - witted .
The legendary paddler is often invited to give speeches on career - building and the history of diplomacy .
He says he never thought his simple gestures of friendship would start what is now known as " pingpong diplomacy . "
" I had no idea what was going on , " he tells CNN .
" I did n't know what Chairman Mao was thinking .
I was merely a pingpong player . "
He says he simply created the opening for Chairman Mao to finesse his geopolitical strategy for China to break out of its isolation .
The New York Philharmonic this week is traveling to Pyongyang to perform and perhaps help thaw the icy relations between the U.S. and North Korea .
A variation of pingpong diplomacy , perhaps ?
" It makes sense , and it's a good thing , " Zhuang says as he flips through the April 1971 cover story of Time , which chronicled the U.S. pingpong team 's visit to China .
He believes even the worst of enemies can build up friendship through engagement .
" Sports and trade can break down diplomatic walls , " he says .
" So can music . "
Zhuang hopes North Korea can pick up a few pointers from China 's experience .
" I hope the North Koreans can reform their theory and adapt with the changes in the world . "
He says China used to face similar challenges : China and the U.S. used to be bitter enemies , and China used to be diplomatically isolated and economically decrepit .
" But as China 's economy developed , " he says , " we have also made friends with other countries and we started to gain their respect .
We now have a win-win relationship with America . "
Much credit , he says , goes to the pingpong diplomacy that he unwittingly kicked off that fateful day in April 1971 .

All About North Korea • China
A Boston police officer filed a federal lawsuit yesterday asserting that a state trooper slapped him and dragged him at least 150 feet with his cruiser during a dispute outside TD Banknorth Garden in 2006 .
Edward J. MacPherson , a 20 - year veteran of the Boston police force , said in the civil rights suit that Trooper Robert Grover attacked him for allegedly failing to keep traffic moving as MacPherson worked a paid detail during a Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert .
He said Grover bumped him with his cruiser , slapped him in the face , and knocked his police hat off , and then dragged him as MacPherson 's arm was wedged in the window , causing him to lose his handcuffs , police radio , and the ammunition clip in his gun .
" Here 's a police officer on duty , " MacPherson 's lawyer , Peter T. Marano of Boston , said of his client last evening in an interview .
" He can probably rationalize a bad guy trying to hurt him .
How do you rationalize someone in a police cruiser and a uniform trying to do that to you ? "
MacPherson was taken to a hospital afterward with injuries to his left shoulder , arm , and back .
He was out of work for several months after the confrontation , which drew little news coverage , and suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder , his lawyer said .
Marano said the State Police subsequently held a court martial for Grover .
He said he did not know the outcome , but added that Grover is no longer employed by the State Police .
Sergeant Robert Bousquet , a State Police spokesman , said Grover has retired , and he did not know whether the episode with MacPherson was a factor .
Bousquet said he could not comment on whether Grover was subjected to a court martial because such proceedings are personnel matters .
The episode began shortly after MacPherson arrived at Causeway and Beverly streets at 10:25 p.m. on June 26 , 2006 , to help pedestrians cross and to keep traffic flowing , according to the suit .
He was working outside his cruiser .
Grover , who was assigned to the State Police Marine Unit around the corner on Beverly Street , drove up in a cruiser while wearing a T - shirt and shorts and told MacPherson that limousines were blocking the area and to move them , the suit said .
MacPherson told him he would take care of it .
The trooper and police officer then argued , and Grover threatened to arrest MacPherson , the suit said .
Grover then got out of his car , walked up to MacPherson , and slapped him in the hand .
When MacPherson warned Grover not to touch him again , the trooper allegedly replied , " I 'll be back , pal , " then sped off in his cruiser .
About 20 minutes later , MacPherson was directing traffic when Grover , now in uniform , sped in his cruiser directly at MacPherson , the suit said .
The cruiser skidded to a stop but bumped MacPherson , knocking him back several feet .
After MacPherson went to the window , Grover slapped him in the face , MacPherson said in the suit .
MacPherson reached into the car and grabbed Grover 's shirt , but the trooper gripped MacPherson 's arm and stepped on the accelerator , dragging him down the street until the police officer fell to the ground .
Grover and several other troopers tried to place MacPherson in handcuffs , but stopped after several Boston officers arrived , said Marano .
No charges were filed .
MacPherson 's lawsuit names Grover , the State Police , and several State Police officials as defendants .
The complaint alleges that Grover had a history of misconduct that his employer covered up .

You can read Romney 's full speech here or watch it on his website here .
As an atheist and a father of three young children , the speech Mitt Romney delivered at the George H. W. Bush presidential library today shocked me to my core .
If this is the drift of this country , towards a politics that explicitly excludes my standing as a worthy citizen because I do not believe in one of the major monotheistic religions , Christianity , Judaism or Islam , then I seriously do not know what I will do to sustain for myself , and instill in my children , the strong sense of belonging that I currently feel as a citizen .
I cherish my country ; I cherish our history , our laws and our principles , including the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights , guaranteeing freedom of speech and the separation of church and state .
As a non-believer who believes that it is this life which matters , my sense of morality is inextricably tied to my sense of belonging as a citizen .
Indeed , this sense of belonging runs deep .
I consider myself to be unavoidably emeshed in the concerns of my fellow - citizens ( as well as , more broadly , the concerns of all of the people on this planet ) .
That is my challenge and my inspiration as I try to live my life well , and guide my children to do the same .
In the speech he gave today , Romney threatened to take part of my core identity away from me .
This is a direct quotation from his speech :
" Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .
Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God.
Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone . "
Although he addressed the speech to all Americans , he was not talking to me when he gave this speech .
Romney made it perfectly clear that as President he would represent non-believers like me with reluctance at best .
We do not fit into his idea of Americans ; we are an after - thought .
If the two political parties in this country are headed towards the conclusion that , as an atheist , I am not a true American , then my family and I will , in effect , be sent into political exile .
For me ( as for the ancient Athenians , who also valued political partipation as a part of the core of a person 's identity ) , exile robs life of its meaning .
Romney , unwittingly or not , for reasons of political expediency or not , threatened me with political -- and therefore , for a non-believer , spiritual -- exile in his speech today .
My first reaction , upon reading the words of the speech , was to feel my heart beating faster , as if I was facing a threat to the safety of my family .
It 's strange how our bodys ' survival instincts , buried deep in our brains , warn us before we even have time to reflect on why .
My second reaction is to redouble my commitment to working for a future where , some day , Romney 's view on the central place of religion in American life is considered a relic of a time when a great country , founded on the basis of equal consideration for all people , was held in thrall to a destructive , exclusionary myth called " faith . "
POLICE are on the lookout for a bungling arsonist who tried to torch a Wigan nightclub - but ended up setting fire to himself .
Police have released footage showing the moped - riding arsonist arrive outside the Decibel nightclub in Atherton and splashing petrol on its door .
He then threw a lit petrol bomb at the entrance but in the process set fire to his own arm .
He struggled for several moments to extinguish the flames before riding off in the direction of Smith Street .
The incident happened outside the Market Street venue last Saturday at 4am .
Flames
Although no - one else was injured , the club 's front door was damaged .
Sgt Dave Johnston , of Atherton police , said the attack could have claimed the life of the inept crook and others .
He said : " This was a reckless and dangerous act which could easily have claimed the life of the offender .
" However , he managed to extinguish the flames and slowly left the scene , probably in some pain .
" We want to know if anyone recognises the biker , or his motorbike .
Also , does anyone remember someone coming home that night possibly smelling of petrol or with singed clothing ? "
Witnesses are asked to call police on 0161 872 5050 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 .

Newswise — Ohio State University geologists and their colleagues have uncovered evidence of when Earth may have first supported an oxygen - rich atmosphere similar to the one we breathe today .
The study suggests that upheavals in the earth 's crust initiated a kind of reverse - greenhouse effect 500 million years ago that cooled the world 's oceans , spawned giant plankton blooms , and sent a burst of oxygen into the atmosphere .
That oxygen may have helped trigger one of the largest growths of biodiversity in Earth 's history .
Matthew Saltzman , associate professor of earth sciences at Ohio State , reported the findings Sunday at the meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver .
For a decade , he and his team have been assembling evidence of climate change that occurred 500 million years ago , during the late Cambrian period .
They measured the amounts of different chemicals in rock cores taken from around the world , to piece together a complex chain of events from the period .
Their latest measurements , taken in cores from the central United States and the Australian outback , revealed new evidence of a geologic event called the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion ( SPICE ) .
Amounts of carbon and sulfur in the rocks suggest that the event dramatically cooled Earth 's climate over two million years -- a very short time by geologic standards .
Before the event , the Earth was a hothouse , with up to 20 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the present day .
Afterward , the planet had cooled and the carbon dioxide had been replaced with oxygen .
The climate and atmospheric composition would have been similar to today .
" If we could go back in time and walk around in the late Cambrian , this seems to be the first time we would have felt at home , " Saltzman said .
" Of course , there was no life on land at the time , so it would n't have been all that comfortable . "
The land was devoid of plants and animals , but there was life in the ocean , mainly in the form of plankton , sea sponges , and trilobites .
Most of the early ancestors of the plants and animals we know today existed during the Cambrian , but life was n't very diverse .
Then , during the Ordovician period , which began around 490 million years ago , many new species sprang into being .
The first coral reefs formed during that time , and the first true fish swam among them .
New plants evolved and began colonizing land .
" If you picture the evolutionary ' tree of life , ' most of the main branches existed during the Cambrian , but most of the smaller branches did n't get filled in until the Ordovician , " Saltzman said .
" That 's when animal life really began to develop at the family and genus level . "
Researchers call this diversification the " Ordovician radiation . "
The composition of the atmosphere has changed many times since , but the pace of change during the Cambrian is remarkable .
That 's why Saltzman and his colleagues refer to this sudden influx of oxygen during the SPICE event as a " pulse " or " burst . "
" After this pulse of oxygen , the world remained in an essentially stable , warm climate , until late in the Ordovician , " Saltzman said .
He stopped short of saying that the oxygen - rich atmosphere caused the Ordovician radiation .
" We know that oxygen was released during the SPICE event , and we know that it persisted in the atmosphere for millions of years -- during the time of the Ordovician radiation -- so the timelines appear to match up .
But to say that the SPICE event triggered the diversification is tricky , because it's hard to tell exactly when the diversification started , " he said .
" We would need to work with paleobiologists who understand how increased oxygen levels could have led to a diversification .
Linking the two events precisely in time is always going to be difficult , but if we could link them conceptually , then it would become a more convincing story . "
Researchers have been trying to understand the sudden climate change during the Cambrian period ever since Saltzman found the first evidence of the SPICE event in rock in the American west in 1998 .
Later , rock from a site in Europe bolstered his hypothesis , but these latest finds in central Iowa and Queensland , Australia , prove that the SPICE event occurred worldwide .
During the Cambrian period , most of the continents as we know them today were either underwater or part of the Gondwana supercontinent , Saltzman explained .
Tectonic activity was pushing new rock to the surface , where it was immediately eaten away by acid rain .
Such chemical weathering pulls carbon dioxide from the air , traps the carbon in sediments , and releases oxygen -- a kind of greenhouse effect in reverse .
" From our previous work , we knew that carbon was captured and oxygen was released during the SPICE event , but we did n't know for sure that the oxygen stayed in the atmosphere , " Saltzman said .
They compared measurements of inorganic carbon -- captured during weathering -- with organic carbon -- produced by plankton during photosynthesis .
And because plankton contain different ratios of the isotopes of carbon depending on the amount of oxygen in the air , the geologists were able to double - check their estimates of how much oxygen was released during the period , and how long it stayed in the atmosphere .
They also studied isotopes of sulfur , to determine whether much of the oxygen being produced was re-captured by sediments .
It was n't .
Saltzman explained the chain of events this way : Tectonic activity led to increased weathering , which pulled carbon dioxide from the air and cooled the climate .
Then , as the oceans cooled to more hospitable temperatures , the plankton prospered -- and in turn created more oxygen through photosynthesis .
" It was a double whammy , " he said .
" There 's really no way around it when we combine the carbon and sulfur isotope data -- oxygen levels dramatically rose during that time . "
What can this event tell us about climate change today ?
" Oxygen levels have been stable for the last 50 million years , but they have fluctuated over the last 500 million , " Saltzman said .
" We showed that the oxygen burst in the late Cambrian happened over only two million years , so that is an indication of the sensitivity of the carbon cycle and how fast things can change . "
Global cooling may have boosted life early in the Ordovician period , but around 450 million years ago , more tectonic activity -- most likely , the rise of the Appalachian Mountains -- brought on a deadly ice age .
So while most of the world 's plant and animal species were born during the Ordovician period , by the end of it , more than half of them had gone extinct .

Anti-depressants may not be as effective as patients -- and doctors -- believe .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Patients and doctors alike may have received some fuzzy truth about the effectiveness of antidepressant medication .
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal , many studies have found that best - selling antidepressants like Wyeth 's Effexor and Pfizer 's Zoloft may have little or even no effect on patients .
Many of those studies , though submitted to the Food and Drug Administration , were left unpublished .
Researchers accordingly suggested in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine that doctors and patients may not have been able to see the full antidepressant picture .
Both Pfizer ( PFE , Fortune 500 ) and Wyeth ( WYE , Fortune 500 ) told The Wall Street Journal that they will disclose all study results , but they will not necessarily publish them in medical journals .
The FDA does not require pharmaceutical companies to publish the studies that they sponsor , which leaves many studies unpublished .
Separately , 74 studies involving 12 antidepressant drugs were submitted to the FDA between 1987 and 2004 , 38 of which the FDA called " positive . "
Though all but one of the " positive " studies were published , only 14 of the 36 " negative " studies were printed in medical journals .
But even with the large disparity of reports that the pharmaceutical companies published , not all of the negative stories were all that " negative . "
According to the NEJM researchers , at least 11 of the 14 " negative " studies presented unfavorable findings as beneficial ones by highlighting positive secondary outcomes and ignoring negative primary results .
The New England Journal of Medicine researchers believe this " publication bias " can complicate doctors ' understanding of the effectiveness of medications .
For instance , when considering all of the studies ' data , the researchers found that Zoloft only has a " small " effect on patients as opposed to the " medium " effect that the mostly - positive results had shown .

There ’s a lot of buzz about Steve Yegge ’s “ port ” of Rails to JavaScript , and Steve has now provided ( in his funny , self - deprecating style ) the background of how it came to be .
He does n’t quite say it explicitly in this post , but I think it reveals that the “ Next Big Language ” he has been hinting at is JavaScript .
I ( mostly ) agree :
JavaScript is in nearly every browser , including tiny ones ( like the one in my BlackBerry Pearl ) .
It may be the single most widely available language today .
Because of the above , an enormous population of JavaScript programmers ( though sometimes of dubious skill ) has emerged .
Starting with Java 6 it ’s “ in the box ” there also .
To me , this makes it the likely winner , by a wide margin , for a dynamic language to be used at Java shops or inside Java projects .
Being “ in the box ” is a powerful advantage , one which the many other contenders will have a hard time overcoming .
Adobe ’s new JavaScript virtual machine implementation , which they handed over to Mozilla as “ Tamarin ” , sounds like it will boost JavaScript performance great , making it good enough for a very wide variety of projects .
JavasScript uses curly braces , like the last few Big Languages .
Like Java , C , C++ , etc. , JavaScript has specs and multiple competing , complete , current , high quality implementations .
This , to me , is a big advantage over Ruby , Python , and other currently popular dynamic languages .
Of course there is plenty of room in the industry for these language to thrive also , I am not saying any of them will go away ; we use Python with great results and expect to keep doing so .
Mark Volkmann initially thought I was nuts to predict JavaScript as a winner but came around a few month later ( and said so in a user group talk ) .
In a project at work , we ’d adopted JavaScript as our plugin extension language for user - customizable rules ( billing rules , etc. ) .
I ’d have chosen Lua ( as I did for another project ) , but there are at least 1000 x as many JavaScript programs out there .
So far it has worked very well .
If we had it to do over we might implement far more of the project in JavaScript .
However , there are a few reasons why I only “ mostly ” agree :
First , with JavaScript there is n’t a good way to avoid shipping source code .
Sure , you an obfuscate JavaScript with various tools , but the results remains far for amenable to readable - source recovery than in a more traditionally compiled language .
For open source projects this is no big deal , but there are also many worthwhile businesses and projects which depend on proprietary , not open software ( including most of our projects ) , and it ’s not year clear that obfuscation is sufficient protection .
( Update in reply to a comment below :
This matters even for server - side software , because some of us create and sell software products for other people to run on their servers . )
Second , at the moment JavaScript appears to lack a module system , without which it ’s painful to build large systems .
I expect an upcoming language version will address this .
Self - financing facts
Mark floated the notion this morning that Clinton would self - finance , and Marc reports that they 're considering taking a loan .
I 've got no news for you -- though it 's been a few hours , and the campaign still has n't answered my question on it -- but here 's a little data .
First , the Clintons are n't Bloomberg , or even John Kerry .
They also have two expensive households to run and lives to lead .
But they may have more money than people think .
Money Magazine reported that Bill earned $ 41 million in speaking fees in the first six years of his post - presidency , and estimated their net worth at $ 34 million , though other estimates are much lower .
And the Wall Street Journal reported that he could be due up to $ 20 million from severing his ties with Ron Burkle , whose Yucaipa fund he advised .
It 's a transaction that would merit a second look if they decide to self - fund .
So even after taxes , and after recent stock losses , they may be able to put enough money in to make a difference .
At some point , then , Bill Clinton may regret saying this in Iowa :
They say you could n’t stop me from spending all the money I ’ve saved over the last five years on Hillary ’s campaign if I wanted to , even though it would clearly violate the spirit of campaign finance reform .
“ Even though I approved of Afghanistan and opposed Iraq from the beginning , ” said Clinton , “ I still resent that I was not asked or given the opportunity to support those soldiers . ” [ digg-reddit-me ]
So Bill Clinton said yesterday in Iowa .
Most people – myself included – were under the impression that the former president supported the Iraq war .
Perhaps it was items like the one below that led me to such conclusions .
Most of the commenters on this have concluded that Bill Clinton is trying to rewrite history .
But parsing Clinton ’s statements reveals something else .
He made statements again and again that would lead any reasonable observer to believe he supported the invasion , but on closer examination , it depends on what your definition of is is .
In an interview with Time magazine in June 2004 , Bill Clinton was asked if President Bush was right to invade Iraq .
You know , I have repeatedly defended President Bush against the left on Iraq , even though I think he should have waited until the U.N. inspections were over .
I do n’t believe he went in there for oil .
We did n’t go in there for imperialist or financial reasons .
We went in there because he bought the Wolfowitz - Cheney analysis that the Iraqis would be better off , we could shake up the authoritarian Arab regimes in the Middle East , and our leverage to make peace between the Palestinians and Israelis would be increased .
At the moment the U.N. inspectors were kicked out in ’ 98 , this is the proper language : there were substantial quantities of botulinum and aflatoxin , as I recall , some bioagents , I believe there were those , and VX and ricin , chemical agents , unaccounted for .
Keep in mind , that ’s all we ever had to work on .
We also thought there were a few missiles , some warheads , and maybe a very limited amount of nuclear laboratory capacity .
After 9/11 , let ’s be fair here , if you had been President , you ’d think , Well , this fellow bin Laden just turned these three airplanes full of fuel into weapons of mass destruction , right ?
Arguably they were super - powerful chemical weapons .
Think about it that way .
So , you ’re sitting there as President , you ’re reeling in the aftermath of this , so , yeah , you want to go get bin Laden and do Afghanistan and all that .
But you also have to say , Well , my first responsibility now is to try everything possible to make sure that this terrorist network and other terrorist networks cannot reach chemical and biological weapons or small amounts of fissile material .
I ’ve got to do that .
That ’s why I supported the Iraq thing .
There was a lot of stuff unaccounted for .
So I thought the President had an absolute responsibility to go to the U.N. and say , “ Look , guys , after 9/11 , you have got to demand that Saddam Hussein lets us finish the inspection process . ”
You could n’t responsibly ignore [ the possibility that ] a tyrant had these stocks .
I never really thought he ’d [ use them ] .
What I was far more worried about was that he ’d sell this stuff or give it away .
Same thing I ’ve always been worried about North Korea ’s nuclear and missile capacity .
I do n’t expect North Korea to bomb South Korea , because they know it would be the end of their country .
But if you ca n’t feed yourself , the temptation to sell this stuff is overwhelming .
So that ’s why I thought Bush did the right thing to go back .
When you ’re the President , and your country has just been through what we had , you want everything to be accounted for .
I ’ve excerpted the entire response here for two reasons : 1 ) to demonstrate that I ’m not selectively highlighting certain statements ; and 2 ) to show how deftly President Clinton failed to answer the question .
If I read this at the time , I would have been under the strong impression that Bill Clinton supported the invasion of Iraq .
If I had read the text extremely closely , trying to determine if he had actually said he supported the invasion , I would have found that he had not .
Clinton is suddenly vague when saying what he supports : calling it “ the Iraq thing ” .
A charitable reader , or even a normal person , would take this to mean that the individual speaking could not think of the appropriate word for a moment .
But if , three years later , President Clinton is insisting that he opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning , the whole conversation takes on a different cast : his comments are clearly designed to lead someone to believe he did support the invasion , but he was apparently careful enough not to say this directly .
A lie is a statement that deviates from or perverts the truth .
Clinton spoke as if he were trying to avoid being charged with perjury while avoiding the truth .
But his intent is now clear .
In short , we should n’t be surprised : Bill Clinton lied for political reasons .
Meanwhile , Marc Ambinder explains how Bill ’s statements have been hurting Hillary .

I was on a conference call with Howard Dean and DNC General Counsel Joe Sandler yesterday and they were discussing their complaint to the FEC about McCain 's matching funds violation of the spending limit .
I believe Dean 's purpose is to get the McCain campaign to stop breaking the law in which McCain had a hand in drafting .
The hero of campaign finance reform is hypocritically violating that law .
Dean :
This is a guy that says one thing and does another .
We want John McCain to obey the law ...
MyDD was on the call as well and goes into more details .
John McCain 's attempted politically motivated gaming of the public financing system is already drawing the attention of the Federal Elections Commission , with the chairman of the FEC firing off a letter to McCain 's presidential campaign asking them to explain why , after they had been certified to become a part of the program , they believe they 're able to pull out without approval .
Now the Democratic National Committee is joining in the act , and will file an FEC complaint tomorrow against the McCain campaign ... read on
Howie Klein has the choice quote from Howard Dean :
" The crucial issue here is John McCain 's integrity .
John McCain poses as a reformer but he seems to think reforms apply to everyone else but him ...
His latest attempt to ignore the law is just more of his do as I say , not as I do hypocrisy and it calls his credibility into question .
McCain financially benefited by accepting this agreement ; he got free ballot access , saving him millions of dollars , and he secured a $ 4 million loan to keep his campaign afloat by using public financing as collateral .
He should be held to the law . "
Update : The DNC has filed its complaint today .
Interest rates are confusing , despite their ubiquity .
This post takes an in - depth look at why interest rates behave as they do .
Understanding these concepts will help understand finance ( mortgages & savings rates ) , along with the omnipresent e and natural logarithm .
Here ’s our cheatsheet :
Term Formula Description & Usage Simple Fixed , non-growing return ( bond coupons ) Compound
( Annual ) Changes each year ( stock market , inflation ) Compound
( n times per year ) Changes each month / week / day ( savings account ) Continuous Growth Changes each instant ( radioactive decay , temperature ) APR Annual Percentage Rate ( compounding not included ) APY Annual Percentage Yield ( all compounding effects included )
P = principal , your initial investment ( i.e. , \ $ 1,000 )
r = interest rate ( i.e. , 5 % per year )
n = number of time periods ( i.e. , 3 years )
And a quick calculator to convert APR to APY :
Why the fuss ?
Interest rates are complex .
Like Roman numerals and hieroglyphics , our first system “ worked ” but was n’t quite ideal .
In the beginning , you might have had 100 gold coins and were paid 12 % per year ( percent = per cent = per hundred — those Roman numerals still show up ! ) .
It ’s simple enough : we get 12 coins a year .
But is it really 12 ?
If we break it down , it seems we earn 1 gold a month : 6 for January - June , and 6 for July - December .
But wait a minute — after our June payout we ’d have 106 gold in July , and yet earn only 6 during the rest of the year ?
Are you saying 100 and 106 earn the same amount in 6 months ?
By that logic , do 100 and 200 earn the same amount , too ?
Uh oh .
This issue did n’t seem to bother the ancient Egyptians , but did raise questions in the 1600s and led to Bernoulli ’s discovery of e ( sorry math fans , e was n’t discovered via some hunch that a strange limit would have useful properties ) .
There ’s much to say about this riddle — just keep this in mind as we dissect interest rates :
Interest rates and terminology were invented before the idea of compounding .
Heck , loans were around in 1500 BC , before exponents , 0 , or even the decimal point !
So it ’s no wonder our discussions can get confusing .
Heck , loans were around in 1500 BC , before exponents , 0 , or even the decimal point !
So it ’s no wonder our discussions can get confusing .
Nature does n’t wait for a human year before changing .
Interest earnings are a type of “ growth ” , but natural phenomena like temperature and radioactive decay change constantly , every second and faster .
This is one reason why physics equations model change with “ e ” and not “ ( 1+r ) n ” : Nature rudely ignores our calendar when making adjustments .
Learn the Lingo
As a result of these complications , we need a few terms to discuss interest rates :
APR ( annual percentage rate ) :
The rate someone tells you ( “ 12 % per year ! ” ) .
You ’ll see this as “ r ” in the formula .
The rate someone tells you ( “ 12 % per year ! ” ) .
You ’ll see this as “ r ” in the formula .
APY ( annual percentage yield ) :
The rate you actually get after a year , after all compounding is taken into account .
You can consider this “ total return ” in the formula .
The APY is greater than or equal to the APR .
APR is what the bank tells you , the APY is what you pay ( the price after taxes , shipping and handling , if you get my drift ) .
And of course , banks advertise the rate that looks better .
Getting a credit card or car loan ?
They ’ll show the “ low APR ” you ’re paying , to hide the higher APY .
But opening a savings account ?
Well , of course they ’d tout the “ high APY ” they ’re paying to look generous .
The APY ( actual yield ) is what you care about , and the way to compare competing offers .
Simple Interest
Let ’s start on the ground floor : Simple interest pays a fixed amount over time .
A few examples :
Aesop ’s fable of the golden goose : every day it laid a single golden egg .
It could n’t lay faster , and the eggs did n’t grow into golden geese of their own .
Corporate bonds : A bond with a face value of \ $ 1000 and 5 % interest rate ( coupon ) pays you \$ 50 per year until it expires .
You ca n’t increase the face value , so \$ 50 / year is what you will get from the bond .
( In reality , the bond would pay \ $ 25 every 6 months ) .
Simple interest is the most basic type of return .
Depositing \$ 100 into an account with 50 % simple ( annual ) interest looks like this :
You start with a principal ( aka investment ) of \ $ 100 and earn \ $ 50 each year .
I imagine the blue principal “ shoveling ” green money upwards every year .
However , this new , green money is stagnant — it ca n’t grow !
With simple interest , the \ $ 50 just sits there .
Only the original \ $ 100 can do “ work ” to generate money .
Simple interest has a simple formula : Every period you earn P * r ( principal * interest rate ) .
After n periods you have :
This formula works as long as “ r ” and “ n ” refer to the same time period .
It could be years , months , or days — though in most cases , we ’re considering annual interest .
There ’s no trickery because there ’s no compounding — interest ca n’t grow .
Simple interest is useful when :
Your interest earnings create something that cannot grow more .
It ’s like the golden goose creating eggs , or a corporate bond paying money that can not be reinvested .
.
It ’s like the golden goose creating eggs , or a corporate bond paying money that can not be reinvested .
You want simple , predictable , non-exponential results .
Suppose you ’re encouraging your kids to save .
You could explain that you ’ll put aside \ $ 1 / month in “ fun money ” for every \ $ 20 in their piggybank .
Most kids would be thrilled and buy comic books each month .
If your last name is Greenspan , your kid might ask to reinvest the dividend .
In practice , simple interest is fairly rare because most types of earnings can be reinvested .
There really is n’t an APR vs APY distinction , since your earnings can’t change : you always earn the same amount per year .
Really Understanding Growth
Most interest explanations stop there : here ’s the formula , now get on your merry way .
Not here : let ’s see what ’s really happening .
First , what does an interest rate mean ?
I think of it as a type of “ speed ” :
50 mph means you ’ll travel 50 miles in the course of an hour
means you ’ll travel 50 miles in the course of an hour r = 50 % per year means you ’ll earn 50 % of your principal in the course of a year .
If P = \$ 100 , you ’ll earn \ $ 50 / year ( your “ speed of money growth ” ) .
But both types of speed have a subtlety : we do n’t have to wait the full time period !
Does driving 50 mph mean you must go a full hour ?
No way !
You can drive “ only ” 30 minutes and go 25 miles ( 50 mph * .5 hours ) .
You could drive 15 minutes and go 12.5 miles ( 50 mph * .25 hours ) .
You get the idea .
Interest rates are similar .
An interest rate gives you a “ trajectory ” or “ pace ” to follow .
If you have \$ 100 at a 50 % simple interest rate , your pace is \ $ 50 / year .
But you do n’t need to follow that pace for a full year !
If you grew for 6 months , you should be entitled to \ $ 25 .
Take a look at this :
We start with \$ 100 , in blue .
Each year that blue contributes \ $ 50 ( in green ) to our total amount .
Of course , with simple interest our earnings are based on our original amount , not the “ new total ” .
Connecting the dots gives us a trendline : we ’re following a path of \ $ 50 / year .
Our payouts look like a staircase because we ’re only paid at the end of the year , but the trajectory still works .
Simple interest keeps the same trajectory : we earn “ P*r ” each year , no matter what \ $ 50 / year in this case ) .
That straight line perfectly predicts where we ’ll end up .
The idea of “ following a trajectory ” may seem strange , but stick with it — it will really help when understanding the nature of e .
One point : the trajectory is “ how fast ” a bank account is growing at a certain moment .
With simple interest , we ’re stuck in a car going the same speed : \ $ 50 / year , or 50 mph .
In other cases , our rate may change , like a skydiver : they start off slow , but each second fall faster and faster .
But at any instant , there ’s a single speed , a single trajectory .
( The math gurus will call this trajectory a “ derivative ” or “ gradient ” .
No need to hit a mosquito with the calculus sledgehammer just yet . )
Basic Compound Interest
Simple interest should make you squirm .
Why ca n’t our interest earn money ?
We should use the bond payouts \ $ 50 / year ) to buy more bonds .
Heck , we should use the golden eggs to fund research into cloning golden geese !
Compound growth means your interest earns interest .
Einstein called it “ one of the most powerful forces in nature ” , and it ’s true .
When you have a growing thing , which creates more growing things , which creates more growing things … your return adds up fast .
The most basic type is period - over - period return , which usually means “ year over year ” .
Reinvesting our interest annually looks like this :
We earn \$ 50 from year 0 – 1 , just like with simple interest .
But in year 1 - 2 , now that our total is \ $ 150 , we can earn \ $ 75 this year ( 50 % * 150 ) giving us \ $ 225 .
In year 2 - 3 we have \$ 225 , so we earn 50 % of that , or \$ 112.50 .
In general , we have ( 1 + r ) times more “ stuff ” each year .
After n years , this becomes :
Exponential growth outpaces simple , linear interest , which only had \$ 250 in year 3 ( 100 + 3*50 ) .
Compound growth is useful when :
Interest can be reinvested , which is the case for most savings accounts .
, which is the case for most savings accounts .
You want to predict a future value based on a growth trend .
Most trends , like inflation , GDP growth , etc. are assumed to be “ compoundable ” .
Yearly GDP growth of 3 % over 10 years is really ( 1.03 ) 10 = 1.344 , or a 34.4 % increase over that decade .
Interest as a Factory
The typical interpretation sees money as a “ blob ” that grows over time .
This view works , but sometimes I like to see interest earnings as a “ factory ” that generates more money :
Here ’s what ’s happening :
Year 0 : We start with \$ 100 .
We start with \ $ 100 .
Year 1 : Our \$ 100 creates a \ $ 50 “ bond ” .
Our \$ 100 creates a \ $ 50 “ bond ” .
Year 2 : The \$ 100 generates another \ $ 50 bond .
The \$ 50 generates a \ $ 25 bond .
The total is 50 + 25 = 75 , which matches up .
The \$ 100 generates another \ $ 50 bond .
The \$ 50 generates a \ $ 25 bond .
The total is 50 + 25 = 75 , which matches up .
Year 3 : Things get a bit crazy .
The \$ 100 creates a third \$ 50 bond .
The two existing \$ 50 bonds make \ $ 25 each .
And the \ $ 25 makes a 12.50 .
Things get a bit crazy .
The \$ 100 creates a third \$ 50 bond .
The two existing \$ 50 bonds make \ $ 25 each .
And the \ $ 25 makes a 12.50 .
Years 4 to infinity : Left as an exercise for the reader .
( Do n’t you love that textbook cop out ? )
This is an interesting viewpoint .
The \$ 100 just mindlessly cranks out \ $ 50 “ factories ” , which start earning money independently ( notice the 3 blue arrows from the blue principal to the green \ $ 50s ) .
These \$ 50 factories create \ $ 25 factories , and so on .
The pattern seems complex , but it ’s simpler in a way as well .
The \$ 100 has no idea what those zany \$ 50s are up to : as far as the \ $ 100 knows , we ’re only making \ $ 50 / year .
So why ’s this viewpoint useful ?
You can separate the impact of the parent \ $ 100 ) from the children .
For example , at Year 3 we have \$ 337.50 total .
The parent has earned \ $ 150 ( “ 3 * 50 % * \ $ 100 = \ $ 150 ” , using the simple interest formula ! ) .
This means the various “ children ” have contributed \ $ 337.50 – \ $ 150 – \ $ 100 = \ $ 87.50 , or about 1/3 the total value .
For example , at Year 3 we have \$ 337.50 total .
The parent has earned \ $ 150 ( “ 3 * 50 % * \ $ 100 = \ $ 150 ” , using the simple interest formula ! ) .
This means the various “ children ” have contributed \ $ 337.50 – \ $ 150 – \ $ 100 = \ $ 87.50 , or about 1/3 the total value .
Breaking earnings into components helps understand e.
Knowing more about e is a good thing because it shows up everywhere .
And besides , seeing old ideas in a new light is always fun .
For one of us , at least .
Understanding the Trajectory
Oh , we ’re not done yet .
One more insight — take a look at our trajectory :
With simple interest , we kept the same pace forever \ $ 50 / year — pretty boring ) .
With annually compounded interest , we get a new trajectory each year .
We deposit our money , go to sleep , and wake up at the end of the year :
Year 1 : “ Hey , waittaminute .
I ’ve got \$ 150 bucks !
I should be making \ $ 75 / year , not \ $ 50 ! ” .
You yell at your banker , crank up the dial to \ $ 75 / year , and go to sleep again .
“ Hey , waittaminute .
I ’ve got \$ 150 bucks !
I should be making \ $ 75 / year , not \ $ 50 ! ” .
You yell at your banker , crank up the dial to \ $ 75 / year , and go to sleep again .
Year 2 : “ Hey !
I ’ve got \$ 225 , and should be making \ $ 112.50 per year ! ” .
You scream at your bank and get the rate adjusted .
This process repeats forever — we seem to never learn .
Compound Interest Revisited
Why are we waiting so long ?
Sure , waiting a year at a time is better than waiting “ forever ” ( like simple interest ) , but I think we can do better .
Let ’s zoom in on a year :
Look at what ’s happening .
The green line represents our starting pace \ $ 50 / year ) , and the solid area shows the cash in our account .
After 6 months , we ’ve earned \ $ 25 but do n’t see a dime !
More importantly , after 6 months we have the same trajectory as when we started .
The interest gap shows where we ’ve earned interest , but stay on our original trajectory ( based on the original principal ) .
We ’re losing out on what we should be making .
Imagine I took your money and returned it after 6 months .
“ Well , ya see , I did n’t use it for a full year , so I do n’t really owe you any interest .
After all , interest is measured per year .
Per yeeeeeaaaaar .
Not per 6 months . ”
You ’d smile and send Bubba to break my legs .
Annual payouts are man-made artifacts , used to keep things simple .
But in reality , money should be earned all the time .
We can pay interest after 6 months to reduce the gap :
Here ’s what happened :
We start with \ $ 100 and a trajectory of \ $ 50 / year , like normal
After 6 months we get \ $ 25 , giving us \$ 125
We head out using the new trajectory : 50 % * \$ 125 = \ $ 62.5 / year
After 6 months we collect 62.5 / year times .5 year = 31.25 .
We have 125 + 31.25 = 156.25 .
The key point is that our trajectory improved halfway through , and we earned 156.25 , instead of the “ expected ” 150 .
Also , early payout gave us a smaller gap area ( in white ) , since our \$ 25 of interest was doing work for the second half ( it contributed the extra 6.25 , or \ $ 25 * 50 % * .5 years ) .
For 1 year , the impact of rate r compounded n times is :
In our case , we had ( 1 + 50 % / 2) 2 .
Repeating this for t years ( multiplying t times ) gives :
Compound interest reduces the “ dead space ” where our interest is n’t earning interest .
The more frequently we compound , the smaller the gap between earning interest and updating the trajectory .
Continuous Growth
Clearly we want money to “ come online ” as fast as possible .
Continuous growth is compound interest on steroids : you shrink the gap into oblivion , by dividing the year into more and more time periods :
The net effect is to make use of interest as soon as it ’s created .
We wait a millisecond , find our new sum , and go off in the new trajectory .
Except it ’s not every millisecond : it ’s every nanosecond , picosecond , femtosecond , and intervals I do n’t know the name for .
Continuous growth keeps the trajectory perfectly in sync with your current amount .
Read the article on e for more details ( e is a special number , like pi , and is roughly 2.718 ) .
If we have rate r and time t ( in years ) , the result is :
If you have a 50 % APR , it would be an APY of e.50 = 64.9 % if compounded continuously .
That ’s a pretty big difference !
Notice that e takes care of the icky parts , like dividing by an infinite number of periods .
Why ’s this useful ?
Most natural phenomena grow continuously .
As mentioned earlier , physical phenomena grows on its own schedule : radioactive material does n’t wait for the Earth to go around the Sun before deciding to decay .
Any physical equation that models change is going to use e rt .

ert is the adjustable , one - size - fits - all exponential .
It sounds strange , but e can even model the jumpy , staircase - like growth we ’ve seen with compound interest .
We ’ll get into this in a later article .
Most interest discussions leave e out , as continuous interest is not often used in financial calculations .
( Daily compounding , ( 1 + r/365 ) 365 , is generous enough for your bank account , thank you very much .
But seriously , daily compounding is a pretty good approximation of continuous growth . )
The exponential e is the bridge from our jumpy “ delayed ” growth to the smooth changes of the natural world .
A Few Examples
Let ’s try a few examples to make sure it ’s sunk in .
Remember : the APR is the rate they give you , the APY is what you actually earn ( your true return ) .
Is a 4.5 APY better than a 4.4 APR , compounded quarterly ?
You need to compare APY to APY .
4.4 % compounded quarterly is ( 1 + 4.4%/4 ) 4 = 4.47 % , so the 4.5 % APY is still better .
You need to compare APY to APY .
4.4 % compounded quarterly is , so the 4.5 % APY is still better .
Should I pay my mortgage at the end of the month , or the beginning ?
The beginning , for sure .
This way you knock out a chunk of debt early , preventing that “ debt factory ” from earning interest for 30 days .
Suppose your loan APY is 6 % and your monthly payment is \ $ 2000 .
By paying at the start of the month , you ’d save \ $ 2000 * 6 % = \ $ 120 / year , or \ $ 3600 throughout a 30 - year mortgage .
And a few grand is nothing to sneeze at .

Should I use several small payments , or one large payment ?.
You want to pay debt off as early as possible .
\ $ 500 / week for 4 weeks is better than \$ 2000 at the end of the month .
Each payment stops a few weeks ’ worth of interest .
The math is a bit tricker , but think of it as 4 \$ 500 investments , each getting different return .
In a month , the first payment saves 3 week ’s worth of interest : 500 · ( 1 + daily rate ) 21 .
The next saves 2 weeks : 500 · ( 1 + daily rate ) 14 .
The third saves a week 500 · ( 1 + daily rate ) 7 and the last payment does n’t save any interest .
Regardless of the details , prepayment will save you money .
The general principle :
When investing , get interest paid early , so it can compound .
When borrowing , pay debt early to prevent that interest from compounding .
Onward and Upward
This is a lot for one sitting , but I hope you ’ve seen the big picture :
The interest rate ( APR ) is the “ speed ” at which money grows .
.
Compounding lets you adjust your “ speed ” as you earn more interest .
The APR is the initial speed ; the APY is the actual change during the year .

Man -made growth uses ( 1+r ) n , or some variant .
We like our loans to line up with years .

Interest rates are tricky .
When in doubt , ask for the APY and pay debt early .
Treating interest in this funky way ( trajectories and factories ) will help us understand some of e’s cooler properties , which come in handy for calculus .
Also , try the Rule of 72 for a quick way to compute the effect of interest rates mentally ( that investment with 6 % APY will double in 12 years ) .
Happy math .

Robert Alexander Watson - Watt convinced the Air Ministry that his radar set had merit .
Good thing for Old Blighty .
Courtesy Archives of Ontario 1935 : The feasibility of radar is demonstrated for the British Air Ministry .
It would prove to be a just - in - the - nick - of - time apparatus that helped save Great Britain from defeat in World War II .
Radar ( for RAdio Detection And Ranging ) was developed over the years with input from many sources , but it was Robert Watson - Watt , a Scottish physicist looking for a reliable method to help airmen locate and avoid approaching thunderstorms , who designed the first set put into practical use .
Watson - Watt realized , as he perfected his device , that radio waves could be used to detect more than storms .
A Royal Air Force Heyforth bomber was used for the War Ministry demonstration at Daventry .
Three times the plane passed overhead and three times the main beam of a BBC short - wave radio transmitter picked up reflected signals .
Impressed , the air ministers embraced the new technology and by September 1939 , when war broke out in Europe , the British had a network of radar installations covering the English Channel and North Sea coasts .
It was radar , even more than the pluck of the dashing RAF pilots , that tipped the scales in England 's favor in the Battle of Britain .
Hitler 's strategic aerial onslaught , meant to clear the skies over the Channel and southeastern England preparatory to an invasion of the British Isles , might have succeeded if not for radar .
The RAF was outnumbered by the Luftwaffe , and radar saved already - stretched Fighter Command from having to maintain constant air surveillance .
With radar providing an early - warning system , well - rested RAF pilots could be scrambled and rising to meet the incoming enemy formations in a matter of minutes .
As the German fighters ran low on fuel and were forced to turn back , the Spitfires and Hurricanes could pick off the German bombers as they moved deeper into England .
The battle peaked during September and October 1940 .
The Germans , discouraged by their tactical errors and high losses , gradually tapered off their attacks , then abandoned them altogether when Hitler turned his attention to Russia .
An interesting historical footnote : Although radar was introduced to warfare by the British , the Germans developed their own version and used it effectively during the Allied air raids over occupied Europe and the Reich .

New studies show that iron , the principal constituent of the innermost parts of the earth ’s core , becomes unusually ‘ soft ’ at the extreme pressures and temperatures that prevail there .
The findings , now being published in Science , enhance our possibility of understanding the innermost parts of the earth and how earthquakes occur , for example .
In a more immediate perspective , scientists will have new tools for developing better materials .
The findings were attained by a team of Swedish and Russian researchers , who used advanced simulations on Swedish supercomputers .
This new knowledge explains some of the seismic data­ - signals from earth tremors­ - that stations around the world gather and that have puzzled scientists until now .
“ These new discoveries about the innermost part of the earth provide an explanation for the low velocity of the seismic waves deep down in the earth .
They explain , in turn , why signals from earth tremors look like they do , thereby facilitating the work of seismologists , ” says Anatoly Belonoshko at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , who directed the studies .
The innermost core of the earth , which consists of highly compressed iron in a solid state , is known to have an extremely low degree of rigidity in regard to shear­ - the impact of twisting or other forces .
The iron at the center of the earth therefore behaves largely like a fluid , which lacks all resistance to shear , making it easy for shifts to take place in the matter in the earth ’s core .
One consequence is that the seismic waves that move along the surface of the inner core move unexpectedly slowly .
“ Besides providing an entirely new potential for understanding a number of mysterious phenomena associated with the low velocity of the movement of these seismic waves , the methods we are using to explain the softness of the earth ’s core can also be applied to materials science , ” says Anatoly Belonoshko .
This dual nature of iron has been an enigma to researchers for more than 50 years , since iron in laboratory experiments has not evinced any tendency whatsoever to behave like a fluid under high pressure .
The reason for this is the much lower temperatures in laboratory experiments compared with the center of the earth .
The solution to the riddle of this ‘ soft ’ iron lies in the how the iron atoms are arranged and can move under the conditions that prevail in the inner parts of the earth .
The conditions can be likened to a solid structure in which the parts , instead of being nailed to each other , are fastened together with rubber bands .
This makes it extremely easy for certain parts to shift in relation to each other .
A more scientific description is that the iron at the center of the earth cannot be depicted as an average of single crystalline iron .
Instead , it is a so - called polycrystalline material with liquid - like granule edges and masses of defects in the structure .
Anatoly Belonoshko , in collaboration with his colleagues Natalia Skorodumova and Anders Rosengren , has been able to show that an external disturbance like shear is rapidly mitigated by a migration of atoms and a gliding of the liquid - like granule edges .
The study shows that traditional methods of mineral physics are valid , despite the unexpected behavior of iron in the earth ’s core , and that what is key to an enhanced understanding of the core of the earth is to be able to recreate the conditions there with great accuracy .
A challenge for scientists is to further develop a new way to calculate the elastic properties of various materials at high temperatures .
“ The methods we use help us understand , and thereby describe and predict , properties of materials at high temperatures .
This opens new avenues for the theoretical , and in the long term practical , construction of new materials , ” says Anatoly Belonoshko .
The simulations were possible to perform with the help of the most powerful Swedish supercomputers , situated at the Center for Parallel Computers ( PDC ) at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and the National Supercomputer Center ( NSC ) in Linköping .
Another year is about to come to the end , and most of us will celebrate the end of 2007 , and the start of 2008 by watching some fireworks explode , either live or on television .
All of the major cities in the world hold huge celebrations , and these 5 YouTube videos show some of the best .
This is a compilation showing some of the best new year ’s fireworks displays of the last few years .
Sydney 1999/2000 Millennium Celebrations
Australia has an important job to play in new year ’s celebrations , being the first of the major world powers to see in the new year .
Consequentially , they always put on a good display , and the fireworks extravaganza they put on for the millennium in 2000 was one of their best ever .
Chinese New Year In Hong Kong 2006/07
This display in Hong Kong is awesome , and is to see in the Chinese new year , rather than the western one we are setting up to see in .
The sheer amount of fireworks on display here is amazing .
Bucharest 2006/07 – Fireworks & Music
This one , from Bucharest last year , does n’t have the incredible quantity that Hong Kong did , but with a combination of fireworks , lasers and music , it still makes for quite a show .
Madeira 2006/07 – Awesome Extravaganza
Madeira in Portugal would n’t strike me as the sort of place to have the best fireworks displays , but this one , which stretches for a 5 km span in the sky , turns that assumption on its head .
London Eye & Big Ben 2006 /07 Spectacular
Last but not least , is last year ’s display from London , and specifically the London Eye , and Big Ben .
Being my home town , I ’m proud that we are able to put on such a spectacular show .
The use of the London Eye , otherwise known as the Millenium Wheel , for many of the fireworks was a brilliant decision , because it focusses everyone ’s attention to one place .
With the countdown to midnight set to start tomorrow , it ’ll be interesting to see if any country or city can live up to , or even exceed these fireworks displays .
Happy New Year !
Last week 's announcement of Japan 's " Robot of the Year " for 2007 — a mechanical arm capable of grabbing 120 items - per- minute from a conveyor belt — marked an anticlimactic end to what has otherwise been a good year in the advancement of artificial intelligence .
The three Fanuc Ltd. assembly - line mechanical arms — which beat out competitors such as Fujitsu's 24 - inch - tall ( 61 - centimeter ) dancing humanoid HOAP and Komatsu Ltd. 's tank - shaped , fire - extinguishing robot — won for their practicality ; they are optimized to work efficiently and accurately on food and pharmaceutical manufacturing lines .
Still , 2007 offered plenty of other significant , if less heralded ( and immediately useful ) , developments and pushed robotic technology to new levels , or at least promised to in the near future .
As part of NASA 's plans to send peopled missions back to the moon ( and then on to Mars ) , the space agency , in September , performed a series of tests to determine if robotic technology could be used to provide medical care for astronauts during extended spaceflights .
On board a military C - 9 aircraft flying in parabolic arcs over the Gulf of Mexico , four surgeons and four astronauts performed simulated surgery both by hand and using a robotic device developed by SRI International to determine if the robot's software can compensate for errors in movement caused by turbulence and varying gravitational conditions .
The U.S. Department of Defense continued its quest to develop autonomous robotic technology that will eventually take the place of human soldiers in battle .
In November , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) hosted its 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge , a competition that tested the driving prowess of experimental driverless autos .
" Boss , " an SUV put together by a team including gearheads from Carnegie Mellon University , General Motors Corporation , Caterpillar and Continental AG drove away with the $ 2 million grand prize .
( The second - and third - place finishers were , respectively , built by groups at Stanford University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University . )
Boss maintained an average speed of 14 miles per hour throughout the 55 - mile course at the former George Air Force Base in Victorville , Calif. , which was built to resemble an urban layout .
The autonomous vehicles demonstrated their abilities by changing lanes , merging onto roadways amidst fast - moving traffic and traversing busy intersections — using only sensors , global positioning systems and computers .
During the tragedy at Utah's Crandall Canyon mine in August , when six miners and three rescuers perished in a mine collapse and subsequent rescue attempt , rescuers learned valuable lessons about the capabilities and limitations of robotic equipment .
A robot crawler was sent 1,500 feet ( 457 meters ) through a borehole into the mine , located about 120 miles ( 193 kilometers ) south of Salt Lake City , after it crumbled due to a cave - in so powerful that it registered a magnitude of 3.9 on the Richter scale .
Workers , handicapped by time constraints and the continued shifting of the mountain 's mass , managed to get the crawler to the mine 's floor but were bogged down by debris and unable retrieve the device , which remains trapped 52 feet ( 16 meters ) below the mountain 's surface .
Other robots helped us learn about ourselves .
In November , University of California , San Diego , researchers reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that " current robot technology is surprisingly close to achieving autonomous bonding and socialization with human toddlers for significant periods of time . "
QRIO , another two - foot - ( 61 - centimeter - ) humanoid was placed in UC San Diego 's Early Childhood Education Center and programmed to wave , dance , sit and stand , among other functions .
Children aged 18 to 24 months quickly warmed to the machine and began to treat it more like a peer than an object .
Earlier this month , Toyota unveiled the latest in its line of " partner robots " : the aptly named Violin - playing Robot , which can hold the string instrument in place with its left hand and move the bow with its right hand to produce music .
The roughly 5 - foot , 123 lb. ( 1.5 - meter , 56 kg ) humanoid joins walking and rolling robots the company introduced in 2004 , which are capable of playing the trumpet .
Toyota rival Honda also this month introduced advancements to its humanoid , ASIMO ( first introduced in 2005 ) , that allow it to perform tasks such as carrying a tray and pushing a cart while simultaneously employing an eye camera to detect the speed and direction of humans and other ASIMOs to avoid collisions .
The new ASIMO also knows when its battery levels are low and will automatically return to its base to recharge .
When not serving tea , robots aided scientists in understanding insect behavior .
Researchers at the Free University of Brussels ( U.L.B. ) in Belgium , École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( E.P.F.L. ) in Switzerland and the University of Rennes in France , along with other European educational institutions , reported in Science that they successfully introduced a few autonomous robots ( boxy in design , but made to smell like the real deal ) into cockroach communities .
The robots were able to alter the collective decision - making process of the group and trigger new behavior patterns in the bugs .
The findings show that it may be possible to use robots to study and control how groups of animals from insects to vertebrates interact .
And further proving there is no limit to what robotic technology can accomplish , a Web video recently surfaced featuring a mechanical device that can not only open a beer bottle but can follow that feat with a proper pour .
( Note how the cup is held at an angle ; many humans have yet to master this technique . )
This sampling merely scratches the surface of the past year 's advances in robotics that whet the appetite for what 's to come :
Early next year , for instance , researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder will benchmark robotic devices to precisely mix and measure medications used in treatments such as chemotherapy .
The robotic Mars rovers Opportunity and Spirit are currently hunkering down in anticipation of the harsh Martian winter season but will soon resume their exploration of the Red Planet .
And Scandanavian research firm Sintef is developing artificially intelligent equipment to help offshore oil and gas drilling platforms run more safely and efficiently .
In all , 2008 promises continued progress in the area of artificial intelligence , although it will still be a while before humankind reaches the point where it cannot live without the robots it has created .

Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee explains to Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers why he 's still in the race .
MEYERS : So , Governor , you remain in the race , despite the fact that it ’s a mathematical impossibility that you can win .
And our question is : why ?
HUCKABEE : Well , Seth , the media loves to throw around the term “ mathematical impossibility ” but no one can ever explain exactly what that means to me .
MEYERS : Well , let me give that a shot : basically , it takes 1,191 delegates to clinch your party ’s nomination and even if you won every remaining unpledged delegate , you would still fall 200 delegates short .
HUCKABEE : Wow .
Seth , that was an excellent explanation .
But I ’m afraid that you overlook the all - important Super Delegates .
Do n’t forget about them .
MEYERS : Well , I wo n’t forget about them , but the Super Delegates are only in the Democratic primaries .
HUCKABEE : Ah…they can vote in the Republican primary ?
MEYERS : They cannot .
HUCKABEE : Uh oh .
That ’s not good news .
You know , Seth , I was … I was counting on those Super Delegates .
MEYERS : Sorry to break that to you .
Now does this mean that now you know that , you ’re going to drop out of the race ?
HUCKABEE : Well , fortunately , Seth , I ’m not a math guy .
I ’m more of a miracle guy .
So at this point , I ’m going to focus on the miracle part .
But if that miracle does n’t happen , let me assure the American people that Mike Huckabee does not overstay his welcome .
When it ’s time for me to go , I ’ll know .
And I ’ll exit out with class and grace .
" Dad , they want me to write an essay on ' What would be the title of my autobiography and why , " Henry announced on the previous day .
" What a goofy idea … " his father replied helpfully , " Seventeen year olds do n't write autobiographies because they do n't have anything to say .
They have n't done anything yet .
Maybe it should be something like ' Blank Slate ' or ' Empty Vessel ' or something like that . "
" Do n't you be silly , " Elizabeth joined in .
" Henry has to get these applications in .
And you 're just wasting his time .
All of these essays are just an opportunity for Henry to sell himself .
That 's what it is all about - selling yourself to the universities .
And you have to go at it seriously or you wo n't be able to get into a good one .
Henry has to take this seriously .
So , you should take it seriously too . "
By that time , your editor was taking it seriously .
He had already come to realize what a serious flimflam the whole thing was .
Selling yourself to a major university is not easy .
Apparently , each year thousands and thousands of children sell themselves … cramming for SAT tests … sweating to get good grades … scouring the Internet for a good college essay they can pass off as their own .
And what are they really doing ?
Why do they work so hard to sell themselves to a prestigious university ?
If they succeed , what do they get ?
For most , nothing but the opportunity to spend $ 150,000 … drink beer …and fill their brains with a lot of useless , trivial , nonsensical and just plain wrong claptrap .
" You 're right Dad , " said Jules , a third - year student in Boston .
" I know what I 'm doing is a waste of time .
I really should pay you back …
I mean , it 's vaguely interesting … and I do n't know what else I 'd do now .
But it really is n't worth the money . "
Jules is studying film .
" What do you actually do ? " we wondered .
" Mostly , we watch movies and talk about them .
Nothing I could n't do on my own … by watching movies and reading the film reviews . "
Ah , dear readers will say , that 's just film , a subject that is notoriously loose and un-serious .
Well , then , take economics .
Much more serious , no ?
It 's the only subject we know anything about .
And from what we can tell , the study of economics at the university level is a net - negative discipline .
We cited some study recently .
It told us that people who had taken an economics class did no better on a test of basic economic ideas than people who'd never opened an economics textbook .
If they 'd tracked these economics students a bit further they would have discovered that it got worse ; the longer they stuck with it , the less they knew .
The only theories in economics that make any sense are those that are simple , instinctive , and practically common sense .
But the more people study economics , the more they come to believe fantasies .
By the second year , they think you can boost employment by printing money .
By the third year , they commonly think that central banks can control the business cycle…and by the fourth year they believe in the Tooth Fairy .
We studied English literature in college .
And then law .
A total waste of time , in our opinion .
Psychology , sociology … the list of phony disciplines is the list of what modern universities offer - along with new ' disciplines ' such as Africana and Gender Studies , Alternative Sexuality , and other folderol .
Unless you 're studying the sciences , time in university could be better spent on a chain gang .
Still , the education industry has the entire country bamboozled .
It puts out a velvet cord , as in a cheap nightclub , and insists that you have to pass through a rigorous selection process to get in .
You 'd think it would be the other way around .
If a student is willing to spend $ 150,000 , you 'd think the university would have to stand in line to get the loot .
Other luxury industries advertise heavily to get customers .
A guy walks into a Tiffany showroom , for example , and is treated with respect .
Normally , businesses are so eager for big - spending customers that they fall all over themselves to get them .
But not the education business .
" Hey Dad , this one wants to know how I 'll contribute to the ' learning community . '
It says , ' learning takes place everywhere … not just in the classroom , but on the sports fields , the assembly rooms , the campus lawn , and the food hall .
Tell us how you will contribute to the learning community on our campus . ' "
And here the conceit of the industry reaches some crescendo .
Of course , learning does take place everywhere - in nightclubs , assembly lines , and in the dark sweats of night .
And every bit of learning comes at a price … but universities are the only places with the gall to charge you extra for it .
" Henry , " came the reply from his father .
" We 're not paying $ 40,000 a year so you can talk to the other yahoos on campus .
We 're paying the money so they can teach you …not so you can teach them .
We 're paying the money so you can go to class and learn something in a disciplined , logical way .
Tell them that if they want you to contribute to the education process out of the classroom , they 're going to have to pay you for it . "

サウンドサーバの PulseAudio は Linuxのサウンド分野では比較的新参者だが、少なくとも2つのメジャーなディストリビューション（
Fedora Ubuntu ）の次期リリースでデフォルトのセットアップとして採用されたので、ここで一度調べて理解しておく価値はあるだろう。
Linux用のサウンドシステムを理解するのは少々ややこしいことだ。どのプロジェクト（少し挙げるだけでもALSA、OSS、ESD、aRts、JACK、GStreamerがある）も大ざっぱで似たような言葉でプロジェクトを説明しているし、多種多彩なパッケージの名前――alsaplayer-esd、libesd-alsa、alsa-oss、alsaplayer-jack、gstreamer-alsa、gstreamer-esd等々――は、まるできりのない組み合わせゲームのようだ。また、これらのコンポーネントがどのように組み合わさるのかを説明するのもなかなか難しい。例えばUbuntuのlibasound2-pluginsパッケージの説明には「ALSAライブラリ用プラグインのjackは、ALSAライブラリがJACK経由で再生やキャプチャを行なうことができるようにするためのものです。（jackdパッケージに含まれているjackd出力ドライバのalsaと混乱しないようにして下さい。alsaは、JACKデーモンがALSAライブラリ経由で再生できるようにするためのものです。）」とある。もちろん――混乱する人などいるわけがない――だろうか？
整理
混乱を招きやすくなってしまっている原因は複数あって、（開発者フレンドリーではなく）ユーザフレンドリな文書の不足や、複数のプロジェクト間で目標が重複していることなどを挙げることができる。
例えばALSA （Advanced Linux Sound Architecture）プロジェクトには、いくつかの独立したコンポーネントがある。その中には、サウンドカード用のカーネルのハードウェアドライバもあれば、ALSAのAPI（アプリケーション・プログラミング・インターフェース）をアプリケーションから利用可能にするライブラリなどもある。ハードウェアドライバはサウンドカードにサウンドを出力させるために必要だが、ライブラリはアプリケーションによって使われたり使われなかったりする。
またKDEのサウンドライブラリであるaRtsには、サウンドサーバ（サウンドをアプリケーションから受け取ってハードウェアドライバに渡す低レベルのデーモン）も含まれていれば、様々なファイルやストリーム形式のエンコード/デコードといった高レベルな機能も含まれている。一方、GNOMEでの状況はもう少しすっきりとしていて、サウンドサーバはESD（Enlightened Sound Daemon）であり、コーデックは別個のライブラリ（GStreamer）が扱うようになっている。
とは言え混乱の最大の原因は、ユーザ空間ALSAライブラリ、aRts、ESD、GStreamerなど、独自のAPIを提供しているオーディオプロジェクトがあまりに多く存在しているということだろう。先にも述べたように、どれを組み合わせても様々な点で重複してしまう。さらにそれらに加えて、ゲーム向けのSDLとOpenAL、古い汎用アプリケーション向けのOSS（Open Sound System）、プロ級の低遅延操作向けのJACKなども存在する。
挙げ句の果てには、サウンド機能を外部のライブラリに頼らずに、すべて内部的に行なうアプリケーションもある。中でも最も有名なものとしては、高機能メディア再生アプリケーションのXineやMPlayerなどがある。これらは、ファイルのデコードから多重分離処理まで、何から何までアプリケーション自体の中で取り扱っている。
PulseAudioがどの部分に当てはまるのかは、個々の処理が切り分けて取り扱われる、GNOMEのシステムを用いて説明するのが最も簡単だ。GNOMEのRhythmboxなどのアプリケーションは、サウンドファイルの圧縮形式から生のサウンドデータへのデコードをGStreamerに依存している。次にGStreamerがそのサウンドデータをESDに渡して、ESDがそれをALSAハードウェアドライバに渡す。
上記の状況に当てはめると、PulseAudioはパイプラインの他の部分に影響を与えることなくESDに置き換わることができる。ただし他のプレイヤーを使う場合には、上記の例には含まれていない、ALSAユーザ空間ライブラリも使用されるかもしれない。その場合にもやはりPulseAudioは、パイプラインの中でカーネルレベルのハードウェアドライバのすぐ上に位置することになる。PulseAudioを利用することにより階層が一つ増えることになるが、そうすることによりすべてのサウンドが同じサウンドサーバを経由することの利点を享受することができるようになる。
そして、そこがポイントだ――ユーザ空間ALSA APIやaRtsやJACKを使うように書かれているアプリケーションもあれば、サウンドを内部的に扱うように書かれているアプリケーションもある――しかしすべてのサウンドが単一のハンドラを経由するようにすれば、制御しやすく、衝突が起こりにくく、予想外のことも起こりにくくなる。
シンプルなサウン ド
PulseAudioを自分のシステムで使い始めるのに最も手早い方法は、手元のディストリビューションでパッケージが用意されていないかどうかを確かめてみることだ。実際、多くのディストリビューションにはPulseAudioのパッケージが用意されている。FedoraとUbuntuの次期リリースではデフォルトでPulseAudioが使用される予定とのことだが、現時点のリリースでも、すでにFedora/Ubuntuをはじめとしてその他のディストリビューションでもパッケージが利用可能になっている。なおPulseAudioのwikiに、パッケージを提供しているディストリビューションのリストがあり、MandrivaやopenSUSEの開発版なども挙げられている。
パッケージになっているバイナリが手元のディストリビューションには用意されていない場合には、PulseAudioを自分でダウンロードしてコンパイルすることもできる。とは言えほとんどのユーザは、パッケージをインストールしてオーディオアプリケーション内で設定オプションを設定するだけで使い始めることができるだろう。
PulseAudioのwiki のThe Perfect Setup（完璧なセットアップ）という題名のページに手順を追った基本的な説明があるが、ディストリビューションにパッケージが用意されているのであれば、ディストリビューション専用のガイドを探してみると良いかもしれない。私の場合Ubuntu専用のガイドがまだなかったので、forum.debian.netに投稿されていたDebian HOWTOの手順を手元 のUbuntu Feistyマシン上で行なったところ、ほとんど問題はなかった。
具体的な手順は以下の通りだ。まず始めに、Synaptic経由で入手可能になっているPulseAudio関連のパッケージをすべてインストールする。GStreamer、ALSA、JACKなどのサウンド用フレームワークごとにPulseAudioを接続するためのパッケージがそれぞれ用意されているのだが、中でも最も重要なのはpulseaudio-esound-compatだ。このパッケージはESDパッケージのesoundを完全に置き換えるもので、実際にはPulseAudioを指すダミーの/usr/bin/esdというシンボリックリンクを作成する。こうしておけば、ESDを利用するつもりのアプリケーションはどれも騙されて自動的にPulseAudioを使うようになる。
重要な注意点として 、PulseAudioのパッケージでは独自のグループが作成され、PulseAudioを使用したいユーザはそのグループのメンバーにならなければならないということがある。大抵のデスクトップユーザはグループやグループパーミッションをあまり気にかけないので、この点は見逃しやすいかもしれない。Ubuntuでは、System（システム）→Administration（管理）→Users and Groups（ユーザとグループ）からグループのメンバーを変更することができる。これを行なうとUsers（ユーザ）設定マネージャが立ち上げるので、Manage Groups（グループの管理）ボタンをクリックしてpulseグループ、pulse-accessグループ、pulse-rtグループのプロパティウィンドウをそれぞれ開いて自分のアカウントを追加する必要がある。
それが終わったら 、Debianのチュートリアルからサンプルの/etc/asound.confファイルをコピーする。これはALSAの設定用ファイルだが、大抵の場合ALSAアプリケーションはこのファイルがなくても問題なく動くので、デフォルトでは作成されていない。しかしALSAアプリケーションがデフォルトの出力先としてPulseAudioを使用するべきであることを指定するためには、作成する必要がある。
サウンドを楽し む
ESDに差し換えてPulseAudioを使用するように設定して、ALSAがPulseAudioを使うように/etc/asound.confで設定し終われば、通常のデスクトップLinuxユーザのサウンド関連の需要の90％を満たしたことになるだろう。
それ以外のアプリケーション――サウンド関連のすべてを内部的に扱う変則的なアプリケーション――については、PulseAudioのwikiにある具体的な手順が貴重な情報源になるだろう。例えばKDEアプリケーションのほとんどはaRtsを使うが、aRtsがESDを使うようにして、その後PulseAudioを経由するように設定を変更することができる。またAmaroKやXMMSやその他のメディアプレイヤーでは、各アプリケーションの設定でバックエンドのエンジンを選択することができる。
現時点 でPulseAudioとは非協調的であるメジャーなアプリケーションは、オーディオエディタのAudacityとビデオプレイヤーのMPlayerだけだ。どちらもそれぞれのプロジェクトのページから開発版のコードを取得する必要がある。より重要なこととしては、Audacityのサウンドデバイスの制御方法が原因で、使用する前にPulseAudioをシャットダウンする必要がある。こうしなくても済むようにするためのコードも開発中だが、まだ安定版コードベースには含まれていない。
PulseAudioの基本的な使い方は以上の通りだが、PulseAudioがLinuxディストリビューションのデフォルトのサウンドスタックの中に含まれることになったのは、PulseAudioに上記以外のかなり多くのことができるためだ。例えばPulseAudioは、ローカル/ネットワーク経由を問わず、複数の音源からのサウンドを複数の出力先に届けることができる。またPulseAudioを使えば、複数のサウンドカードを単一の仮想的なデバイスへと一体化したり、PCから別のPCへ音楽を転送したり、単一のマイク入力を複数のPC間で共有させたりすることもできる。
PulseAudioについて知るにはまず、PulseAudioのwikiを見るのが最も良いだろう。FAQのページの後半にはPulseAudioの先進的な機能の利用方法を示す具体例が多く載っている。設定オプションのほとんどはテキストファイルの設定ファイルの中で指定するが、再起動しなくても――場合によっては実行ファイルのpulseaudio自体を起動し直すことはあるかもしれないが――新しい設定を試すことができる。
またPulseAudioプロジェクトでは 、Lennart Poettering氏によるGUIツールを見てみることを勧めている。このツールには、PulseAudio専用の音量調節、音量メーター、デバイス選択用ツールなどが含まれていて、すべてGNOMEやKDEのデフォルトのツールと同じように、パネルアプレット経由でアクセスすることができる。また、より多くの機能を搭載したPulseAudio Managerアプリケーションもあって、これを利用するとデバイスやモジュールの接続や切断を実行中に行なうこともできる。
PulseAudioが機能満載で複雑だからと言って、怖じ気付く必要はまったくない。PulseAudioプロジェクトは、よく使う機能については専門知識の必要がないように単純にしておくということをうまく行なっている。しかし一方でオープンソース流の伝統に基づいて、よりパワフルなことを行なうこともできるようになっており、しかもそれらが簡単にできるようにもなっている。
Linux.com 原文
My husband of two months has always treated me very well , and is usually thoughtful .
But , one week before our wedding , he broke a promise .
I hate the whole stripper thing , so he agreed to a coed party at a dueling piano bar .
There was a strip club next door , but he promised he would n’t go in .
All was well until I learned that he and his brother ( who ’s nothing but trouble ) were at the strip club .
I went over and went crazy and tossed an ashtray at his head .
I was kicked out , they followed , and his brother yelled at me .
I wanted to call off the wedding , but we still got married .
Since then , I keep bringing this up and he keeps begging for forgiveness , saying he ’d never been so drunk , and he did n’t know what he was doing .
I just ca n’t understand how he could hurt me this way .
-- Still So Angry Inside
If your husband tossed an ashtray at your head , do you think he’d be describing himself as “ Still So Angry Inside ” or “ Still In Court Trying To Get The Charges Reduced ” ?
It does n’t take much for domestic violence against men to be taken seriously … usually , just a chalk outline where a man ’s body used to be .
The rest of the time , people tend to shrug it off or even find it cute : “ Well , well , well , she ’s quite the firecracker ! ”
Granted , male abusers can do much more damage with their fists , but put a heavy object in a woman ’s hands , and good morning brain damage !
( Just wondering …has your husband gotten the ashtray out of his skull , or does he have to hang around smoking areas with his head bent down so people have someplace to flick their ash ? )
But , he broke his promise !
Bummer .
Human nature happens .
If your husband ’s a cad , why marry him at all ( could n’t get the catering deposit back ) ?
If he ’s a good guy who got drunk and slipped ( maybe after his bro gave him a little push ) , why make him sorry he married you ?
Sure , if he keeps slipping , say , by tucking your monthly mortgage payment into some stripper ’s g-string , that ’s one thing .
But , come on …two - plus months later , are you really reacting to what happened -- or just acting out as a means of controlling him ?
Consider what you ’re doing to him and to your marriage by showing him that nothing he says or does makes the slightest bit of difference .
As a friend of mine likes to say , “ Your proctologist called .
They found your head . ”
You can stay married to your grudge or your husband , pick one .
Frankly , you each have a lot of work to do in therapyland , individually and together .
You have to deal with your uncontrollable anger and the underlying issues -- probably insecurity and fear of being ditched -- and get in the habit of expressing your fears instead of weaponizing them .
Your husband needs to start standing up for himself -- for starters , by doing a Senator Craig and withdrawing his guilty plea .
The correct response ?
The one your girlfriends would be pushing on you if the tables were turned : “ There ’s no excuse for domestic abuse ! ” ( Physical or emotional . )
Finally , the two of you should attend one of Dr. John Gottman ’s research - based marriage weekends ( gottman.com ) and learn to have a partnership instead of a monarchy .
Marital harmony can be yours , just not by getting your husband to “ agree ” to like what you like : stag parties featuring your fat , fully clothed co-workers burying their heads in plates of cake instead of some hot young thing leaping naked out of one .

Bravo .
Some people think taking this kind of thing seriously makes a man wimpy .
Those people have never known the dull hum of a surprise concussion or the " cuteness " involved in confiscating a pointy shard of broken glass from the pleasant - smelling psycho trying to put it straight in their neck .
Posted by : Steve at October 31 , 2007 1:32 AM
Right on , Amy !
Abuse is abuse , whether the perp is male or female .
No excuses .
Posted by : Flynne at October 31 , 2007 5:42 AM
" Some people think taking this kind of thing seriously makes a man wimpy . "
Yeah I was one of those people .
Then one of my buddies started dating this , well words fail me as I only know two languaes worth of expatiates .
She is bar none the nastiest thing I have ever seen , larger than an M1A2 .
She is defiantly abusive and he 's too subservient to do any thing .
If the LW had not mentioned his brother I 'd think it was her .
Unfortunately there is not a hell of a lot I can do cause she 's isolated him from all of us .
Had this have been a female friend in the situation the options would have been pretty simple .
However in his area if a man goes to court ( after we slap some sense into him ) with this situation he 'll be a laughing stock .
Going to court after kicking two tons of crap out of her would send any one of his male friends into the hole for a long time .

" If he ’s a good guy who got drunk and slipped " He went to strip club not a whore house .
So he broke his promise .
She a controlling freaking nut .
I can only assume they had the standard vows for the wedding which she is not following .
" coed party at a dueling piano bar "
That is not a bachelor party .
Shit when my mother at the bridal shower called us and thought me and dad were at a strip club she said to a room of my wife 's friends and parents " What it 's nothing they have n't seen before . "
She was actually surprised that we did n't go to one during the bridal shower .

An example of the hate mail I 'm getting from women for condemning violence against men / condoning men going to strip clubs is here :
http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2007/10/we_get_hate_mai_1.html
Posted by : Amy Alkon at October 31 , 2007 6:39 AM
What a lunatic .
I pity the poor bastard that actually married her .
I have no issue with my husband going to the strip club ... unless he spends half our house payment there !
Here 's why : 1 . Strippers get hit on all the time .
Do you really think that they 're going to stop on a dime and pay more attention to YOUR man than all of the other guys in the place ?
2 . Guys ca n't touch / make - out with strippers .
Ask the bouncers about that .
However , if they go to a regular club with their friends and " hook up " with a random woman ... are their friends going to stop them ?
3 . Strippers STRIP .
They 're not hookers .
What woman can honestly say that she 's never checked out men other than the one she 's with ?
Anyone that does is a liar .
My husband looks at other women .
I look at other men .
Keyword is " look " .
Hell , half the time , I point out hot women to my husband ( mostly when trying to decide if " they 're real " or not ) .
At the end of the day , I know that my husband loves me and will be by my side .
Other women may check him out , but I 'm the one he 'll take to bed .
It sucks that this woman , and so many just like her , are so insecure and unhappy inside .
Posted by : Renee at October 31 , 2007 7:28 AM
He did break his promise , which is n't a good thing .
Obviously the response does not match the crime and this lady should be in court , not polishing the new china .
Thanks for pointing out , and I hope the LW got the point , that demanding he make the promise in the first place was where this whole thing started to come off the rails .
HE should have suggested a halt to wedding plans when she tried to set the rules for his behavior .
Posted by : moreta at October 31 , 2007 8:16 AM
It was n't until I read the letter a second time that I understood that she followed them into the strip club ( did she pay a cover ? ) , and threw the ashtray at her man 's head there .
I wonder if the brother was n't hoping that after that incident that his brother would come to his senses and call off the wedding ... no luck , apparently .
So she 's physically abusive , and prone to throwing tantrums , and he 's the one apologizing ?
Amy , you were too nice .
( Except to the LW 's co-workers , in assuming that they were fat , and willing participants in this lovely drama . )
Posted by : Jessica at October 31 , 2007 8:40 AM
I 've never really understood why men are drawn to obviously psychotic women .
In this case , I 'm sure she 's done many other horrible things to him , but he stayed with her and now he married her .
My theories range from : guys like this hate themselves ; they 're masochists and enjoy suffering ; they think they can rescue her and turn her into a nice person .
The latest one I thought of is that they 're drama queens and enjoy the rush of the near - death experience of being with these women , kind of like BASE jumping or russian roulette .
Why is n't he writing the letter since he's the victim in this situation ?
Why is it her ?
Posted by : Chrissy at October 31 , 2007 8:58 AM
As someone who was married to a female abuser , I have to say that this woman is pretty classic .
She may not be stabbing her husband or waking him up by choking him , but she is an abuser through and through .
Her controlling behavior would be enough to condemn a male for abuse .
The problem is , in modern society , this type of aggressive , stereotypically " masculine " behavior ( c.f. Duluth Model ) is viewed as more of a empowering , you - go - grrrrl type attitude than that of an abuser .
After all , she 's just standing up for herself , making her wishes known , and keeping her stupid , slow , lying man in line like the child he is .
And regarding strip clubs ?
Even when I went to them with partners ( yes , they had both male and female strippers ) , they are nothing but a huge , depressing time and money pit .
I do n't see any good in them whatsoever , but that does n't mean people should n't be free to be an idiot and go to them if they want to do so .
Posted by : Jay at October 31 , 2007 8:58 AM
Amy ,
Were I the man in the situation I think I would ave given SERIOUS reconsideration to tying the knot with someone as insecure as this woman seems to be .
Her " he promised me that he wouldnt go in there " rant is nothing more then a childish attempt at attention .
If a guy starts going strip clubs on a regular basis then theres a problem .
One visit is not a capitol crime .
Men going to a strip club is like women going to a spa .
Theres not much difference .
The bonding aspect is what I mean by that .
A group of women go to a spa to chat and get thier hair , nails etc done and feel feminine .
Men got o strip clubs for much the same reason .
They are in like company , talking about the similar interests while watching naked or topless women dance around on stage while drinking beer or watching football etc .
Im not advocating that all men run out and meet thier buddies at the local tittie bar .
What Im saying is that we dont need to treat it like a betrayal of marriage like this women did .
On the last part her humming an ashtry at his head then trying to justify it in the manner which she posted is ignorant .
Its abuse and assault but many men will just laugh it off or ignore it .
Were more men to actually start reporting it to the police then the courts and the media would have to treat it as a real issue rather then the topic of humor that it is now .

I 'm reminded of a recent psuedo - celebrity - trying - to - find - twoo - wuv reality show ( of which I watched every episode , but that 's besides the point ) .
There was one contestant who was particularly catty , possessive , and violent , and who initiated a physical altercation with a fellow contestant .
Instead of sending her off into anonymity and recommending a good therapist , the psuedo celebrity looked into her eyes and said , " You are completely crazy .
But that means you 're probably crazy for me . "
I wanted to puke .
I think some guys are turned on by psychotically jealous women .
I 've had both male and female friends tell me that they find it a turn - on when their partner flies into a jealous rage or tells them they 're " not comfortable " with them being " too close " to a member of the opposite sex or going to strip clubs ( male or female ) .
Posted by : sofar at October 31 , 2007 10:14 AM
What is this girl , twelve ?
And her husband is a pussy .
Begging for forgiveness ?
He should have taken her up on her offer to call off the wedding .
And I read your hate mail this morning , too !
The nutcases are crawling out of the woodwork !
I went to a strip club with a busload of people doing a barhopping New Year 's
Eve thing a few years back , and I thought it was pretty silly .
Just the kind of thing guys like .
And who cares ?
If I thought any of those women had a thing on me lookswise , I 'd get my ass to a gym , not browbeat my boyfriend .
Yeah , those guys who blow the equivalent of a house payment on porn have a screw or two loose , but this situation is nothing but Jerry Springer - type trailer trash drama .
What a couple of numbskulls .
They 're made for each other .
Posted by : Pirate Jo at October 31 , 2007 10:43 AM
You know , in thinking about this a bit more , I 'm just astounded .
I mean , my first reaction was " The woman is psycho . "
But it goes beyond that .
How is this any different than a man who does n't like the way you looked at someone in the mall , or the fact that you were 20 minutes late from work , or whatever other imaginary offense he comes up with , and so he starts beating the snot out of you ?
In my opinion , it 's no different , it 's the same pattern of behavior , and this man is CRAZY for putting up with her crazy ass .
Posted by : Anne at October 31 , 2007 11:27 AM
It 's the same as with women who stay with abusive men - the abuser bullies them into being dependent on their approval , and believing they should be grateful to have them .
I think the only significant difference between the sexes in this area is that by now most male abusers are aware that society looks down on their behaviour , and are n't so shameless about it .
Posted by : Paddybrown at October 31 , 2007 12:48 PM
This woman validates for me a social mindset I see happening in our current society ;
The sexes do n't came from different planets ( The Venus - Mars thing ) but from different eras .
Mens are in the Victorian era while womens are in the 21st century Back in the Victorian era , it was of custom to protect women from anything remotely sexual or shocking .
It was also well - seen to believe that women were feeble being without reason , drived by emotion and prone to crisis of hysteria .
They had the legal status of a teenager and received the same leniency from the judicial system .
Of course , it is a great thing to know that those days are gone .
Now women can be firefighters , fighter pilots , C.E.O. , head of State or even serial killers .
For this , I saw a genuine and well - deserved evolution of the women status .
I see every day the direct impact of the equality of the sexes and this is one of the reasons that explain why the western societies are so in advance on the rest of the world .
In this case , I ask myself why we give so much slack when a women is violent ?
Why are we so keen to blame it on hysteria when a women slaps a men ?
If the opposite came to be , we can be sure that the men would be served with papers and incarcerated .
That letter is narcissist to the best description .
the poor bloke who landed with this hussy really need to get himself a divorce .
Posted by : Toubrouk at October 31 , 2007 1:31 PM
Its truly the nature of our society to look the other way when women act this way .
I dated a girl for a couple years who 's personality strongly resembled the woman writing in .
At first , I thought she was just kind of quirky and cute , but as time went on , I realized it was n't an act .
She was very insecure , she had control issues and she had poor self control .
This led to her becoming extremely jealous of any female friends I had , to the point where she 'd nearly start fights with them .
There was once or twice where she nearly picked fights with her own friends over her own insecurities .
She would also throw control - tantrums .
She 'd pick unwinnable fights , just to feel like she could control the relationship .
She even tried throwing things and hitting once ( I made it clear to her that the next time she attempted anything like that would be the last time she saw me ) .
What I learned from this is that you can't change someone like this .
They 've got too many issues and are too resistant to change .
Even if you think you can work it out , its unlikely that you will be able to .
Stay away from people like this , you 'll be much happier in the end .
Posted by : Joe at October 31 , 2007 1:43 PM
Wow , I 've only just been shown this column for the first time , and I 'm impressed .
I am living with a man who has only recently escaped from an abusive marriage .
He stayed married for 13 years because he basically had the choice to stay , or to leave and lose his children .
That 's an even tougher choice than most women have , because most of the time women get custody no matter what their circumstances .
I would like to thank you for speaking out against abusive women .
She is still doing everything she can to control our lives .
He can't ignore her because of the children , but suddenly every single thing she wants is about the children .
The thing that worries me ?
What lessons is she teaching her children .

Come on .
FYI , I rarely give the advice to " get therapy " ( I mean , who ca n't figure out that that 's an option without writing to me ? ) but this is n't going to go anywhere good if they continue as they are on their own .
I advised that because a therapist will be able to tell her how sick she 's being , and has been .
She needs outside intervention .
Posted by : Amy Alkon at October 31 , 2007 3:44 PM
Yeesh .
The scary part is , I can easily imagine a friend of mine 's girlfriend writing a letter like that , or losing her freaking mind over a strip club visit like that .
Personally , I 'd be kinda happy if my fiancé saw a stripper before we got married .
Maybe it'd give her something to fantasize about a little bit , to make our wedding night a bit spicier .
No harm in that , is there ?
I 'm not saying she should squeeze her eyes shut and pretend I 'm the stripper - I 'm just saying that stuff like that can boost a couple 's libidos .
Maybe the woman who wrote this letter is n't ready for the commitment of marriage .
It sounds like she 's WAY too scared of being dumped .
She needs to get her head together before she imposes that kind of baggage on her poor husband .
Posted by : RJ at October 31 , 2007 4:21 PM
Read Jim Goads SHIT MAGNET sometime .
He spent 2 and a 1 / 2 yrs in the pen for defending himself against a psychotic girlfriend ( OK he put 32 stitches in her face , but she did decide to start it .
He merely finished it . )
While in the pen he met several guys who were in for the same reason , including a guard who had a girlfriend put roughly the same number of stitches in his face .
Women almost never go to the pen for this ; it 's almost always the man .
The statistics back this up .

" I hate the whole stripper thing " !?
Maybe he does n't .. problem number one .. it 's his stag - do not yours .. so maybe that 's something you need to sort out before you get married !
It seems like a petty reason to deck someone with an ashtray .

My marriage is a nightmare , but at least I have an understanding with my wife .
She throws stuff at me , I get to throw stuff at her .
I do n't let any time pass , either .
If she calls me a bastard , I call her a bitch .
She cries , which carves my heart out , but she gets the idea really quick that there will be no double standard in our marriage .
We 've been married 15 long years , and although I do n't like our marriage , I do n't know what to do .
We do treat each other with wary respect , but there is no closeness .
Once the kids grow up and move out I 'll have nothing to hold me here anymore .
God help me I do n't hate her , but I 'll be damned if I 'll let anyone abuse me .
Posted by : A. Nonymous at November 1 , 2007 12:18 AM
Thank you Amy for lifting the fog on this subject .
My ex-GF would throw things , scream obscenities , call names -- all classic signs of an abuser IF THE ABUSER WERE MALE .
She not only did n't see her behavior as emotionally and physically abusive , she convinced herself that I was abusing her and " made " her throw things !
When I eventually realized what sort of relationship I was in , I found that most of the abuse hotlines just blew me off .
The one for my home state , for example , sounded bored and suggested that female on male abuse was no big deal and that I would n't get any help from them .
Nice .
Real nice .

I 'm completely against violence .
And I do n't condone this woman 's ridiculous pent up anger .
However , these commenters are quick to assume she 's " prone " to violence , or tantrums .
We do n't know her history .
We only know this .
You can't base your judgments on assumptions .
Second , while some of us do n't mind strip clubs , it really bothered her .
It 's something he agreed to forgo her , PLUS , he made an agreement .
Agreement is an agreement , no matter what the content .
Also , it was specific .
They agreed on that night no strip clubs .
So , him breaking it was a big deal .
But he was truly sorry .
She should have forgiven him and moved on .
RE : Nightmare Marriage , eye for an eye is n't a solution .
Violence is wrong .
Retribution is juvenile .
You 're complicit in being violent .
You do n't have to hate your wife to move on without her .

" My husband of two months has always treated me very well , and is usually thoughtful . " ..
Has anything really changed ?
Apart from this one incident !
It seems to me that the hurt lies in the fact that the husband broke a promise to his wife .
This has damaged the ' trust ' that is necessary in any relationship .
The couple will need to work hard to rebuild that trust .
There is also a question of ' control ' of the relationship here .
It does seem as if the woman wants to be in control of the relationship and of her husband 's behavior .
Why does she ' keep bringing this up ' is it just to see her husband ' begging for forgiveness ' ?
A healthy relationship is one in which one partner does not try to take control .
This couple would seem to have much to work through to build their relationship on healthy and happy grounds .

You asked : I 've never really understood why men are drawn to obviously psychotic women .
Might sound like a lame explanation , but there 's a stereotype among men that psychos are really good in bed .
Ca n't say I 've always found that to be the case -- neither can I say that it 's completely unfounded .
Plus , psychos tend to be out at night more often and , superficially , more outgoing / less timid in showing sexual interest .
Also , they never seem to have boyfriends , which should n't be particularly surprising .
As for why some men will date or , more importantly , keep dating ( or even marry ?!) psychos --I do n't have any idea .
In my case , I only dated one ( " dated " as in for a few months ) out - and - out wrist - slitting psycho and that mostly had to do with a common interest in early - twenties substance - abuse .
The unpredictable crying , begging , screaming and accusing was taxing enough .
When that same nut tried to stab me , I cashed in and left the casino ( sobered up ) , never to gamble like that again .

Time for the women to learn that standards on domestic violence will not be different for them .
Men , if your wife or girlfriend hits you , call the police .
It 's not the end of your relationship or marriage .
It 's just a wake - up call so that your significant other understands that in a modern society there 's no room for violence .
It 's really time for men to calmly pick up the phone and call the police .
Be a man .
Pick up the phone and call the cops on a physically abusive wife or girlfriend .

I 'm not condoning the mad bitch for one second , but ...
If the original letter had said ; " My fiancé did something on his stag night that he 'd promised not to do .
I found out and got quite upset about this betrayal of trust .
We went ahead with the marriage because I thought I would deal with this and move on , but 2 months later I find that I can't get over the basic fact that my Husband ( as he is now ) went against my specifically defined wishes and his own word "
Would you still be calling her a nutter ?
OK so she threw things at him , which is n't a really smart thing to do , worse that that she 's ADMITTED throwing things at him , which really is n't a smart thing to do - especially on the internet .
Maybe this is a first for her and the reason she giving him such a hard time is because she can't quite get over her own reaction ?
Though of course she should just be a psychopath !

A few years back , I dated a woman who had a major thing about strip joints .
Now , I ’m hardly someone who frequents strip clubs , and I had n’t been in one for years before I met this woman , and I never really gave them much thought .
Anyway , we ’d been dating for about three months .
It was already clear to me that she was somewhat “ emotional ” ( for want of a better word ) but there was a lot of stuff about her that I genuinely liked and admired , which kind of offset the jealously and clinging behavior .
So , we ’re walking along the street one night on the way to dinner at one of my favorite restaurants , and she says “ I was listening to Howard Stern the other day … ” .
OK , that ’s surprise right there .
She never really struck me as the Howard Stern type .
Quite the opposite .
She lost a couple of points right there .
She continues .
“ And he was asking callers what they would do if they could spend a day naked in a hot tub with a bunch of strippers .
If they wanted to do it , he ’d arrange it for them . ”
OK , I said , sounds like the kind of thing Stern does on his show .
“ So , ” she said , “ what would you do if he called you with that proposal ? ”
This is where I stepped into the minefield .
My mistake was in not taking the question seriously .
I really , honestly , thought she was joking .
I mean , asking that is in the same category as asking whether , if I won the lottery , I ’d buy her the Hope Diamond or something .
It ’s not something that is going to happen in the real world .
And one is not expected to answer in a realistic manner .
So I said something like “ sounds good to me . ” Good God .
The night was shot , right then and there .
She ranted about how she could never trust me , how we were going to have to do a lot of work to restore trust ( that ’s always a dead giveaway that a woman is a nut case – talking about the “ work ” that must be done to restore “ broken trust ” .
It really means that the man will have to toe the line for the rest of his fucking life ) .
There was a crying jag in the restaurant ( every man ’s nightmare and one of a psycho woman ’s best weapons – making a scene ) .
On the way out of the restaurant , just as we exited , she said she was going to go back and use the ladies ’ room .
Fine , I said , I ’ll wait here and have a smoke .
I lit up and tried to relax .
Then disaster struck .
A woman approached me and asked me for a cigarette .
I gave her one .
She asked me for a light .
As I was giving her a light , my dinner companion exited the restaurant and observed me lighting up the smoke .
You would have thought she ’d come out of the restaurant and found me getting a blowjob from another woman .
The weeping , the ranting , the crying about “ broken trust , ” and so on .
Apparently I was obviously flirting with the woman who bummed a smoke off me .
And , since I was doing it right in front of my dinner companion , I was obviously intentionally doing it to humiliate her .
Finally , I gave up .
I said that I was going home .
Alone .
Maybe things would be calmer the next day .
They were n’t .
The weeping , shouting looniness went on for three days .
At which point I broke up with her .
Funny postscript – about six months ago , I met my sister for dinner in a restaurant in my city ( she lives in the suburbs of the same city ) .
After dinner , she had plenty of time before she had to catch her train ( she ’d taken the train rather than drive in so she could have wine with dinner ) .
We thought we ’d have a drink at a place I knew nearby .
For some odd reason it was closed .
However , the strip joint around the corner was n’t .
So , what the heck .
In we went .
It was a weeknight , and the place was pretty quiet .
So we sat down at the bar and ordered drinks and talked .
Some of the girls working the place approached us .
I think they thought we were a couple looking for adventure .
When they found out we were brother and sister , they actually thought it was kind of cool , and we ended up hanging out with a couple of the strippers for a while .
And they were n’t even trying to hustle us for drinks .
The bartender ended up giving the strippers , me and my sister free drinks for the rest of the evening .

Hmm ...
I would have called off the wedding after the ashtray incident .
That woman is clearly out of her mind .
There are other ways at solving " differences " like that .
And how that they be a happily married couple after what happened ?
I 'd start to fear for my life if I were in the guy 's shoes .
obviously a rage of frustration by a feminist .
Have a happy life , for as long as you will live while being with that woman .

A. Nonymous ' post struck a chord and I am saddened to see this .
The only positive validation of my decision to have a kid was that it finally made me realize that I could n't stay where I was .
Did I really want my son to grow up seeing how I was treated and think that was the proper way to treat a woman ?
Or that the type of relationship my ex and I had was how it should be ?
While I think staying together for the kids when two people just do n't have the hots for each other anymore is OK , when there is abuse , either way , of any sort , I do n't think you 've got a good environment for raising kids .

" obviously a rage of frustration by a feminist "
Her violent rage and lack of self - control has nothing to do with her assumed social ideology .
Posted by : Chrissy at November 1 , 2007 9:02 AM
True , Chrissy .
Many feminists are on the " right " side , here .
There are plenty of women who do n't call themselves feminists but feel a sense of entitlement -- that they can do anything because they 're " ladies " and true " gentlemen " should be at their beck and call .
Steve : " Might sound like a lame explanation , but there 's a stereotype among men that psychos are really good in bed . " ... which goes back to how we put sex on such a high pedestal that some deluded schmoes feel that they should put up with someone who is hostile and violent if they can get some really good " action " along with it .
Sad.
John : " When I eventually realized what sort of relationship I was in , I found that most of the abuse hotlines just blew me off .
The one for my home state , for example , sounded bored and suggested that female on male abuse was no big deal and that I would n't get any help from them . "
By the way , John , there are resources for both men and women .

Sc00 by asks : " If the original letter had said ; " My fiancé did something on his stag night that he 'd promised not to do .

Would you still be calling her a nutter ? "
First , that 's not what it said .
You 're asking about some hypothetical different letter that was never written .
But assuming it was , it still means that this woman had a silly issue about an even sillier bachelor - party ritual and nagged the guy into some promise that , once the night got going , would be impossible to keep .
It does n't add up to a " betrayal of trust . "
Furthermore , your hypothetical letter says " I can't get over the basic fact that my Husband ( as he is now ) went against my specifically defined wishes .
. . " .
Where is it written that her husband must always follow her wishes , no matter how specifically defined ?
Must a man , upon marriage , give up all independence and surrender the right to make his own decisions about what to do with his own time ( if his new wife admits there 's any such thing as " his own time " ) ?
Sc00 by further says : " OK so she threw things at him , which is n't a really smart thing to do , worse that that she 's ADMITTED throwing things at him , which really is n't a smart thing to do - especially on the internet .
Maybe this is a first for her and the reason she giving him such a hard time is because she can't quite get over her own reaction ? "
She did n't just throw things at him .
By her own admission , she " went crazy and tossed an ashtray at his head . "
And I 'm surprised that nobody has picked up on this sentence from the letter : " All was well until I learned that he and his brother ( who ’s nothing but trouble ) were at the strip club . "
She " learned " that he and his brother were at the strip club ?
Obviously she followed them , or had them followed .
She then barged into the club , sabotaged her soon - to - be - husband 's perfectly innocent night out , assaulted him , made enough of a pain in the ass of herself so that she got thrown out of the place .
She 's a nut case .
I can't believe this poor guy not only married her , but keeps begging for forgiveness .
What a loser .
She 's got him on a short leash for the rest of his pathetic life .
One more thing .
What the hell is a " dueling piano bar " ?
And what straight guy ever had a coed bachelor party at a piano bar anyway ?
Posted by : LMM at November 1 , 2007 1:02 PM
We have a dueling piano bar here .
There are two piano's on stage and the guys take requests in the metal / pop / rock genres and do their best to pull them off .
It 's packed every weekend .
It 's a fairly rowdy and participative night where everyone is encouraged to stand on their chairs , sing along with bawdry lyric substitutions , get up on stage and participate in contests that are intended to make you drunk ( er ) , partly naked or embarassed .
I 've been told by many straight , manly men that they have a good time there .
I have seen some guy only stag parties although its more often stagettes or co-ed parties ( pre-wedding , birthday , anniversary , etc . )
So if its a similar place , its not quite as " gay " as it sounds .

I do n't normally comment , but I had to say that I am taking a sociology class on " marriage and family " and we watched a video of John Gottman giving a seminar and I was very impressed .
His theories of love and how to make relationships work seem to be not only realistic and true , but also do - able .
And when I realized my relationship contained one or two of what he calls " The Four Horsemen " I decided to have a chat with my SO and discuss our relationship .
Just thought I 'd let you know how great I think it is that you mentioned him because I think everyone could benefit from his words of wisdom .
Oh , and I agree with you 100 % .

OK , I guess that makes a bit more sense .
I 've never heard of a place like that , much less been to one .
The only kind of piano bar with which I 'm familiar is the traditional place with one piano , where men request and sing show tunes .
Usually there are n't too many women in the place .
And I simply could n't imagine a bunch of guys going there for a bachelor party .
If a man does want to go there for his " last night of freedom , " I 'd say the marriage will have bigger issues than ashtray - hurling .
Posted by : LMM at November 2 , 2007 5:58 AM
Amy , in your rush to ( rightly , IMO ) condemn the ashtray throwing , I think you missed Scooby 's point .
The idea that she " nagged the guy into some promise that , once the night got going , would be impossible to keep " is BS .
You can keep a promise like that if you want to , and if you do n't want to , then you DON'T AGREE TO IT .
Posted by : jfpbookworm at November 2 , 2007 7:36 AM
The guy has his own issues , including letting himself be pussywhipped by this woman , but this is n't a response to the guy .
I offered information at the end about what he needs to do to change -- ultimately , so he 'll be man enough to say , " You know , this is a ritual that 's harmless and that I 'm going to participate in , " and reassure the woman , blah blah blah .
Posted by : Amy Alkon at November 2 , 2007 7:44 AM
Just a comment .
I read the story and Anny ... it was HER that threw the ashtray not her husband .
This was pulled out to make him look like the bad guy in an abuse thing .
Should n't you come back and correct YOUR error ?
It 's clearly stated in her message to you that SHE threw it in a fit or rage .

Sorry , Jami , but what are you saying , and are you saying it to A. Nonymous ?
Posted by : Amy Alkon at November 2 , 2007 8:20 AM
Ben : I have to disagree with you .
Having been in that situation , it 's not the wake up call that you expect .
You will get the wake up call when she lies to the police and says you hurt her .
The other thing that happens is the cop gets pissed ( at you ) for bugging him about your girlfriend kicking your ass .
Either way , not the outcome you were looking for .
You are several orders of magnitude more likely to get arrested , no matter who the actual perpetrator was .
Even with witnesses , it is difficult to successfully prosecute a case like that .
Assuming that she is arrested , the charge will be downplayed , minimized and reduced , and ' self defense ' will come up in court .
Plus , you 're reputation will get trashed ( he was abusing me , cheating on me , doing drugs , child porn , downloading pirate movies , whatever )
If you 're married , you 'll get a restraining order .
Against you .
There may be a mutual one , but I assure you , especially if you have kids , you 'll be ousted from your own house or apartment , and made to pay for it the whole time the divorce is going on .
When the confused person from Victim Services calls you to let you know that your assailant has been released from jail , offers you a protective order because it's in the script he has to read , he 'll make the determination that you do n't really need it , and your tearful little ex will be on the front porch trying to patch things up .
At least until you drop the charges .
Then the real fun begins , because someone is out for revenge .
The next time the police are out , someone has a nice little surprise for you ...
If it happens , get out , stay out , cut off all contact .
DONT repeat my mistakes and assume there 's going to be a sincere reconciliation .
NO ONE is worth the risk , and it's too easy for you to get busted for something you did n't do .
Posted by : Wayne at November 2 , 2007 9:40 PM
So they both did something dumb .
He went to a strip club knowing that she hated it , and she threw an ashtray at him , although it does n't sound like it did very much damage .
In the course of a marriage it 's bound to happen that each partner at different times will do something stupid that really hurts and angers the other .
It 's what happens afterwards that counts , and that 's where this couple is in trouble .
Your advice is good .
They need help in learning how to handle these kinds of situations .
Posted by : Kirk at November 2 , 2007 9:47 PM
I guess what got me is that it is 2 months later , and she is still making him apologize !
Did she ever apologize to him for assaulting him ?
Well , no , because he DESERVED it for making her angry .
And her question to Amy seems to be what can HE do to help her get over this .
Umm , GET OVER IT .
And , Amy , I loved the comment about not calling off the wedding because of the catering deposit .
That probably is the reason they went ahead with the wedding .

Two issues going on here : 1 ) Strip Club issue
2 ) Violence issue Many people would not be upset by their SO going to a strip club .
This does not make them morally superior , contrary to popular belief .
Different couples have different lines they draw , and different definitions of cheating .
The LW made it clear that visiting a club was crossing the line .
It sounds like the LW and her hubby have different definitions of unacceptable behavior .
This is something they need to seriously work on and come to a consensus .
The LW is upset because she feels cheated on .
While some of us would n't have a problem with a club ( or hell , some people would n't have a problem with their spouse sleeping with someone else , ) this LW does , her hubby knew it , and they need to figure out what the boundries are as a couple .
Having said that , he knew he crossed a line , and he apologized , and she should move on .
She had some doubts , but she DID marry him , and now she needs to work out whatever conflicts they are having .
Unless it was one of those cardboard ashtrays , that was a rather psycho act .
Assuming it was metal or plastic , there is a serious lack - of - control issue thing going on here that the LW needs to work on .
She 's not going to be able to have a good marriage if she can't control her anger and rage .
LW , please go get some help for your anger .
And apologize to your hubby .
He 's already apologized to you .

Uh , yes , but to say they need to " come to a consensus " is an understatement .
She 's a violent , criminal bully , and he's a pussy who left his balls under the bed years ago .
That said , nobody , NOBODY , has any right to enact violence on their partner , no matter what the issue .
Posted by : Amy Alkon at November 4 , 2007 8:09 AM
Nicole says : " The LW is upset because she feels cheated on . "
Yes , but the LW was n't cheated on .
Her feeling that she was cheated on does n't make it so .
Emotions do n't determine truth .
Facts do .
Because something her spouse might do might make her feel bad should not give her a veto power over his every action .
If a woman feels " cheated on " because her spouse / boyfriend / whatever went to a strip joint , or looked at a porn flick , or saw a Calvin Klein ad , for pete 's sake , that 's her problem , and she should deal with it like an adult .
Posted by : LMM at November 5 , 2007 5:36 AM

Also a quick note : please note that the advice given was to the abusER , not the abusEE .
Your advice to get an annulment would be great for the guy who had an ashtray winged at his head .
Not so much for the woman , she has no reason to get an annulment .
Although it would be a blessing in disguise for the man , I 'm sure .

So his " trouble - maker " brother got him loaded and brought him to the strip club next door to where his " co-ed bachelor party " ( an oxymoron if I ever heard one ) was taking place .
So what 's the problem ??
" Promise " or not , she should 've known better than to even ask him not to go .
I 'm stunned she was actually so upset about it she made a scene ...
Granted , as long as she can reduce him to a groveling , quivering mass of guilt - laden mush every time she brings it up , she 'll do it .
When he stops feeling guilty , she 'll stop being angry ... until she finds something else to castrate him over .
Bitches are like that .

Amy and all others posting on this should read this article .
http://www.molokaitimes.com/articles/731312226.asp
I was in an abusive marriage and those thinking men date these women under the belief they are good in bed or etc are wrong .
Usually these women KNOW and play on your emotions and the laws and even society .
One minute they will be yelling and attacking you , the next crying and pulling at you begging to be forgiven and unless you follow their desires , plan on false accusations and society doing EXACTLY as they want .
I stayed for years to protect my children who I knew she would get if I left no matter the reasons or situation and she also knew I had little chance of getting them so used that card constantly .
Posted by : QED at November 11 , 2007 1:20 PM
The problem is letting it get to the point where there are kids .
While I 'm sorry to hear what you 've gone through , and find it admirable that you stayed to protect your children , just as there 's a certain mindset in a woman that allows her to stay in an abusive relationship , it is n't just any man who gets into this situation and stays , but a man with issues of self - worth and self - assertion .
Or , in relationships where the woman sticks around with an abuser , a woman with issues of self - worth and self - assertion .
It 's essential to take personal responsibility for what you allow into your life , and to really look at the person .
And at first sign of emotional blackmail , or other suck nuttery , run .
One key is not getting into relationships before you resolve all your own issues .
I do n't mean that anybody is going to be perfect , but if you get into a relationship before you feel okay being without one , you 're basically at the mercy of the person you 're involved with .

Had an experience like that .
Abusive wife , probably borderline personality .
Put up with it for sake of the kids .
Hit with things , slapped , etc. .
One night she hits me , I push her away .
Suddenly -- gawd , he dared touch me !
Calls 911 .
Of course we both get arrested .
Horrible night in the slammer , finally got charges dropped .
One guy in the cell had a story ( I checked it out and it 's true ) about how easy it is to get arrested for DV .
He had n't touched anyone .
He was cussing out his drug dealing stepkids , and one of them split his head open with a golf club .
His wife called 911 ... and he got arrested for DV !
The law classifies disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace , with a family member as domestic " violence . "
And the stepkids had split , but the officers felt compelled to arrest * somebody * whenever 911 gets a DV call , so they arrested him , took him to the ER to get staples in his scalp , and then to jail .

The reconciliation thing feeds into the romantic fantasies that both sexes have a tendency to let trick them into missing reality .
How many romantic movies or novels or whatever scenario has a couple torn up only to reconcile and live happily ever after when the ' bad ' one comes to his / her senses ?
Real life seldom if ever works like that , but that sort of ' romantic ' thinking is burned into the collective perception by popular culture .
There 's a reason why the word ' reality ' tends to get paired with words like ' cold ' and ' harsh ' and ' grim ' .

A computer containing over 171,000 confidential blood donor records and other files from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has been stolen .
The data , which the Blood Service says was securely encrypted , was given to the New York Blood centre in December on a computer disk .
It was part of a software upgrading programme for the Irish Service .
The laptop with the disk was stolen on 7 February when a member of the New York Blood Centre was mugged outside his home .
The Irish Blood Transfusion Service says it is deeply concerned at the theft and was first notified of the incident on 8 February .
It plans to issue letters later this week to each of the 171,324 donors affected to reassure them and advise them of the possibility , however remote , that their personal data might be accessed .
It also intends to contact another 3,294 patients whose hospital blood records are also involved .
An information helpline that donors can contact will operate from 8 am tomorrow morning .
The number is 1850 731 137 .
What do you get when you cross an ouroboros with a Möbius strip ?
M.C. Escher knew :
The dreaded Mouroboröbius !
Actually , it ’s just Escher ’s four - block wood engraving print Möbius Band I , circa 1961 , which gives the appearance of being both a double and a triple ouroboros / Möbius strip combo :
Two loops , two strips ; three creatures , three twists .
( It is also a left - handed trefoil knot . )
In my copy of Escher ’s The Graphic Work , the notes to this piece ( which notes I believe are written by Escher himself ) mention that the three creatures depicted are in fact supposed to be … fish ?
( The dreaded ichthyoboros ? )
An endless band has been cut through , down its whole length .
The two sections have been drawn apart from each other a little , so that a clear space divides them all the way round .
Thus the band ought to fall apart into two unattached rings , and yet apparently it consists of one single strip , made up of three fish , each biting the tail of the one in front .
They go round twice before regaining their point of departure .
Escher ’s other ouroboros : Dragon , circa 1952 .
Thirstier World Likely to See More Violence
By Stephen Leahy
Mar 16 ( IPS ) – A strong link between droughts and violent civil conflicts in the developing world bodes ill for an increasingly thirsty world , say scientists , who warn that drought - related conflicts are expected to multiply with advancing climate change .
“ Severe , prolonged droughts are the strongest indicator of high - intensity conflicts , ” said Marc Levy of the Centre for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University ’s Earth Institute in New York .
These are internal conflicts , not between countries , and involving more than 1,000 battle deaths , Levy said at a press briefing in Washington last week .
Such conflicts tend to occur about a year after a “ severe deviation in rainfall patterns ” , he said .
Levy and colleagues used decades of detailed precipitation records , geospatial conflict information and other data in a complex computer model that overlays all this onto a fine - scale map of the world .
“ Major deviations from normal rainfall patterns were the strongest predictor of conflicts , ” he said .
“ I was surprised at how strong the correlation is . ”

Intelligence agencies will only be allowed to collect data secretly from suspects ' computer hard drives if there is evidence that " legally protected interests , " like human lives or state property , are in danger , the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe announced .
Law enforcement authorities must get permission from a judge before they secretly upload spyware to a suspect 's computer via e-mail , the court said .
Furthermore , personal data may not be collected or evaluated in an investigation .
Wednesday 's decision voided a broadly formulated law in the western German state of North Rhine - Westphalia , which had explicitly allowed the use of Trojan software since January 2007 .
The law did not adequately uphold the basic rights of those under investigation , the judges concluded in their 106 - page report .
New rights for Internet age
Can computer surveillance help fight terrorism ?
The ruling came after former state Interior Minister Gerhart Baum , two lawyers and a journalist had protested against the state law .
However , head judge Hans - Juergen Papier emphasized that the case had wider implications .
It effectively leaves the door open to federal authorities , who had halted all online searches until the state ruling came , to spy on computers in a limited manner .
With the decision to restrict online investigations , the Constitutional Court had for the first time established the " basic right to the protection of confidentiality and integrity in information systems , " said Papier .
Police online investigations have been hotly disputed in Germany since Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called for computer searches in response to a foiled Islamic terrorist attack planned on a German train in 2006 .
A handful of online searches have been conducted in Germany since 2005 .
Crime versus privacy
Proponents , including Schaeuble and Chancellor Angela Merkel , have defended police spyware as a useful tool to fight terrorism .
According to the Interior Ministry , evidence is growing that Islamist militants use the Internet to recruit and train potential terrorists .
" In order to be able to protect citizens , the security authorities have to keep up with the technological developments of the offenders by using modern IT technology and professionally encoded communication , " said Schaeuble on Wednesday in response to the ruling .
Spyware opponents say that the method is a violation of individual privacy rights .
" Secret access to the entire hard drive is a new kind of attack on basic rights -- even more far - reaching than a massive bugging operation , " said Gerhart Baum previously , as reported by German public broadcaster ARD 's online news site .
Data protection is a particularly sensitive topic in Germany , where both the Nazi Gestapo and the East German Stasi implemented invasive surveillance methods .

Having declared victory in his battle to save Christmas , Bill O'Reilly has decided to direct his " Culture Warrior " bravery to saving Christians .
Laura Ingraham ( whom , we must remember , got this gig because even Malkin could n't stomach it any longer ) is brought on to agree with Bill that the left and the media are out to get them .
The trigger of this insane rant ?
This op - ed column in the Seattle Post - Intelligencer which points out some of Mike Huckabee 's more regressive statements .
Funnily enough , as Newshounds points out , after blaming the left and the media for attacking Huckabee for being a Christian , O'Reilly went ahead and attacked Huckabee himself .
Hypocrite much , Bill ?
Oh ... wait , look who I 'm talking about .
My bad .
BOR : It 's not just the Democrats against the Republicans this year , Laura .
And I think you understand that .
LI : Sure .
BOR : It 's the Democrats AND the media against the Republicans .
And the media is its own entity .
It does n't confer with the Democrats .
They 're not like calling each other up .
The media is made to say , " Okay how can we destroy whoever we have to destroy , where can we go , what is their vulnerability ? "
And right now , their vulnerability is ' make them all out to be religious nuts ' and that 's what they 're doing .
Actually , Bill , with you as their spokesman , I do n't think the left or the media has to do very much to bring out the nuttiness .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The government said Wednesday it would ban the sale of samurai swords because the weapons had been used in a number of serious , high - profile attacks .
The Home Office said the swords would be added to the Offensive Weapons Order from April next year , meaning they could not be imported , sold or hired .
However collectors of genuine Japanese swords and those used by martial arts enthusiasts would be exempt from the ban .
“ In the wrong hands , samurai swords are dangerous weapons , ” Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker said .
“ We recognize it is the cheap , easily available samurai swords which are being used in crime and not the genuine more expensive samurai swords which are of interest to collectors and martial arts enthusiasts . ”
The Association of Chief Police Officers said the swords were not a common weapon but they had been used in a number of significant incidents .
In 2000 , Robert Ashman murdered a Liberal Democrat councilor at the offices of Cheltenham MP Nigel Jones , who was also seriously hurt in the attack .
A year earlier , Eden Strang seriously wounded 11 people when he went on the rampage with a samurai sword at a Roman Catholic Church near his home in Thornton Heath , south London .
“ There are many regrets that I ’m not a citizen of New Hampshire and a member of its Legislature , but my chief regret tonight is that I ’m not allowed to vote for Betty Hall ’s House Resolution 24 to commence impeachment procedures in the U.S. Congress .
At our founding , New Hampshire was essential .
At our preservation , it is even more so .
Vote to impeach to restore our unique democracy . ”
– Edward Asner
By Lauren R. Dorgan / Concord Monitor —
Activists from as far away as Michigan and as close as Warner clutched their pocket - sized U.S. Constitutions and crowded into a State House hearing yesterday on a proposed resolution that would request Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Even Hollywood chimed in :
An organizer read a statement he said was from Ed Asner , the liberal actor best known as Mr. Grant on the Mary Tyler Moore Show .
Asner conveyed regrets “ that I am not a citizen of New Hampshire , ” according to a statement read by Stuart Hutchison , who leads a New Jersey - based anti-impeachment group .
“ At our founding , New Hampshire is essential , ” Hutchison read .
“ At our preservation , New Hampshire is even more so . ”
The resolution was proposed by Rep. Betty Hall , a Brookline Democrat .
It lays out a case that Bush and Cheney violated treaties “ by invading Iraq without just cause or provocation ” and misled American lawmakers to make their case .
It claims that the federal government ’s warrantless wiretapping , detentions of “ enemy combatants ” at Guantanamo and use of torture on terrorism suspects are due cause to impeach Bush .
Hall argued that the nation ’s founders intended impeachment as a tool when other checks and balances failed .
“ They did n’t know there could be such a thing as shock and awe , used to start an illegal war , but they knew there would be illegal wars , ” Hall said .
About 100 people crammed into a State House hearing yesterday , many of them gray - headed , most of them appearing in favor in the bill .
There were a few opponents .
Rep. David Hess , a Hooksett Republican , said he spoke for his party ’s leadership in opposition to the bill .
“ I have never seen a document more vitriolic and more inflammatory , ” Hess said .
He said he did n’t see evidence – and “ I ’m not talking about a statement anybody could write in Vermont or San Francisco . ”
Hess specifically challenged several portions , including the paragraph about Bush ’s use of “ signing statements , ” documents with which Bush claims the right to disobey laws he ’s signed because he thinks they ’re unconstitutional .
“ I do n’t know what signing statements are , ” Hess said , prompting clucking and laughter from the audience .
Meanwhile , a man in the corner intently planned his testimony , penciling in all - caps phrases FREE ELECTIONS and SECRET COURT .
Several people testified about their efforts to support a pro-impeachment movement in Vermont ; one woman said she was now working for an effort that hoped to bring “ the ( Dennis ) Kucinich camp and the Ron Pauls together . ”
The hearing quickly became a discussion of national malaise , with many telling the committee that the country is n’t the same as it was when were young , with speakers cited everything from confidence in foreign policy to toy safety .
“ I ’ve watched my country change in the last years for the worse , ” said Gail Mitchell of Barrington .
Later , she listed off some changes that worry her : “ Food , homes , jobs , safety , health care . ”
For others , the hearing was about history .
Various speakers brought up the Revolutionary War , the Civil War , World War I and World War II to argue either that Bush ’s actions have historical precedent or that he is beyond all precedent .
Nan Stearns of Amherst said she came with a group she founded , Women Making a Difference , or WMD .
“ The war is wrong .
Torture is wrong , ” Stearns said .
“ I ca n’t think of anything the Bush administration has done right except bring those of us who are here today together . ”
The committee is scheduled to vote on the bill today .
( Be sure and read the introduction and Part I or you can listen to the sermon in its entirety . )
Look with me at Matthew 23:13 - 15 .
Matthew 23 concludes some rather contentious sections in this Gospel where Jesus and the Pharisees are standing toe - to - toe during the week of the Passover .
They ask Jesus difficult questions about the Law , but Jesus answers them in a way that cuts through the question to the heart and the motive of the matter .
They became ones who were experts in the law and the doctrine of the Scriptures
“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites !
For you tithe mint and dill and cumin , and have neglected the weightier matters of the law : justice and mercy and faithfulness .
These you ought to have done , without neglecting the others . [ 24 ]
You blind guides , straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel !
Only heaven truly knows the damage this type of thinking does and the type of hurt this inflicts .
When we find ourselves becoming more concerned about majoring on the minors than on the majors — which is ministering the name of Christ by loving them in Christ .
When we find ourselves speaking truth , believing truth , and dispensing truth with a cold and calculated heart and not the warmth of the love of Christ , we risk dispensing hurt and heartache that will in the end drive people away from the church .
But how many souls have been injured by hypocritical spirits who say one thing and live another way ?
Many who bring charges like this against churches and Christians do so because of something painful that happened in the past .
Author James Spiegel relays a time when he was a teenager .
He and his friend made money cutting grass in their neighborhood .
On one occasion a friend and I approached a man who lived across the street from my house and asked him if he would allow us to cut his lawn .
He agreed and offered to pay us $ 25 for the job , nothing that he would be gone for the weekend and would therefore pay us upon his return .
That Saturday my friend and I worked for several hours , but because it was a rather large lawn , we had to finish it on Sunday .
The next day we returned to obtain our wages from the man .
In hopes that he would be impressed by our labor , we informed him that it took us two days to get the job done .
“ Two days ? ” he asked .
“ You mean to tell me that you mowed my lawn on Sunday ? ”
We nodded .
“ Well , boys , I do n’t allow work to be done at my house on Sundays .
I ca n’t pay you . ”
We watched him as he dug into his pocket and pulled out approximately two dollars in change .
He handed it to us , saying , “ I ’m doing this out of the kindness of my heart . ”
In stunned silence my friend and I sauntered back into my house and informed my father as to what had just transpired .
He was irate .
“ Hypocrites … lousy hypocrites ! ” he bellowed .
“ They smile so sweetly and look so righteous at church , but in the real world they ’re nothing but swindlers and cheats . ” [ 1 ]
This story is pretty true - to - form to many other stories those in our cultures have about how Christians say one thing and practice another in their relationships .
While they may overstate things about how all Christians look righteous but are actually cheats , instead of us simply looking at what they are saying , we need to see what ’s behind it : a lot of hurt and betrayal of trust by people who promise to love and care , but who did n’t follow through on that .
All of us know of people who may not come to our churches for various reasons , do n’t we ?
They may be members of our churches .
Yet , they just do n’t come .
If you were to invite them , some of them may respond to you that they just do n’t like “ Institutional religion ” or “ I just ca n’t stand all those hypocrites up there . ”
Do n’t blow them off !
Do n’t write them off as not worth your time .
There is a deeper hurt that ’s there and we as the body of Christ and for the sake of their souls need to seek and find exactly what the issue is so healing can commence .

Cool Piggy Banks : An Illustrated Guide To Savings Devices
This is the type of stuff that wakes up the collector in me .
Want to teach your kids the value of a buck ?
Well there are a lot of ways to do it and we present you some of the more creative approaches .
What do you think of a bank that explodes if you do n’t save often enough ?
These new - fangled banks are much more interactive nowadays and use all kinds of incentives to get you to save , including the fear factor !
This gave me the idea of featuring some of the most interesting saving advices here for your amusement .
Since I ’m on the lookout for something fun and entertaining enough to help me broach the subject of basic finance to my young school - age child , I ’ll most likely pick out one of these banks as a Christmas gift .
Heck , I may get a few more as gifts to all the other young kids I know ( I have a huge extended family ) ! 🙂
So here it is in all its glory ….
the Illustrated Guide To Fun Novelty Piggy Banks for the Young and Old !
Banks with Counters
Most innovative piggy banks seem to come manufactured from Japan , the home of some of the coolest gizmos , gadgets and really interesting novelty items out there , and a country whose citizens pride themselves on having a historically impressive savings rate .
This bank counts your yen ( yes , unfortunately it only takes Japanese currency ) giving you some idea of how much you ’ve already saved .
You can screw this “ Life Bank One ” counter on a bottle top and drop your coins to activate the counter .
The Life Bank One Yen Counter
For U.S. coinage , you ’ll have to turn to this Pig E Bank , which only recognizes and counts pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters .
Here ’s another coin counter which , as far as I know , does not discriminate and accepts any currency : the DigiBANK comes styled as an attractive pig or panda ( again made in Japan ) .
It shows a running total of what you ’ve saved so far , on its LCD screen .
Digibank Pig and Panda
Coin Eating Banks
This is the type of bank that will pique my kids ’ attention .
Banks that eat your coins may not possess the highest educational value ( say , compared to the Money Savvy Cow or Pig ) , but it ’s pure entertainment and will no doubt keep my child shoving coins in them any chance he gets .
These colorful Gobble Monster Banks are true to their name .
Visit this video for a demo of how these banks work .
Gobble Monster Banks
If you ’re looking for something different , oddly humorous and provides a bit of action , this creepy bank with a face may be for you .
This one is highly interactive and I ’m on the hunt for this item as a gift for my older child this Christmas .
But after seeing these various videos where I caught sight of its beady eyes , I ’m having second thoughts …
What do you think ?
It ’s been called “ peculiar ” , “ bizarre ” , even “ disturbing ” — it sort of is , when it ’s doing its thing .
Banpresto’s Face Bank
Banks That Hold You Hostage
These banks try to coax you into saving money by “ threatening ” you to comply to its wishes or else it does something “ naughty ” .
Would you be “ scared ” or irritated enough to feed your bank a coin or two to stop it from acting up ?
The Banclock claims to be a devious combination of Bank and Alarm Clock .
It performs a dual function by acting as a clock and sounding its alarm whenever you set it to go ( should be a good thing to get you out of bed ) .
You can only shut it up by feeding it a coin .
Personal Bank + Alarm Clock = Banclock
Tomy ’s Exploding Bank is one of the most innovative banks that have hit Japan recently , requiring you to add coins to it regularly ( e.g. every day ) or it decides to blow itself up .
If you fail to save any money through this bank for a period of time , it explodes — leaving you with scattered coins .
As the company claims : “ Users must pick up and collect the scattered coins and reflect on their laziness . ”
Fun concept , which you can see in action here .
Tomy ’s Savings Bomb , The Exploding Bank
Here ’s another bomb - shaped bank called the ‘ Superbitus ’ Bomb Bank a creation from Art Lebedev Studios .
It is described by its designer as “ a one - piece bomb - shaped plaster - made money - saving box . ”
Anyway , you can buy these bomb - shaped banks , write your goals on them then when you ’re ready to get the money from within , you break the banks by “ dropping the bomb ” .
I ’m not sure if they ’re art pieces or real banks — maybe both , but I fail to see how useful they can be if they can only be used once : it ’s somewhat annoying since you can only get your money out of it by breaking it open .
Another downside : expense — especially if you decide to use one bank per goal or get a new one after you drop it on its nose .

Banks That Simulate Life
I suppose this was an attempt to appeal to little boys or sci - fi fans out there .
Why not take a sinister looking robot and turn it into a talking bank ?
Robby
The Robot is the thing on the left — “ it talks fast , tells the time and takes your spare change . ”
It mutters classic movie lines it quotes from its participation in the 50’s show “ The Forbidden Planet ” — a fun blast from the past .
The gizmo on the right is from Sharper Image and is another talking robot bank that — surprise , surprise ( ! ) — ALSO talks , counts and tells time but has more juvenile , mundane language .
There seems to be no shortage of these things around .

Now that we tackled robot banks , why not check out the bank inspired by the popular Japanese virtual pet ( remember the Tamagotchi ) ?
The Jinsei Ginkou ( or Bank of Life ) from Takara Tomy is also called the “ Tamagotchi Bank ” since it has one of those console looking screens that reflects the virtual lifestyle of a virtual man .
When the bank is empty , the man lives in a tiny , unkempt hovel and as you add more money to the bank , the virtual character on the screen starts upgrading his environment all the way to a fancy apartment .
I used to own a Tamagotchi trinket not very long ago — it was one of those things I had to own out of curiosity :) .

Banks With Secret Keys
You ca n’t get your money from these banks unless you hold the key .
These are standard ATM banks that require you to have a PIN number to access .
They ’re great because they can take all sorts of currency : coins , cash , bills , etc .
Try Amazon for a whole slew of ATM style savings gadgets such as this one .
Or how about something more challenging , like a Wooden Bank Puzzle ?
I ’ve seen a few complicated ones from some puzzle catalogs and I ’ve been tempted to get one in the past .
But I ’m afraid I ’ll stick some money in and failing to solve the puzzle , be unable to get my money out afterward .
Might be nice for puzzle lovers who like the Rubiks Cube !
Along these lines is this piggy bank in reverse , because it ’s a Piggy Bank Puzzle that comes already broken into pieces and you ’re supposed to put it back together using glue .
Probably great for those arts and crafts types out there but I ’m not sure if it ’s still available .

I think these would be great gift ideas for the kids in your life or those who are kids at heart .
If there are other ingenious piggy banks out there you know about , I ’d be delighted to hear about it .

Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa , appealed yesterday to Jews to challenge what he described as the Israeli government 's oppression of Palestinians .
In a lengthy and emotional address to a packed Old South Church , where the faint din of pro-Israel protesters could be heard through the stone walls , Tutu cited passages from the Hebrew Bible to argue that the God worshiped by Jews would champion the cause of Palestinians .
" Remembering what happened to you in Egypt and much more recently in Germany - remember , and act appropriately , " he said , alluding to the enslavement of Jews in Egypt described in the book of Exodus , as well as to the Nazi Holocaust .
" If you reject your calling , you may survive for a long time , but you will find it is all corrosive inside , and one day you will implode . "
His remarks , to a congregation of about 850 , created controversy even before they were delivered .
A wide array of Jewish community leaders and organizations denounced Sabeel , the Palestinian Christian organization that put together the conference at which Tutu spoke , as anti-Israel , and rued Tutu 's support of the group .
About 200 people protested the conference on Friday ; yesterday , the Jewish Sabbath , the protest was smaller , with a few dozen people holding signs and shouting from the corner of Boylston and Dartmouth streets .
The pro-Israel demonstrators said Tutu 's comparison of Israel to apartheid in South Africa was unfair because Israel is a democracy where Arabs have rights .
" That conference is bad for peace , it 's bad for America , it 's bad for Israel , and it's bad for the Palestinians , " Steve Grossman , a Democratic activist who is chairman of the Jewish Community Relations Council 's Israel Action Center advisory board , said Friday .
" Israel wants peace , regardless of the falsehoods and misrepresentations which will be heard at Old South Church this weekend . "
Tutu , 76 , was frail but defiant .
After the conference , he joined a pro-Palestinian rally in Copley Square at which Israel was denounced as an apartheid state .
Noting that the rally was sponsored by a group called Jewish Voice for Peace , he said , " You are sometimes vilified as self - hating Jews , but thank you for standing up for the truth . "
The rally was attended by a few hundred people ; hundreds more carrying peace flags walked by as part of a march against the Iraq war .
During his speech in the church , Tutu said the Israeli government is in some respects worse than the South African apartheid government , citing what he described as the Israeli government 's use of " collective punishment " of Palestinians .
At a press conference before his speech , Tutu criticized the Israeli government for brutality and what he described as " gross violations of human rights . "
But his remarks inside the church were aimed directly at Jews .
He said he was delivering " a cri de coeur , a cry of anguish from the heart , an impassioned plea to my spiritual relatives , the noble offspring of Abraham like me - please hear the call , the noble call of your scriptures , of our scriptures , to be with the God of the Exodus who took the side of a bunch of slaves against the powerful pharaoh . "
" Jews are indispensable for a good , compassionate , just , and caring world , " he said .
" And so are Palestinians . "

( Correction : Because of a reporting error , a story in Sunday 's City & Region section about Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's speech to the Sabeel Conference in Boston said that pro-Israel protesters could be heard inside the hall .
While chants from the street could be heard , it was not possible to discern their source , and protesters with a variety of agendas were gathered outside the Old South Church , where the conference was held . )

I want to highlight a couple of things that Bob Warfield has pointed out in a recent blog entry on the “ small vs large ” team size debate .
My very small experiences observing and participating in development projects in the thick of the small and medium sized business environment have lead me to suspect these things , but it ’s always good to hear someone that can articulate this stuff concisely :
“ There are two ways to think about this .
Chris takes the path that says the example is irrelevant because most software is n’t that way .
I take the path of saying that the example is spot on because all software should become a language if done right .
The benefit ?
Your small team is enormously more productive as are your customers if you can actually make the language something they can grasp and use .
There is a reason these small teams built languages ( though I ’m not sure I view Linus as a tool / language ) .
In fact , Quattro Pro had no less than 18 interpreters buried in the guts .
Very few of them were surfaced for end users , most were there to make the code simpler and the product more powerful . ”
So if you ’re building something complex that has to meet a lot of different people ’s needs ( and whose needs are constantly changing ) then you need to see through the cloud of conflicting requirements to the generic tools that would enable solutions to actually emerge .
And the most powerful tools are actually going to be languages .
“ Do n’t kid yourself that a giant team running around gathering requirements and hacking out use cases in monolithic modules is building software , business or otherwise .
It ’s creating an unmaintainable mess that makes nobody but the IT guys that assembled that laundry list happy .
Certainly the business users who it lands on are going to find it is n’t what they thought they were getting and it is almost impossible to change it into what they wanted . ”
If we solve today ’s problem , we ’re hosed .
Today ’s problem is n’t the real problem … it ’s just one iteration of it .
So we should n’t give into the temptation to “ hard code ” stuff for the check - list people just to please them in the short term .
The requirements and use cases of today have to be expressed in terms of our tools and linguistic abstractions : we need to invest efforts in expanding their scope and expressiveness .

The murder of Bobby Litambola , 17 , attacked in the street in Canning Town , east London , last Saturday , brought to 24 the tally of young people under 18 who have been killed this year in knife or gun crime in London .
The vast majority of these murders take place in the capital , but others have died elsewhere in the country .
In August , 11 - year - old Rhys Jones was shot and killed in Liverpool , apparently in error .
These children have more in common than their youth , and the violence of their deaths .
Though investigations are ongoing , the shocking thing about these murders has been the fact that , in many cases , the perpetrators appear to have been no older than the victims .
What might until recently have remained after - school scraps between rival groups of friends have degenerated into gang killings .
Jonathan Matondo , shot dead in Sheffield in October , came from a " respectable " family , police were keen to stress .
But locals said that his killing followed months of disturbances between groups of rival young people .
Jonathan 's street name in this little local war game was said to be " Venomous " .
Have we become caught in a disturbing spiral of youth violence , with gang culture taking over the schools and streets of Britain ?
Certainly , our fear about violent crime is increasing - one in six report " high anxiety " about violent crime , while 81 % of pupils worry about violence against them or their friends .
As to whether we are right to be nervous , however , the stark figures are not easy to interpret .
In the decade to 2005 , according to the Home Office , the total number of children aged between five and 16 who were murdered fell by more than 50 % to 20 - and a significant proportion of those were killed by a parent .
Crimes of " violence against the person " - including serious assaults and sexual attacks - have fallen by 8 % over the past year .
But statistics can frequently say what you would like them to say ; other studies have shown rises in different types of violent crime .
What is indisputable is that young people are carrying guns and knives in increasing numbers , and are more likely to become the victims of them .
The average age of gun crime victims , according to the Metropolitan police , fell from 24 to 19 in the three years to 2006 .
The Met says it has specific intelligence on 171 gangs in London alone , though admits that " an accurate assessment of how many there are is difficult " .
Some have members not yet in their teens .
Patsy McKie co-founded campaign group Mothers Against Violence after her son , Dorrie , 20 , was shot dead in an apparently unprovoked attack in Manchester in 1999 .
She is angered by what she sees as a public debate on youth violence that demonises the teenagers involved .
" Young people do this because it is what is around them .
Adults need to look at what they are doing .
It is not young people putting this stuff on TV , it is not young people bringing in the drugs .
We all need to take responsibility . "
What is frequently missing from this debate are the voices of the young people themselves .
These remarkable interviews , conducted over a period of six months , display all the swaggering self - assurance and profound insecurity of the teenage years .
They are tinged with bravado and a self - conscious glamorising of their own choices , but they also offer a frightening glimpse of what for increasing numbers of teenagers is a familiar way of life .
Sir Ian Blair , the Met police commissioner , has said , " We need to find out why some people feel safer in gangs than out of them . "
These young people may offer a clue .

I arrived from Ghana when I was about 10 .
Growing up in Brixton was hard , my mum could n't help me out cos she was working night and day .
At secondary school I was a target to pick on cos I could n't speak English properly .
It got to the point where I flipped and anyone who tried anything I used my strength against .
I 'm 17 now , and when I look back our intention was n't to become a gang , we were just children mucking about .
We grew up on the same estate , came back from school and ended up playing together .
As we grew up , more friends started joining and we got bigger and bigger .
Age 14 and 15 it changed .
We started being lunatic ; robbing handbags and phones .
That 's when the name starts coming up - MZ. Murder Zone , my crew .
Back in the day everyone from here to Croydon and Peckham knew about MZ .
Being around people that sell drugs , I knew they were making a lot of money so I thought maybe I could do this to help my mum .
So I was dealing crack , heroin , weed .
I could make a grand a week .
I used to use a bike cos I knew the feds [ police ] target drug dealers in cars .
There was a lot of us , more than 20 .
It 's like a family .
What you 'd do for a little brother , you 'd do for your bredren [ brethren ] .
If one of you is going somewhere and gets stopped by someone , the whole lot of you would jump him cos he 's stopped one of your bredren .
If you entered their territory alone , it 's what we call " slipping " and you can get hit .
So when we went out it was as a family - MZ family , we used to call it .
If one of my friends gets hit I 'm down to do whatever it takes .
Let 's say he gets beaten up , that means I will go over there and do the same to the youth .
I wo n't murder them , but I 'll beat him till he 's unconscious , just like how my friend 's unconscious .
But if he 's murdered my friend , that 's a different story .
If you 've lost a friend , most people my age would think they had to take a life from the other side .
Either because of the rep you need - " Yeah , he pulled the trigger he was a bad man " - or cos he was your bredren and you can't let a life go away like that .
At first I was a younger , a " buck " .
You look up to the big boys , their names are known , they 're bad and no one wants to mess with them .
You see the jewellery , the fast cars , the fast women , you 've heard about their background and you 're thinking , " Rah , they 've done it , so why ca n't I ? "
MZ made life simple for me .
Their reputation made it safer for me to go round certain places .
You need to protect yourself if you 're leaving your estate .
In this generation everyone 's trying to rep their own little postcode .
It 's like with lions .
When a lion 's got his territory , he do n't allow any other male to get through .
If the male comes for me , it 's a fight , it 's a war right there .
They just think I need to control my territory , otherwise another male will try and come and take over .
If you get caught slipping by another group of boys , then you 're going to get it dangerously .
It 's about who 's more powerful than who .
That 's why people kill each other .
I 've had a friend dead .
He was killed in Kennington , knife to the heart .
There are plenty of knives on the street .
I 've been sliced on my neck - it was just a little scuff , someone pulled a knife , reached for the back of my neck and just sliced it .
Most of the boys I know have either had a bullet or a knife .
I 've been shot .
I was hit on the arm with a bullet by being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
We 'd gone to a party and my mate saw an enemy and punched him , we ran off and they started firing after us .
I did n't really feel anything until someone told me , " Your hand 's bleeding " , and then I realised , " Rah , I 've been hit . "
Luckily it was n't hard enough to go through my bone or I would n't be able to use my hand no more .
Disrespecting someone is major these days .
When I was growing up , if you disrespect a man you 're going to have to rock him one on one with your hands .
Now it 's about shooting .
More young people have got guns and they think it 's easier to kill than fight .
Tupac made me change my life around .
I do n't care about 50 Cent or any other rappers , but he was different .
People did n't understand ' Pac , but if you really listen to the guy and his behaviour , there was a meaning to it .
I 'm not fully out of this yet , but I want to be .
It 's not like you 're going on holiday and you can just pack your bags and go .
Imagine you 're living this life for eight years .
That eight years has made you what you are today .
You can't resist that background .
I 'm doing A - level art now and I 'm hoping to go to art school .
I want to write films .
I look to [ British rapper ]
Asher D. He 's been through similar things .
He 's been stabbed in the back of the neck like me .
He nearly went to prison for firearms .
That 's why I give him respect .
For flipping round .
I hope I can do that .

We started PHC after what happened to my best mate .
It stands for Paki Hating Crew .
He was murdered three years ago by a group of Asians from the other side of Leeds .
I remember the night he died .
He was chilling on the estate with two mates and I was just round the corner playing football .
We saw about 40 or 50 Asians running off and knew something had happened .
We sprinted round to see what had happened and his body was lying there on the pavement .
The police would n't let us through to see him .
His body was covered up but you could see a load of blood on the road .
They 'd stabbed him and beaten him with baseball bats .
His mate told me they were beating him so hard his body was bouncing a foot off the ground .
But he was still alive when we got there and I thought he'd be OK .
Later on that day his mum told us that he 'd died in hospital .
We were shocked .
He was only 16 .
He was a big lad and used to take on six or seven of them at a time with his fists .
They hated him .
That 's why they came for him in a big group .
It took 30 grown men to get him on the ground .
They wanted to get him , but they did n't want to kill him - they fucked up .
If the police had n't found the killers and sent them to jail , they would n't be alive now - we'd have made sure of that .
We used to talk to the Asians , but since then it 's never been the same .
They started their own gang - WBHC , the White and Black Hating Crew .
People who think we 're racist are wrong .
My mate was mixed race ; there 's black people in the gang and in my family .
I 've got no problem with black people , Chinese people , even most Paki people are all right .
But those Asians who killed my mate , I 'm racist towards them .
PHC has grown and grown , there 's about 50 of us here and this is where it started .
But if you go round the city you 'll find different groups in PHC .
There 's no leaders , we 're all the same , everyone 's their own person .
There would be about 500 of us , if we ever all got together .
They'd be fucked , but it has n't happened .
Leeds is all I 've known .
My mum and dad split up when I was six and I live with my mum .
I got permanently excluded from school at 15 for drug dealing .
I could make £ 100 a day .
I 've also been tagged twice for street robberies .
We 'd do it together , me and the other lads in the gang , taking mobile phones , bikes and money .
We could make a few grand a week and would share the proceeds .
I used to spend the money on weed , clothes and food .
I got let back into school because no other place would have me .
School was shite , I hated it .
The government talk about stopping gangs .
Well , give us some shit to do , then .
There 's nowt to do round here .
There are fights every so often .
People bring weapons but do n't always use them .
I 've been hit with sticks and bats and bottles thrown by the Asians , and we 've done the same to them .
I 've seen guns .
One of my mates who 's 14 has got one , a revolver and bullets .
He was messing about with it once and fired it through the floor .
You do n't really need a gun round here , but he says it 's for his own protection .
I do n't carry a knife normally , but I might take one if I 'm going up there to the Asians on top of the hill .
The fighting used to be exciting .
But I 'm not really into it any more .
I 'm always being stopped by the police for things I have n't done .
They just go for a face they know .
I 've been in custody for five months but I could have gone down for three years for the street robbery .
That made me change .
The judge said that if he ever saw me again in that courtroom I would n't be going back home .
My mum pleaded with me and said that if I did n't stop I 'd be in and out of jail for the rest of my life .
I have n't been in trouble for a while now .
I left school last year when I was 16 and went to college .
I finish my apprenticeship next year and I 'll be able to work .
What do I want from life ?
To settle down , and move away from this shitty place .
Claudia , 18
I 've spent my whole life in Brixton .
Nowadays you see people with weapons on the streets all the time .
There 's plenty of machine guns , but mostly young people have got replicas - often they 're too scared to let it off because it could backfire .
When you 're involved there 's a lot of people that hate you so you need to have protection - it might be a group of people , or you could be in a gang .
I 'm involved but I do n't see myself as in a particular gang .
The most that a lot of us will say is that we 're from Brixton - that 's it .
Gangs change too much every day .
Peckham and Brixton have been in argument from God know 's when .
Peckham will not be caught in Brixton and we will not be caught there .
I do n't trust Peckham , full stop .
You can always spot a Peckham boy , when you 've grown up in the ends [ area ] you just know - the way they look , the way they walk , the way they act , you can just tell what a Peckham boy looks like , just like you can tell what a Brixton boy looks like .
Peckham would n't come here without guns .
There 's no neutral ground , but the closest there is to it is Brixton KFC , because the police are normally wandering up and down .
I got involved because I needed the money .
When I was 13 I got kicked out of school for fighting .
The following year I left home .
I was renting a flat by myself , which was costing £ 100 a week and I had to provide for myself .
I was dealing crack , heroin , everything .
A lot of people will say they 're doing this for the money and a lot of people ain't really taking the money .
But for me the money was great .
There is peer pressure , but you do n't have to be involved .
Most of these crews that keep appearing in the paper are n't making any money .
It 's just about status .
But a lot of young people do n't realise what the risk is .
They 've been kicked out of school , mum works 24/ 7 , there 's nothing for them to do .
That 's how it always starts - boredom .
I got involved because I wanted big , I wanted the quick route to money , and it worked for me .
I was not pressured , no one forced me , and it was fun , there 's a thrill to it .
The money 's live [ cool ] , everyone 's live , no one can talk to you or give you shit , it 's a good life .
I 'm a girl !
Getting that type of money as a girl of 15 !
You can hold yourself , no one can rob you , no one can move to you [ mug you ] , it feels good because of who you are , your reputation .
There are girls moving in crews , but there ain't many doing what I did .
Because when boys are beefing I 'll be involved as well .
They said to me once , " She makes money like she 's a boy , she bangs it out like she 's a boy , so she can get taken out like a boy . "
It 's true what they were saying and I need to watch out all the time .
Brixton's my ends , but I 've still got to keep on point because I 've got a lot of haters .
I 've seen too many shootings - the first one was when I was 13 .
In the past three years I 've nearly been shot about half a dozen times .
One time they put a gun to the back of my head .
I heard them cock it , but it jammed .
I turned and I hit it out of their hand - bang - it dropped on the floor .
It was just me and a mate , there were six of them .
They could have grabbed me but I think they were more shocked at what just happened .
A youth picked it up .
I looked at the boy who had the gun , punched him in the face and then I jumped in a car and got away .
I could be dead , I know that .
Another time , this guy was pointing the gun at me , but while he was talking I managed to wrestle it out of his hand .
Later I got revenge .
I 'd rather not say what we did to him , he got enough to last him a lifetime .
You can't pull a gun on somebody and then not shoot them , it 's like putting somebody in a coffin and not burying them .
I 've pulled a gun a few times - I had to , they were shoot - outs .
Everyone had guns , they pulled , we pulled , shots were let off but no one got hurt , although I do n't know how .
If my dad was around I do n't think I 'd have done any of this .
He died when I was young .
I would n't say I 'm totally out of it yet , but by next year I 'll be out of it altogether as it's not a good life to stay in .
I plan to be very wealthy and I wo n't be living here .
Next year I go to uni to study business and law and I ain't got time to be putting my head in nothing else but uni .
I 'm very ambitious - I want to do law and be in property .
We live in a racist society , but I believe you have to make your way to the top and change things .
Marlon , 16
My life was basically surrounded by gangs because Walworth Road was a dangerous place to be - we were at war with Peckham .
I started acting like a gangster at primary school when I was nine .
I was being rude to the teachers , beating up the teachers , using obscene language and not listening .
I joined Walworth Road Gangsters at 12 , when I started secondary school .
There were 30 of us .
Some of the gang were there because their families neglected them and they needed people to turn to .
It starts with you bonding with a close friend , then you maybe meet other people until you just come together as one group and think , " We 're a family . "
If something troubles our minds , we 'll go and sort it out , that 's how a gang is .
We carried baseball bats , lots of weapons , knives ... we never carried guns , but we could get hold of them if we really wanted them .
There was lots of guns around from the olders who used to watch over us .
There was olders and youngers and tinies - we were the tinies back then .
Each person in a group had to do different things .
Olders would ring up my cell phone and set me tasks like delivering drugs and collecting the money .
I 'd get paid £ 500 a week and hand over about five grand to the older .
I used to look up to them .
They had what we did n't have - cars , rings , gold chains , money , lots of girls , so we thought , " We want to live like that . "
Later on , I was a leader who gave the orders .
Every so often people would refuse to do what I told them .
At that point you have to go and beat him up to gain their respect again - that 's how gang culture works .
We were n't allowed in Peckham , Peckham were n't allowed in Walworth .
The border was Burgess Park .
If you were on your own , they 'd beat you up , and the same thing with us .
So I had to stay out of Peckham .
It was like a war back then , but I 'm OK now , I can go down there .
We used to put a lot of people in hospital , hitting them over the head with baseball bats .
It 's the easiest weapon - you can just carry a tennis ball and say you 're going to the park .
And if you want to , you can kill someone with a baseball bat .
I knew lots of people from Walworth Road who lost their lives .
I remember a girl called Ruth who was stabbed two years ago over drugs .
When I was younger , you used to have a scuff and then shake hands .
Now people say if the next man steps on your shoes , you 'll shoot him for it .
Fights are never over now .
You may think you 've fought and everything is sweet , but someone can just go and shoot you now .
It makes me sad to see the tinies shooting people over nothing .
In 20 years they 'll probably either be dead or in prison for life .
My dad died when I was three and I grew up with a single mother .
She could n't cope when I was in Walworth Road , she had to get other family members to talk to me .
School did n't know what I was doing , they thought I had behavioural problems - Tourette 's , that kind of thing .
But the problem was the people I hung around .
The Walworth Road guys are still doing what they do .
I can't neglect them and say , " You 're not my friend " , but I do n't follow them any more .
The youth project where I am now treats me like a man and makes me feel part of the family .
I 've decided I want to be a football coach and a construction worker .
I started questioning the gang thing to my friends , but they did n't respond .
In the gang some people are achieving something , making money , and some people are not , and you 'll never know who 's achieving something until it 's too late .
After a while you realise this is childish , just seeing someone on their own on the street and beating them up .
They have to sort the police out - the guns are coming into the black community from corrupt policemen .
There needs to be more youth projects , too , for the people who feel neglected .
And there are no male role models in school .
If a woman teacher was talking to me , I 'd think she was taking the mick out of me .
But if it 's a man , I 'd say , " Yeah , he knows what he 's talking about , he 's probably been through it . "

The first person I saw commit a murder was my dad when I was seven .
In all I 've seen around 15 people murdered .
Dad used to try and keep me away from it , but sometimes he could n't get anyone to look after me .
I do n't know what that first one was about .
He did it with his hands - he used to beat people to death .
And after a couple of times you become used to it , it seems normal .
I was born in England , but my mum's Argentine and my dad's half Jamaican and half English .
I grew up in south London , mostly in Peckham , but have moved back to Argentina twice , when I was three and 15 .
I started out in a little estate gang in Bermondsey when I was about eight .
I was the youngest and I learned to defend our territory .
I used to fight people , walk around with a cricket bat - it sounds funny , but I did n't know about baseball bats then .
I had no reservations about hitting people , we had a rottweiler , we had dobermans and would take them for walks and frighten people .
I got myself a little reputation in my area and when I went to school in Blackfriars it got bigger .
I was exposed to people from different areas and joined a north London gang , even though I am from south London .
There were a couple of other gangs in school , so it was best to be in one yourself .
Aged 13 , we took guns into school , knives , one boy took an axe , all kinds of things , dog chains , whatever we could get our hands on .
The guns were pistols , converted replicas .
I never used them , but I 'd pull it out , which was enough .
Outside of school I 've done loads of shootings , both here and in Argentina .
I went to Argentina when I was in my mid teens .
I lived in the capital for a while and then moved to a small town outside .
It 's just a poor country , it really is like people will kill you over nothing .
I used to shoot loads of people - it was all to do with cocaine and my main job was to collect debts .
If they did n't pay I had to torture them , anything to make them pay .
People knew me and crossed the street to avoid me , which I thought was respect , so I was happy .
Really it was fear .
In England the gangs thing is mainly associated with black people , but that 's not the case .
The gang members I worked for were Latin - Colombians .
It 's not really about race - these poor communities are separated ; people in Peckham live just three miles from Westminster , but look at the quality of life .
It 's almost like they 've made a decision , " I want a piece of the pie " - these young gang members are some of the smartest , most polite , funny kids you could meet .
They do n't want to have to go out and be violent , but that 's the only choice they think they 've got .
Violence is good , but after you get exposed to it so many times , it gets dull .
With shooting someone , the pay - off is the explosion , the bang , the flash - it 's almost like fireworks .
You do n't see blood splatter everywhere like in the movies , though .
I do n't know if any of my victims died , but I used to make sure I did damage .
The intention was to leave a scar on their face to show I 'd been there .
My best friend taught me to go for their armpit as it's a hard place to heal up .
If they 've got stitches they 're going to rip open , they 're really going to feel it .
The other day they stripped someone naked and made them walk through Peckham High Street .
If you do n't want that kind of thing , then you need to earn the respect .
How did I get the respect of the north London boys ?
You have to be the cruellest , the most violent , the most intimidating .
You do n't even need to use brute force .
Sometimes it 's mind games , spreading stuff about them within their gang , intimidating them over the phone .
Text messages do get used .
But people are getting more aware that there 's a record of your text , it makes more sense to use a pay phone or something that 's harder to trace .
I had to get a few people who were n't showing me enough respect .
A boy I was friends with borrowed a CD and one of my shirts and did n't bother to give them me back .
So I broke into his house and stabbed him while he was asleep .
I got out of it because I was given a chance .
I was raised all my life to think I was worthless .
But then when I was living in a shared house there was a family from Mauritius in the next bedroom .
They knew I was n't really all right .
They took me to a South American church and that 's how I learned a lot more about morals and remorse .
The pastors helped me a lot .
If it was n't for this family I probably would have ended up falling back into it .
A lot of middle - class people think that gangs are untouchable and youths are unreachable , but that 's not the case - these 13 - and 14 - year - old boys are scared , they are looking for guidance and they 're going to anyone who can provide it , whether that 's a 30 - year - old gang leader or a 20 - year - old church member .
That 's why I love the family .
They could n't even speak English , but they still managed to help me .
They took a chance and said , " I 'm not going to judge you . "
I think that was one of the most inspirational things .
Becoming a dad has had a great impact on me , too .
My daughter 's a year old now , so I 'm no longer responsible for just me .
I want her to avoid making the same mistakes I made .

SEAN PENN has quit his job as contributing reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle , after the newspaper dubbed Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez a " dictator " .
The politically charged star has carried out a series of assignments for the paper - edited by Sharon Stone 's ex-husband Phil Bronstein - visiting Iraq and Iran as a contributing reporter .
But Penn has severed all ties with the California publication in a stinging letter to Bronstein , which has was published in Thursday 's ( 17Jan08 ) edition .
Penn writes , " I could only hope this great city was more clever than its increasingly lamebrain paper .
Chavez was democratically elected .
" In the paper 's attack on Oliver Stone , who , agree with him or not , has at least the balls , passion and intellectual curiosity to pursue information away from a porcelain dumping bowl and a desperate newspaper , we see another attempt to marginalise the outspoken . "
Penn signed the letter " former SF Chronicle contributing reporter " .
Bronstein has responded , writing alongside Penn 's piece , " He 's a great actor and a great director .
People get riled up about a lot of things .
Particularly in this day and age ; they get to express themselves .
We were more than happy to print this letter .
" Sean Penn 's days of writing for the San Francisco Chronicle may be over :
The actor now calls the publication an " increasingly lamebrain paper .
" Penn offered the critique in a letter published Tuesday , written in response to a tongue - in - cheek article that focused on celebrity interest in Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
It listed a number of potential matchups between celebrities and dictators or other authoritarian figures .
Penn objected to the characterization , saying Chavez is a democratically elected leader .
The acclaimed actor and director called the newspaper an " increasingly lamebrain paper " after it published a tongue - in - cheek article , saying , " celebrities making asses of themselves ... hanging out with the world 's most notorious dictators and other authoritarian figures " .
The paper listed Danny Glover , Oliver Stone and Sean Penn among those celebrities , while dubbing Chavez a dictator .
In a letter to the newspaper published on Thursday , Penn writes , " I could only hope this great city was more clever than its increasingly lamebrain paper .
Chavez was democratically elected , and dictators do n't lose constitutional referendums .
Trivial theorems
Mathematical folklore contains a story about how Acta Quandalia published a paper proving that all partially uniform k-quandles had the Cosell property , and then a few months later published another paper proving that no partially uniform k-quandles had the Cosell property .
And in fact , goes the story , both theorems were quite true , which put a sudden end to the investigation of partially uniform k-quandles .
Except of course it was n't Acta Quandalia ( which would never commit such a silly error ) and it did n't concern k-quandles ; it was some unspecified journal , and it concerned some property of some sort of topological space , and that was the end of the investigation of those topological spaces .
This would not qualify as a major screwup under my definition in the original article , since the theorems are true , but it certainly would have been rather embarrassing .
Journals are not supposed to publish papers about the properties of the empty set .
Hmm , there 's a thought .
How about a Journal of the Properties of the Empty Set ?
The editors would never be at a loss for material .
And the cover almost designs itself .
Handsome , is n't it ?
I See A Great Need !
Ahem .
Anyway , if the folklore in question is true , I suppose the mathematicians involved might have felt proud rather than ashamed , since they could now boast of having completely solved the problem of partially uniform k-quandles .
But on the other hand , suppose you had been granted a doctorate on the strength of your thesis on the properties of objects from some class which was subsequently shown to be empty .
Would n't you feel at least a bit like a fraud ?
Is this story true ?
Are there any examples ?
Please help me , gentle readers .

Closed - circuit TV cameras supposed to catch violent thugs have been trained on roads instead - to trap and fine motorists who stray into bus lanes .
A Home Office study of Britain 's 4.2 million CCTV cameras also revealed they are not proving much help to the police in collaring criminals .
More than eight out of ten of the cameras - the UK has the largest number in the world - do not provide satisfactory images for officers to use .
In many cases , a suspect can be recognised only if police already know who they are .
Also , very few cameras are positioned in a place that would tackle terrorism , or spot reconnaissance missions by fanatics .
But , despite the lack of success , officials are still considering the case for even more cameras .
Councils , which run CCTV control rooms , can choose where they target their cameras - even though , when they were paid for , the intention was to cut street crime .
Home Office officials found they are being used to monitor bus lanes for motorists passing inside the thick white lines painted on the road .
Those caught can be served with a fine of up to £ 100 , sent to the home of the person registered as the car 's keeper by the DVLA .
The report , compiled by the Home Office and Association of Chief Constables , reveals : " In some cases the cameras ' initial purpose has been changed or they are required to perform a number of additional and conflicting tasks .
Scroll down for more ...
" Some existing cameras originally installed for detecting crime are now being positioned to monitor a bus lane and record vehicle number plates .
" While the cameras are being used in this way , it seems unlikely that they will be used proactively to patrol the area and detect crime .
Current installed cameras cannot perform these two functions at the same time . "
Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said : " In yet another extraordinary admission of incompetence we see that this Government has managed to give people all the disadvantages of CCTV in terms of undermining civil liberties but only provide minimal advantage in terms of public safety and crime detection .
" The countless victims of crime in this country will be stunned to hear that , not only can they not get a police officer on the streets , but also most of the CCTV footage that should help them get justice is less than useless . "
Paul Smith , founder of drivers ' pressure group SafeSpeed , said : " Drivers will be infuriated .
We are seeing local authorities with stretched budgets profiting from these cameras by fining drivers .
" They are often very minor offences with little to do with safety .
This is about raising revenues and nothing to do with combating crime . "
Phil Booth , of the NO2ID civil liberties campaign , said : " This is both a farce and a national scandal .
The cameras are delivering no meaningful results for the safety of the average citizen .
It seems more like a snooper 's charter to spy on the motorist , while the criminal gets away with it . "
Other damning findings of the report , the National CCTV Strategy , include the fact that many cameras in public places such as shopping centres and transport hubs are designed to " monitor crowds , slips , trips and falls " rather than detect crime .
Some police forces have failed to keep pace with technological developments , leading to evidence being lost , and some cameras are poorly maintained and " not fit for purpose " .
The report added that CCTV played a crucial role in the investigation into the July 7 suicide bombings , but went on : " The majority of cameras have not been placed in positions which may be required for the prevention and detection of serious and organised crime and counter - terrorism . "
The authorities should consider placing cameras to cover high - risk targets - such as major pieces of the national infrastructure - rather than to combat low - level crime and disorder , the document said .
Camera operators should also be trained to spot " hostile reconnaissance " by terrorists .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' CCTV has proven its effectiveness time and again in tackling crime and disorder .
It also plays a vital role in the fight against terrorism and helps communities feel safer .
" The strategy recognises that for CCTV to continue to be effective it must have both the support of the public and take account of rapidly changing technology . "
In the world of decentralization , distributed hash tables ( DHTs ) recently have had a revolutionary effect .
The chaotic , ad hoc topologies of the first - generation peer - to - peer architectures have been superseded by a set of topologies with emergent order , provable properties and excellent performance .
Knowledge of DHT algorithms is going to be a key ingredient in future developments of distributed applications .
A number of research DHTs have been developed by universities , picked up by the Open Source community and implemented .
A few proprietary implementations exist as well , but currently none are available as SDKs ; rather , they are embedded in commercially available products .
Each DHT scheme generally is pitched as being an entity unto itself , different from all other schemes .
In actuality , the various available schemes all fit into a multidimensional matrix .
Take one , make a few tweaks and you end up with one of the other ones .
Existing research DHTs , such as Chord , Kademlia and Pastry , therefore are starting points for the development of your own custom schemes .
Each has properties that can be combined in a multitude of ways .
In order to fully express the spectrum of options , let 's start with a basic design and then add complexity in order to gain useful properties .
Basically , a DHT performs the functions of a hash table .
You can store a key and value pair , and you can look up a value if you have the key .
Values are not necessarily persisted on disk , although you certainly could base a DHT on top of a persistent hash table , such as Berkeley DB ; and in fact , this has been done .
The interesting thing about DHTs is that storage and lookups are distributed among multiple machines .
Unlike existing master / slave database replication architectures , all nodes are peers that can join and leave the network freely .
Despite the apparent chaos of periodic random changes to the membership of the network , DHTs make provable guarantees about performance .
To begin our exploration of DHT designs , we start with a circular , double - linked list .
Each node in the list is a machine on the network .
Each node keeps a reference to the next and previous nodes in the list , the addresses of other machines .
We must define an ordering so we can determine what the “ next ” node is for each node in the list .
The method used by the Chord DHT to determine the next node is as follows : assign a unique random ID of k bits to each node .
Arrange the nodes in a ring so the IDs are in increasing order clockwise around the ring .
For each node , the next node is the one that is the smallest distance clockwise away .
For most nodes , this is the node whose ID is closest to but still greater than the current node 's ID .
The one exception is the node with the greatest ID , whose successor is the node with the smallest ID .
This distance metric is defined more concretely in the distance method ( Listing 1 ) .
Listing 1 . ringDistance.py #
This is a clockwise ring distance function .
#
It depends on a globally defined k , the key size .
#
The largest possible node id is 2 ** k. def distance ( a , b ) : if a==b : return 0 elif a <b : return b- a ; else : return ( 2**k ) +( b-a ) ; Each node is itself a standard hash table .
All you need to do to store or retrieve a value from the hash table is find the appropriate node in the network , then do a normal hash table store or lookup there .
A simple way to determine which node is appropriate for a particular key ( the one Chord uses ) is the same as the method for determining the successor of a particular node ID .
First , take the key and hash it to generate a key of exactly k bits .
Treat this number as a node ID , and determine which node is its successor by starting at any point in the ring and working clockwise until a node is found whose ID is closest to but still greater than the key .
The node you find is the node responsible for storage and lookup for that particular key ( Listing 2 ) .
Using a hash to generate the key is beneficial because hashes generally are distributed evenly , and different keys are distributed evenly across all of the nodes in the network .
Listing 2 . findNode.py #
From the start node , find the node responsible # for the target key def findNode ( start , key ) : current=start while distance ( current.id , key ) > \ distance ( current.next.id , key ) : current=current.next return current #
Find the responsible node and get the value for # the key def lookup ( start , key ) : node=findNode ( start , key ) return node.data[key ] #
Find the responsible node and store the value # with the key def store ( start , key , value ) : node=findNode ( start , key ) node .
data[key ] =value
This DHT design is simple but entirely sufficient to serve the purpose of a distributed hash table .
Given a static network of nodes with perfect uptime , you can start with any node and key and find the node responsible for that key .
An important thing to keep in mind is that although the example code so far looks like a fairly normal , doubly linked list , this is only a simulation of a DHT .
In a real DHT , each node would be on a different machine , and all calls to them would need to be communicated over some kind of socket protocol .
In order to make the current design more useful , it would be nice to account for nodes joining and leaving the network , either intentionally or in the case of failure .
To enable this feature , we must establish a join / leave protocol for our network .
The first step in the Chord join protocol is to look up the successor of the new node 's ID using the normal lookup protocol .
The new node should be inserted between the found successor node and that node 's predecessor .
The new node is responsible for some portion of the keys for which the predecessor node was responsible .
In order to ensure that all lookups work without fail , the appropriate portion of keys should be copied to the new node before the predecessor node changes its next node pointer to point to the new node .
Leaves are very simple ; the leaving node copies all of its stored information to its predecessor .
The predecessor then changes its next node pointer to point to the leaving node 's successor .
The join and leave code is similar to the code for inserting and removing elements from a normal linked list , with the added requirement of migrating data between the joining / leaving nodes and their neighbors .
In a normal linked list , you remove a node to delete the data it 's holding .
In a DHT , the insertion and removal of nodes is independent of the insertion and removal of data .
It might be useful to think of DHT nodes as similar to the periodically readjusting buckets used in persistent hash table implementations , such as Berkeley DB .
Allowing the network to have dynamic members while ensuring that storage and lookups still function properly certainly is an improvement to our design .
However , the performance is terrible — O( n ) with an expected performance of n/ 2 .
Each node traversed requires communication with a different machine on the network , which might require the establishment of a TCP / IP connection , depending on the chosen transport .
Therefore , n/2 traversed nodes can be quite slow .
In order to achieve better performance , the Chord design adds a layer to access O ( log n ) performance .
Instead of storing a pointer to the next node , each node stores a “ finger table ” containing the addresses of k nodes .
The distance between the current node 's ID and the IDs of the nodes in the finger table increases exponentially .
Each traversed node on the path to a particular key is closer logarithmically than the last , with O ( log n ) nodes being traversed overall .
In order for logarithmic lookups to work , the finger table needs to be kept up to date .
An out - of - date finger table does n't break lookups as long as each node has an up - to - date next pointer , but lookups are logarithmic only if the finger table is correct .
Updating the finger table requires that a node address is found for each of the k slots in the table .
For any slot x , where x is 1 to k , finger [ x ] is determined by taking the current node 's ID and looking up the node responsible for the key ( id + 2 ( x - 1 ) ) mod ( 2 k ) ( Listing 3 ) .
When doing lookups , you now have k nodes to choose from at each hop , instead of only one at each .
For each node you visit from the starting node , you follow the entry in the finger table that has the shortest distance to the key ( Listing 4 ) .
Listing 3 . update.py def update ( node ) : for x in range ( k ) : oldEntry=node.finger[x ] node.finger[x]=findNode(oldEntry , ( node.id + ( 2**x ) ) % ( 2**k ) )
Listing 4 . finger - lookup.py def find Finger ( node , key ) : current=node for x in range( k ) : if distance ( current.id , key ) > \ distance ( node.finger[x ].id , key ) : current=node.finger[x ] return current def lookup ( start , key ) : current=find Finger( start , key ) next=find Finger ( current , key ) while distance ( current.id , key ) > \ distance ( next.id , key ) : current=next next=findFinger( current , key ) return current
So far we have more or less defined the original version of the Chord DHT design as it was described by the MIT team that invented it .
This is only the tip of the iceberg in the world of DHTs , though .
Many modifications can be made to establish different properties from the ones described in the original Chord paper , without losing the logarithmic performance and guaranteed lookups that Chord provides .
One property that might be useful for a DHT is the ability to update the finger table passively , requiring periodic lookups to be done in order to refresh the table .
With MIT
Chord , you must do a lookup , hitting O ( log n ) nodes for all k items in the finger table , which can result in a considerable amount of traffic .
It would be advantageous if a node could add other nodes to its finger table when they contacted it for lookups .
As a conversation already has been established in order to do the lookup , there is little added overhead in checking to see if the node doing the lookup is a good candidate for the local finger table .
Unfortunately , finger table links in Chord are unidirectional because the distance metric is not symmetrical .
A node generally is not going to be in the finger tables of the nodes in its finger table .
A solution to this problem is to replace Chord 's modular addition distance metric with one based on XOR .
The distance between two nodes , A and B , is defined as the XOR of the node IDs interpreted as the binary representation of an unsigned integer ( Listing 5 ) .
XOR makes a delightful distance metric because it is symmetric .
Because distance ( A , B ) == distance ( B , A ) , for any two nodes , if A is in B 's finger table then B is in A 's finger table .
This means nodes can update their finger tables by recording the addresses of nodes that query them , reducing significantly the amount of node update traffic .
It also simplifies coding a DHT application , because you do n't need to keep a separate thread to call the update method periodically .
Instead , you simply update whenever the lookup method is called .
Listing 5 . xor -distance .py def distance ( a , b ) : return a^b #
In Python , this means a XOR b , # not a to the power of b .
An issue with the design presented so far is the paths to a given node are fragile .
If any node in the path refuses to cooperate , the lookup is stuck .
Between any two nodes there is exactly one path , so routing around broken nodes is impossible .
The Kademlia DHT solves this by widening the finger table to contain a bucket of j references for each finger table slot instead of only one , where j is defined globally for the whole network .
Now j different choices are available for each hop , so there are somewhere around j* log ( n ) possible paths .
There are less than that , though , paths converge as they get closer to the target .
But , the number of possible paths probably is greater than 1 , so this is an improvement .
Kademlia goes further and orders the nodes in the bucket in terms of recorded uptime .
Older nodes are given preference for queries , and new references are added only if there are not enough old nodes .
Besides the increased reliability of queries , this approach offers the added benefit that an attack on the network in which new nodes are created rapidly in order to push out good nodes will fail — it wo n't even be noticeable .
It 's important to understand that these different properties are not tied to a particular DHT implementation .
We gradually have built up a DHT design from scratch , developed it into something that resembles Chord , then modified it to be more like Kademlia .
The different approaches can be more or less mixed and matched .
Your finger table buckets can have 1 slot or j slots , depending on whether you use modular addition or XOR for your distance metric .
You can always follow the closest node , or you can rank them according to uptime or according to some other criteria .
You can draw from several other DHT designs , such as Pastry , OceanStore and Coral .
You also can use your own ideas to devise the perfect design for your needs .
Myself , I have concocted several modifications to a base Chord design to add properties such as anonymity , Byzantine fault - tolerant lookups , geographic routing and the efficient broadcasting of messages to enter the network .
It 's fun to do and easier than you think .
Now that you know how to create your own DHT implementations , you 're probably wondering what kind of crazy things you can do with this code .
Although there probably are many applications for DHTs that I have n't thought of yet , I know people already are working on such projects as file sharing , creating a shared hard drive for backing up data , replacing DNS with a peer - to - peer name resolution system , scalable chat and serverless gaming .
For this article , I 've tied the code together into a fun little example application that might be of interest to readers who caught my interview on the Linux Journal Web site about peer - to - peer Superworms ( see Resources ) .
The application is a distributed port scanner that stores results in the simulated DHT ( Listing 6 ) .
Given a fully functional DHT implementation , this script would have some handy properties .
First , it allows multiple machines to contribute results to a massive scanning of the Internet .
This way , all of the scanning activity can't be linked with a single machine .
Additionally , it avoids redundant scanning .
If the host already has been scanned , the results are fetched from the DHT , avoiding multiple scans .
No central server is required to hold all of the results or to coordinate the activities of the participants .
This application may seem somewhat insidious , but the point is it was trivial to write given the DHT library .
The same approach can be used in other sorts of distributed projects .
Listing 6 . portscan.py def __main__ ( ) : id=int(random.uniform ( 0,2**k ) ) node= Node ( id ) join ( node , initialContact ) line=raw_input ( ' Enter an IP to scan : ') .trim ( ) key=long( sha.new( line ).hexdigest ( ) ,16 ) value=lookup ( node , key ) if value= =None : f=os.popen('nmap ' +args [ 1 ] ) lines=f.readlines ( ) value=string.join( lines , '
') store ( node , key , value )
In this installment of our two - part series , we discussed the theory behind building DHTs .
Next time , we 'll talk about practical issues in using DHTs in real - world applications .
Inside an old airplane hangar at what used to be Pease Airforce Base in Portsmouth , Barack Obama made his first New Hampshire appearance since his Iowa victory .
He recited his standard stump speech , but there was a confident , almost giddy , spirit in his voice and among the crowd of a few hundred supporters .
Obama did work a new joke into his speech .
Referring to his new status as the Democratic front - runner , he said : “ This feels good .
It ’s just like I imagined it when I was talking to my Kindergarten teacher . ”
Regarding the current method of selecting superdelegates , Rep. John Larson ( D - Conn . ) , an Obama supporter , said : ' Obviously it ’s an imperfect system .
It smacks a lot of the old state legislatures electing senators . '
White men hold superdelegate power balance
In an ironic twist to the historic Democratic nominating contest between an African - American and a woman , the balance of power may be held by a more familiar face : the white male .
According to a Politico analysis , close to half of the 700 - plus Democratic superdelegates who could end up determining the party nominee are white men .

One Obama superdelegate , a House member , had sharp criticism for the superdelegate racial and gender makeup , a reaction that reflects the sensitivities surrounding the issue .
“ It ’s still the old guard , the white men .
They always want to control the outcome , ” the superdelegate said .
“ But this time , they wo n’t be able to do it . ”
That strong response could portend a messy intraparty fight in the event that superdelegates cast the decisive votes for the nominee .
The exact percentage of white males varies slightly depending on whether the penalized Michigan and Florida delegation superdelegates are counted , but the overall percentage is at least 46 percent .
Overall , men of all races represent 64 percent of the party ’s superdelegates .
Unlike traditional pledged delegates , superdelegates are unbound by the outcome of any primary vote or caucus .
They are allowed to make their own choice for the nomination , and this year , the campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton are aggressively courting their support in the event that superdelegate votes are needed to determine which candidate wins the nomination .
Representing about 20 percent of all delegates to the Democratic National Convention , the superdelegate roster is composed of members of Congress , other elected officeholders and party officials .
The percentage of white male superdelegates is disproportionate to the share of white males who make up the overall Democratic electorate .
According to a January 2008 national poll by Zogby International , 28 percent of Democratic voters are white men .
Women account for 55 percent of Democratic voters .
But superdelegates have never reflected the diversity of the Democratic party as a whole , nor were they designed to .
They represent the party insiders , a group that white men still dominate .
Among the superdelegates , including Michigan 's and Florida 's , there are 28 governors ( 21 white men ) , 49 senators ( 33 white men ) and 228 representatives ( 137 white men ) .
Members of the Democratic National Committee are also superdelegates , and among this group , there is more diversity .
Many superdelegates were not surprised that there were so many white males in their ranks .
“ Obviously it ’s an imperfect system .
It smacks a lot of the old state legislatures electing senators , ” said Rep. John B. Larson ( D - Conn. ) , an Obama supporter .
“ I do think you ’ll see some kind of reform after this to make it binding with the majority of votes . ”
Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter ( D - N.Y. ) , a Clinton backer , noted that delegates were much more diverse than they were in 1972 , when she first became a delegate under party rules that specifically required more participation by women .
“ I remember how excited we were to stop stuffing envelopes and go to the convention , ” she recalled .
“ I ’m not surprised that there are still a lot of men .
It ’s just staying power .
We still have a ways to go . ”
Rep. Hilda L. Solis ( D - Calif. ) , also a Clinton supporter , said she was more concerned about the decisions of the superdelegates than their gender and racial identities .
“ Women and minorities often have a diminished presence , ” she said .
“ But what really matters to me is who they ’re lining up with . ”
Among the more than 700 superdelegates named by the Democratic National Committee , Clinton leads Obama by 231 to 140.5 ( the eight members of Democrats Abroad receive a half vote . ) .
Among white men , at least 81 were supporting Clinton and at least 63 were backing Obama .
Many more remain uncommitted .
Stacie Paxton , a DNC spokeswoman , said that DNC members represent the party ’s rich diversity and include African - Americans , Hispanic Americans , Asian Americans , Native Americans and Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender people .
" Superdelegates are a diverse group of people from all parts of the country and all walks of life , " said Paxton .
