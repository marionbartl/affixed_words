Late at night , in most places I knew , there was almost no traffic and driving , a meditative activity , could cast a spell .
Behind the wheel , gliding along , I was keenly aware of being an American in America , on a road that was also metaphorical , making my way through life , unhindered , developing ideas , making decisions , liberated by the flight through this darkness and silence .
With less light pollution , the night sky was different , too — starrier , more daunting , more beautiful .
I have not seen roads or night skies like that for many years .
As Gosse said about the ring of living beauty of the English shore , “ All this is long over and done with . ”
A longing for a simpler world , for a glimpse of the past , is one of the motives in travel .
But the rest of the world has fared no better in terms of population pressure , and in many places it is much worse , even catastrophic .
The population of Malawi 40 years ago was small and sustainable .
None of us Peace Corps volunteers there at that time thought in terms of rescuing the country but only of helping to improve it .
Now Malawi can’t feed itself ; it ’s one of the many countries that people wish to flee , renowned for being hopeless , unjustly publicized as an enormous orphanage of desperate tots , needing to be saved , devoid of pride , lost without us .
The notion that a pop singer ( back then it would have been Elvis ) would breeze through and scoop up a child in a condescending gesture of rescue was unthinkable then .
In India a few months ago , as I was leaving my hotel in Chennai , I noticed a hotel employee shadowing me .
He warned me that the sidewalks were so packed with people I would be swallowed up and stifled .
He was right .
And I was unable to cross the main street in Bangalore , a leafy city of under a million people in 1973 and now a hectically improvised sprawl of seven million .
Mumbai ’s population of nearly 20 million rivals that of São Paulo , Brazil , and Lagos , Nigeria — nightmare cities .
Travel , except in almost inaccessible places , is no longer the answer to finding solitude .
And this contraction of space on a shrinking planet suggests a time , not far off , when there will be no remoteness : nowhere to become lost , nothing to be discovered , no escape , no palpable concept of distance , no peculiarity of dress — frightening thoughts for a traveler .
Yet some of the most populous countries manage to be habitable because they are societies with strict , and civilized , codes of conduct .
India , China and Japan are convenient examples , but I would include many African and Middle Eastern countries , too .
The vindictive stereotype of the Muslim as a xenophobe does not tally with my experience of wandering in the Muslim world , where I have been treated hospitably , welcomed by strangers as “ dayf al Rahman , ” a guest of the Merciful One .
We are passing through a confused period of aggression and fear , characterized by our confrontational government , the decline of diplomacy , a pugnacious foreign policy and a settled belief that the surest way to get people to tell the truth is to torture them .
( And by the way , “ water boarding ” was a torture technique at the worst of the Khmer Rouge prisons . )
It is no wonder we have begun to squint at strangers .
This is a corrosive situation in a country where more and more people , most of them strangers , are a feature of daily life .
Americans as a people I believe to be easygoing , compassionate , not looking for a fight .
But surely I am not the only one who has noticed that we are ruder , more offhand , readier to take offense , a nation of shouters and blamers .
Yes , it is just silly and fogeyish to yearn for that simpler and smaller world of the past .
But one could ask for the past ’s better manners , the instinctive decorum that has served to mitigate conflict .
One of the lessons of travel is that , though half the world is wearing T - shirts and sneakers , they manage to live in overpopulated cities because they have not abandoned their traditional modes of politeness .
These grace notes , which make traveling in crowded countries bearable , are a lesson to us in a mobbed and jostling world .
Montezuma Heat Death
I decided to spend a little time optimizing Montezuma indexing for speed , with the hope that I could get it to index the Planet Lisp archives within a reasonable amount of time .
Indexing 1000 pastes took about 100 seconds , as I mentioned the other day .
Avoiding 6 million garbage - generating calls to subseq saved 10 seconds .
Cutting down on the number of calls to string < and string > saved 4 seconds .
Each was a significant speedup , but nothing dramatic .
After doing some of this benchmarking , the laptop I was using overheated and shut down .
Since this time there were no cats lying on top and therefore no obvious scapegoats , I thought maybe the vents had just gotten clogged and so I blasted the hell out of it with canned air .
The comprehensive air blast cleaning cut 45 seconds off the benchmark time .
It was like getting a processor upgrade .

We are now officially a nation of hysterics :
Two people who sprinkled flour in a parking lot to mark a trail for their offbeat running club inadvertently caused a bioterrorism scare and now face a felony charge .
The sprinkled powder forced hundreds to evacuate an IKEA furniture store Thursday .
New Haven ophthalmologist Daniel Salchow , 36 , and his sister , Dorothee , 31 , who is visiting from Hamburg , Germany , were both charged with first - degree breach of peace , a felony .
***
Police fielded a call just before 5 p.m. that someone was sprinkling powder on the ground .
The store was evacuated and remained closed the rest of the night .
The incident prompted a massive response from police in New Haven and surrounding towns .
Daniel Salchow biked back to IKEA when he heard there was a problem and told officers the powder was just harmless flour , which he said he and his sister have sprinkled everywhere from New York to California without incident .
This is the real legacy of the last 7 years - a nation so whipped up into a frenzy over terrorism that you , me , anyone could be charged with a felony as long as some hysterical bedwetter somewhere thought we were committing an act of terrorism in our daily life .
The Salchow ’s are just lucky they are white .
If they had biked back to the scene wearing brown skin and attempted to make their way through the crowd to talk to the cops , they probably would have been shot .
The fact that this sort of shit is happening with increasing regularity just emboldens politicians to make more laws , take more of your rights , and spend more of your hard earned money in the name of security .
How many Americans have died due to terrorist attacks in this country in the last ten years ?
Two thousand , seven hundred and forty - five .
All related to 9/11 , save five people that were killed in the anthrax mailings .
There simply have been no other attacks - nothing .
Nada . Zero. Zilch .
The only other thing I can think of that comes close is the DC Sniper , and I ca n’t even remember his cause , so I am hesistant to call him a terrorist .
Again . 2745 dead .
That is it .
What is the US population ?
According to the census , 302,703,731 .
So 2745 out of 302,703,731 in the past ten years have died in terrorist attacks , and we are getting our knickers in a twist about an arrow made of flour in the IKEA parking lot ?
It is absurd .
You are safe .
I am safe .
This nation is safe .
Quit being such a damned pussy .
All of you .
*** Update ***
An update on 29 August .
Long story short - this is a shakedown .
Certainly a Judge must control the courtroom .
How a Judge may do this , not surprisingly , is determined by the law .
One tool is the power to hold someone in contempt .
[ Hint :
It ’s a power used , a lot , below . ]
According to the Supreme Court , if the sentence imposed for contempt is less than 6 months , there is no right to a jury trial .
Now , to our man in Maryland .
In 1990 , Mr. Johnson was convicted of malicious destruction of personal property , placed on probation , and given a 3 - year suspended sentence .
He had to stay out of trouble for 3 years .
Unfortunately , in 1991 he was convicted of burglary , and sentenced to 10 years .
So Mr. Johnson is in jail for a couple years , when he is called to court for violating his 1990 probation – with just 10 days remaining on the 3 - year suspended sentence .
Althought the prospect of serving an additional 3 years – on top of the 10 years he was already serving – did not sit well with him , his probation agent told him that the State would not seek to tack on the additional 3 years for violating his probation .
WRONG !
The Judge added on the 3 years , and a lively , lengthy , colorful conversation ensued .
And just when you think it might be over …
THE COURT : Call the next case please .
[ PROSECUTOR ] : State calls Eugene Wright … MR. JOHNSON : — at the same time .
Do n’t make no motherfucking sense .
THE COURT : Bring him back .
Take him back .
MR .
JOHNSON : No motherfucking sense .
THE COURT : Pull him back .
MR .
JOHNSON : Yo , man , stop yanking on my motherfucking arms .
Motherfucking —
THE COURT : Sit him back over there in front of the table .
[ Uh-oh ]
THE CLERK : Give me the file back .
He might be under contempt of court .
THE COURT : Now , stand up there .
Come back to that table there .
Step on up now .
What ’s wrong with you ?
MR .
JOHNSON : What the fuck you think wrong with me , man ?
Goddamn , I ’m trying to tell you I ain’t have no motherfucking option in this shit , man .
THE COURT : All right .
MR .
JOHNSON : What the fuck ?
You think everybody just want to go sit in prison for the rest of their life because you ai n’t got nothing better to do than to sit up there and crack jokes .
This ai n’t no motherfucking joke , man .
This is about my goddamn life .
THE COURT : That cost you five months and twenty - nine days in addition to the three years I ’ve just given you [ # 1 , and suspiciously shy of the 6 months that would require a jury trial ]
MR. JOHNSON : Fuck this shit , man .
THE COURT : All right .
That ’s five months and twenty - nine more in addition to the five months and twenty - nine I ’ve given you . [ # 2 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Fuck you , bitch .
THE COURT : That ’s five months and twenty - nine days .
That ’s three years .
That ’s five months and twenty - nine days .
Now , wait a minute .
That ’s consecutive to the three years that you ’re now doing .
Each one of those .
Separate and independent . [ # 3 ]
MR. JOHNSON : If I had a gun , your motherfucking head would be splattered all over the back of the goddamn wall for —
THE COURT : And you ’d better shoot straight when you try .
When you get out , come on .
Five months and twenty - nine more for that .
That ’s consecutive to the three others and consecutive to the one that you ’re doing now . [ # 4 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Whatever man .
You ’re tired of giving it out ?
Did you finish or what ?
THE COURT : Well , we can see .
That ’s five months and twenty - nine more . [ # 5 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Kiss my ass again .
THE COURT : Five months and twenty - nine more . [ # 6 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Kiss my ass until you ’re tired of giving me another .
THE COURT : That ’s six of them .
MR .
JOHNSON : Kiss my ass again .
THE COURT : Seven .
Five months and twenty - nine days . [ # 7 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Fuck you .
Kiss my ass again .
THE COURT : Five months and twenty - nine days . [ # 8 ]
MR. JOHNSON : All right .
THE COURT : Consecutive .
THE CLERK : Silence .
MR .
JOHNSON : So you finished giving out time ?
THE COURT : I guess .
Until you cuss again .
MR .
JOHNSON : Suck my dick .
[ Very tricky , because “ dick ” is n’t a cuss word . ]
THE COURT : Five months and twenty - nine days consecutive . [ # 9 ] [ Damn ! ]
THE BAILIFF : Quiet in the Court .
MR .
JOHNSON : You finished ?
THE COURT : I suppose .
MR .
JOHNSON : Well , what the fuck are you holding me for then ?
THE COURT : Five months and twenty - nine more days .
Consecutive . [ # 10 ]
MR. JOHNSON : Get the fuck off me , man .
THE COURT : Call the next one .
Not thrilled with the prospect of finishing his 10 - year sentence , then 3 more years for the probation violation , then just under 5 MORE YEARS for contempt of court , Mr. Johnson appealed .
Who do you think won ?
Mr. Johnson did .
The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed the contempt convictions .
In the instant case , the trial judge , by engaging in a prolonged dialogue with the appellant , may have provoked the appellant into repeatedly committing acts of contempt .
Convictions for those acts may not stand .
The Court of Special Appeals held that the entire incident described above be considered as only one episode of contempt , and sent the matter back to the trial judge on that one count of contempt , with the not - so - subtle hint that they “ leave it to his judgment what further action should be taken . ”
Johnson v. State , 642 A.2d 259 ( Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1994 ) .
Firefox pencils !
I got this crazy idea to spread the word of Firefox by having some custom pencils with the Firefox logo made .
I was inspired because where I work there was a severe shortage of pencils among the office supplies .
And sure enough when they came in they got snatched up quickly !
( The pencil sharpener was working overtime ! )
The advantages I see of advertising Firefox with Pencils :
Last a long time
Tends to " float around " amongst people
Something people can use , will keep , and keep close to them .
Everyone can use pencils , not everyone can install software
Relatively cost effective
So , how did I get these made ?
There are a number of companies out there that will put any logo you want on a wide variety of items such as pens , pencils , and mugs .
A few I found were : Inkhead.com , Discountmugs.com , branders.com , Promotional - pens.us , and Omegahtc.com .
First I modified the Firefox logo to a single color vector image using a program called Inkscape ( no relation to Inkhead )
Most of these branding companies request logo artwork to be submitted as encapsulated postscript ( EPS ) or similar final output format , so I exported the end result to EPS format .
The single color EPS file I used : ffpencil.eps
The original SVG file edited with Inkscape : ffpencil.svg
A PNG rendering of how the final result should look : ( Print this PNG at one inch tall and wrap it around a pencil for the full effect )
Next , I ordered the pencils from Inkhead.com
To start the ordering process I created an " account " with them on their web site .
It 's basically the same as signing up for a message board .
I ordered 500 " Thrifty Model " pencils ( 2 boxes ) .
The unit price of the pencils was $ 50 for a box of 250 or $ 75 for two .
The custom art option adds a $ 20 art charge .
-
This is required for anything other than plain text with the fonts listed in their order form .
If you re-use the exact same art file in future orders the charge is only 4.99 .
When selecting the custom art option you can add comments about how you want the art file to be positioned or sized .
By default they will size the art file to cover as much of the imprint area as possible and it will be centered toward the eraser end of the pencil .
I specified " Size Reference : Text ' GetFirefox.com ' should be ~ 3/4 " to fit in imprint area .
Position ~ 1/2 " from eraser end .
Print as White ink on blue pencil . "
The imprint area on the Thrifty Model pencils is 3 / 4 inches high and 4 inches wide , the circumference of the pencil itself is one inch ..
Note that the imprint area size is different for other pencils and other products .
The colors are selected on the order form but I included that in the comment just in case .
The final cost is base cost plus art charge plus shipping and handling .
The last step of the order process is uploading the art file .
Some time after I submitted the order they e-mailed a design proof ( in PDF format ) for approval .
It showed a diagram of the pencil and the graphic as it would be fitted in the imprint area .
To approve the proof I just replied to the e-mail indicating I approved .
Finally ... wait for delivery .
And when they arrive , party !
Comments and notes :
The official Firefox logo is supposed to appear in color or gray scale .
I could not do that here .
I hope Firefox fans will consider this single color logo decent enough .
Close up this logo appears very sharp .
I ordered the pencils 4/11/07 and they arrived 4/25/07 - Fairly speedy , and about a week earlier than the time estimation calendar on their site had indicated .
But I am sure it is intended to overestimate .
The minimum required order was 250 pencils , but it is just a few bucks more and much more economical to get 500 .
The total cost for 500 pencils with custom art is around $ 100 depending on your shipping and handling .
( Inkhead is based out of Winder , GA ) For folks that do n't want to spend that much money for that many pencils , consider splitting the purchase between four or five different people .
I had intended for there to be slightly less of a gap between the eraser end and the GetFirefox.com text , it looked about right on the proof .
Still looks fine though .
Other colors such as red on a white background or white on a red background would be interesting , but I think the planet part of the logo would look out of place .
Using nothing but the text " Firefox " in these cases I 'm sure would look fine .
The blue base paint on a few of the pencils was kind of rough / bubbled instead of being perfectly flat .
No big deal , it was just a small few , the rest were perfect .
The erasers on these pencils work great !
These should work well with Google Gmail Paper ! :)
Two heaping boxes of Firefox pencils !
( With a few already removed from the first box )
For size and color reference here they are next to Firefox CDs .
Firefox pencils : " take back the paper " .
That is a lot of pencils !
Pencils !
Pencils !
The Pencils are here !
Yay , pencils !
Back to Mozilla Kicks Ass
Today at the Worldwide Partner Conference in San Francisco , Microsoft 's chief operating officer , Kevin Turner , announced that Windows Server 2008 ( previously known as Longhorn ) , Microsoft SQL Server 2008 , and Visual Studio 2008 will be officially launched on February 27 , 2008 .
This may come as a surprise to those following the Windows 2008 Server news closely , since most sources at Microsoft have been insisting that the next version of its server operating system will released at the very end of 2007 .
Apparently in Redmond there is a difference between releasing the OS and the extravagant product launches , which are more of a pep rally for the product then a technical presentation .
Since this news comes in the context of a speech at the Worldwide Partner Conference , the focus is on money and how much Microsoft Partners can expect to make off the release of these three products .
With lackluster Vista sales , along with Apple and Linux continuing to push hard for acceptance in the corporate workplace , this year most resellers have had to rely on Office 2007 to make their sales numbers .
Next year could be a different matter .
Windows Server 2008 integrates tightly with Vista , which will help speed adoption of both OSes in the corporate world .
( I know personally of several Fortune 500 companies that are waiting on Server 2008 before starting their Vista rollouts , including my own . )
Partners can also expect those who are waiting for Vista 's Service Pack 1 , which is slated to be released about the same time as Server 2008 , to get off the fence , further boosting sales ( as much as $ 128 billion , according to Turner ) .
One possible downside to the announcement is that since companies now have a hard date for the release of these products , they may push their adoption dates back so they can do them en masse — something that neither Microsoft nor their partners want to see .
I am really excited about Windows Server 2008 .
Not only does it build on Server 2003 's emphasis on security and ease of management , but it hits two really important points : Terminal Services and virtualization .
There is no doubt that virtualization is one of the hottest topics in the data center , and Microsoft has addressed this by making Windows Server 2008 more effective as a virtual machine with their core roles , but the company also plans on releasing the update to Virtual Server soon after the release of Windows Server 2008 — albeit with out all the bells and whistles they originally planned .
Smaller virtual machines running on a more efficient hypervisor makes for a happy data center .
On the Terminal Server side , a lot of functionality that previously required additional software is now being bundled into the core OS for free .
This is a godsend for those IT departments running on a lean budget who want to support additional features but cannot justify the added expense of a full - blown Citrix environment .
No matter how you slice it , Windows Server 2008 will be a big deal .
Obviously it 's not going to sell as many copies as a desktop OS like Vista , and certainly it will have fewer people that see it face to face , but IT departments know that the core of their infrastructure needs to be as stable and as flexible as possible .
So far , everything I 've seen of Windows Server 2008 leads me to believe that Microsoft has done a good job listening to customer feedback and is on target to make this a must - have upgrade for all but the smallest companies .
Sexual orientation , at least for men , seems to be settled before birth .
“ I think most of the scientists working on these questions are convinced that the antecedents of sexual orientation in males are happening early in life , probably before birth , ” Dr. Breedlove said , “ whereas for females , some are probably born to become gay , but clearly some get there quite late in life . ”

Sexual behavior includes a lot more than sex .
Helen Fisher , an anthropologist at Rutgers University , argues that three primary brain systems have evolved to direct reproductive behavior .
One is the sex drive that motivates people to seek partners .
A second is a program for romantic attraction that makes people fixate on specific partners .
Third is a mechanism for long - term attachment that induces people to stay together long enough to complete their parental duties .
Romantic love , which in its intense early stage “ can last 12 - 18 months , ” is a universal human phenomenon , Dr. Fisher wrote last year in The Proceedings of the Royal Society , and is likely to be a built - in feature of the brain .
Brain imaging studies show that a particular area of the brain , one associated with the reward system , is activated when subjects contemplate a photo of their lover .
The best evidence for a long - term attachment process in mammals comes from studies of voles , a small mouselike rodent .
A hormone called vasopressin , which is active in the brain , leads some voles to stay pair - bonded for life .
People possess the same hormone , suggesting a similar mechanism could be at work in humans , though this has yet to be proved .
Researchers have devoted considerable effort to understanding homosexuality in men and women , both for its intrinsic interest and for the light it could shed on the more usual channels of desire .
Studies of twins show that homosexuality , especially among men , is quite heritable , meaning there is a genetic component to it .
But since gay men have about one - fifth as many children as straight men , any gene favoring homosexuality should quickly disappear from the population .
Such genes could be retained if gay men were unusually effective protectors of their nephews and nieces , helping genes just like theirs get into future generations .
But gay men make no better uncles than straight men , according to a study by Dr. Bailey .
So that leaves the possibility that being gay is a byproduct of a gene that persists because it enhances fertility in other family members .
Some studies have found that gay men have more relatives than straight men , particularly on their mother ’s side .
But Dr. Bailey believes the effect , if real , would be more clear - cut .
“ Male homosexuality is evolutionarily maladaptive , ” he said , noting that the phrase means only that genes favoring homosexuality cannot be favored by evolution if fewer such genes reach the next generation .
Church Relaxes Negro Admittance Policy Pigmentation Test and Special Seating Arrangements Now Available !
Freehold Iowa- Wednesday evening , Pastor Deacon
Fred sent elderly white church members into a tizzy of profane catcalls when he announced that Landover Baptist would be admitting people of color into the main sanctuary for the first time in history .
He assuaged their fears by confiding that coloreds would have limited access to the general congregation and would be restricted to hidden areas .
" We 've got to face it my friends , " he said , " It 's not the same world anymore .
There are colored folks in this town who make more money than some of our tin- level tithers , and cash does n't discriminate based on color .
It 's all green to Jesus and He does n't care if it comes out of a Negro 's shoe , or a white man 's wallet , as long as it ends up in our offering plates on Sunday morning .
Praise God ! "
Landover Baptist will utilize a screening process invented by wealthy , educated colored folks .
" We understand that people of color with money are just as leery of other Nubians whose ancestors were apparently so hideously unattractive that no obese , drunken white man could even bring himself to rape them , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
Since Coloreds have developed a successful process for screening out their undesirables , and since we do n't have much experience in these matters , the Board of Deacons at Landover Baptist is advising that whites borrow from a pre-existing process that people of color are already very comfortable with .
" We understand that this is a very exciting time for local Negroes , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" For many , it 's their first opportunity to worship in a real church , with a floor that does n't turn to mud when it rains , and to be among people whose parents and grandparents first introduced their ancestors to the lashing Love of Jesus .
If it 's any indication of their eagerness , there is a already a long list of applicants who have paid the non refundable $ 50 .
00 admittance test fee . "
Prospective Negro church members annual household income must exceed $ 148,000 ( as verified by non-colored accountants ) to qualify for the following admittance tests : 1 . Brown Paper Bag Test :
A brown paper bag will be placed next to the face of each candidate .
If the skin of the candidate is darker than the bag , they will not be admitted into the church .
If such a person is unable to tap - dance or engage in any other harmless talent to the delight of the families making their way from the reserved parking decks , they will be immediately escorted by Pastor Sergeant Connor into the next county .
Those Negroes who pass this initial test will then be directed to the appropriate ticket window and should then pay careful attention to the three signs for the new , separate entrances : Brown Paper Bag , High Yellow , and Passing .
Out of loving Christian concern , we understand that if an individual falls into one category , they will be uncomfortable if they are seated in the company of another category .
As such , one of the domestics employed by the Ladies of Landover will make a binding , non-appealable , decision regarding where you will sit based on your skin tone .
2 . Pencil Test :
A pencil will be placed through the hairy naps at the back of the head of each candidate .
If the pencil stays in the naps without support , the candidate will be denied access to the church , but will be permitted to join us in worship from the parking lot if a love offering is make in advance .
3 . Bible Balance Test :
A Bible will be placed at the tuft of the back , just above the buttocks of the candidate .
If the hind end is jutted in such a way that it holds the Bible in place without support , the candidate will be denied access to the main sanctuary , but will be permitted to join us in worship in the caged area behind the one way mirror above the center balcony .
4 . Pronunciation Test :
Candidates will be given a series of simple English sentences to memorize and recite ( example : " I say , do n't you rather think that this pish - posh about it being dreadfully inclement was balderdash , as it appears that it shall be most agreeably lovely – just absolutely , gloriously brilliant -- for well into the next fortnight , no ? " )
If the candidate forgets or mispronounces any of the words , or if the Pastor doing the testing is not comfortable with their quarrelsome or uppity inflection , they will not be admitted to the main sanctuary , but will be allowed to join us in worship from the parking lot or from behind the one way mirror above the center balcony .
5 . Special Test
For legal reasons , we do not discuss this special test publicly .
Historical Note : Previously , people of color were confined to the small caged area to the rear of main sanctuary where they were forced to stand behind a one way mirror .
Coloreds were also permitted to sit out in the field behind the church and watch services on the outdoor jumbo - tron above the parking lot .
Since , in bald violation of States ' Rights and etiquette , the US Marshals ' surprise raid in 1972 forced Landover members to finally free their slaves , white parishioners have since suffered greatly for the Lord 's sake .
In some extreme cases , members who cannot afford servants are even forced to do their own cooking and cleaning .
Most Landover Baptist members retain their family slaves in the form of " indentured servants . "
These faithful and happy servants retain their previous living quarters and are given a small salary for food and clothing .
In return , they are blessed daily with the privilege of serving the last generation of True American Christians™ in Freehold , Iowa .
These faithful servants await their reward in Heaven where , God willing , they will continue 5 star service to God 's chosen people who will become their masters in mansions of Glory .

Being subjected to advertising is just something we ’ve come to expect in our daily routines , and for most of us , we ’ve become so conditioned to various advertising methods that we do n’t even think twice about it .
There is nothing wrong with advertising in and of itself .
It ’s how we learn about products , services and entertainment .
Advertising is also the big main source of revenue for things we hold dear like television and The Movie Blog ( which is 100 % funded by advertising ) , so I ’m certainly never going to rail on the evils of advertising .
However , advertising in movie theaters is a topic that has been brought up here on The Movie Blog more than a few times , and a recent report by the Cinema Advertising Council in the New York Post begs us to once again revisit the issue .
We ’ve all figured that commercials playing in movie theaters was worth a lot of money … but did you realize its worth almost HALF A BILLION DOLLARS ?
The IMDB gives us this :
Revenue from in - theater advertising rose more than 15 percent to $ 456 million from $ 395 million a year ago …
The Post quoted CAC Chairman Cliff Marks as expressing the belief that moviegoers are becoming “ more accepting ” of screen advertising .
A recent Arbitron poll indicated that two - thirds of moviegoers “ do n’t mind ” the ads .
Do n’t mind the ads ?
DON ’T MIND THE ADS ???
First , I should mention here that I do n’t mind the idea of movie theaters making money .
It ’s a business .
They exist to make money , and if they can find new creative ways to generate money then I say more power to them .
If they can come up with new ways to get my money while providing me with some new service or product that I ’m willing to pay for … then good for them .
Second , there are types of advertising in movie theaters I “ do n’t mind ” .
For example , if the movie is supposed to start at 7 pm and I get into my seat at 6:45 pm , I really do n’t mind commercials and ads being shown on the screen until showtime .
I ’m just sitting there anyway , it ’s not taking away from my time since the show is n’t advertised to start for another 15 minutes … so really … showing ads in that vacuum is no skin off my nose , it gives me something to look at while I wait , and it generates some income for the theaters .
GREAT !
It ’s a win / win for everyone .
But you do n’t have to have a degree in advertising to know that the bulk of that $ 456 million in ad money does n’t come from those “ pre-show ” commercials .
Oh no no no no… most of that money comes from the ads I LOATHE .
The commercials ( not trailers … I like those ) that they start playing at the time they advertised the MOVIE was supposed to start .
I ’ve said this before , but it ’s worth repeating .
– When you take my money for popcorn , at least I ’m getting a tasty treat
– When you take my cash at the box office , I ’m getting to come in to watch the movie
– When you take my time for commercials on TV , I ’m getting a “ free ” TV show out of it
But what are we getting for our time with commercials in movie theaters ?
When the ad says “ Movie starts at 7 pm ” and I ’m in my seat ( that I paid admission for ) at 7 pm , it ’s time for you to start giving me what I paid you for … the movie .
If you want to show me commercials , fine … give me the movie for free then .
The theater industry is pulling in RECORD amounts of income from those commercials , and unlike TV ( where we get a free show ) , WE GET NOTHING IN RETURN FOR OUR TIME SITTING THERE WHEN THE MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO START .
Movie theaters have in essence found the PERFECT advertising .
Ads that take to audiences time , without giving them anything in return .
I do n’t mind theaters making money off me when I get a product , service or entertainment in return … but commercials playing at 7 pm when you told me the movie would be starting is doing nothing but STEALING my time .
You are taking from me without giving anything in return .
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM ONLINE MOVIE PIRACY !?!?
When we download a movie without giving the movie industry anything in return , they call that a crime ( and it is ) .
But when the industry takes our time ( sometimes up to 15 or 20 minutes ) without giving us anything for that time in return they call it “ smart marketing ” .
How about I start calling pirating movies “ Smart Shopping ” .
Will piracy be considered ok then ?
Remember , YOU ARE GOING TO DIE SOME DAY .
That means time has value , and when anything else in life takes your time , you get compensated in one form or another .
Let ’s think of it this way .
TIME
I see approximately 8 films in theater each month .
At about 15 minutes of commercials per film ( remember , these are ads that begin to play at the movie advertised start time ) , I end up spending about 2 hours per month watching ads in theaters uncompensated .
That ’s 24 hours , or a full day of uncompensated ad watching in a year .
MONEY
I ’m not a doctor or lawyer , so let ’s say my time is worth a measly $ 20 / hour .
Since I spent about 24 hours watching uncompensated ads in theaters last year , I figure the movie industry owes me about $ 480 out of that Half Billion they made last year off my time .
Seems fair .
The principle for piracy and time theft is the same .
Taking an asset ( a movie , or your time ) without providing the due compensation for taking that asset .
So where do we start the class action lawsuit ?
If you tell me the movie starts at 7 pm , then when I PAY YOU to get into the movies , there is an implied contract that you give me what I paid for … a movie at 7 pm .
When you instead put up 15 - 20 minutes of commercials at 7 pm you are stealing my time , and also stealing MY SHARE OF THAT $ 456 MILLION you made off my time .
So the next time you ’re pirating a movie ( which is neither something I do nor endorse ) , let that ease your conscience , because although you ’re stealing the $ 10 you would have paid in admission … they probably owe you about $ 150 for stolen ad time anyway .

If Sneetches with Stars use Java , and Sneetches without Stars use Ruby , who uses ML ?
Update
: More than a few people have written that Steve Yegge 's association of static typing with neatness and dynamic typing with slovenliness runs opposite to their impressions of the kinds of people who strongly prefer one or the other .
I used Steve 's terms in the original post , partly because I thought people would get the same joke I thought Steve was making .
It look slike they do n't , nobody wrote to say " LOL . "
I have changed the terms to something that represents what I think of the cultural divide between programmers who like Java and programmers who like Ruby .

I tend rather to be critical of precise statements ; they are the only ones which can correctly be labelled " wrong . "

Why would the Sneetches without stars use starless languages ?
By James Coomarasamy
BBC News , Philadelphia
The collapse of President Bush 's recent immigration reform was partly fuelled by fears that the English language was under threat from Spanish .
But as one food stall owner in Philadelphia illustrates , English has some unlikely champions .
Joey Vento sounded pleased to hear from me .
Well , fairly pleased .
Facing threat of legal action , Joey Vento says : " Bring it on ! "
That is not quite how I remembered our previous encounter .
I had certainly quizzed him about his views on immigration , but he had given as good as he had got and been more than happy to talk about the need to defend the English language in today 's America .
With immigration back in the news , I asked him , could we have another chat ?
" Sure , " he said .
And with that I was on my way to Geno's - the Philadelphia cheese steak stall he founded 41 years ago .
It is hard to miss , on the apex of Ninth and Passyunk , in the heart of Little Italy .
It is just a takeaway stall really , but there is so much neon on the inside and outside that Joey affectionately calls it " the Las Vegas of Philadelphia " .
Defender of English
Which is appropriate , for a man who had just hit the publicity jackpot when I last met him .
For some , he had struck a chord , struck a blow for ordinary Americans .
For others , this was brazen discrimination .
English is a language that Joey 's Sicilian grandfather never mastered when he came to the United States in the 1920s .
" But he tried , " Joey told me , " and he knew that was what it meant to come here . "
Joey 's not exactly proud of his family .
He freely admits that his brother and father were gangsters .
But he is proud of the notoriety he has achieved as a defender of the English language .
Somewhat disconcertingly he was brandishing a knife when I arrived , but it turned out he was in the middle of slicing the rolls for the day 's food .
" I'm 68 , " he reminded me , looking fighting fit in a black T - shirt , with a silver chain around his neck , " and I 've been up since three in the morning .
Do n't tell me Americans wo n't do the tough jobs . "
Something of a shrine
Joey Vento's restaurant is a Philadelphia landmark
" People visit us , then they see the Liberty Bell , " Joey jokes , placing his stall just above one of the symbols of American independence .
Its signature - in fact its only dish - is a bun filled with thinly sliced rib-eyed steaks , topped with chopped , fried onion and a choice of three cheeses : American , provolone and an amorphous , glutinous yellow substance called cheese whiz .
I would not recommend the latter .
As we were chatting , one of Joey 's well - fed regulars popped in and asked for a double helping of whiz .
For breakfast .
When he left , Joey confided that the whiz could be speeding him to a heart attack .
" But in moderation there 's no better stuff , " he added quickly , " although I 'd recommend the provolone . "
Twelve months on , the cheese choice remains the same and the controversial sticker is still there .
Joey maintains that his stall has become something of a shrine , not just for cheese steak connoisseurs , but for English - first pilgrims , who get a free pen and sticker when they order .
Messages of support
He seems unconcerned that the local authorities are taking him to court for placing what they argue is an offensive sign in his window .
" Bring it on , " he says , his eyes glistening almost as brightly as his diamond ear stud .
" What have I got to fear ? "
And with that , he glances up at the walls for reassurance .
Staring back at him is a host of famous faces , from Bill Clinton to Justin Timberlake to Rudy Giuliani - some snapped in the act of rustling up cheese steaks at the stall themselves - all wearing huge , cheese whiz - eating grins on their faces .
But none of those grins is as wide as Joey 's , a self - made man who clearly loves the limelight .
Leaving a batch of rolls to languish unsliced , he scuttles away to a back room , looking for proof of the righteousness of his cause .
He returns with a pile of folders , overflowing with letters and messages of support from all over the country .
" We 're with you , Joey . "
" What you 're doing is great , Joey . "
Even : " We 'll vote for you Joey . "
To these writers , he is a true patriot , defending his countrymen from the threat to their identity posed by the growing influence of Spanish .
And while that is not the only reason why the immigration bill failed , the letters to Joey give a sense of the grassroots anger that senators from both parties have been hearing .
Unlike Joey , the immigration bill really has been through the wringer , and failed to come out the other side .
When I phoned him , just after the senate vote , Joey was triumphant .
" Looks like those politicians listened to Joey , " he said .
Looks like they did .

There 's always talk about economic improvements for developing nations ; fair trade agreements , living wages and a global economy .
Often lost in those discussions is the idea that improving health is also an important part of economic and societal change .
The new challenge for the international community , writes Barry R. Bloom , Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health , in a new subsection of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) called Sustainable Health , “ goes beyond how to contribute to pilot programs in health that provide drugs , vaccines and preventive or health care services ” to how to do so in a way that engages the local and national populations and enables the programs to expand to a nationwide scale that is sustainable over time .
[ As defined by the UN Bruntland Commission : " Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . " ]
Economists David E. Bloom and David Canning describe the discovery in life expectancy data of two clusters of countries , one of high mortality and the other low , that both progress toward improved life expectancy but lack a continuum of change between them .
An examination of life expectancy in the early 1960s revealed one group of countries clustered around a life expectancy of 40 years and a second group clustered around a life expectancy of 65 years .
By the first half of this decade , the mode of each cluster had moved up by about 10 years .
( Mode is the value occurring most frequently in a series of observations or statistical data . )
The authors reject the idea that these changes reflect a simple convergence process , that instead , the data suggest continuous advances within the cluster but that low life expectancy countries seem mired in a mortality " trap . ”
A few countries from time to time seem to escape the trap by rapidly reaching a certain threshold and then leap the gap to the high life expectancy cluster .
These observations hold even when excluding the effect of AIDS mortality on countries .
The authors suggest consideration of a “ big push ” ( or transformational ) theory of health aid that focuses on helping those countries approaching the low - mortality threshold to bounce into the low mortality cluster rather than providing incremental funding to a larger set of countries .
“ With limited resources , the largest health gains may be achieved by focusing on countries near the threshold , where small changes in health status can have large effects on those countries ’ chances of escaping the mortality trap , ” they write .
A second paper , by Burton H. Singer of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University and Marcia Caldas de Castro , assistant professor of demography in the Department of Population and International Health at HSPH , argues that sustainable control of schistosomiasis and other water - borne diseases in the tropics will require bridging organizations and communities to ensure human and animal disease surveillance , monitoring the impact of new economic development projects and linking the engineering and health institutions responsible for clean water and sanitation .
Another article describes the success of a program in rural villages of Argentina that , by including the community , was able to create sustainable control of the parasite causing Chagas disease .
A fourth article is an analysis of factors predisposing industrial workers in India to cardiovascular disease in which the critical importance of education to reduce tobacco use and hypertension is revealed .
All four papers in the special series , writes Dean Barry R. Bloom , “ emphasize the importance of multisectoral approaches to providing sustainable solutions to complex health problems in developing countries -- public health , medicine , engineering , education and community engagement . ”

My friend Patrick spent the past year teaching English in Japan .
It 's a good way to get yourself involved in lots of sexy adventures , I 'm told !
Near the end of his tenure there , he gave some of his students blank Dinosaur Comics printouts , and asked them to fill in the dialogue as an English exercise .
Much like a similar process in Korea , the results are hilarious and surreal .
Thank you to Pat , and to all the anonymous students who worked on these comics !
Pat was apparently a big influence on them , judging by how often he shows up in the comics .
Also , I think it 's pretty neat how despite having no knowledge of the comic , and coming from an entirely different cultural context , the character of T - Rex often appears largely unchanged .
I 've included text annotation in cases where the handwriting can be difficult !
The final comic below - the one at the very bottom - may be the saddest and sweetest dinosaur comic ever .
When you travel to Europe , do n’t be surprised to find that many Europeans do n’t believe in God .
I have even witnessed some alcohol - infused conversations between Americans and Europeans that almost ended in fistfights over His / Her existence .
When you travel to the following countries , you might want to pick a less controversial topic of conversation … umm , maybe George W ?
Here are the Top 10 least religious countries in the world :
1. Sweden ( up to 85 % non-believer , atheist , agnostic )
2. Vietnam
3. Denmark
4. Norway
5. Japan
6. Czech Republic
7. Finland
8. France
9. South Korea
10 . Estonia ( up to 49 % non-believer , atheist , agnostic )
The one that surprised me was Israel , ranking 19th , with up to 37 % claiming to be non-believer , atheist , agnostic .
Compare that with the United States , ranking 44th , with 3 - 9 % non-believers , atheists , agnostics .
( I think I have met them all on the streets of New York City , too . )
The survey concluded that “ high levels of organic atheism are strongly correlated with high levels of societal health , such as low homicide rates , low poverty rates , low infant mortality rates , and low illiteracy rates , as well as high levels of educational attainment , per capita income , and gender equality .
Most nations characterized by high degrees of individual and societal security have the highest rates of organic atheism , and conversely , nations characterized by low degrees of individual and societal security have the lowest rates of organic atheism .
In some societies , particularly Europe , atheism is growing .
However , throughout much of the world — particularly nations with high birth rates — atheism is barely discernable . ”
They have a U.S. State Department contract through Diplomatic Security .
Instead of using Diplomatic Security officers or hiring new Security officers or relying on U.S. military personnel , the Bush Administration has contracted with firms like Blackwater , Triple Canopy , and others for people capable of conducting personnel security details .
State Department is not about to curtail the contract with Blackwater , who is tightly wired into Washington .
Plus , State Department simply does not have the bodies available to carry out the security mission .
Second problem .
The Iraqi government has zero power to enforce a decision to oust a firm like Blackwater .
For starters , Blackwater has a bigger air force and more armored vehicles then the Iraqi Army and police put together .
As Spencer Ackerman reported , Blackwater 's little bird helicopter ( an aircraft normally used by U.S. special operations forces ) that was firing mini guns at Iraqi targets on the ground this past weekend .
I can only imagine how Americans would react if there were Russian , Chinese , Mexican , or French security firms running around the United States and getting into firefights in tough neighborhoods , such as South Central Los Angeles .
We would just shrug our shoulders and say nothing .
Right ?
Yeah , that 's what I thought .
This incident will enrage Iraqis and their subsequent realization that they are impotent to do anything about it will do little to support the fantasy that the surge is working .
There are some Iraqis who genuinely want to run their own country .
But we are not about to give them the keys to the car .
Blackwater is staying .

Brain Surgery : It Really Is Brain Surgery
Dynamic 3 - D computer modeling tracks brain changes during surgery
A 3 - D tessellated image of a brain is projected on a large monitor .
August 31 , 2007
Everything changes after the surgeons open your skull .
Your brain , and the tumor inside it , no longer fully float in their protective bath of cerebrospinal fluid .
Gravity comes into play , as does the atmospheric pressure of the operating theater .
The brain responds to these foreign forces , the cerebral tissue sagging , rebounding and changing shape .
The tumor that the neurosurgeons want to remove also has changed position .
The preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image is no longer accurate enough for brain surgery .
Thus , the brain the surgeon operates on is a different shape from the one depicted in the preoperative MRI .
Of course , once the surgeon begins work , the shape of the brain changes even more .
The brain 's changing shape is a problem not only of space , but of time .
The goal is to remove as much as possible of the tumor and none of the healthy neural tissue .
Today 's operating procedure is to keep track of the brain 's movement by conducting MRI scans during surgery .
MRI is a labor - intensive and painstaking process that takes time .
Processing each intraoperative MRI can put the procedure on hold for as long as 90 minutes .
" They tell me that they do n't even talk while the MRI is happening , " said Nikos Chrisochoides , a professor of computer science at the College of William and Mary in Virginia .
Chrisochoides is the leader of a group that is working with a team at Harvard Medical School to use mathematics and computer power to solve the neurosurgeon 's problem of space and time .
Modeling the brain
In essence , the William and Mary team provides the surgical team with a dynamic computer model of the patient 's brain .
In clinical trials , Chrisochoides says his team can render a new model in six or seven minutes , but hopes to be able to do so in under two minutes .
" We want to help the neurosurgeon make an informed decision of what to cut , where the critical paths are , what areas to avoid , " he said .
" I 'm neither a neurosurgeon nor a doctor , so the contribution of my research is to make this distillation of objects really , really , really fast . "
Chrisochoides ' lab is dominated by a projection computer monitor whose screen would not look out of place in a small multiplex theater .
Chrisochoides handed out 3 - D glasses to a small audience that included a colleague from NASA and Andriy Fedorov , a Ph.D. student recently returned from 15 months as the team 's representative at Harvard .
Chrisochoides takes his place at the keyboard and mouse , and the huge monitor displays a parietal slice of a computer mesh brain .
A nasty - looking blob clearly indicates the presence of the tumor .
The glasses give the audience a striking 3 - D effect , showing off the curves of the vector arrows indicating how displacement -- represented by color as well as length of the shaft -- was acting on the brain .
The process begins with the acquisition of a variety of images before the surgery - - images which are otherwise unavailable in the middle of the procedure .
Low - resolution intraoperative data allows the tracking of the shift of brain matter and calculates how to change the preoperative images accordingly .
Only a guess . . .
The brain , of course , is an elastic object .
" If you push it , " Chrisochoides said , " it takes energy and then after a while it settles down .
We can calculate the place where it settles by solving the partial differential equation .
Mathematicians can tell us that there is a solution , but they cannot tell us what the solution is .
There 's no such thing for this equation .
There 's no analytic solution .
So we have to approximate . "
Chrisochoides approximates the geometry of the patient 's brain by tessellating it into triangles in three dimensions , or in other words , generating a mesh representing the brain .
Its work that the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) has funded for the past seven years that he has been at William and Mary , and earlier this year , Chrisochoides ' work earned him a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship .
" This fellowship means quite a lot to my research , " said Chrisochoides .
" It is in medicine and health , not computer science as one would expect , and it will open many more opportunities for our project . "
The funds will establish a new Center for Real - Time Computing at William and Mary and drive the design of three new courses on medical image analysis , something Chrisochoides will undertake as he begins writing the first book on parallel mesh generation .
" I 'm delighted to see his success in terms of his scientific work and societal impact and the recognition he received , " said Frederica Darema , one of the NSF officers who has overseen Chrisochoides ' efforts .
" This is a great example of how computer sciences research is impacting other fields and enables such important capabilities , and it 's really great to see this impact in medicine . "

Donald Kerr , a top intelligence official with the US government , says that citizens need to change their definition of privacy to match the government 's definition , the AP reports .
Appointed Director of the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) in 2005 , Kerr is now the principal deputy director of national intelligence .
Kerr is one of many in the intelligence community who finds Americans ' views on privacy to be antiquated and unreasonable .
Kerr echoes the view that privacy is not synonymous with anonymity .
Americans who want to see anonymity at the center of privacy policies need to give up this notion , he says .
" Too often , privacy has been equated with anonymity ; and it's an idea that is deeply rooted in American culture ... but in our interconnected and wireless world , anonymity - or the appearance of anonymity - is quickly becoming a thing of the past , " Kerr said according to a PDF transcript of his comments .
Americans need to shift their definition of privacy to center instead on the proper maintenance and protection of personal data by government and business entities .
Kerr said that " privacy , I would offer , is a system of laws , rules , and customs with an infrastructure of Inspectors General , oversight committees , and privacy boards on which our intelligence community commitment is based and measured .
And it is that framework that we need to grow and nourish and adjust as our cultures change . "
Kerr also tackled the " common thinking that , in order to have more safety , you get less privacy . "
Kerr argues that " you need to have both ...
You can be perfectly safe in a prison ; but you certainly are n't free .
And you can be perfectly free in an anarchist society ; but you certainly are n't safe . "
The problem , according to Kerr 's line of thought , is n't that government and businesses may have intricately detailed information about citizens , or that they might be actively working to collect such data as part of an extensive program of electronic surveillance .
The concerns , Kerr says , should be focused on how such data is safeguarded and how Americans view the importance of that data .
Kerr 's comments come at a time when the US government is trying to address objections over the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act .
In particular , the question is whether or not telecommunications companies deserve immunity for their involvement in illegal wiretapping beginning in 2001 .
Kerr seems to be saying , hey guys , what they did is n't bad at all , you should be impressed how secret it all was , really .
Proponents of increased surveillance , like Kerr , have high estimations of the government 's ability to safeguard sensitive data , though the sentiment is not shared by all .
It 's hard to have too much confidence when the FBI is busy losing laptops and the nature of such programs appears to be one involving little oversight from independent branches of government .
It 's cliché , but Benjamin Franklin long ago warned against rhetoric that demands trading individual rights for corporate security .
Asking Americans to greenlight extensive , unchecked electronic surveillance by changing their very definition of privacy is a prime example of such rhetoric .
Kurt Opsahl , a senior staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said " It 's just another ' trust us , we 're the government ' " argument .

The game plays in that I randomly distribute the 70 + cards to my students , we start with one student reading a definition from a card , and the students have to figure out the word that matches the definition .
That card is then read " I have [ ] , who has [ ] ? "

WASHINGTON , May 15 — President Bush intervened in March 2004 to avert a crisis over the National Security Agency ’s domestic eavesdropping program after Attorney General John Ashcroft , Director Robert S. Mueller III of the F.B.I. and other senior Justice Department aides all threatened to resign , a former deputy attorney general testified Tuesday .
Mr. Bush quelled the revolt over the program ’s legality by allowing it to continue without Justice Department approval , also directing department officials to take the necessary steps to bring it into compliance with the law , according to Congressional testimony by the former deputy attorney general , James B. Comey .
Although a conflict over the program had been disclosed in The New York Times , Mr. Comey provided a fuller account of the 48 - hour drama , including , for the first time , Mr. Bush ’s role , the threatened resignations and a race as Mr. Comey hurried to Mr. Ashcroft ’s hospital sickbed to intercept White House officials , who were pushing for approval of the N.S.A. program .
Describing the events as “ the most difficult of my professional career , ” Mr. Comey appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of its inquiry into the dismissal of federal prosecutors and the role of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales .
Several lawmakers wanted to examine Mr. Gonzales ’s actions in the N.S.A. matter , when he was White House counsel , and cited them to buttress their case that he should resign .

The Commission for Racial Equality said yesterday it was unacceptable for any shop to stock or sell the 1930s cartoon adventure of the Belgian boy journalist because of its crude racial stereotypes .
The book , which includes a scene where Tintin is made chief of an African village because he is a " good white man " and a black woman bowing to Tintin saying : " White man very great ... white mister is big juju man ! " was highly offensive , a spokeswoman from the commission said .
" This book contains imagery and words of hideous racial prejudice , where the ' savage natives ' look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles , " she said .
" How and why do Borders think that it 's OK to peddle such racist material ?
This is potentially highly offensive to a great number of people . "
She added that the only place the book was acceptable was in a museum - with a sign accompanying it saying " old- fashioned , racist claptrap " .
The commission was made aware that the chain stocked the book after a customer , David Enright , a solicitor , found it in the children 's section of a London branch .
" I was aghast to see page after page of representations of black African people as baboons or monkeys , bowing before a white teenager and speaking like retarded children , " he wrote .
A spokesman for Borders confirmed the book would be moved to the adult section but it would not be withdrawn , adding that the company stood by its commitment to let customers make the choice .
Waterstone 's said it would not censor the book but is considering moving it from the children 's section .
The book 's publisher , Egmont , released a colour edition in Britain two years ago , which included a foreword noting the colonial attitudes prevalent when it was written .
Update :
MySpace , still holding the blue ribbon in the popularity contest between social networks , has now announced that it will be " joining forces " with Google to support OpenSocial .
" Our partnership with Google allows developers to gain massive distribution without unnecessary specialized development for every platform , " said MySpace CEO and co-founder Chris DeWolfe in a statement .
" This is about helping the start - up spend more time building a great product rather than rebuilding it for every social network .
We 're pleased to collaborate with Google to establish a landmark standard for social applications . "
MySpace 's reasons for joining the initiative are probably rooted in attempting to slow the mass exodus of its users to Facebook .
Whether Facebook will join OpenSocial still remains to be seen , but with its number one competitor now behind it , we are n't holding our breath .
Original story :
Google is gearing up to launch OpenSocial , a set of APIs to be used across social networks .
No , Google is not ditching Orkut ( its own social network that is popular in Brazil but has fizzled out in the US ) , although Orkut will be involved .
Instead , OpenSocial will offer a set of common APIs that its partners — or " hosts " — can use on their networks .
This will allow other social networks to get in on the app / widget phenomenon that has become so big at Facebook and give users the opportunity to have a more robust social networking experience .
The goal of OpenSocial is not to compete with the likes of Facebook — at least not directly , on the social networking level — but rather to take what Facebook has done with its API and make it more open , more universal , and apply it across any number of social networking partners that want to join up .
Right now , Facebook 's API uses its own markup and query languages ( FBML and FQL ) in order for developers to create apps and widgets for the platform — not terribly inconvenient for some who have the time and patience to learn something new , but a pain for everyone else .
Google 's API will allow developers to use markup that they 're most familiar with : HTML , JavaScript , and even Flash to offer similar apps and widgets to other networks .
Any social network can decide to use OpenSocial , and a number of big ( and small ) names have already joined up for launch .
LinkedIn , Orkut , Friendster , Salesforce , Ning , Hi5 , Plaxo , Viadeo , and Oracle are all on board to make use of OpenSocial 's offerings .
A number of developers have already joined in , including iLike , Flixter , and Slide .
When OpenSocial goes live tomorrow at http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial, however , anyone who wants to develop widgets can do so , including you and me .
The three common APIs that Google will provide include user data , friend information , and activities ( when people become friends , people change things , make announcements , etc. ) .
Additionally , Google will provide developers a live " sandbox " in which to test their apps on Orkut , which is already live at http://sandbox.orkut.com
( although there 's not much there yet ) .
Of course , here is where Google 's scheme will force developers to join ( or rejoin , as the case may be ) Orkut , in hopes that they might even stick around .
It does look and function a lot differently than it did back in the olden days , after all .
One OpenSocial partner , Ning , is already pretty excited about the prospect of having apps available in the same way that Facebook does .
" This is very , very good for the web .
Open Social is the kind of standard that web developers love , and can easily use , " Ning ( and Netscape ) cofounder Marc Andreessen wrote on his blog .
" We will aggressively support Open Social in every conceivable way . "
There are some criticisms of OpenSocial , however .
Analyst David Card at Jupiter Research points out that there are some major players noticeably missing from the list of launch participants , such as Amazon , eBay , and Microsoft .
Not to mention MySpace and Yahoo — as Card puts it , " the list of participants includes seemingly everybody but those that matter . "
OpenSocial 's success will ultimately depend upon whether Google can get other major players to join in after launch , either as hosts , or developers , or both .
If not , then OpenSocial may end up going the way of Orkut — a good idea that fizzled out in the shadow of stronger competitors .
This is the sixth article in a twelve - part series that discusses the twelve finalists and their calculator submissions for the OMGWTF Programming Contest .
The entries are being presented in the order submitted , and the winner will be announced on June 18 , 2007 .
Yes , you read that title correctly .
OMG !--O-C-R--CAL .
That 's right , someone just had to go and implement Optical Character Recognition for their calculator .
But if that was all that Entry # 100175 ( Ivan Milyakov 's OMG! OCRCAL ) did , it surely would n't have made finalist .
The OMG !OCRCAL is a bit more ... in depth ... than what you might think .
First and foremost , a screen shot of me entering " 881+456 = "
You too can enter calculations in the OMG !
OCRCAL with a simple download of the executable ( omgocrcal.exe ) and the configuration file ( definition . txt , must be in same directory as exe ) .
I highly recommended checking it out first hand .
There 's even a user guide ( omgocrcal.pdf ) in case you run into difficulties .
What makes OMG !
OCRCAL even more unique is that it does n't actually represent the numbers using numbers : everything is based on abstract shapes .
This has the added benefit of allowing the shapes to be completely user configurable .
And this is exactly why I noted above that the definition .
txt file had to be downloaded as well : this file contains all of the number / shape definitions .
I 'll bet you assumed the same thing about definition .
txt that I did : a file filled with all sorts of abstract OCR gobbledygook that only Ivan and his OCR cadre can comprehend .
Good news !
It 's not .
In fact , the OMG !
OCRCAL configuration file is written in English and is completely human readable :
Let 's assume that tab equals 8 spaces
Let 's draw characters randomly Let 's allow user to make mistakes
Now we 'll define numbers Zero is a large circle
One is either a long vertical line or a long vertical line a very small slash line top of first joins top of second
Two is either a part of circle 12 to 6 a long horizontal line 6 of first joins left of second or a part of circle 9 to 5 a slash line a long horizontal line 5 of first joins top of second bottom of second joins left of third -- snip --
The OMG !OCRCAL comes with its very own parser that reads this file and builds shapes from it .
Go ahead , change it .
Make your own shapes that represent numbers .
As for the mathematics , only a handful of things are " hard coded " :
ten symbol names ( " Zero " through " Nine " )
order of symbols ( " Zero " preceeds " One " which preceeds " Two " which preceeds " Three " ... which preceeds " Nine " )
" Zero " acts as a placeholder symbol
The operations work by simple increments and decrements based on the order of symbols .
Addition is performed symbol by symbol ( ala grade school " long addition " ) by incrementing " Zero " the number of times each operand can be decremented ( not so much like grade school ) .
Multiplication is repeated addition , and subtraction and division are mostly opposite of their counterparts .
There is a fair amount of code behind OMG !
OCRCAL – over 4,000 lines of code in 370 + functions – and from what I ’ve seen , it ’s a well thought - out , object - oriented approach to developing this solution .
It has a handful of fun parts ( e.g. probability.h : “ typedef Probability Possibility ; // Alternate spelling ” ) , but the value in checking it out is educational .
I found it very interesting to see how Ivan did things .
As for how he came up with the concept , I had to ask :
First and foremost , Ivan , what drew you to the contest ?
I felt an urge to participate in the contest : somehow it ’s much more fun to write something creative and ... err , useless .
I used to write exclusively C++ code , so I felt qualified to give it a shot .
At what point did you decide OCR was the theme ?
Later on , actually .
My first idea was to use some complicated finite automata configurable in using plain English text .
Thinking about it a little longer , I decided to eliminate all numbers from calculation and operate on entirely abstract entities .
Though the rules said that a custom UI was unnecessary , I felt that a perverse program logic requires a unique UI .
I asked myself , multiple windows ?
Nah , too obvious .
3 - D interface ?
Eh. Handwriting ?
Too complicated … or , was it ?
The left and right side of my brain had a quick meeting : if we can describe the shape of numbers , why can't we recognize the mouse movements based on the same description ?
And hence , the OMG ! OCRCAL was born .
How did you go about developing the OMG !
OCRCAL ?
The first thing I started with was the configuration file .
I defined all of the character shapes in it before even writing a single line of code .
I was hoping to be able to implement custom shapes ( like a “ figure - eight ” ) instead of using two circles , but just ran out of time .
Everything is now just lines , circles , and arcs .
After the config file , I implemented the parser … then the shape recognizer … then the join matcher .
And actually , I “ cheated ” a bit : the first UI was built in C# program , as it was much easier to implement .
I later ported it to C ++.
Whatever happened to the original finite automata concept ?
Well , after 100,000 bytes of code and a few days left before the deadline , the OMG !
OCRCAL was nothing more than a UI : it could n’t even add one plus one .
Goodbye automata , hello elementary school addition !
It was a bit tight .
I found doing mathematics without any numbers to be a bit of a challenge .
I would have really liked to do more , but there ’s only so much time .
Do you work with OCR in your job ?
Not at all .
My day job is a .NET developer at a software engineering company in Moscow , Russia .
Where did you attend university ?
I graduated from Moscow State University of Electronics .
I grew up here , and work here , and just ca n’t ever see leaving .
It ’s a beautiful city with lots of work opportunities for programmers .
And one last question : would you replace Window ’s Calculator with OMG !
OCRCAL ?
Sure .
It would n't make any difference as I calculate using either Google or a sheet of paper .
But then again , my program looks like a sheet , so maybe it 's worth trying !

Propaganda is a type of message aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of people .
Instead of impartially providing information , propaganda is often deliberately misleading , using logical fallacies , that , while sometimes convincing , are not necessarily valid .
The following list includes some of the more amazing propaganda posters ever made by Americans , Soviets , Nazis and others .

American Propaganda
“ You ca n’t beat the Axis if you get VD ”
A series of American propaganda posters during World War II appealed to servicemen ’s patriotism to protect themselves from venereal disease .
“ Wanted ! For murder ”
U.S. propaganda poster , which warns against civilians sharing information on troop movements .
World War II .
“ We can do it ! ”
Of all the images of working women during World War II , the image of women in factories predominates .
Rosie the Riveter –the strong , competent woman dressed in overalls and bandanna–was introduced as a symbol of patriotic womanhood .
The accoutrements of war work–uniforms , tools , and lunch pails –were incorporated into the revised image of the feminine ideal .
“ Above and beyond the call of duty ”
At the beginning of the war , African Americans could join the Navy but could serve only as messmen .
Doris ( “ Dorie ” ) Miller joined the Navy and was in service on board the U.S.S.
West Virginia during the attack on Pearl Harbor .
Restricted to the position of messman , he received no gunnery training .
But during the attack , at great personal risk , he manned the weapon of a fallen gunman and succeeded in hitting Japanese planes .
He was awarded the Navy Cross , but only after persistent pressure from the black press .
“ Pvt. Joe Louis says … ”
1942 Office of Facts and Figures poster promoting a sense of common purpose during World War II .
Keep These Hands Off !
A study of commercial posters undertaken by the U.S. Government found that images of women and children in danger were effective emotional devices .
This Canadian poster was part of the study and served as a model for American posters .

Nazi Propaganda
“ Long live Germany ! ”
This poster makes a direct Christological comparison of Hitler .
Just as a dove descended on Christ when he was baptised by John the Baptist , so what looks to be an eagle hovers against the light of heaven over an idealized Hitler .
Liberators
A 1944 Nazi propaganda poster titled “ LIBERATORS ” , which perfectly epitomizes many perennially - recurring themes of anti-Americanism .
German Nazi euthanasia propaganda
The poster argued in so many words that the care of each “ undesirable ” cost the “ undue burden ” of 60,000 marks of German taxpayer money over the patient ’s lifetime , and that a publication called the New Folk contained a better – indeed , a “ final ” – solution to the difficulty .
“ Get rid of old cloth and shoes ! ”
The Germans worked to gather as much old material for the war effort as possible .
This poster is for a 1943 clothing drive .
Soviet Propaganda
“ Long Live World October [ revolution ] ! ”
A poster of the Russian Civil War , 1918 - 1922 says : Long Live World October [ revolution ] !
The workers conquered power in Russia and will conquer power in the entire world .
“ Build like you would for yourself ! ”
“ The Motherland Is Calling ! ”
A 1941 poster for the World War II
“ Mercilessly , we will humiliate and destroy the enemy ! ”
Soviet propaganda poster from World War II , depicting a Red Army soldier aiming a bayonet at Hitler ’s temple .
The torn paper document is titled “ The Agreement on non-Aggression between Germany and USSR ” .
“ Freedom to the People of Chile ”
“ Victory of Vietnam is a Victory of Solidarity ”
“ The Myth and The Reality ”
What looks like a little american is actually a submarine .
“ Here again blood and oil is being poured ”
This is how USA and allies milking blood and oil from Middle East .
Others
“ If you start a war of invasion , We shall destroy the American bastards first ! ”
A recent North Korean poster against America .
“ This is your future al - Zarqawi ”
U.S.PSYOP pamphlet disseminated in Iraq .
It shows al - Qaeda terrorist al - Zarqawi caught in a rat trap .
“ Emu och solidariteten ”
Swedish Anti-Euro propaganda for the referendum of 2003 .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures rocketed briefly past $ 88 a barrel Tuesday for the first time as mounting concerns over a possible Turkish attack on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq and tight U.S. crude supplies heading into the winter kept strong upward pressure on energy prices .
The benchmark light , sweet crude contract for November delivery hit an all - time session high of $ 88.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The advance was clipped by traders eager to lock profits , however , ending the day at $ 87.61 a barrel .
Still , that 's up $ 1.48 , or 1.7 % , from Monday , when crude sprinted $ 2.44 to what was a short - lived record close at $ 86.13 .
November crude has soared $ 7.35 a barrel , or nearly 9 % , in just a week .
Behind this latest spike was a mixture of fundamental supply concerns and speculative dollars chasing higher profits .
Threats by Turkey 's government , seeking parliamentary approval to take military action against Kurdish separatists hiding just across the border in northern Iraq , has raised tensions in the Middle East and could have " very grave consequences , " Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told the BBC .
Turkey wants to flush out pockets of the Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK , operating from bases in northern Iraq .
The Ankara government accuses the group of stepping up what it calls terrorist attacks on Turkey in a bid to establish a separate homeland .
For the oil market , a unilateral strike by Turkey against targets in Iraq could again shut down the Ceyhan oil pipeline that runs from the oil fields of Kurdish northern Iraq across southern Turkey to a tanker loading terminal in the Mediterranean .
The pipeline has struggled to resume regular crude shipments , languishing for about four years following the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
This means energy traders are reacting more to the threat of a wider conflict than the loss of actual barrels flowing through Ceyhan .
The tense situation also fueled more speculative buying , with the red - hot commodities sector diverting funds from more sluggish investments .
It also puts crude within easy striking distance of $ 90 a barrel .
See MarketWatch First Take .
While $ 90 oil is nominally an alarming level , economists point out it still falls short of the inflation - adjusted figure of $ 100 a barrel hit back in the early 1980s .
These latest rumors and events have " kept churning the market , " said Charles Perry , chairman of energy - consulting firm Perry Management .
" It appears to me that the real thing driving this market up is the realization that we are in short supply , and it is not getting any better , " he said .
“ ' It appears to me that the real thing driving this market up is the realization that we are in short supply , and it is not getting any better . ' ” — Charles Perry , Perry Management
At the moment , " the world is awash in little news items that impact the market , " said Perry .
" But if we were not already in short supply , the market could stand these minor events . "
The market will get a closer look at U.S. energy supplies on Wednesday , when the Energy Department releases its weekly summary of oil and fuel inventories for the week ended Oct. 12 .
Meanwhile , there was speculation over a potential storm building in the Caribbean and a report that production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was down more than 100,000 barrels per day , Perry said .
In its monthly report released Monday , OPEC added to the supply fears when it predicted non-OPEC countries will produce 110,000 fewer barrels of oil per day than expected in the fourth quarter , even as demand for crude oil will grow by 100,000 barrels a day compared with last year .
See the full report .
OPEC attempted to calm the market Tuesday , blaming the spike in prices unjustified given current supplies .
" While the Organization does not favor oil prices at this level , it strongly believes that fundamentals are not supporting current higher prices and that the market is very well supplied , " OPEC Secretary - General Abdalla Salem El - Badri said in a statement .
Overbought oil ?
Perry said he does n't expect to see $ 90 oil this week , though that level may be reached in two to four weeks .
The path of least resistance for crude seems to be higher still , said Edward Meir at Man Energy .
" Although , like many others out there , we are hard - pressed to justify such high valuations , " he said .
John Person , president of NationalFutures.com , warned that oil prices may be overbought somewhere between $ 85 and $ 87.50 .
" This may have been the threshold high for the time being , " he said in emailed comments .
“ ' Prices are seen as out of control and are in a spot where it can now jeopardize global economic stability . ' ” — John Person , NationalFutures.com
Overall , " prices are seen as out of control and are in a spot where it can now jeopardize global economic stability , " he said .
" China , European and American consumers will become more frustrated , and this can lead to changes in consumption habits , as well as potential releases in SPRs [ strategic petroleum reserves ] by governments to ease prices . "
Crude lifts products
Crude 's record highs fanned a fresh rally for petroleum products as the cost of the raw material bolstered fundamental support for heating oil and gasoline prices , but the rally wavered as the session wore on .
Heating oil for November delivery finished the day up 3.2 cents at $ 2.3387 a gallon .
The November reformulated gasoline contract rose 1.6 cents , or 0.8 % , to $ 2.1737 a gallon , though falling from a contract high of $ 2.2019 .
The Nymex November natural - gas contract fell 7.8 cents to $ 7.367 per million British thermal units , a 1 % drop from the previous session .
Welcome back to Rock , Paper , Shotgun ’s exclusive interview with Team Fortress 2 developers , Robin Walker and Charlie Brown .
( Here ’s Part One if you missed it . )
This time we get down to the finer details of the classes on offer , and talk about their evolution , as well as discussing Valve ’s other great obsession , PopCap ’s Peggle .
But first we talked about the remarkable part humour had to play in TF2 ’s development .
RPS : I want to ask about the role of humour in the game .
You watch the promo movies , and they ’re really hilarious , but you think : how can those possibly carry over into a multiplayer game where there ’s people playing everyone ?
And yet somehow it has .
Robin Walker :
It actually came about the other way .
Charlie Brown :
When we sat down to start work on this , we realised there are a lot of funny moments in multiplayer games .
In Counter - Strike and Day of Defeat , these are realistic games that are n’t intended to be humorous , but you have ragdolls , you have people fighting with non-realistic tactics …
RW : And people !
Put people in a room with guns and tell them to behave , and there ’s no repercussions and there ’s no consequences … [ Laughs ] .
CB : Funny stuff just happens .
So when we started , we knew what kind of weapons we wanted , we knew the physics , we knew we had really fast movements speeds and not all our weapons were realistic , and so it was pretty easy to see during testing that these funny moments happened way more frequently than they did in our other games .
That was one of the reasons we chose this art style in the first place .
We said , let ’s just embrace the exaggerated funny things that happen .
We used that to our advantage .
RW : It led to a lot of ideas that I do n’t think we would have had .
One of my favourites is the gib call - outs , where in the Death Cam , if there are little pieces of you on screen , they ’ll get little labels .
CB : My personal favourite would be the Spy masks .
We never would have done that in something serious .
The humour solved a bunch of problems .
RW : The earliest version of TF2 that you guys never got to play was this ultra-realistic … it looked a lot like Counter - Strike to a large degree .
We wanted to do all these things , but realism fought us every step of the way .
In a realistic game it ’s hard to justify why everything is n’t just a bullet or an explosive , because at the end of the day , that ’s what kills people in the real world .
Almost anything you invent other than that will be worse , not better .
We wanted to build weapons with some travel time to them .
It ’s a worse weapon in a realistic sense , but usage - wise it gives some interesting characteristics .
In a realistic game you ’re constantly asking yourself why someone has that gun .
CB : And we have things that look like guns but are n’t .
RW : Heh , yeah .
This is a gun !
Shoot your friends with it !
CB : And it will make them stronger .
RW : So the point I was trying to make was that we spent some time squirming under this art direction that we ’d chosen too early .
Later , when we started thinking about humour , we had a lot of fun with being free .
We realised we could do that thing that we ’d joked it would be fun to do .
Well guess what ?
Now we can do it .
Let ’s do it !
RPS : Do you have any examples of what those things might have been ?
RW : Well , the gib call - outs was one .
CB : The Spy masks .
The air - walk when the Soldier jumps in the air .
RW : And all of the comments stuff .
The voice system in Half - Life 2 that governs how characters talk – we realised it had a huge amount of freedom .
The underlying system has a lot of power that in some ways really are n’t apparently in Half - Life 2 .
It ’s built for really dynamic places where the state of the world is really unknown .
It ’s a really good system for determining what ’s the best option .
There might be ten different options for saying , “ I ’m reloading ” , for all different circumstances .
The system ’s really good at saying , this is the one that ’s most appropriate right now .
And so when we started thinking about the facial animation and applying that to multiplayer , that got us really excited because that ’s exactly what multiplayer space is .
A really dynamic place .
So the system can choose , here ’s a really good line for you to say after you ’ve killed that guy .
Because he ’s the sixth guy you ’ve killed in the last thirty seconds , and you ’re dominating him , and you ’re a Heavy , and he ’s a Scout , so it ’s time to yell , X .
So we ’re able to fill the game will all these fun phrases .
To a level where even today as we play , every now and then we hear a line we ’ve never heard , after months .
CB : It ’s also incredibly useful .
We ’ve had a few play - testers who were n’t really aware of the game , and the Engineers building up his …
RW : “ Building a teleporter ! ”
CB : And we ’ve got this person going …
RW : “ Hey , it ’s a teleporter . ”
CB : And they figured out what teleporters were at that point .
RW : And the Spy mask thing .
The Spy mask is one of the best examples to back all the way up to what we were talking about earlier with acceptability .
One of the things we ’ve learned over the years is we ’ve grown a healthy hatred of outside - the - game solutions to problems that are really about art direction , or about …
CB : Presentation .
RW : So we have a problem .
I want to show you what class your Spy on your team is .
And we want him to look like a Spy , because we know through play - testing that he ’s got to look like a friendly spy all the time or it ’s incredibly confusing to new players .
So the first thing we think of is , put a radical above the dude ’s head that ’s an image of the Scout or something .
And we hate that because the more you fill the game with those sorts of things , the more people look at them and not the characters .
Everything that ’s most important in the world should be the characters .
So you should n’t check someone ’s team by looking at a radical above their head .
You should look at the character and that should tell you .
We felt that if we kept to that you ’d be looking at the world first , and your HUD second .
So just as a test we put the radical over the Spy ’s head , which we all hated but we did n’t have a better idea at the time .
And right off the bat , play - testers had trouble with it .
If you ’re a new player and you see a Scout above the head of a guy , it does n’t tell you what it is .
It just says , that guy ’s got a floaty Scout above his head .
We said , we ca n’t do this , whatever we do it has to be on the character .
Within a day or two we came up with the Spy masks .
Internally we keep looking back on that moment as one of those eureka moments that validates , a ) when we push ourselves to not take the easy route we often get better solutions , and b ) that wholehearted consistency to keeping information on the character is making us stay honest .
And it works really well .
We get new players who do n’t even know what the Spy can do , and they look at that character and he ’s wearing that paper mask , and they think , “ Well , I guess he ’s like disguised as that guy . ”
RPS : So , do you guys have favourite characters ?
RW : I think most of us here play three or four classes each .
CB : I could say that I ’m not very good at the Scout , and I ’m not as good as the Spy as I ’d like to be .
RW : I ’m probably best between the Scout and the Soldier .
I have a penchant for playing anything that trades speed for fire power .
One of the things that we ’re happiest about is that TF is more about versatility .
It ’s been really fun watching the online communities go through a micro version of the passage we ’ve all gone through here .
It ’s like , “ Oh , they ’re all at the Heavy / Medic phase !
They ’re soon going to get to the , Holy crap , Snipers kick the crap out of that phase ! ”
They ’re saying , “ This is too powerful , ” and we ’re thinking , “ Well next week you ’re going to find that this destroys that . ”
It ’s really fun to see .
CB : But it ’s still an effective combo .
There ’s no complete counter for it .
RPS : Any less favourite characters ?
RW : I do n’t play a lot of Demoman , but I get destroyed by it a lot .
There ’s some really good Demoman players in this company .
CB : Mine ’s the Heavy .
Not for any lack of power , I just like to move quickly .
RW : I like the Heavy a lot .
If only for his singing taunts .
[ He starts loudly singing ]
Dun dun dun daahh dun !
CB : Usually I play the Medic or the Engineer , because personality - wise I tend toward the support characters , but on my more aggressive days I really do like the Pyro or the Soldier .
RW : So much of the class interactions are a result of the best choices on your server .
If you ’re a hopeless optimiser like I am , then as the numbers of the Heavies and Medics increases , the value of Snipers increases , so I ’ll often switches classes after about five minutes once I ’ve seen what the enemy make - up is , or I can see what they ’re trying to do .
That ’s why it ’s been really fun going out on public servers with an over - abundance of Spies these days .
Internally we all have a fairly effective Spy radar in our heads , so you get to have a lot of fun .
I ’ve had friends message me with Steam Community and say , “ There ’s this Spy that ’s causing us a lot of trouble . ”
So I ’ll go in the game and dominate the Spy pretty easily , because at this point most of the Spies are still using pretty simple tactics .
They have n’t been forced to learn the harder tactics the Spy uses , and as people get more and more experienced dealing with Spies , they ’re going to be forced to do that .
Right now the population of Spies is such that you can have a blast just running out there as a Pyro .
That back and forth is an interesting one , and I do n’t think it ever stops .
There ’s always going to be a flavour of the month .
And that ’s always a response to what the flavour of the last month was .
RPS : Would you agree with my theory that people who play the Medic have a Messianic complex ?
CB : [ Laughs ]
Are you telling me or asking me ?
RW : It was very interesting to see how much more people liked the Medic after we put in some of the automatic responses .
So when you charge any class to a large amount , they automatically thank the Medic , and that immediately meant people playing the Medic were happier .
I ’m sure most of them know it ’s automatic , and you can thank them anyway , but just being told by the game , “ you ’re doing good ” , works .
If you asked us some of the things we ’re proudest of in the game , Medic would be high up there .
We always wanted to build a support class where when you chose him you did n’t feel like you were having to step down in any way , that you were making a secondary choice , that you were somehow giving up a part of your own success to be that person .
And similarly , you were n’t relegating your gameplay to some non-fun thing , where you get to stand behind the combat around the corner , and never come around .
We wanted to build a Medic where there was a lot of skill to it , where there was a big difference from beginner Medics and experienced Medics , and that the best Medics were the ones who were in combat , able to stay alive under a huge amount of fire – the ones who were game winners .
The simple mantra is , if there ’s a Medic there he needs to have as big an impact on the game as if he were a Soldier or a Heavy .
One of the moments when we thought we were on the right track was when we had a couple of our guys who were some of our best FPS hardcore players , transition to playing Medic almost exclusively .
RPS : Presumably the Medic ’s needle gun would be another of those things that would n’t have been possible without the humour ?
CB : The needle gun is … a bit different .
RW : We still have n’t got it so the needles stick in the body , and we really want to recreate that Indiana Jones pin-cushion guy .
So you come around the corner and there ’s a corpse with a hundred needles in his back .
They stick in the world right now , but not other people .
RPS : Tell me about Peggle .
CB : It ’s awesome ?
RW : We play a lot of Peggle ?
I think the funniest thing was when we shipped the Steam Community beta , and we ’d made the Valve group , I went to the group and I saw , top most played game , 170 hours of Peggle in the last week .
And I thought , wow , what a bunch of hardcore gamers we are !
CB : Every time someone will go to compile , Peggle ’s there .
So you ’re sitting there coding , and with Steam Community on , while you ’re working you ’ll see , “ Blah blah playing Peggle , ” and , “ Blah blah playing Peggle , ” …
RPS : And this led to the Valve Peggle ?
RW : Yeah , Eric ’s local , so that was cool .
We could have those guys come around and work on the site for a while , and have some of our artists help .
That was a classic example of [ he chuckles ] , there ’s no real strategic business decisions going on .
We want more Peggle !
You can GIVE us more Peggle !
Put that in the box , how does that sound ?
RPS : Did you have any inkling of this when PopCap went onto Steam ?
CB : Well , we all started by playing Insaniquarium .
RW : And we ’ve got at least one guy who claimed to be the world ’s best Bookworm player .
Just very matter - of - fact .
He can tell you the top - scoring words he ’s ever done .
I guess there ’s some fixed order in which the original Bookworm dropped its letters , and he knows the exact order of every letter that ’s going to arrive , so he can start planning his moves .
He took it to the ridiculous level .
So we were all really excited about Bookworm Adventures .
RPS : I love Bookworm Adventures .
I prefer it to Peggle .
RW : Well …
Well , I think you ’re insane .
CB : I ’m going to walk out the interview now .
RW : My wife likes Bookworm Adventures .
But she does n’t like Peggle , for some reason .
So that ’s why we had to get divorced … [ laughs ] .
I ’m a dead man .
A huge thanks to Robin and Charlie for the time they gave us , and the depth they were willing to go into .
In Robin ’s defense , he ’s still married to his Bookworm - loving wife , and hopes to stay that way , despite our printing his comments .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
When people began dumping used tires in the ocean 40 years ago to create artificial reefs , they gave little thought to the potential environmental cost , or to how difficult it would be to pick them up .
A U.S. Navy Diver attached to Mobile Diving Salvage Unit ( MDSU ) 2 Det. 6 prepares a lift bag to salvage tires off the coast of Fort Lauderdale , Florida , June 4 , 2007 .
MDSU 2 is conducting salvage operations in conjunction with U.S. Army Deep Sea Divers , and U.S. Coast Guard divers through the Innovative Readiness Training program .
The goal of the salvage mission is to retrieve approximately 2 million tires .
The tires were placed on the ocean floor in the 1970s to act as an artificial reef .
However , coral would not stick to the rubber and the tires now present an environmental hazard .
Salvage operations will continue for the next month then resume next year .
REUTERS / Jack Georges / U.S. Navy photo / Handout
“ It was one of those ideas that seemed good at the time , ” said Jack Sobel , a senior scientist at The Ocean Conservancy , a Washington - based environmental group .
“ Now I think it ’s pretty clear it was a bad idea . ”
Now , local authorities are going after some 700,000 tires dumped off the coast of Fort Lauderdale , up the coast from Miami .
A team of 40 divers from the U.S. Army , Navy and Coast Guard spent three weeks in June pulling up 10,373 sand - filled and slime - coated tires from the ocean floor .
Using the tire project as a salvage exercise , the military divers learned they could strap together 50 to 70 tires with wire cables and lift them to the surface with inflatable air bags , where a crane hauled the bundle from the water .
Millions of tires , usually bundled with nylon straps or steel cables , were cast into the sea off Australia , New Zealand , Malaysia and off the U.S. states of New York , New Jersey , North Carolina , California and Florida .
The idea was to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land , but in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean , nylon straps wore out and snapped , cables rusted , and tires broke free .
Thousands have been tossed up on U.S. shores , particularly during hurricanes .
Tires dotted the sand as far as the eye could see along North Carolina ’s Topsail Island after Hurricane Fran crashed the coast in 1996 .
The tires dumped off Fort Lauderdale posed a particular threat .
When they broke free they migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract , climbing up its slope and killing everything in their path .
“ If we can keep the project going we think they can get all the tires and then the reef can recover , ” said Ken Banks of Broward County ’s Environmental Protection Department .
“ But the reef recovery will probably take decades . ”
AIRCRAFT CARRIER
Officials said the Fort Lauderdale project drew together a host of government and military agencies to salvage the tires cheaply .
“ If you have to pay to make them go away , it would have cost about $ 17 per tire .
We got that down to about $ 2 per tire , in part because they are making other products out of them , ” said William Nuckols , a project coordinator for Coastal America , a U.S. government agency .
The tires were trucked to a disposal plant in Georgia , where they were chipped into fuel for a waste recycling plant .
U.S. states no longer permit tire reefs .
But Sobel said the entire concept of artificial reefs needs to be reexamined .
They have been created around the globe using all manner of material , from tires and concrete sewer pipes to discarded airplanes and ships .
One of the largest , the rusting 880 - foot ( 270 - metre ) U.S. aircraft carrier Oriskany , was sent to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico last year .
They are promoted by local officials as tourist attractions and by fishing captains and scuba operators who say they create new habitats and nurseries for fish and other sea creatures .
But Sobel said there are big questions that need to be answered .
Do they damage natural habitats , as the tires did off Fort Lauderdale ?
Do they concentrate marine creatures and make it easier for fishers and divers to catch them , exacerbating an overfishing problem and causing lasting damage to fisheries ?
Do they draw eggs and larvae that would otherwise settle in natural habitats ?
“ There ’s little evidence that artificial reefs have a net benefit , ” Sobel said .
Linda Calbi was originally charged with murder , but the charges were later downgraded to aggravated assault , based on expert reports that medical error contributed significantly to the boy 's death .
She was sentenced last year to three years in prison and wo n't be eligible for parole until November 2008 .
The Calbis were divorced in 2001 after 15 years of marriage .
A few months after Matt 's death , Chris Calbi fell behind his alimony payments and filed papers in court seeking a reduction or termination of his payment obligations .
" She took the life of her oldest son , scarred her younger son for the rest of his life , and tore the fabric of my soul from me , " Chris Calbi wrote in papers filed in Superior Court in Hackensack .
" To reward this evil and violent woman by allowing her ... to derive a financial benefit from the family she destroyed ... can only be described as a perversion of our justice system . "
A judge ordered him to continue making payments , then later interrupted alimony for the period that Linda Calbi is incarcerated .
But Chris Calbi's arrears had risen to more $ 40,000 by then , and the judge ordered him to pay $ 400 a month to his ex-wife 's prison account .
This court case of a mother who killed her 14 - year - old son is troubling ( Hat Tip : reader_iam ) : I would have to agree with the father 's analysis ; to be forced to pay this killer ( the beating she gave her son caused internal injuries ) alimony is truly a perversion of our justice system .
No one who kills their child should be rewarded with monetary support from a spouse .
More and more , it seems our society rewards horrible acts with money , prestige and sympathy .
There has to be a line drawn somewhere .
The law should be changed .

The Smalltalk Question
One of the minor puzzles of American life is what question to ask people at parties and suchly to get to know them .
“ How ya doin ’ ? ” is of course mere formality , only the most troubled would answer honestly for anything but the positive .
“ What do you do ? ” is somewhat offensive .
First , it really means “ what occupation do you hold ? ” and thus implies you do little outside your occupation .
Second , it implies that one ’s occupation is the most salient fact about them .
Third , it rarely leads to further useful inquiry .
For only a handful of occupations , you will be able to say something somewhat relevant , but even this will no doubt be slightly annoying or offensive .
( “ Oh yeah , I always thought about studying history . ” )
“ Where are you from ? ” is even less fruitful .
“ What ’s your major ? ” ( in the case of college students ) turns sour when , as is tragically all too often the case , students feel no real passion for their major .
“ What book have you read recently ? ” will cause the majority of Americans who do n’t read to flail , while at best only getting an off - the - cuff garbled summary of a random book .
“ What ’s something cool you ’ve learned recently ? ” puts the person on the spot and inevitably leads to hemming and hawing and then something not all that cool .
I propose instead that one ask “ What have you been thinking about lately ? ”
First , the question is extremely open - ended .
The answer could be a book , a movie , a relationship , a class , a job , a hobby , etc .
Even better , it will be whichever of these is most interesting at the moment .
Second , it sends the message that thinking , and thinking about thinking , is a fundamental human activity , and thus encourages it .
Third , it ’s easiest to answer , since by its nature its asking about what ’s already on the person ’s mind .
Fourth , it ’s likely to lead to productive dialog , as you can discuss the topic together and hopefully make progress .
Fifth , the answer is quite likely to be novel .
Unlike books and occupations , people ’s thoughts seem to be endlessly varied .
Sixth , it helps capture a person ’s essence .
A job can be forced by circumstance and parentage , but our thoughts are all our own .
I can think of little better way to quickly gauge what a person is really like .
“ What have you been working on lately ? ” can be seen , in this context , to be clearly inferior , although similar .
So , what have you been thinking about lately ?
You should follow me on twitter here .

Open Letter to Fox News :
Thursday , September 06 , 2007
Last night during the debate Fox News and Sean Hannity displayed an extreme amount of discourtesy and disrespect to not only the Republican Presidential candidates but also the American people .
There was a very clear bias towards several individuals on stage .
Sen. Brownback and Congressman Ron Paul received very little air time in comparison to the other candidates on stage .
Rudy Giuliani was allowed much more talk time as well as additional talk time after the bell than any other candidate on stage .
The moderator would ask all the candidates their opinion on issues , i.e. , taxes or Gitmo and ignore only Ron Paul ’s completely different opinion on those matters .
Finally , when the moderator would get around to asking Dr. Paul a question it was a unique one - sided question engineered to make Dr. Paul foolish .
Furthermore , when the moderator would ask a question of Dr. Paul it seemed as though Rudy Giuliani ’s microphone was turned up so he could be heard snickering at the question .
What type of Presidential candidate is that inconsiderate as to laugh at questions directed towards another candidate ?
The attempted manipulation portrayed from the debates continued on throughout the ‘ Hannity and Combs ’ broadcast as well .
First , when the results for the cell phone text messaging poll were announced live on the air , Hannity could be heard screaming out “ Oh you ’ve got to be kidding me , this is driving me crazy ” then , he resorted to the claim that Ron Paul supporters were calling multiple times .
What type of journalism is this ?
I do n’t appreciate this host criticizing a very American belief that we are fighting an endless , pointless war and we need to come home .
Apparently over 33 % of the viewers from last night felt the same way .
Why is this so hard to believe and / or understand ?
Furthermore , the phone system would n’t allow multiple votes from the same telephone number .
Hannity ’s claim of multiple callers was a lie and he should make a public apology for disrespecting 1/3 of last night ’s viewers .
But the disrespect did n’t stop with that comment .
‘ Hannity and Combs ’ invited all of the candidates as guests after the debate .
Each guest on stage was treated with respect and dignity .
They were posed questions and allowed to answer questions .
Dr. Paul however was chastised and confronted with a very confrontational host when he appeared on stage .
Dr. Paul was not even allowed to answer 1 question without being hammered by Sean Hannity .
Fox News actually had to cut away from Hannity to allow the interview to continue with a more reserved and more professional Combs , but that did n’t stop Sean Hannity from bursting in with “ Oh I just have to ask this question ….. ” as he continues to argue with Dr. Paul .
Fox News had no other option but to cut to commercial after only a very short time .
The attempt by this organization and individuals to sway the election in their favor is unethical and should be construed as nothing less than attempted voter manipulation .
Fox News appears on tens of millions of homes across the nation and they should not be allowed to continue this very ‘ unfair and unbalanced ’ manipulation of the United States Presidential election .
Ron Paul won the poll last night by a land slide .
And , when asked by the host of the guests in the New Hampshire restaurant how many patrons were disappointed with Giuliani ’s performance , most if not all raised their hands .
Where is any of this newsworthy information on the FoxNews.com website ?
It ’s no where to be found .
The current image is an edited picture to show McCain , Romney , Giuliani and Fred Thompson who was n’t even a part of last nights debates .
Why does Fox News feel as though they can dictate the next American president to the American people ?
So based on the previous biased towards certain candidates , I now call on Fox News to end their blatant favoritism towards Rudy Giuliani .
It is clear that the American people are not interested in an individual with poor family values , strange personal dressing habits , dead - beat dad attitude and poor leadership qualities in a leadership position at our Nations top Office .
I also call on Fox News to live up to their claim of ‘ Fair and Balanced ’ and provide an equal amount of air time towards Dr. Paul and the other non main stream media candidates .
It ’s not up to Fox News to decide the Presidential candidates ; it ’s up to the American people .
Finally , I call on Fox News to end their relationship with Sean Hannity .
This individual is a horrible example of unbiased reporting and it is very obvious that he is unable to control his own emotional opinion when he sits before a guest with whom he may not agree .
There is absolutely no excuse for a host of a show to disrespect an instant text poll , or disrespect a Presidential hopeful as was done during the New Hampshire debate .
Last night was a horrible demonstration of blatant attempted manipulation and I call on Fox News to end this sort of behavior immediately .
I encourage all Fox News employees to vote in this upcoming election , but not use your widely broadcast news organization to try and sway uninformed Americans towards another candidate who will be just as unpopular as the current President .
It ’s not your election to choose , Fox News .
“ You Choose 2008 ” is directed towards the American people , not the Fox Network .
Giuliani laughs at questions directed at Dr. Paul .
Laughter starts with 5:25 & 3:10 left and again with 1:23 remaining :
It is not possible to vote more than once
Hannity argues with Presidential hopeful
How the crowd really sounded when Ron Paul walked on stage .

AOL has settled with 48 states and the District of Columbia over an investigation stemming from its previous cancellation policies in which some customers were unable to close their AOL accounts , or found themselves being billed for services after thinking they had canceled .
AOL will pay $ 3 million and has agreed to continue maintaining its online cancelation feature that went live last August ; previously , customers had to call in to cancel , and AOL employees were encouraged to convince them otherwise .
The company admitted no wrong - doing as part of the settlement .
California led the multi-state investigation , which would have led to a lawsuit had AOL not agreed to settle .
New York and Florida were the only states not to participate in the action .
In 2005 , AOL paid $ 1.3 million to settle a similar complaint in New York .

But AOL customers wo n't see any of the settlement money ; the $ 3 million will be split among the 48 states and District of Columbia to cover the cost of the inquiry and other consumer protection efforts .
AOL will , however , refund any customers that it charged after they attempted to cancel their accounts .
For its part , AOL says it already revamped its cancellation policies in 2005 and 2006 after a deluge of high profile complaints .
In one case , a customer recorded an AOL representative who simply refused to cancel his account .
Employees were reportedly paid bonuses up to $ 3,000 if they convinced a customer to keep the AOL service .

Since August 2007 , US and European banks have constantly made headline news concerning the deep crisis they are going through and its knock - on effect on the neoliberal economic system as a whole .
Asset depreciation for these banks currently stands at over 200 billion dollars .
Several banking research services and seasoned economists estimate that the final damage will exceed 1,000 billion dollars .
How did the banks manage to build such an irrational lending system ?
Eager for profit , mortgage companies made loans to a sector of the population that was already heavily indebted .
The conditions attached to these mortgages–highly profitable for the lender–amounted to daylight robbery for the borrower : the interest rate was fixed and reasonable for the first two years but thereafter rose sharply .
Lenders assured borrowers that the property they were buying would quickly appreciate thanks to the boom in the real estate sector .
The problem was that the real estate bubble burst in 2007 and house prices started to go steadily down .
The number of defaults on payment soared and mortgage brokers had trouble repaying their own loans .
To protect themselves , the big banks either refused extra credit to the mortgage lenders or agreed to new loans at far higher interest rates .
But the spiral did not stop there , since the big banks had bought up a large number of the original loans as off - balance sheet operations by creating specific companies called Structured Investment Vehicles ( SIV ) , which finance the purchase of high yield mortgages converted into bonds ( CDOs , or Collateralised Debt Obligations ) .
As from August 2007 , investors stopped buying the unguaranteed commercial papers issued by SIVs , which no longer looked like a safe or credible option .
Consequently , the SIVs lacked the liquidity needed to buy up mortgages and the crisis worsened .
The big banks who had created the SIVs therefore had to bail them out to stop them going bankrupt .
Up to then , SIV operations had not appeared in the banks ’ accounts ( thus allowing them to conceal the risks involved ) , but now the SIV debts had to come out of the closet and onto the books .
The result was general panic .
In the US , 84 mortgage companies either went bankrupt or partially stopped doing business between 1 January and 17 August 2007 , as opposed to only 17 similar cases for the whole of 2006 .
In Germany , the IKB BANK and SachsenLB were saved by the skin of their teeth .
Recently , in England , the bankrupt Northern Rock has had to be nationalised .
On 13 March 2008 , the Carlyle Capital Corporation ( CCC ) fund , known to be close to the Bush clan , collapsed with debts 32 times its capital .
The following day , the prestigious US bank Bear Stearns ( 5th US investment bank ) called on the US Federal Reserve to provide an emergency credit line .
Bear Stearns is being snapped up by JPMorgan Chase for a mere pittance .
Several branches of the lending market are shaky constructions on the point of collapse .
They drag into their misadventures the powerful banks , hedge funds or investment funds through which they were created .
The salvage of these private financial institutions requires massive intervention on the part of the public authorities .
And thus once again , profits accrue to the private sector , and losses to the public purse .
Which brings us to a key question : how is it that banks can readily waive bad debts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars yet have constantly refused to cancel the debts of developing countries ?
Why should the one be feasible and the other impossible ?
It should be remembered that the debts claimed today from these countries go back in the past to criminal dictatorships , corrupt regimes and leaders pandering to major powers and investors .
The big banks lavished loans on such notorious regimes as that of Mobutu in Zaire , Suharto in Indonesia , the Latin - American dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s , not to mention the apartheid regime in South Africa .
How can the banks persist in inflicting the burden of debt on people who have suffered the consequences of despotic regimes funded by the banks themselves ?
From a legal standpoint , many of the debts appearing in their accounts are odious and as such should not be repaid .
But the banks continue to demand their pound of flesh .
We should also remember that the Third World debt crisis was caused by the drastic unilateral hike in interest rates imposed by the Fed in 1982 .
Up to then the private banks had been happily handing out variable rate loans to countries that were already over - indebted .
The crash came when these countries could no longer sustain repayments .
Today history is repeating itself , this time in the North : overindebted households in the US are faced with mortgages that they can never repay as they watch the value of their properties plummet .
The recent waiving of debts by banks can only justify the claims of those who , like the CADTM , demand the cancellation of Third World debt .
Why ?
Because the long - term debt of Third World public authorities towards international banks reached 181.9 billion dollars in 2006 .
Since August 2007 , the banks have had to cancel a far greater amount , with more still to come .
It is clear that the big private banks have failed in three ways :
* they have built up catastrophic private lending structures that have led to the present disaster ; * they have lent to despotic regimes and forced the democratic governments that replaced them to repay this odious debt down to the last cent ; * they refuse to cancel the debts of developing countries , for whom repayment means ever - worsening living conditions for their people .
For all these reasons , the banks must be held to account for their actions over the last decades .
The governments of the countries of the South must make a full audit of their debts , as Ecuador is doing today , and repudiate all debts that are odious and illegitimate .
The bankers have shown them that such a step is perfectly feasible .
It would also be the first step towards restoring the true role of finance , which is to be of service to men and women .
Everywhere , without exception .

“ THE world 's most vulnerable who spend 60 % of their income on food have been priced out of the food market , ” is the alarming warning from Josette Sheeran , head of the United Nations ' World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
As the price of wheat , maize , corn and other commodities that make up the world 's basic foodstuffs is soaring the poorest people in the poorest countries are the hardest hit .
And as prices shoot up helping them is getting tougher too .
The WFP's food costs increased by more than 50 % over the past five years .
Ms Sheeran predicts that they will increase by another 35 % in the next couple of years too .
For many years the least developed nations have worried about food security , especially countries at war and those battling droughts and other climatic hardships .
Meanwhile the world 's richest nations have produced more than enough for their needs and spent more time and effort worrying about the problems related to an abundance of food .
These range from the health risks associated with ballooning rates of obesity to subsidies for uncompetitive farmers , particularly from the European Union .
Despite efforts to tackle spending on farm subsidies , over 40 % of the entire EU budget still goes towards supporting agriculture .
“ Until two years ago we had too much food , but it was badly and unequally distributed , ” says Abdolreza Abbassian , secretary of the intergovernmental group for grains trade at the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , a UN agency .
Today about 850 m people , mostly women and children , remain chronically hungry while 1.1 billion are obese or overweight .
Food is scarcer now thanks to market liberalisation , which helped to cut excess production and lower stocks .
At the same time demand for grains and other food commodities has shot up in China , India and other countries with rapidly growing economies .
The biofuel industry is gobbling up an increasing share of the corn and sugar crops .
And this year floods and droughts around the world destroyed much of the harvest in countries such as Britain , which had one of the wettest years in recent history , and Australia , which had one of the driest .
Concern about the cost of food is even spreading beyond the world 's poor countries .
Last month Italians took to the street in Rome and Milan to protest against an increase in pasta prices .
They are eating less too : Italians ' pasta and bread consumption dropped 7.4 % and milk consumption fell by 2.6 % in the first eight months of the year according to Coldiretti , a farmers ' association .
Efforts to find solutions have been complicated by political manipulation .
This month the Russian government introduced price controls in the run-up to parliamentary elections in December .
This will temporarily help the country 's poor but leave them more exposed to the impact of price increases after controls are lifted .
Jacques Diouf , head of the FAO , predicts that more countries will introduce food - price controls while others will scrap import tariffs on food or increase subsidies for food production .
And efforts to alleviate one problem , finding an alternative to oil , has brought strong condemnation from a proponent of another , feeding the world 's starving poor .
Jean Ziegler , the UN 's independent expert on the right to food , calls the growing use of crops to replace petrol as a crime against humanity and wants a five - year moratorium on biofuel production .
Periods of high prices followed by times of low prices are common in agricultural markets .
What makes the current cycle different from previous periods of high prices is the rise has hit nearly all food commodities .
In the past farmers producing a plentiful crop attracting low prices would switch to one in shorter supply that would earn them more .
And stocks are so tight at the moment that there is not much of a buffer if bad weather next year effects crops again , according to the FAO 's Mr Abassian .
Prices will probably remain high for the next year or two while the world is adapting to food scarcity .
What happens next will reveal the resilience of the world 's food - supply system , predicts Ms Sheeran .
Her programme , she says , is battling with a host of adverse circumstances .
In addition to higher prices for food the WFP has to cope with climatic change , a rapidly increasing world population and the decline in the rich world 's aid budgets .
Ms Sheeran refers to this as the post food - surplus era .
The fat probably wo n't get any thinner but the effects on the world 's poorest and hungriest could be devastating .
Their analysis was unique , Dr. Christakis said , because it moved beyond a simple analysis of one person and his or her social contacts , and instead examined an entire social network at once , looking at how a person ’s friend ’s friend ’s friends , or spouse ’s sibling ’s friends , could have an influence on a person ’s weight .
The effects , Dr. Christakis said , “ highlight the importance of a spreading process , a kind of social contagion , that spreads through the network . ”
Of course , the investigators say , social networks are not the only factors that affect body weight .
There is a strong genetic component at work as well .
Science has shown that individuals have genetically determined ranges of weights , spanning perhaps 30 or so pounds for each person .
But that leaves a large role for the environment in determining whether a person ’s weight is near the top of his or her range or near the bottom .
As people have gotten fatter , it appears that many are edging toward the top of their ranges .
The question has been why .
If the new research is correct , it may mean that something in the environment seeded what many call an obesity epidemic , leading a few people to gain weight .
Then social networks let the obesity spread rapidly .
It also may mean that the way to avoid becoming fat is to avoid having fat friends .
That is not the message they meant to convey , say the study investigators , Dr. Christakis and his colleague , James Fowler , an associate professor of political science at the University of California in San Diego .
You do n’t want to lose a friend who becomes obese , Dr. Christakis said .
Friends are good for your overall health , he explains .
So why not make friends with a thin person , he suggests , and let the thin person ’s behavior influence you and your obese friend ?

Bush is set to release a regulation tomorrow that will allow mining companies to blast the tops off mountains and dump the resulting waste in nearby streams and valleys .
Currently the practice , called mountaintop mining , exists in a hazy legal status but has been used regularly for the past two decades .
The new rule will loosen a 1983 law which prohibits disturbing soils within 100 feet of streams ( in the past , companies have been sued under the Clean Water Act for dumping mining waste into streams ) , essentially giving coal companies the go - ahead .
As we reported last year , the Appalachian mountains ( where the majority of mountaintop removal mining takes place ) have been so degraded that the public can take tours of the mind - boggling environmental damage .
But mining companies and their coal mining advocates think they are providing a great service .
Proponents claim that coal reduces our reliance on foreign oil and mountaintop removal provides more flat land for big box stores like Wal - Mart .
Woo -hoo !
GOD does not play dice , or so said Einstein .
But might he knit ?
If so , physicists seeking to explain the fundamental nature of the universe think they may have spotted a point at which a stitch became tangled , creating a flaw in the fabric of reality .
The universe was born in the Big Bang some 14 billion years ago .
The first snapshots of the infant universe , showing it aged a mere 300,000 years , before the first stars coalesced , are taken in the light ( or , rather , the microwaves ) from that explosion .
The cosmic microwave background , as it is known , reveals the early universe to have been a remarkably uniform fireball .
Today 's universe looks very different .
It is lumpy , with clusters of galaxies scattered through it .
Physicists have therefore spent years examining the baby pictures in the hope of discerning telltales of how the change happened .
What they have found are subtle variations in the cosmic microwave background , including a large spot that is distinctly colder than the rest .
Over the past year , several ideas as to what caused this spot have been proposed and then quashed .
The latest suggestion , made by Neil Turok of the University of Cambridge , in England , and his colleagues , and published this week in Science , is that the spot is a blemish which formed as reality crystallised , rather as ice cubes contain irregularities and air bubbles .
At the precise moment the universe began , its constituents — which today appear as fundamental forces such as gravity and electromagnetism , and subatomic particles such as electrons and quarks — were unified into a single substance in the extreme heat of the explosion .
As the universe expanded , though , it cooled .
And as it did so , it went through phase changes , just as steam condenses to liquid water that then forms ice as the temperature falls .
At each point at which the phase of the universe changed , one of the forces of nature became distinct , or a type of matter emerged as being different from the others .
Only when this process was complete did the familiar pattern that makes up the laws of physics properly emerge .
One theory , devised several years ago , has it that each of these phase transitions is marked by the formation of defects .
Such imperfections are analogous to the misalignments between ice crystals that often form when water freezes .
These can be seen both in ice cubes and on frost - covered windowpanes in the places where growing crystals have met .
Cosmic - defect theory , as it is known , holds that a similar process would have happened as the newborn universe cooled .
One type of defect proposed by Dr Turok is called a “ texture ” — a knot of energy that could be anything between a few millimetres and many light years across .
Like other cosmic defects , once formed , textures would unravel at the speed of light .
They would , however , leave behind a trace of their existence .
That is because the process of unwinding concentrates mass into a rapidly shrinking region , creating a gravitational field that attracts nearby matter .
This , in turn , would lower the frequency of microwaves ( or any other form of electromagnetic radiation ) in the region by a process called gravitational red-shifting .
A lower frequency corresponds to a lower temperature , so these spots would appear cold .
Of course , the explanation for the cold spot could be something else entirely .
The team are being careful not to claim they are certain they have seen a cosmic defect .
Indeed , they propose further tests that might show them to be wrong .
If the cold spot is merely a random fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background , for example , that could be revealed by examining the polarisation of the microwaves coming from it .
But , having conducted a statistical analysis of the microwave background , the team reckon that it is most likely that the cold spot is , indeed , caused by a defect .
If they are correct , it would be a boon not only for cosmologists but also for particle physicists .
Spots such as this ( if more can be found ) would give them a way to study how fundamental forces and particles formed that is far beyond the capabilities of the puny ( but very expensive ) machines they use on Earth .
And , based on Dr Turok 's results , the pattern they eventually discover might look surprisingly like “ knit one , purl one ” .

Jeremy Scahill is the author of Blackwater : The Rise Of The World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army and is now a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at the Nation Institute .
He has shared the Polk award for investigative journalism .
And last night Bill Moyers devoted 45 minutes to a conversation with Scahill .
If you did not see the show ( shame on you ) you can read the transcript .
Perhaps my own outrage is almost exhausted at this point .
I see an abandonment of any commitment to a liberal democracy , and I am no longer sure why anyone acts surprised at the latest outrages .
If Mukasey is confirmed after what he said on Thursday , then what is the point of fighting for Democratic control of a Congress which will not stand up for the Constitution ?
Watching Moyers and Scahill last night was a weird experience .
There was not that much that was new to me , but there was some .
I found myself cycling rapidly among the emotions of outrage , anger , and despair .
Let me offer a few quotes from Jeremy Scahill that contributed to that cycle of emotions :
in Iraq , you ’re talking about an occupation of a country .
And without these private sector forces , without companies like as Blackwater , Triple Canopy and Dyncorp , the occupation would n’t be tenable .
So if we do not have sufficient military forces , under the rules of the UCMJ , it is okay to use mercenaries to accomplish a goal with which the American people do not agree ?
There are over 170 mercenary companies like Blackwater operating in Iraq right now .
That ’s almost as many nations as are registered at the UN .
And I think this is n’t just about Iraq .
It ’s also looting the US treasury .
I think we ’re in the midst of the most radical privatization agenda in our nation ’s history .
We of course see it in schools .
We see it in the health care system , in prisons .
And now , we ’re seeing it full blown in the war machine .
What I ultimately see as the real threat here is that the system of the very existence of the nation state I think is at stake here .
Because you have companies now that have been funded with billions of dollars in public money using that money to then build up the infrastructure of private armies some of which could take out a small national military .
And the old model used to be if a company wants to go into Nigeria for instance and exploit oil , they have to work with the juntas forces in order to do that .
Now , you can just bring in your own private military force .
The very existence of the nation state may be at stake .
And yet did Congress come prepared for the hearing ?
Read the following exchange between Scahill and Moyers , and note what I bold besides their names :
JEREMY SCAHILL : I think that Blackwater has made a-- a very serious strategic error in how they 've handled their publicity for years .
And now , we 're seeing the company go on the offensive .
I think Erik Prince held his own in front of the Congress .
And I -- and I attribute it largely to the fact that it appeared as though the Democrats did n't really do their homework on him .
I mean , here you have the man who owns the company providing the largest private army on the US government payroll in Iraq .
A billion dollars in contracts .
Twenty - seven of his men killed in Iraq .
We do n't know how many people he killed .
No private actor in the occupation of Iraq has had more of a devastating impact on events in Iraq than Blackwater .
And I just felt watching that hearing -- and I went down for it -- that many of the Democrats had n't done their homework .
BILL MOYERS : Well , they -- well , they were reading the report at the time that he was testifying , right ?
JEREMY SCAHILL : Right .
And you see them flipping through the pages .
And it appeared as though a lot of the members were just sort of paging through it while Erik Prince was testifying .
And consider the next two quotes from Scahill that I will offer :
I think it 's really scary .
I mean , I think that the U.S. government right now is in the midst of its most radical privatization agenda .
Seventy percent of the national intelligence budget is farmed out to the private sector .
We have more contractors than soldiers occupying Iraq .
I think that what this does is it takes -- it sanitizes it also for the American people .
There 's not a draft .
There 's been , you know , almost 4,000 U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq ; we do n't know how many private contractors .
But that 's a relatively small number compared to Vietnam , for instance , where we talked about 65,000 body bags coming home .
And already , people are outraged at it .
And I see this as a real subversion of democratic processes in this country and a subversion of sovereignty of nations around the world .
What I see in the bigger picture here is what the real revolution is in terms of U.S. politics is that they 're taking billions of dollars in public money .
And they 're privatizing it .
You know , the Pentagon can't give campaign contributions .
The State Department can't give campaign contributions .
Blackwater 's executives can give contributions .
DynCore's , Ratheon , Northrop Grumman .
And so what they 're doing is , they 're taking billions of dollars .
And it 's making its way back into the campaign coffers of the very politicians that make the meteoric ascent of these companies possible .
I really view this through the lens of it tearing away at the fabric of American democracy as well .
Read that again : " tearing away at the fabric of American democracy " and yet the Congress could not do its homework before the hearing , nor did most of the media to whom Erik Prince turned after the hearings do much better .
Bill Moyers asked an important question :
The thought was , you know , suppose we had a national emergency .
Suppose the terrorists struck again .
And a President , President Hillary Clinton , or President Barack Obama declared marshal law in order to try to deal with this threat .
And there was a private army of twenty thousand soldiers that I could call upon to throw a ring around the capital and make sure that the Congress did n't leave town or did n't get back to the capital if -- how far fetched is that ?
But anyone paying attention knew the answer - it has already happened , because Blackwater was in New Orleans - even before FEMA was , according to Scahill , and had hundred of people along the Gulf Goast , received contracts from the Department of Homeland Security .
The use of such forces has been greatly expanded by Bush , but as Scahill points out , the Clinton administration did a lot of privatization as well , and Halliburton got many contracts in the 1990s .
Further , the public relations firm to which Blackwater turned to help in their pushback in the media is headed by Hillary 's political advisor Mark Penn .
And the use of such public relations firms to drive American policy on behalf of private entities is not the worst example .
Foreign governments use them .
We have seen Robert Livingston lobbying on behalf of Turkey .
Hill and Knowlton put together the false testimony by a young lady whom only later did we know was the daughter of the Kuwaiti Ambassador , testimony that inflamed American public opinion with tales of babies being ripped from respirators in Kuwait City by Iraqi soldiers .
I ostensibly teach government .
I try to teach how our government is designed to work , and also the reality of how it actually works .
Over time the connection between the two seems to be disappearing .
I am given great flexibility in what I do in my classroom , but I am reaching the point where if I were to talk about what I really perceive , what my own thoughts now are , I would be well outside the bounds of even the great flexibility I am granted .
What difference does it make to elect Democrats if they will not stand up for what is right ?
People worry about Constitutional conflicts , but perhaps the time for such a conflict is overdue .
We survived Watergate .
But had not certain people been willing to risk their careers and their positions , we might have awoken one morning and found our republic gone and replaced by something alien .
Last night on Countdown John Dean acknowledged that the extreme ideas of the unitary presidency , first being espoused during the Reagan administration and upon which people in this administration rely heavily far exceed the wildest imagination of thus under Nixon advocating an imperial presidency .
Think about that for a moment .
We had a great crisis in the 1970s , and yet at its worst it does not in the eyes of an insider of that period come close to what we confront today .
And yet people will not stand up in Congress , at least , not enough .
Yesterday I wrote a comment in which I placed the following words in bold :
By now no one should believe anyone from this administration .
In that comment I noted Bush 's remarks on his first visit to DC as president - elect on December 18 , 2001 :
If this were a dictatorship , it would be a heck of a lot easier , as long as I 'm the dictator
I was writing in response to Jeff Huber 's diary on mercenary Americans , and could not help but be reminded of the Reagan administration , of what we discovered about Casey and North , and I quoted from a New York Times story by Fox Butterworth :
Lieut .
Col. Oliver L. North testified today that William J. Casey , as Director of Central Intelligence , had wanted to use profits from the arms sales to Iran to establish an ' ' off - the - shelf , self - sustaining , stand - alone ' ' fund that could pay for intelligence operations outside normal Government control .
In another comment , posted on an open thread almost immediately after watching the Moyers show , I opined that our insistence upon the Marines destroying Fallujah after the death of the four Blackwater contractors was reminiscent of , and in many ways far worse , than the Nazi destruction of Lidice after the assassination of Heydrich .
Perhaps those remarks will mark me as un-American , too intemperate in my use of language .
Perhaps I will be attacked as Pete Stark has been .
Perhaps political figures who have previously sought my support , my money , will move away from me as Nancy Pelosi has moved away from Stark 's remarks about Bush .
Is not that part of the problem ?
Too many in the Democratic party are afraid of the blunt language , worrying about how it will be turned against them .
They give NOTHING to the many Americans who want to see someone stand up for what is right .
They back down in the face of pushback from Bush defenders , yet do not stand up forcefully enough when Bush and his supporters attack their patriotism and willingness to defend the American people .
There is nothing to stop the House from passing a Sense of the House resolution condemning the words of the President and anyone in his administration who attempts to demagogue issues of national security or impugns the patriotism of those who disagree with him .
Stark 's language was mild as compared to what has been said by Bush supporters about those who oppose the president .
I am angry .
I despair .
I am outraged .
I am exhausted .
I teach about a government that perhaps no longer exists , one that had three co-equal branches , that had checks and balances , in which the power of the executive was limited , in which governmental functions were done by governmental employees subject to Congressional oversight , in which those who acted militarily on behalf of the United States were subject to the regulations of the UCMJ .
I see major aspirants for the highest office in the land signing on to a resolution declaring a part of a nation 's national security apparatus a terrorist organization .
Could not the same appellation be applied to our own CIA , which in its violation of international law through extraordinary rendition , secret prisons where torture occurs , kidnapping people off the streets of Italy , and the like , led to an environment designed to terrorize those who might oppose our actions ?
What about our own military commanders rationalizing destroying civilian gatherings upon a hint that there might be " insurgents " present ?
What about what our military has done in Abu Ghraib , were not at least some of those actions that fall under the category of terrorism ?
Is not much of what is being done a violation not only of international law but also of any standard of human decency ?
Where is the outrage over this ?
Where is the insistence by Democrats and honest Republicans for accountability ?
Why is the press so hesitant to fully scrutinize ?
This is a personal screed .
My anger is palpable .
And yet my capacity for outrage seems as yet not exhausted .
There are immediate crises that face us .
One is the environment .
We need to take serious action now .
Another is the abandonment of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Still another is our abandonment of the idea of a community of nations in favor of the idea of asserting American superiority , even though the latter is not sustainable , and is destructive of the principles upon which we claimed our independence .
I find myself coming to a dangerous place .
I am no longer willing to vote for someone merely because they are the lesser of two evils .
Time is too short .
The lesser of two evils is still evil .
If someone wants my support for high office , they will have to stand up for what is right , at the risk if necessary of their political career , even their own life .
This country is desperate for such courageous leadership .
Hillel was an important figure in Jewish thought .
I want again to apply some of his words from that time :
If I am not for myself , then who will be for me ?
And if I am only for myself , then what am I ?
And if not now , when ?
I challenge those who say we have to hold our fire in order to elect Democrats because then it will make a difference to answer some questions .
What liberties are you prepared to abandon in order to elect Democrats ?
What will you say to the families of Americans killed or devasted ( psychologically as well as physically ) by our continued debacle in Iraq ?
How will you justify to the people in Iraq and other countries whose lives we are destroying by not standing up for what is right ?
If not now , when ?
My heart aches for what I perceive .
I feel impotent as an individual .
My efforts as a citizen and as a teacher now seem almost pointless .
But I will not quietly fade into the background even if the words I offer are ignored .
I demand that people acknowledge one point :
Choosing the lesser of two evils is still to choose evil .
At times we may have no other choice , we must choose between Scylla and Charybdis .
But if we speak out , if we stand up sooner , if we demand honesty and true leadership , perhaps we can avoid traveling so far that we have no other choice .
And if we must make that choice , we have an obligation to acknowledge the evil to which we must acquiesce , and do all in our power to ameliorate the suffering we cause others .
We must be accountable for that which is done on our behalf and in our name .
We cannot depend upon leadership from the top .
WE MUST INSIST UPON IT , even absent highly visible leaders .
And we must be willing to support as we can any small steps in that direction by political leaders , even as we challenge them to go further .
Is it too late for outrage ?
I began with that question .
My answer now is not quite yet too late for outrage .
but getting awfully close .
I will continue to write , to speak , to teach , to try to persuade , to challenge , to listen , to do what is within my limited powers flowing from my incomplete understanding and restricted vision .
What about you ?

No estimated wait time given if placed on hold .
The security council statement , which also called for " genuine dialogue " with the opposition leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , marked the first time that Beijing had agreed to UN criticism of the junta .
The statement did not threaten sanctions , but the significance of its unanimous support by all 15 members of the security council would not have been lost on Burma 's generals , who had hitherto been able to count on China , a neighbour and key trading partner , to block UN censure .
" That represents a very significant shift in global politics from just a few weeks ago , " said the foreign secretary , David Miliband .
" It is proof that the recent brutal crackdown and ongoing persecution of peaceful protesters has isolated the Burmese regime .
They must now respond to these growing global calls for them to work with others in building a better future for the people of Burma . "
Britain co-sponsored the statement with the US and France , which also signalled they would maintain the pressure on the junta to respond to UN demands for the release of prisoners , including Ms Suu Kyi .
The US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , said that if the junta failed to respond accordingly , the security council would take the matter up again in as little as two weeks .
" We will not relent .
We will persist , " he told journalists .
" What is important is that the government of Myanmar delivers , " France 's deputy UN ambassador , Jean - Pierre Lacroix , said .
China 's deputy UN ambassador , Liu Zhenmin , did not respond to questions on what further action the council might take , saying only that he hoped the statement would contribute to the success of a mission to the region by a UN special envoy , Ibrahim Gambari , due to start next week .
Mr Gambari will visit Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , India , China and Japan , before going to Burma by the end of the month .
The statement had to be diluted from earlier drafts to win Chinese approval , dropping a demand for the Burmese government to account for what had happened to detained demonstrators , and a call for a transition to democracy .
A Burmese dissident group yesterday accused the security forces of beating and killing protesters , and leaving them to die of their injuries .
The Democratic Voice of Burma , a Norway - based radio station run by dissident journalists , said at least a dozen freed prisoners had given accounts of brutal treatment in detention centres .
One said that " dozens " of prisoners had been killed .
The government has said that 10 people were killed and nearly 2,100 arrested in the course of last month 's street demonstrations , and that 700 detainees had since been released .
The regime has denied torturing its prisoners and has blamed the protests on western instigation .
The state - owned New Light of Myanmar newspaper denounced the protesters , as " stooges of foreign countries putting on a play written by their foreign masters " .
Slow on the writing , I know .
My other project is coming along well ( though slowly ) , but I ’m back here , so let ’s just launch right into things .
The President delivered his big ol ’ address , which marked the second of two huge public spectacles concerning Iraq that surrounded the 9/11 anniversary , the first being Petraeus ’s speech .
I find it interesting that we have a cluster of performances pumping up the Iraq Fiasco right now , apparently they ’re hoping to make people forget that the two are entirely distinct from one another .
Anyway , Bush ’s speech .
The thing is so full of dishonesty and delusion that it ’s almost impressive .
But I ’d like to focus on one situation more than anything else .
One year ago , much of Baghdad was under siege .
Schools were closed , markets were shuttered , and sectarian violence was spiraling out of control .
Today , most of Baghdad ’s neighborhoods are being patrolled by coalition and Iraqi forces who live among the people they protect .
Many schools and markets are reopening .
Citizens are coming forward with vital intelligence .
Sectarian killings are down .
And ordinary life is beginning to return .
One year ago , much of Diyala province was a sanctuary for al Qaeda and other extremist groups , and its capital of Baqubah was emerging as an al Qaeda stronghold .
Today , Baqubah is cleared .
Diyala province is the site of a growing popular uprising against the extremists .
And some local tribes are working alongside coalition and Iraqi forces to clear out the enemy and reclaim their communities .
One year ago , Shia extremists and Iranian - backed militants were gaining strength and targeting Sunnis for assassination .
Today , these groups are being broken up , and many of their leaders are being captured or killed .
Keep in mind that one year ago the United States was in its third year of the invasion .
One year ago from the date of Bush ’s speech , we were on our 1273rd day of the Iraq campaign .
One year ago from the date of Bush ’s speech , we were on our 1231st “ post - Mission Accomplished ” day .
One year ago , when Bush admits that Baghdad was in flames and safe havens for Al Qaeda were littered about the nation , the United States had been occupying Iraq for nearly 42 months .
Bush is admitting that in the course of those three and a half years , the nation collapsed into chaos and ruin .
The claims of progress would mean something were it not for this somewhat inconvenient fact .
The argument of improving situations would mean something were it not that those situations came about at his doing .
If I set a fire , I ca n’t expect praise for putting part of it out , but that ’s exactly what Bush is doing .
Make no mistake , any time the president attempts to garner support by pointing out a time where Al Qaeda has been beaten away from their Iraqi stronghold , he is the reason they were there in the first place .
Lacking any actual progress by way of stabilizing the country , we ’re at the point where our leader is expecting us to sing his praises for partially cleaning up his own messes .
In 2002 we were promised that the country would fall right into place once Saddam fell .
Rumsfeld and the boys famously refused to consider post - war planning because that was supposed to be the easy part .
Sweets and flowers , greeted as liberators , as soon as Saddam was out of power , so we were told , everything would be hunky dory .
Five years later , the greatest progress we have is that Baghdad is n’t the shithole it was last year .
Bush said it best himself .
“ Ordinary life is beginning to return . ”
The Iraqi people are still waiting for the country to be as habitable as it was when Saddam was still there .
And people can’t imagine why I would never trust Bush to start up a war with Iran even if it were conclusively proven that Khamenei had a nuclear bomb pointed directly at my house .

Voiceover artist Emma Clarke , 36 , recorded the announcements in the same smooth tones that have warned millions of passengers to “ Mind The Gap ” and posted them on her Web site .
The messages include :
* “ We would like to remind our American tourist friends that you are almost certainly talking too loudly . ”
* “ Would the passenger in the red shirt pretending to read the paper but who is actually staring at that woman ’s chest please stop .
You are not fooling anyone , you filthy pervert . ”
* “ Would passengers filling in answers on their Sudokus please accept that they are just crosswords for the unimaginative and are not in any way more impressive just because they contain numbers . ”
* “ Here we are crammed again into a sweaty Tube carriage ...
If you ’re female smile at the bloke next to you and make his day .
He ’s probably not had sex for months . ”
Clarke said it was “ just a bit of a laugh . ”
But Tube operator Transport for London ( TfL ) failed to see the funny side and dropped her , after eight years .
“ London Underground is sorry to have to announce that further contracts for Miss Clarke are experiencing severe delays , ” a TfL spokesman told the Evening Standard Monday .

Analysis
The world just got a little scarier for social network providers .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just determined that Roommates.com - a networking site for people looking for , well , roommates - did not deserve immunity under Section 230 of the US Communications Decency
Act for information that users of the site provide on questionnaires during registration .
Section 230 of the CDA gives providers of an interactive computer service , such as a website , immunity from lawsuits relating to the publication of information on the site by a person other than the site 's provider .
Thus , information posted to a blog 's comments or on an online forum wo n't put the site provider on the hook for damages if the publication of the content happens to break the law someplace .
Someone who , in whole or in part , creates or develops the published information , however , qualifies as a " content provider , " and falls outside the bounds of the immunity .
The Ninth Circuit panel determined that Roommates.com , by filtering the kind of information that visitors to the site would see , had developed the information provided , and could not claim immunity for the publication of the information .
This could have wide - ranging repercussions , and knock scores of websites outside the safe , comfortable realm of Section 230 immunity that they 've come to enjoy .
This could then make them liable for claims relating to third - party publication , such as the posting of defamatory information on their website .
The current suit , brought by the Fair Housing Councils of San Fernando Valley and San Diego , alleged that Roommates.com violated the Fair Housing Act by encouraging discrimination in the selection of roommates .
The lower court initially determined that Roommates.com qualified for the Section 230 immunity and entered judgment for the website .
The Councils appealed , and a divided Ninth Circuit panel ruled that the immunity actually did not apply .
Because of how the site operated , the panel concluded , the information was not totally provided by someone other than the website , thus the lower court now has to conduct a trial over whether the information on the site does in fact violate the Fair Housing Act .
Roommates.com requires people looking for roommates to fill out forms with personal information about themselves , as well as their preferences for their roommates .
Through drop - down menus , registrants can state a desire to live with only straight males with no children , or with only lesbians with children , or several other similar combinations .
Registrants can also fill in a free - text " Additional Comments " section , which many use to further refine their roommate preferences .
User profiles are then published and distributed using the above information .
What raised the ire of the court was the fact that Roommates.com channels visitors to certain profiles based on the information provided during registration .
For example , a straight male seeking a room could only search profiles of those users who had indicated during registration that they would live with a straight male .
By categorizing , channeling and limiting the availability of profile information , the court argued , Roommates.com had added an additional layer of information that made them a content provider that could not claim the Section 230 immunity .
But where would this test end ?
Would Google 's search results , which channel information to users based on queries they provide at Google 's prompting , contain this additional layer of information ?
Would a search on MySpace for single females in New York have it ?
If so , Google could become liable for , um , every piece of defamatory content on the Internet , and MySpace could find itself in hot water over defamatory comments and / or sexual predators lurking on the site .
MySpace has already used Section 230 to shield itself from liability for the sexual assault of a minor by a predator who used the site to connect with his victim .
This new decision - which applies to a different jurisdiction , but carries more precedential weight - throws that decision into question when the issue comes up again .
Plus , it could add more pressure on the site to release information that states want to use to investigate pedophiles .
So far , MySpace has steadfastly refused to give up the data .
Of course , it 's completely possible that the decision could be overturned before it comes to all that .
Roommates.com could appeal to the Ninth Circuit to conduct an en banc review ( that 's fancy lawyer - talk for " a decision from the entire court , rather than just from a rinky - dink three - judge panel ) , and even if that fails , there 's always the Supreme Court , although that 's a long - shot .
But given that the panel 's majority opinion was written by Judge Kozinski , the Ninth Circuit as a whole might view the situation a little differently , making Supreme Court review unnecessary .
Judge Kozinski recently went on a tirade against blogs while participating in a discussion at the Santa Clara University School of Law where he called the darlings of Web 2.0 " hateful , " " self - indulgent , " and " annoying " .
He may be right .
But it does show that he has a certain attitude about Internet content that probably influenced the decision a wee bit .
Once some new eyes read over the record of the case , look for the outcome to shift back in favor of website providers .
But in the meantime , also watch for the coming flood of social networking websuits .
After this decision , it 's bound to happen . ®
When Intel and the One Laptop Per Child Project buried the hatchet — a love - in that brought resources to OLPC and the prospects of Intel gaining a CPU role in the XO laptop — the questions were many .
Where would this leave AMD ?
What would Intel really do with its competing Classmate PC ?
The answer is now clear : with AMD still in the XO 's " driver 's seat , " Intel is continuing its efforts to sell the Classmate PC in markets where it will compete head to head with the OLPC , including the much sought - after Chinese education market .
Intel is currently working with China to solidify a promotional deal aimed at bringing the Classmate PC to nearly a million Chinese students next year .
Intel 's interest in China should not be surprising .
Not only does the country have a surplus of potential Classmate PC users , but Intel has committed to building a new , historic 90nm fab there .
The company has a design center in China currently tasked with finding new uses for computing power among China 's largely poor , rural population .
In short , Intel is serious about China , and the 90nm fab is a perfect place to see why .
The Classmate PC has been a sore spot for Nicholas Negroponte , chairman and visionary of OLPC .
In May of this year , Negroponte bashed the Classmate PC project on 60 Minutes , saying that " Intel should be ashamed of itself " for offering the Classmate PC at what he says is a " loss " to foreign governments .
Negroponte said that Intel is afraid of the OLPC " because the numbers are so large , they look at those numbers and they say , ' If we 're not in those , we 're toast . ' "
Several months later in the wake of a public friendship between the two companies , Intel still is n't " inside " the XO .
As we reported previously , the final design stage of the XO is essentially closed , and AMD has gone on the record to say that its position in the XO is n't up for grabs anytime soon .
According to AMD , " the whole device would need to be redesigned " were OLPC to adopt an Intel CPU .
This leaves Intel twiddling its thumbs , to a certain extent .
If Intel really sweats the OLPC and what it could do for AMD , there does n't appear to be much it can do about it from within the confines of the OLPC partnership .
Hence we 're not too surprised that Intel is talking directly to the Chinese government about adopting the Classmate PC in trials that would begin next year , according to the Chinese - language Commercial Times .
John Davies , VP of Intel 's World Ahead program , confirmed that the company would like to begin seeding schools with Classmate PCs next year .
If a deal can be reached , it could generate more than 1 million orders next year alone .
Make no mistake about it : those are orders that OLPC would n't mind servicing .
We believe that the competition between Intel and OLPC will heat up greatly in the coming year , despite the official involvement of Intel in OLPC .
While philanthropic , the rush to equip the world 's " poor " with laptops is big business , and given that there are signs of trouble at OLPC , it can only be expected that Intel would continue with its own project .
In fact , the situation may be worse now than it was when the original flare - up between the two companies occurred .
We believe that there 's a lot riding on the success of OLPC's " Give 1 Get 1 " initiative , because there are signs that OLPC is having difficultly gaining the big orders needed to leverage scale and push the cost of the XO laptop down .
Cost increases have pushed the OLPC from its $ 100 target all the way up to $ 188 , putting it dangerously close to Intel 's Classmate PC , which is currently pegged at $ 225 in its most basic configuration .
The two systems cannot be compared on specs alone , of course , but for governments considering either option , the close parity in pricing now makes the decision much more difficult than it would have been had the XO price not deviated so far from its original target .

Android , Google 's new mobile software platform based on the Linux kernel , is scheduled to be released in early 2008 under an open - source license .
But hope for the new platform is mingled with worries that it wo n't be as free and open as the initial publicity surrounding the release strenuously implies .
" I would n't bother with this , " says Bruce Perens , a professional evangelist of open - source software .
" It 's so easy to find a project that is 100 percent open source right now to work on , or indeed to create one .
That way , I 'd be a little more sure that my work would n't be locked up with proprietary stuff forever . "
Android 's release last week was initially greeted as a breath of fresh air by those hoping to inject more freedom into the smartphone industry , which is currently saddled by various restrictions .
Lockdowns on hardware functionality , demanded by service providers and enforced by the manufacturers , have resulted in a marketplace filled with crippled devices that are only minimally configurable or expandable .
However , the announcement that Android would be released under a software license which allows for some restrictions to remain in place , albeit in a more limited way , has given many pause .
The Android software platform will be licensed not under the GPL , the license that covers Linux and GNU software , but under the Apache License , which does not include the GPL 's restriction on closed modifications .
According to the Android FAQ page , " The Apache license allows manufacturers and mobile operators to innovate using the platform without the requirement to contribute those innovations back to the open - source community . "
The page promises that " industry players can add proprietary functionality to their products based on Android without needing to contribute anything back to the platform , " and , to be sure , " companies can remove functionality if they choose . "
Those restrictions , plus the licensing of the preliminary developer tools , have raised red flags for some potential developers .
" What happened to the whole ' full stack ' and ' open - source ' thing , " software developer Robilad asks on his blog , referring to the language used by Google in Android 's announcement .
" Let 's just hope Google gets around to releasing the actual Android code under an open - source license before 2017 . "
Google 's wording does n't give a clear impression about who 's going to reap the benefits of Android .
With one hand , Android offers ( in a video on the project 's website ) " the ability to have your cellphone do whatever the heck you want it to do " while the other hand panders to " industry players " who may want to curtail that user experience .
GPL - licensed code makes no such compromises .
" Anyone is free to use , change or improve our code , " explains Steven Mosher , vice president of marketing for OpenMoko , another Linux - based mobile platform which now finds itself in competition with Android .
" They owe us nothing , " Mosher says of smartphone manufacturers using OpenMoko .
" Our only request is this :
They owe other people the same rights we gave them .
We give you the code for free .
If you change it or improve it , you must give your work back to the common good . "
According to Mosher , members of the open - source community are concerned that , by choosing the Apache License , Android is " using ' open source ' , but cynically neglecting its principles . "
Google is n't terribly worried about the licensing controversy .
" We 've already seen tremendous developer interest in the Android SDK , with downloads surpassing all others on code.google.com , " says a spokesperson .
Hal Steger , vice president of marketing for Funambol , an open - source messaging software project , accordingly warns that " Google 's choice to go with the Apache License will likely result in some developers sticking with the OpenMoko - type approach . "
Clearly , in order to launch a successful mobile platform , it 's necessary to woo the powers that be .
Even the combined might of Google and the open - source community wo n't soon overthrow the iron whim of the cellular carriers .
Some open - source advocates , though , do see potential in Google 's power to broaden the market .
Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin finds one thing especially promising : the challenge Google has brought against the status quo , closed - source software model for handhelds currently dominated by Microsoft 's Windows Mobile and Symbian ( the software platform jointly owned by Nokia , Sony Ericsson , Siemens and other handset makers ) .
" Google is proliferating the use of the Linux kernel as the standard for mobile devices , " says Zemlin .
" Similar to the server operating environment , the world will likely end up with two camps : Linux - based phones on one side with Microsoft and Symbian on the other .
My guess is Microsoft and Symbian will continue to lag due to the lack of agility from their proprietary development models .
It 's difficult for them to compete with open - source licenses , no matter which specific one . "

As a first - time mother , Sara Herman thought it was only to be expected that she had an enormous bump after five months .
What she and doctors failed to realise was that the petite mother - to - be , who is only just over 5 ft , was expecting a giant .
When Jack eventually arrived at 37 weeks he weighed an astonishing 14lb 8oz .
Scroll down for more ...
And now , after health problems kept him in hospital for four months , he is enjoying life at home in Manchester with 37 - year - old Mrs Herman and her husband Keith .
" At five months I looked like I was going to give birth at any moment and the size of my bump meant it was difficult for me to get around , " said Mrs Herman , a product sourcer .
" But because it was the first time I 'd been pregnant , I just thought this was normal . "
Mrs Herman became pregnant in September last year , shortly after marrying Keith , who runs a sales promotion business .
A scan at 14 weeks showed the baby was growing fast and doctors even thought that the due date was wrong as the baby was so large .
" When they said they thought Jack was going to be big , I imagined a 9lb or 10 lb baby at the most , " she said .
" And that 's what the doctors thought too . "
When she was five months pregnant , the couple went on holiday to New York , where strangers asked her if her baby was due any day .
She said : " Jack was actually about 7lb then , so he was actually the size of an average new - born baby .
" I was finding it very difficult to get around the department stores , and had to lie down in the afternoons as I was so exhausted from all the weight I was carrying . "
At 37 weeks , Mrs Herman was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester as she had not felt the baby move much for the last two days .
" He was actually so big that there was n't much room for him to move around , which is why I had n't felt much movement , " she said .
" I was taken straight down for a caesarean .
The doctors actually gasped when they brought him out . "
Tests showed that Jack had grown so big because of a condition called hyperinsulism which causes the body to produce too much insulin , leading to weight gain .
His heart muscle had thickened since it had to work extra hard because of his size .
Scroll down for more ...
Mrs Herman said : " He may have looked big and healthy , but he was actually life - threateningly ill .
They had to put him on a drip .
" I went in to see him after a few hours and I could n't believe his size .
He was in the unit with premature babies , who looked tiny compared to him .
He actually filled the whole incubator .
After a few days , the doctors had to get him a bigger one . "
Jack was transferred to Pendlebury Children 's Hospital in Manchester , which is setting up a support group for children with hyperinsulism .
At the age of 14 weeks he had 95 per cent of his pancreas removed to treat his condition .
The operation was a success and he was allowed home with medication .
His heart condition has also improved .
He weighs nearly 22lb , compared with the average weight at six months of 16lb , and wears clothes for a child aged 12 to 18 months .
Mrs Herman added : " I have to manage his weight very carefully because of his condition .
Surprisingly , he does n't have a good appetite but he 's starting to eat rice and mashed banana .
" He 's such a happy baby , always laughing and giggling .
People can't believe that he 's only six months old when I take him out in his pram . "
• Britain 's heaviest baby was Guy Warwick Carr , delivered in Cumbria in 1992 weighing 15 lb 8oz .
The biggest ever born was a boy produced in 1879 by Anna Bates of Canada , who like her husband was more than 7ft tall .
The infant weighed 23lb 12oz and died 11 hours after birth .

Using an average of $ 50 a barrel , the report said the discrepancy was valued at $ 5 million to $ 15 million daily .
The report does not give a final conclusion on what happened to the missing fraction of the roughly 2 million barrels pumped by Iraq each day , but the findings are sure to reinforce long - standing suspicions that smugglers , insurgents and corrupt officials control significant parts of the country 's oil industry .
The report also covered alternative explanations for the billions of dollars worth of discrepancies , including the possibility that Iraq has been consistently overstating its oil production .
Iraq and the State Department , which reports the numbers , have been under relentless pressure to show tangible progress in Iraq by raising production levels , which have languished well below the U.S. goal of 3 million barrels a day .
Virtually the entire economy of Iraq is dependent on oil revenues .

The narration begins :
As your jet starts its descent , you are glued to your window .
The scene below is astonishing : a 24 - square - mile archipelago of coral - colored islands in the shape of an almost finished puzzle of the world .
In the shallow green waters between continents , the sunken shapes of the Pyramids of Giza and the Roman Coliseum are clearly visible .
In the distance are three other large island groups configured as palms within crescents and planted with high - rise resorts , amusement parks , and a thousand mansions built on stilts over the water .
The “ Palms ” are connected by causeways to a Miami - like beachfront chock - a- block full of mega- hotels , apartment high - rises and yacht marinas .
As the plane slowly banks toward the desert mainland , you gasp at the even more improbable vision ahead .
Out of a chrome forest of skyscrapers ( nearly a dozen taller than 1000 feet ) soars a new Tower of Babel .
It is an impossible one - half - mile high : the equivalent of the Empire State Building stacked on top of itself .
You are still rubbing your eyes with wonderment and disbelief when the plane lands and you are welcomed into an airport emporium where hundreds of shops seduce you with Gucci bags , Cartier watches , and one - kilogram bars of solid gold .
You make a mental note to pick up some duty - free gold on your way out .
The hotel driver is waiting for you in a Rolls Royce Silver Seraph .
Friends have recommended the Armani Hotel in the 160 - story tower or the seven - star hotel with an atrium so huge that the Statue of Liberty would fit inside , but instead you have opted to fulfill a childhood fantasy .
You always have wanted to be Captain Nemo in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea .
Your jellyfish - shaped hotel is , in fact , exactly 66 feet below the sea surface .
Each of its 220 luxury suites has clear Plexiglas walls that provide spectacular views of passing mermaids as well as the hotel ’s famed “ underwater fireworks : ” a hallucinatory exhibition of “ water bubbles , swirled sand , and carefully deployed lighting . ”
Any initial anxiety about the safety of your sea - bottom resort is dispelled by the smiling concierge .
The structure has a multi - level failsafe security system , he reassures you , that includes protection against terrorist submarines as well as missiles and aircraft .
Although you have an important business meeting at the Internet City free - trade zone with clients from Hyderabad and Taipei , you have arrived a day early to treat yourself to one of the famed adventures at the Restless Planet dinosaur theme park .
Indeed , after a soothing night ’s sleep under the sea , you are aboard a monorail headed for a Jurassic jungle .
Your expedition encounters some peacefully grazing Apatosaurs , but you are soon attacked by a nasty gang of velociraptors .
The animatronic beasts are so flawlessly lifelike — in fact , they have been designed by experts from the British Museum of Natural History — that you shriek in fear and delight .
With your adrenaline pumped - up by this close call , you polish off the afternoon with some thrilling snowboarding on the local black diamond run .
Next door is the Mall of Arabia , the world ’s largest mall — the altar of the city ’s famed Shopping Festival that attracts 5 million frenetic consumers each January — but you postpone the temptation .
Instead , you indulge in some expensive Thai fusion cuisine at a restaurant near Elite Towers that was recommended by your hotel driver .
The gorgeous Russian blond at the bar keeps staring at you with almost vampire - like hunger , and you wonder whether the local sin scene is as extravagant as the shopping ?..
The Sequel to Blade Runner ?
Welcome to paradise .
But where are you ?
Is this a new science - fiction novel from Margaret Atwood , the sequel to Blade Runner , or Donald Trump tripping on acid ?
No , it is the Persian Gulf city - state of Dubai in 2010 .
After Shanghai ( current population : 15 million ) , Dubai ( current population : 1.5 million ) is the world ’s biggest building site : an emerging dreamworld of conspicuous consumption and what locals dub “ supreme lifestyles . ”
Dozens of outlandish mega-projects — including “ The World ” ( an artificial archipelago ) , Burj Dubai ( the Earth ’s tallest building ) , the Hydropolis ( that underwater luxury hotel , the Restless Planet theme park , a domed ski resort perpetually maintained in 40C heat , and The Mall of Arabia , a hyper - mall — are actually under construction or will soon leave the drawing boards .
Under the enlightened despotism of its Crown Prince and CEO , 56 - year - old Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , the Rhode - Island - sized Emirate of Dubai has become the new global icon of imagineered urbanism .
Although often compared to Las Vegas , Orlando , Hong Kong or Singapore , the sheikhdom is more like their collective summation : a pastiche of the big , the bad , and the ugly .
It is not just a hybrid but a chimera : the offspring of the lascivious coupling of the cyclopean fantasies of Barnum , Eiffel , Disney , Spielberg , Jerde , Wynn , and Skidmore , Owings & Merrill .
Multibillionaire Sheik Mo — as he ’s affectionately known to Dubai ’s expats — not only collects thoroughbreds ( the world ’s largest stable ) and super - yachts ( the 525 - foot - long Project Platinum which has its own submarine and flight deck ) , but also seems to have imprinted Robert Venturi ’s cult Learning from Las Vegas in the same way that more pious Moslems have memorized The Quran .
( One of the Sheik ’s proudest achievements , by the way , is to have introduced gated communities to Arabia . )
Under his leadership , the coastal desert has become a huge circuit board into which the elite of transnational engineering firms and retail developers are invited to plug in high - tech clusters , entertainment zones , artificial islands , “ cities within cities ” — whatever is the latest fad in urban capitalism .
The same phantasmagoric but generic Lego blocks , of course , can be found in dozens of aspiring cities these days , but Sheik Mo has a distinctive and inviolable criterion : Everything must be “ world class , ” by which he means number one in The Guinness Book of Records .
Thus Dubai is building the world ’s largest theme park , the biggest mall , the highest building , and the first sunken hotel among other firsts .
Sheikh Mo ’s architectural megalomania , although reminiscent of Albert Speer and his patron , is not irrational .
Having “ learned from Las Vegas , ” he understands that if Dubai wants to become the luxury - consumer paradise of the Middle East and South Asia ( its officially defined “ home market ” of 1.6 billion ) , it must ceaselessly strive for excess .
From this standpoint , the city ’s monstrous caricature of futurism is simply shrewd marketing .
Its owners love it when designers and urbanists anoint it as the cutting edge .
Architect George Katodrytis wrote : “ Dubai may be considered the emerging prototype for the 21st century : prosthetic and nomadic oases presented as isolated cities that extend out over the land and sea . ”
Moreover , Dubai can count on the peak - oil epoch to cover the costs of these hyperboles .
Each time you spent $ 40 to fill your tank , you are helping to irrigate Sheik Mo ’s oasis .
Precisely because Dubai is rapidly pumping the last of its own modest endowment of oil , it has opted to become the postmodern “ city of nets ” — as Bertolt Brecht called his fictional boomtown of Mahoganny — where the super - profits of oil are to be reinvested in Arabia ’s one truly inexhaustible natural resource : sand .
( Indeed mega - projects in Dubai are usually measured by volumes of sand moved : 1 billion cubic feet in the case of The World . )
Al - Qaeda and the war on terrorism deserve some of the credit for this boom .
Since 9/11 , many Middle Eastern investors , fearing possible lawsuits or sanctions , have pulled up stakes in the West .
According to Salman bin Dasmal of Dubai Holdings , the Saudis alone have repatriated one - third of their trillion - dollar overseas portfolio .
The sheikhs are bringing it back home , and last year , the Saudis were believed to have ploughed at least $ 7 billion into Dubai ’s sand castles .
Another aqueduct of oil wealth flows from the neighboring Emirate of Abu Dhabi .
The two statelets dominate the United Arab Emirates — a quasi-nation thrown together by Sheik Mo ’s father and the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1971 to fend off threats from Marxists in Oman and , later , Islamists in Iran .
Today , Dubai ’s security is guaranteed by the American nuclear super - carriers usually berthed at the port of Jebel Ali .
Indeed , the city - state aggressively promotes itself as the ultimate elite “ Green Zone ” in an increasingly turbulent and dangerous region .
Meanwhile , as increasing numbers of experts warn that the age of cheap oil is passing , the al - Maktoum clan can count on a torrent of nervous oil revenue seeking a friendly and stable haven .
When outsiders question the sustainability of the current boom , Dubai officials point out that their new Mecca is being built on equity , not debt .
Since a watershed 2003 decision to open unrestricted freehold ownership to foreigners , wealthy Europeans and Asians have rushed to become part of the Dubai bubble .
A beachfront in one of the “ Palms ” or , better yet , a private island in “ The World ” now has the cachet of St. Tropez or Grand Cayman .
The old colonial masters lead the pack as Brit expats and investors have become the biggest cheerleaders for Sheikh Mo ’s dreamworld : David Beckham owns a beach and Rod Stewart , an island ( rumored , in fact , to be named Great Britain ) .
An Indentured , Invisible Majority
The utopian character of Dubai , it must be emphasized , is no mirage .
Even more than Singapore or Texas , the city - state really is an apotheosis of neo-liberal values .
On the one hand , it provides investors with a comfortable , Western - style , property - rights regime , including freehold ownership , that is unique in the region .
Included with the package is a broad tolerance of booze , recreational drugs , halter tops , and other foreign vices formally proscribed by Islamic law .
( When expats extol Dubai ’s unique “ openness , ” it is this freedom to carouse — not to organize unions or publish critical opinions — that they are usually praising . )
On the other hand , Dubai , together with its emirate neighbors , has achieved the state of the art in the disenfranchisement of labor .
Trade unions , strikes , and agitators are illegal , and 99 % of the private - sector workforce are easily deportable non-citizens .
Indeed , the deep thinkers at the American Enterprise and Cato institutes must salivate when they contemplate the system of classes and entitlements in Dubai .
At the top of the social pyramid , of course , are the al - Maktoums and their cousins who own every lucrative grain of sand in the sheikhdom .
Next , the native 15 % percent of the population — whose uniform of privilege is the traditional white dishdash — constitutes a leisure class whose obedience to the dynasty is subsidized by income transfers , free education , and government jobs .
A step below , are the pampered mercenaries : 150,000 - or - so British ex-pats , along with other European , Lebanese , and Indian managers and professionals , who take full advantage of their air - conditioned affluence and two - months of overseas leave every summer .
However , South Asian contract laborers , legally bound to a single employer and subject to totalitarian social controls , make up the great mass of the population .
Dubai lifestyles are attended by vast numbers of Filipina , Sri Lankan , and Indian maids , while the building boom is carried on the shoulders of an army of poorly paid Pakistanis and Indians working twelve - hour shifts , six and half days a week , in the blast - furnace desert heat .
Dubai , like its neighbors , flouts ILO labor regulations and refuses to adopt the international Migrant Workers Convention .
Human Rights
Watch in 2003 accused the Emirates of building prosperity on “ forced labor . ”
Indeed , as the British Independent recently emphasized in an exposé on Dubai , “ The labour market closely resembles the old indentured labour system brought to Dubai by its former colonial master , the British . ”
“ Like their impoverished forefathers , ” the paper continued , “ today ’s Asian workers are forced to sign themselves into virtual slavery for years when they arrive in the United Arab Emirates .
Their rights disappear at the airport where recruitment agents confiscate their passports and visas
to control them ”
In addition to being super - exploited , Dubai ’s helots are also expected to be generally invisible .
The bleak work camps on the city ’s outskirts , where laborers are crowded six , eight , even twelve to a room , are not part of the official tourist image of a city of luxury without slums or poverty .
In a recent visit , even the United Arab Emirate ’s Minister of Labor was reported to be profoundly shocked by the squalid , almost unbearable conditions in a remote work camp maintained by a large construction contractor .
Yet when the laborers attempted to form a union to win back pay and improve living conditions , they were promptly arrested .
Paradise , however , has even darker corners than the indentured - labor camps .
The Russian girls at the elegant hotel bar are but the glamorous facade of a sinister sex trade built on kidnapping , slavery , and sadistic violence .
Dubai — any of the hipper guidebooks will advise — is the “ Bangkok of the Middle East , ” populated with thousands of Russian , Armenian , Indian , and Iranian prostitutes controlled by various transnational gangs and mafias .
( The city , conveniently , is also a world center for money laundering , with an estimated 10 % of real estate changing hands in cash - only transactions . )
Sheikh Mo and his thoroughly modern regime , of course , disavow any connection to this burgeoning red - light industry , although insiders know that the whores are essential to keeping all those five - star hotels full of European and Arab businessmen .
But the Sheikh himself has been personally linked to Dubai ’s most scandalous vice : child slavery .
Camel racing is a local passion in the Emirates , and in June 2004 , Anti-Slavery International released photos of pre-school - age child jockeys in Dubai .
HBO Real Sports simultaneously reported that the jockeys , “ some as young as three — are kidnapped or sold into slavery , starved , beaten and raped . ”
Some of the tiny jockeys were shown at a Dubai camel track owned by
the al - Maktoums .
The Lexington Herald - Leader — a newspaper in Kentucky , where Sheikh Mo has two large thoroughbred farms — confirmed parts of the HBO story in an interview with a local blacksmith
who had worked for the crown prince in Dubai .
He reported seeing “ little bitty kids ” as young as four astride racing camels .
Camel trainers claim that the children ’s shrieks of terror spur the animals to a faster effort .
Sheikh Mo , who fancies himself a prophet of modernization , likes to impress visitors with clever proverbs and heavy aphorisms .
A favorite : “ Anyone who does not attempt to change the future will stay a captive of the past . ”
Yet the future that he is building in Dubai — to the applause of billionaires and transnational corporations everywhere — looks like nothing so much as a nightmare of the past : Walt Disney meets Albert Speer on the shores of Araby .

Often when creating text from a program , you encounter this situation :
You have a value , e.g. first_name , that might be empty ( depending on your programming language , this means undefined , NILL , None , nil or Nothing ) or contain a string .
In the latter case , you want to surround it by some markup , in the former you want to do nothing .
Here is how I ’d code that in Template : : Toolkit :
< table >
[ % IF second_name % ] < tr>< th > Second name </ th>< td >< b>[ % second_name %]
</b></td></tr> [ % END %]
[ % IF first_name % ] < tr >< th > First name < / th > < td > [ % first_name % ]</td></tr> [ % END %]
</table >
And here in python :
output = " < table > "
if second_name :
output += " < tr >< th > Second name < / th >< td >< b>%s</b></td></tr> " % second_name
if first_name :
output += " < tr >< th > First name </ th>< td >
%s</td></tr> " % first_name
output += " </table > "
I really do n’t like entering each variable name twice , when I basically want to do one thing with it .
Here is how you can use Haskell ’s flexible syntax to help you out .
First we define a unconditional “ insert here ” operator ++!++ and then a conditional one , named ++?++ :
(++!++) :: String -> String -> String ->
String
pre ++!++ post = \ins -> pre ++ ins ++ post
--
Or more haskell - style :
-- pre ++!++ post = ( pre ++ ) .(++ post )
(++?++) :: String -> String -> Maybe String ->
String
pre ++?++ post = \ins -> maybe " " ( pre ++!++ post ) ins
--
Or more haskell - style :
-- pre ++?++ post = maybe " " ( pre ++!++ post )
Note that the first line of each function , the type declaration , could be left out as Haskell can figure it out by itself .
Also note that these function are not restricted to strings ( as lists of characters ) , but can be used for any kind of list .
Now I can write the code up there as :
output = " < table > " ++ ( " < tr >< th > Second name < / th > < td > < b > " ++?++ " </b></td></tr> " ) second_name ++ ( " < tr > < th > First name < / th > < td > " ++?++ " </td></tr> " ) first_name ++ " </table > "
I think that ’s a nice display of the flexibility of Haskell ’s syntax , in this case , using symbols for function names and infix application .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If all goes according to plan , by 2009 you could be sticking it to Big Oil by driving an all electric , Chinese - made sedan for little more than the cost of a Camry .
Electric cars are nothing new .
But until now they 've either been very expensive to produce or , if not that , then small and relatively slow - little more than glorified golf carts .
Miles Rubin , with his $ 30,000 Miles XS 500 , is hoping to change all that .
According to Rubin , Founder of Miles Automotive Group , the XS 500 has a top speed of 80 miles per hour and a range of 120 miles at 60 miles per hour .
That 's about as fast as GM 's late - 90s era electric car , the EV 1 .
And the XS 500 will be a lot cheaper to produce , the company says .
Both the low cost and the high range can be attributed to China , where low labor costs keep the price down and state - sponsored research into battery technology yielded what Rubin said was an advanced lithium ion power pack produced by Lishen Battery .
Plug the car into a normal wall socket and , according to company literature , six hours later you 've got a full charge .
While this sounds like the perfect vehicle , serious challenges remain .
The first , of course , will be bringing the car to market .
Rubin said he 'll have 6 prototypes of the XS 500 by the fall , but they still need tinkering to get safety approval from U.S. regulators , plus do additional battery testing .
Then there 's the competition .
Phoenix Motors has a four - door utility truck with similar performance capabilities that it 's planning on selling to the public around the same time .
And Tesla Motors , makers of the $ 100,000 all - electric Tesla Roadster which is expected to enter limited production by the end of the year , has plans to enter the sedan market next .
( An e-mail to the company seeking comment was not returned .
For more on Tesla 's sedan plans , as well the recent departure of that company 's CEO read the Green Wombat blog . )
The big automakers are also getting in on the electric game with their plug - in hybrids - vehicles that use an electric motor all the time but can recharge with both a plug and a conventional gasoline engine , giving them far greater range .
General Motors , the only big automaker to announce anything like a target date , said Thursday mass production of its Volt plug - in should begin by 2010 .
Selling the car is another obvious challenge .
Ford , GM , Toyota and Honda all had electric vehicles back in the late 1990s .
They were sold in California at a time when state regulations basically required car makers to do so .
All of them halted production after those regulations were changed .
" But the world has changed , " said Rubin .
" We need to get off our reliance on oil and we need to alter our carbon footprint . "
Rubin has previously worked as a corporate lawyer and , later , headed several companies , including a company that sold metal forms to Detroit automakers .
He most recently headed Polo / Ralph Lauren Jeans .
Even if U.S. consumers flock to electric cars out of environmental concern , Rubin may still have to convince them to put their bodies inside a Chinese vehicle , especially in light of all the news lately of recalled Chinese goods .
To ensure quality , he says there are inspectors in both Chinese factories that will produce the car .
He also touts the car 's safety features including as reinforced doors and both front and side airbags .
" The cars will speak for themselves .
You can PR it to death , but if it does n't perform well , it 's dead on arrival , " he said .
Rubin will also have to answer skeptics who wonder how an electric vehicle is actually better for the environment , given that the electricity to run the car is produced largely from coal and the nation 's electric grid is strained as is .
Rubin retorts that the electric grid is plenty capable of handling demand from electric vehicles , provided people recharge them at night .
On the environmental question , he says just because electricity now is mostly made from coal and natural gas , renewables like solar or wind or carbon - free nuclear power could play a larger part of meeting the nation 's electricity demand .
Environmentalists also support the development of electric cars , noting that it 's much more efficient to create electricity than it is to power a vehicle with a combustion engine .
A Short History of the English Language
Nearly all of the inhabitants of Western Europe speak either a Romance language -- i.e. , derived from Latin ( like French , Italian , Spanish ) -- or a Germanic language ( like German , Dutch and the Scandinavian languages ) .
The Romance languages sound alike , as do the Germanic languages , but the two groups sound very different from each other .
They are split geographically as well , with the Latinate languages stretching to the south and west of Europe and the Germanic languages to the north and east .
Only in England did the two languages combine , welded together by the fusion of two populations co-existing on the same island .
Speakers of Anglo - Saxon , a Germanic language , invaded Britain in 449 , pushed back the Celts , the previous inhabitants , and settled there permanently .
Four centuries later , the Normans , who spoke French , conquered the Anglo - Saxons .
The two populations existed side by side , with the aristocrats speaking French and the peasants , Anglo - Saxon , until the fourteenth century , when the two languages coalesced to form English .
In general , the common words of English are Germanic .
The " function words " -- prepositions , conjunctions , pronouns , demonstratives , etc. -- are almost all from the Anglo - Saxon .
So are words for actual things and physical actions in the real world .
Sir Walter Scott pointed out in Ivanhoe , English has separate words for an animal and the meat of an animal .
The French lord would demand boeuf , mouton , or porc ; the French for cow , sheep , or pig , which , when cooked , became beef , mutton , or pork .
Latinate words had higher status than words from Anglo - Saxon , and this tendency increased during the Renaissance when professional vocabulary entered English from Latin , directly or through the French .
Thus , Latinate diction became an indicator of education and , consequently , of social status .
Formal speech also tends to be heavily Latinate , because it tends to simulate upper - class speech .
Coarse language tends to be Germanic -- almost all the four - letter words , for example , are from the Anglo - Saxon .
Social prejudices came to elevate Latinate words over the Germanic ones , but this elevation can be precarious .
Latinate words came to be indicators of deceptiveness , found in high density among people who wished to seem upper class , intelligent , or virtuous .
Germanic words , on the other hand , often connote frankness and sincerity .
In his essay , " Politics and the English Language , " George Orwell showed the essential difference between Latinate and Germanic words .
First , he vividly described three terrible events in predominantly Germanic language .
Then he gave Latinate summaries of those events .
The Latinate words are purple ; the Germanic words are green :
Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air , the inhabitants driven out into the countryside , the cattle machine - gunned , the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets : this is called pacification .
Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry : this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers .
People are imprisoned for years without trial , or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps : this is called elimination of unreliable elements . . . Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them .
. . .
The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism .
A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow , blurring the outlines and covering up all the details .
The great enemy of clear language is insincerity .
The Germanic words make the reader see cruelty and suffering ; the Latinate words remove human beings from the picture .
Orwell proved a true prophet about Latinate euphemisms , which are still used today to transform an ugly reality into a bloodless abstraction , a " killer " into a " terminator . "
Latinate words can be misused for deception , but some ugly realities are best left covered over .
The dentistís office is an excellent place to find examples of Latinate euphemisms .
" Injections " have replaced " shots , " and patients feel " discomfort " instead of " pain . "
Like Orwell 's deceivers , dentists use long , Latinate words as a kind of Novocain to detach their patients from what is happening .
" Discomfort " does hurt less than " pain " because using that word distances the sufferer from the reality and one can use that distance to become a co-creator of reality , not merely its victim .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- Ichiro Suzuki sped around the bases as the ball bounced away from Ken Griffey Jr. for the first inside - the - park home run in All - Star game history .
On a night of tricky hops , Suzuki and the American League rebounded to win -- as usual .
Instead of a Barry Bonds splash shot , the defining hit at Tuesday 's All - Star game was Suzuki 's drive off the right - field wall at quirky AT&T Park .
His two - run homer in the fifth inning put the AL ahead , then Carl Crawford and Victor Martinez added conventional shots and the Americans held on for a 5 - 4 victory over the Nationals .
" I thought it was going to go over the fence , " Suzuki said through a translator .
" When it did n't , I was really bummed . "
In a decade of dominance , the AL has won 10 straight games played to a decision , with the notorious 2002 tie at Milwaukee interrupting the run .
The only longer streak was when the NL took 11 in a row from 1972 - 82 .
" We 're tired of losing always , " the Chicago Cubs ' Derrek Lee said .
" We just want to win one and put all of this to rest . "
Suzuki's home run ball -- smudged with green and red and signed by the Japanese star -- immediately was handed over to the Hall of Fame .
" He 's an artist with that bat , " NL manager Tony La Russa said .
That was n't the only drama .
Alfonso Soriano hit a two - out , two - run homer in the ninth that made it 5 - 4 , and the NL loaded the bases on three walks .
Angels closer Francisco Rodriguez then retired Aaron Rowand on a routine fly to right for a save .
" I did n't enjoy it a bit , " said AL manager Jim Leyland , so competitive that he screamed at an umpire in the ninth .
Willie Mays , Bonds ' godfather , was honored with a touching tribute before the game .
In the Say Hey Kid 's day , the NL ruled All - Star games but not anymore .
The AL closed to 40 - 36 - 2 and improved to 5 - 0 since the All - Star winner received homefield advantage in the World Series .
" Nobody wants to lose , " Griffey said .
Soriano , who joined Frank Robinson as the only player to hit All - Star homers with each league , connected off Seattle closer J.J. Putz , who then walked J.J. Hardy .
Rodriguez relieved and walked Lee on a full count -- Leyland screamed at first - base umpire Charlie Reliford about a check swing .
A walk to Orlando Hudson loaded the bases before Rowand 's fly ended it .
" I just missed it , just missed it , " Rowand said .
" I was trying to hit a line drive somewhere , score a couple of runs .
I just missed hitting that ball off or over that fence . "
Suzuki , on the verge of a large contract extension from the Mariners , had been 3 - for - 15 in All - Star play coming in .
He got three hits , was the game 's MVP and will be remembered for his strange shot , unfamiliar even to ballpark regulars such as Bonds .
" He came up to me and said I 've never seen that happen before , " Griffey said .
Fans had waited in kayaks out in McCovey Cove beyond right field in vain for some shots into the water -- no souvenirs found their way into the chilly bay .
Bonds , the center of attention in the days before the game , had a quiet night .
He flied to right field in the first , hit an opposite - field shot to the warning track in left in the third , then departed at the top of the fourth .
He received a huge ovation after he came out on the red carpet during the pregame introductions and bowed three times to his adoring hometown fans .
Hitting in the No. 2 spot -- his last regular - season appearance in that slot was 20 years ago -- he even faked a bunt on the first pitch of his second at - bat .
" There 's too many emotions to be able to explain it , " he said .
" This is my family who I grew up for a lot of years .
All I can do is say thank you . "
His chase for Hank Aaron 's home run record resumes later this week , and the scrutiny will return .
But for a night , the swirl of steroids speculation lifted along with the San Francisco fog .
Griffey , perhaps the closest to a latter - day Mays baseball has seen , drove in two runs for the NL with a first - inning single and a sixth - inning sacrifice fly .
Boston 's Josh Beckett got the win , and San Diego 's Chris Young -- who gave up Suzuki 's homer -- was the loser .
Young entered to start the fifth and walked his first batter , Brian Roberts .
One out later , Suzuki reached down and golfed a ball to right - center field .
It hit off an All - Star ad in an area known as the arcade and instead of bouncing straight back , it kicked toward right field .
" It just hit the corner and bounced the other way , " Griffey said .
" I tried to make a good throw to the cutoff man and hoped that he would fall down . "
Suzuki was at third by the time Griffey got to the ball and easily sped home for the first inside - the - park homer of his major league career -- since joining the majors in 2001 , he had never hit one in the regular season or playoffs .
An All - Star every season he 's played in the majors , his homer put the AL ahead 2 - 1 .
Second in the majors with a ,359 average , Suzuki joked about his power .
" If I 'm allowed to hit .220 , I could probably hit 40 , " he said , " but nobody wants that . "
Before a ballpark record crowd of 43,965 on an overcast evening , Mays was honored for being perhaps the greatest five - tool player in the sport 's history .
After the All - Stars were introduced , he walked in from center field , flanked by Bonds and Derek Jeter , between two rows of the assembled players .
The tribute was similar -- but less emotional -- than 1999's ceremony honoring Ted Williams at Boston 's Fenway Park .
Griffey was the early star .
He put the NL ahead with an RBI single in the first off Dan Haren , then threw out Alex Rodriguez trying to score from second in the fourth on Ivan Rodriguez 's single .
Crawford homered with two outs in the sixth against Francisco Cordero to make it 3 - 1 .
The ball went a little to the center - field side of Suzuki 's shot , about 20 feet from the sign that totals Bonds ' homers , currently 751 .
A fan appeared to reach over the brick wall , about 19 feet high , and gather up the ball .
Griffey drove in the NL's second run with a sacrifice fly in the bottom half against Justin Verlander after Carlos Beltran nearly duplicated Suzuki 's shot off the wall but was held to a triple by Vladimir Guerrero .
Martinez hit the 18th pinch homer in All - Star history , a two - run drive in the eight off Mets closer Billy Wagner .
Bonds did n't seem to mind that he was n't the hero .
" It was fabulous .
It was great , " he said .

The AL and NL began the night tied with 326 runs each in All - Star play .
...
There have been two inside - the - parkers in the ballpark : by Fernando Vina on May 9 , 2000 , and Dustan Mohr on Aug. 4 , 2004 .
...
Young pitched the fifth inning and made pickoff throws to Lee .
The pair were suspended for brawling at Wrigley Field on June 16 after Young hit Lee with a pitch .
...
Jeter was 1 - for - 3 , leaving him at 8 - for - 16 in All - Star play .

After the game , a recording of Yankee Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard invited fans to next year 's game in New York .
The Iraqi government has let it be known that it doesnt recognize any immunity for the private military company Blackwater USA , and its starting to look as if Blackwaters contract to serve as bodyguards for U.S. State Department personnel in Iraq will be ended sooner rather than later , despite Blackwater taking on high - priced legal counsel to make whatever case needs to be made on its behalf , whether in court or in the world of lobbying .
But whatever happens to Blackwater in the short run , unless U.S. foreign policy changes drastically , we can expect private contractors to play a large role  uncomfortably large in the eyes of many  in U.S. military actions for some time to come .
The Blackwater imbroglio has placed the key questions of who actually controls these private forces and to whom they are accountable front - and - center , and we can expect a fair amount of chin- scratching and policy tweaking in the next few months .
But unless we take the advice of that fellow from Texas who ran for president in 2000 promising a humbler and more modest foreign policy that leaves nation - building to those who actually live in the nations in question  whatever became of the guy , anyway ?
 the implementation of the activist and interventionist foreign policy we have in place now will require plenty of private contractors .
It is hardly unprecedented to have private contractors participate in military activity , including in combat or near - combat .
During the early 19th century the U.S. commissioned private ships as privateers to carry out missions at sea , including missions that sometimes involved interdicting or engaging ships from other countries .
Civilians carried out many supply functions for both the Union and Confederate armies during the War between the States .
Private contractors have long been part of the American way of war .
However , things changed significantly , quantitatively if not qualitatively , after the fall of the Soviet empire .
The U.S. military had already gone to a professional volunteer military in the 1970s  in part to defuse domestic opposition to the Vietnam war on college campuses , which actually worked pretty well .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , when traditional large - scale warfare seemed unlikely in the near future , the active military was downsized and greater emphasis was placed on making it technologically competent as a force multiplier .
Concurrent with these developments was a shift in the definition of combatant and non-combatant necessitated by the introduction of a lot more women into the military than had been the case before .
Since the decision had been made not to use women in direct combat roles and the dividing line between combat and non-combat is sometimes less than bright in an actual battle , that question is not settled as definitively as the authorities pretend it is .
Is an intelligence officer called in to interrogate a prisoner who has just been captured a combatant or a non-combatant ?
In most such cases he or she will be close enough to the battlefield as to be vulnerable to a misfired ( or well - aimed ) mortar round , but since interrogators arent expected to fire back , they re usually considered non-combatants .
Traveling on a road in Iraq is generally not considered to be combat duty , but driving on Iraqi roads has turned out to be one of the most dangerous things soldiers can do .
So the question is still a bit unsettled .
The introduction of the all - volunteer military and the integration of more women into the military are related .
Without conscription it has been necessary to recruit quite a few women to meet recruiting quotas .
But the perceived need to keep them in non-combat roles has been a factor in the redefinition of the concept of combatant .
When the military was made up largely of conscripts who were expected to serve their two - year hitch and go back home , and were therefore not highly trained , it made a fair amount of sense to have them peeling potatoes , cleaning up the camp , cooking , running supply trains , and performing other support services that were fairly often far from the frontlines .
As the concept of the volunteer professional military evolved , with those who volunteered generally expected to stay for a considerable period of time if not for the full 20 years it takes to make a " career , " it made less sense to have this limited pool of people , who were expected to be more intensively trained in combat - related skills , performing supposedly menial but necessary tasks .
Thus the notion of privatizing the delivery of some of these services , which also correlated with Reagan - era friendliness toward the concept of privatization in general , came to seem attractive .
Blackwater USA was founded in 1997 , initially as a state - of - the - art firing range to be rented both by the military and civilian law enforcement entities .
Founder Erik Prince , who reaped many millions when his family business in Michigan was sold , was also politically connected  an enthusiastic evangelistic - oriented conservative Republican who had actually spent some time in special forces , so the company started to get more government contracts .
After 9/11 , however , the private military - oriented contracting business , which includes not only Blackwater but Halliburton , Fluor , DynCorp , Triple Canopy and others , really bloomed .
This had something to do with Don Rumsfelds insistence that the army of the future was a lean , mean , technological fighting machine at the same time the administration decided to undertake an open - ended invasion of Iraq .
Nearly every authority , military or civilian , I talked to in the months leading up to the invasion said the ideal size of such an invading army should be in the 300,000 to 500,000 range , not so much for the initial invasion ( though it might well have been a harder fight than it turned out to be ) as for the aftermath .
Unless we planned to attack , win , track down Saddam and be out by Christmas ( which Rumsfeld might have thought was the plan ) , the force of 170,000 or so would be insufficient for the occupation phase , as it has proven to be .
That made it all the more important to use private contractors in technically non-combat roles , and inexorably  especially given the fuzziness of the lines  in roles that approached closer and closer to actual combat and in some cases can sensibly only be called combat roles .
This creates problems , of course .
The private contractors  especially when they are working for the State Department rather than for the military itself , as was the case with the Blackwater employees involved in the September 16 shootings that have precipitated so much concern  have not been integrated into the military chain of command .
So you have private contractors  and CIA operatives tool let us not forget  running around an ill - defined battlefield but not subject to military command or military discipline .
Perhaps its a minor miracle that more outrages havent occurred .
We had better hope the government learns from mistakes made in Iraq some improved methods of holding private contractors accountable , because theres little chance the imperial vision of the United States is going to be downsized in the near future  though it may turn its fiery eye on places like Darfur or Burma under the next president .
Since the military is already having trouble recruiting enough people to fill its quotas now , expect the government to continue using private contractors  perhaps even more of them  to carry out its imperial tasks .
ALL OF the approaches to interrogation supported by President Bush as " nontorture " ( head slapping , freezing temperatures , water boarding ) qualify as torture under international law ( " Bush backs interrogation of suspects , " Page A2 , Oct. 6 ) .
During my last year in Vietnam , 1968 to ' 69 , I was in charge of US Air Force interrogation of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army prisoners .
None of what Bush labels as legal was legal under the Geneva Conventions , to which the United States is still a signatory .
US Army , Marine , and Army of Republic of Vietnam personnel were constantly amazed at the interrogation results produced by the Air Force , and we were never allowed to touch prisoners , let alone head - slap them .
Every human being has needs , and we learned those needs and exploited them .
Neither Bush 's bullying approach in the Mideast nor his unlawful interrogation program has worked .
Sophisticated psychological methods are not being used by the Bush people , so the alleged " nontorture " bullying will continue .

A submarine of the Spanish navy suddenly surfaces and collides with Endesa Ceuta , taking part in the Vuelta España a Vela .
Alicante , 14 September 2007 .

It 's not a joke .
It took place on Friday afternoon , during the 4th leg of the Vuelta España a Vela ( Spain Sailing Tour ) , from Cartagena to Alicante .
While the fleet was approaching Alicante , a submarine suddenly surfaced in front of Endesa - Ceuta .
The yacht managed to avoid a head on collision but the extent of damages suffered is not clear .
Unfortunately , the photo is fuzzy but the photographer , like the rest of the participants , was caught by surprise .
Obviously , nobody was expecting to see a submarine surface in front of them .
The Vuelta de España a Vela ( Spain Sailing Tour ) is the annual regatta co-organized by RFEV , Vuelta España a Vela SL , Deporevents and CNEV in order for the latter to fulfill its obligations under the Deed of Gift .

It ’s a story that virtually begs for the “ only - in - Santa - Cruz ” eye - roll treatment – another item in a wave of wackiness over the years that has painted the beach town , fairly or not , as nuttier than a bowl of granola .
Only this time , it might actually be true – the “ only - in - Santa - Cruz ” part , at least .
That ’s because two cherished progressive ideals – smoking bans and medicinal marijuana – have collided in a cloud of , well , smoke .
The city last year banned smoking in two city parks , citing the threat to public health .
The city also is on record in support of the local group that distributes medicinal marijuana .
That group ’s annual festival is coming up – noon to 5 p.m. , Sept. 29 – and some of the members might need to “ medicate ” during the festivities .
The problem :
The festival is in San Lorenzo Park , one of the parks with a no -smoking ban .
The solution ?
Rescind the law for a day .
The city passed a unanimous resolution last week to do just that .
But wait , do n’t pack the bong in the backpack just yet .
“ This is not Golden Gate Park , and it ’s not 1964 , ” said Valerie Corral , co-founder of the Wo / Men ’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana .
“ It ’s not going to be a big smoke - out . ”
Small smoking tent
She said the festival – meant to be a celebration of the support the group has received – will be a no-smoking event .
A small tent will be set up for WAMM members to repair to if they need to partake .
Others who light up – either tobacco or grass – will be asked to put it out .
“ This event has very little to do with smoking and very much to do with thanking the community , ” Corral said .
There will be food vendors and music , and admission is free .
Corral added , “ We wanted to go through the system to get the approval to let our members medicate if they need to . ”
She acknowledged that those who do n’t know much about WAMM might think it ’s a scam to get around marijuana laws .
But WAMM does n’t buy or sell marijuana ; it grows and distributes it for free to its 250 members – 80 percent of whom , Corral said , are terminally ill .
Lenient attitude
Santa Cruz police spokesman Zach Friend said there will be no special patrols for the festival .
That ’s probably not surprising , given that city voters in 2006 directed the police to treat pot smoking as its lowest enforcement priority .
Which begs the question :
If a pot smoker and a cigarette smoker were caught puffing in a park , who would be cited ?
“ Both , ” Friend said .
“ It ’s an ordinance against smoking , period . ”
As for the dangers of second - hand smoking to festival - goers , that ’s what the tent is for .
It will be constructed so the smoke is ventilated up and away from the crowd – to the dismay of some , perhaps .
Toilet themed restaurants are not new in Taiwan ; it has been around since 2004 or earlier , with people dining in a toilet like ambience and eating from mini toilet bowl .
I always thought that the business idea wo n’t last long ; but with the huge exposures by media and bloggers … seems that these eateries are becoming a bizarre food icon from Taiwan , something like fugu in Japan and live octopus in Korea .
Below are pictures from Modern Toilet , a food chain that operates 12 toilet themed restaurants in Taiwan ; these pics are from its outlet in Shilin , Taipei …
I would certainly visit one of these restaurants if I visit Taiwan ; not sure if I could consume all the food though … the sh!t ice cream seems a bit too much lol .

A teenage student has become the latest victim in Dallas to die from a powerful and highly addictive new street drug known as ' cheese ' .
The rise of the drug , a mixture of black tar heroin and powdered headache tablets , has been described as an epidemic .
Dealers often sell it at $ 2 a time to get youngsters hooked .
Because it is snorted , teenagers do not realise they are taking such a lethal heroin - based drug .
Since 2005 at least 23 teenagers in the Texan city have died after taking cheese , so called because it resembles crumbled Parmesan .
The latest victim was 18 - year - old Scott Clark , a volunteer for a local animal charity and a fitness fanatic .
The drug is mass produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border in increasing quantities .
The authorities are so concerned that a special regional ' cheese task force ' has been set up to tackle the problem .
Sergeant Jeremy Liebbe said : ' To market heroin to kids , you 've got to get rid of the needle because even the hardcore cheese users that we 've identified and brought into custody have said " I would n't stick a needle in me to get high , but I 'll snort it up my nose " .
The deaths have been almost split 50 - 50 between Hispanic and white youths .
The vast majority of the victims have been boys .
Only two girls have died from the drug .
Zachary Thompson , director of Dallas County Health and Human Services , said : ' We 've had this drug in the community for some time and did n't recognise it at first .
Cheese heroin has been the most instantly addictive and deadliest drug that we have seen since the crack cocaine epidemic . '
TomP's Diary :
Yesterday , John Edwards criticized the corporate nature of the Clinton campaign and why it is the wrong way for Democrats .
John Edwards highlighted Senator Clinton 's chief advisor , Mark Penn , as a prime example :
" Bush has been a perfect example of cronyism , because Blackwater has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans and to President Bush .
I also saw this morning that Sen.
Clinton 's primary adviser , Mark Penn , who is like her Karl Rove – his firm is representing Blackwater .
I think it is important for Iowa caucus - goers to understand the choices they have in this election .
And it is the reason I continue to say we do n't want to replace a group of corporate Republicans with a group of corporate Democrats . "
Ben Smith ( quoting John Edwards )
Mark Penn has sought to clarify his company 's role with Blackwater :
Burson says its subsidiary , BKSH & Associates , run by GOP operative Charlie Black , " helped Blackwater prepare for their recent hearing before Congress .
With the hearing over , BKSH 's temporary engagement has ended . "
Ari Berman , The Nation
Okay , so his company 's subsidiary prepared Blackwater to testify before Congress .
Hmmm .
And they wo n't do it again , right ?
Not until next time , anyway .
And tell me , why do you need a PR firm to tell the truth to Congress ?
Who is Mark Penn and why is he important ?
But perhaps the most important figure in the campaign is her pollster and chief strategist , Mark Penn , a combative workaholic .
Penn is not yet a household name , but perhaps he should be .
Inside Hillaryland , he has elaborately managed the centrist image Hillary has cultivated in the Senate .
The campaign is polling constantly , and Penn 's interpretation of the numbers will in large part decide her political direction .
Yet Penn is no ordinary pollster .
Beyond his connections to the Clintons , he not only polls for America 's biggest companies but also runs one of the world 's premier PR agencies .
snip
Morris knew Penn from his days as a pollster in New York and brought him into the White House .
Morris decided what to poll and Penn polled it .
They immediately pushed Clinton to the right , enacting the now - infamous strategy of " triangulation , " which co-opted Republican policies like welfare reform and tax cuts and emphasized small - bore issues that supposedly cut across the ideological divide .
" They were the ones who said ' Make the '96 election about nothing except V - Chips and school uniforms , ' " says a former Clinton adviser .
When Morris got caught with a call girl , Penn became the most important adviser in Clinton 's second term .
" In a White House where polling is virtually a religion , " the Washington Post reported in 1996 , " Penn is the high priest . "
He became known as the " most powerful man in Washington you 've never heard of . "
Spinning Hillary Centrist
The man with the polls tells Hillary what to say and how to say it .
Hiding corporate policies under the pablum of poll - tested platitudes .
PR firms do that every day for corporations .
Just ask Labor about Mark Penn :
" Learning that Mark Penn was CEO of a company that in fact conducts some of its business busting unions was very , very problematic to the AFL - CIO , as well as to many other unions , and we made that clear " to the Clinton campaign , said Karen Ackerman , AFL - CIO political director .
" This is an issue that continues . "
Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in a statement : " We have expressed our concerns to Sen. Clinton about Mark Penn and his firm 's work for anti-union companies .
We value Sen. Clinton 's commitment to strengthen America 's middle class .
But as long as Mark Penn continues to profit from his company 's involvement with anti-union companies , this issue will not go away . "
LA Times
One of labor 's bigger irritations with the Clinton campaign has been the role of chief strategist Mark J. Penn , who has remained worldwide president & CEO of Burson - Marsteller , the global public relations and public affairs firm .
One of the B - M clients most despised by labor is Cintas Corp. , which is the largest uniform supplier in North America and say it clothes 5 million people for work each day .
snip
With Burson - Marsteller 's assistance , Cintas has staved off a push to unionize its workforce , and the public relations firm 's website at one point boasted of its work in parrying union pressure .
Ben Smith's Blog
You cannot ask Eleazar Torres - Gomez about Burson 's work for Cinitas in fighting unionization , a union that would have forced the company to obey safety rules , because he 's dead :
Eleazar Torres - Gomez was pronounced dead on the scene after apparently being dragged by a conveyor into an industrial dryer .
Torres - Gomez was trapped in the dryer — which can reportedly reach temperatures of 300 degrees — for at least 20 minutes .
Cincinnati Beacon
A particularly brutal way to die .
And Cinitas had been repeatedly fined by OSHA for the same safety violations that killed Mr. Torres - Gomez .
" Federal safety officials have called for a $ 2.78 million penalty against the Cintas Corporation , the nation 's largest supplier of uniforms , for violations at its Tulsa plant , where a worker died when he was pulled into a large dryer
Representative Phil Hare , Democrat of Illinois , said yesterday , " OSHA 's findings prove that Cintas inaction led to the death of Mr. Torres Gomez despite the company 's ridiculous allegations that he tried to commit suicide or was too stupid to operate the machinery . "
NY Times
Hmm . Cinitas spin .
It 's enough to kill .
Cintas spokeswoman Pamela Lowe said it was Cintas ' main public relations agency , doing " a wide range of corporate communications for us . "
" I 'll tell you that Cintas is pleased with the work that Burson has done , " she said .
LA Times
Connect the dots .
Triangulation .
Union Busting .
Blackwater .
Here 's another : The Security Industrial State Lobbyists Paying for Future " Access " to Hillary Clinton :
Just days after the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks , Hillary Clinton and several Democratic lawmakers will be getting uncomfortably cozy with moneyed interests who have stood to reap billions in post - 9/11 homeland security spending , watchdog groups say .
Edwards Campaign Calls Out Clinton for Lobbyist Fundraiser Today ( quoting abc news )
No amount of PR can hide the truth .
Mr. Torres - Gomez ' son Emmanuel Torres - Gomez testifying before a Congressional committte :
On March 6 , 2007 , my father was killed while working at a Cintas laundry in Tulsa , Oklahoma .
He was reportedly dragged into an industrial dryer by a conveyor belt .
This has been devastating for us .
In 2005 , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Cintas for not putting guards on a dryer at a laundry in New York .
The equipment that was unguarded in that case was similar to the equipment involved in my father 's death .
If the company had added the guards , which it knew was required by OSHA , my father would be alive today ...
My father 's death was preventable .
My Father 's Death was Preventable
Please also check out Uniform Justice .
Do what you can to help the Teamsters and UniteHere unionize Cinitas and prevent another horrific death like that suffered by Eleazar Torres - Gomez .
Which side will The Democratic Party be on ?
The Side of Money or the Side of The People ?
John Edwards is right :
" we do n't want to replace a group of corporate Republicans with a group of corporate Democrats . "
For some , it may be a matter of life and death .
" There 's peer pressure and then there 's Army pressure "
SignOnSanDiego :
Legislation that could grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented high school graduates is creating a schism among Latino educators and others who have typically favored legalization efforts .
At issue is a component of the Development , Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act , or DREAM Act , a bill that could be voted on in the Senate by next week as an amendment to a Department of Defense authorization bill .
The proposed legislation , a version of which was first introduced in 2001 , would make high school graduates who arrived in the United States illegally at 15 or younger and who have lived here at least five years , eligible for conditional legal status provided they attend two years of college or serve two years in the military .
After six years , those who meet the conditions could obtain legal permanent resident status .
It is the military service component that has landed some Latino supporters of legalization measures on the same side of the proposal as the immigration restriction lobby , which decries the DREAM Act as amnesty .
Those uncomfortable with the military component see the measure as a devil 's bargain :
On one hand , it offers a shot at higher education and success to young people who might otherwise have to spend their lives in the shadows .
On the other , they fear that those who can't afford college , or do n't see it as a viable choice , might feel compelled to join the military not because they want to , but because they fear eventual deportation .
EVERY day , economy watchers are bombarded with seemingly contradictory indicators .
Inflation is either contained , or it's about to explode .
The price of oil is poised to drop , or to spiral higher .
Lately , we 've received seemingly contradictory figures on a crucial statistic : productivity .
When the growth rate of productivity -- the amount of output an hour the economy can produce -- falls sharply , it 's frequently a sign that dreaded inflation could be on the rise .
When productivity growth rises smartly , it may indicate that companies are figuring out how to make more goods and services while keeping costs under control .
That 's why Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve chairman , closely watches the productivity figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Over his 18 - year tenure , Mr. Greenspan has managed to puzzle most observers with Fedspeak -- a monotone patois that conveys small amounts of information in convoluted , carefully hedged sentences .
But when he appeared before Congress in July , Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he was a little puzzled by the recent productivity figures .
" The traditional measure of the growth in output per hour , " he said , " has slowed sharply in recent quarters . "
( Translation : productivity growth is way down , look out for inflation . )
" But , " he continued , " a conceptually equivalent measure that uses output measured from the income side has slowed far less . "
( Translation : maybe not . )
The " traditional measure " to which Mr. Greenspan referred is nonfarm business productivity .
This broad measure of the economy calculates productivity based on examining the output and production of the vast American corporate sector .
And as Mr. Greenspan noted , that figure had fallen sharply in recent quarters .
The year - over - year growth rate of nonfarm business productivity fell from an impressive 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2004 to a less impressive 2.3 percent in the second quarter of 2005 .

It 's about the international fiat monetary regime 's denouement , and of course the Ron Paul presidential campaign .
Even the popular name of this " crisis " — implying that the whole problem is " subprime " borrowers with sketchy credit histories — is really just more disinformation .
Shaky American borrowers defaulting on their home loans are indeed a great danger , but in the same way that a free press is a danger to despotic government .
It is the danger of exposure .
It is the end of plausible deniability .
If the " markets " of the world perceive — finally — that the emperor has no clothes , the nearly century old game may be over .
First , a little background .
Forgive all the quotation marks , but it 's important to maintain a healthy skepticism when considering this subject .
When a " lender " ( usually a bank ) makes a " loan " to a " borrower , " the borrower executes a legal instrument known as a " note , " sometimes also called a " bond . "
The " note " or " bond " is the borrower 's promise to repay the " loan " at such and such an interest rate , over such and such a period of time , consisting of monthly payments in such and such an amount .
There 's a lot more to explain here , but first , before we go there , pull out your wallet and take a look at any currency you have in there .
You will notice that the currency is also called a " note . "
Just like the " note " the " borrower " executes to the " lender , " the currency is a promise to pay , but in the case of currency it is minus the interest rate or period of time .
Currency notes are " payable to the bearer on demand , " also called " bearer paper " and " demand notes . "
But if one kind of note functions as currency — money , really — why can't another ?
Why indeed .
No reason at all .
In fact , since in the absence of a gold standard currency " notes " are ultimately unredeemable promises , other kinds of notes are arguably better than currency .
Particularly if they are " backed " by something of " tangible " value — like , say , real estate — which is something government currency can't claim .
This reasoning — and it is valid reasoning — led to a state of affairs in which home mortgage loan paper ( the " notes " ) , primarily from the United States , began to " circulate , " just as currency circulates among individuals .
This paper , and derivatives of it like CDO 's , mortgage - backed securities , CLO's , SIV's , have by now gone all over the world and for all intents and purposes function as " money " in the world 's banking systems , constituting financial " assets " on their books .
The nominal aggregate value of all this American mortgage loan paper is many , many trillions of dollars .
This actually — and somewhat ironically — dwarfs the nominal value of all official but un - backed US government paper currency in circulation .
Notice I say " nominal " value .
This is important .
Because while the essence of the international fiat monetary regime is that nothing can have a fixed , permanent or finally determined value , everything must have a " nominal " value , otherwise buying and selling — that is , trade and economic activity itself — would be impossible .
Yet the " market , " like the human beings who comprise it , craves precisely assets of a fixed , permanent and finally determined value .
This is the basis of the great financial asset game of the 20th century just past : the hoi polloi chasing and acquiring assets they believe to be of permanent value ; and the rulers — sometimes slowly , sometimes abruptly — then destroying the value of those assets , in part because not to do so would undercut the regime itself .
The regime is a jealous god .
So the home loans of the hoi polloi , and the homes themselves " backing " the loans , were eventually transformed into " financial assets " like everything else , then sold and marketed all over the world at their nominal value .
The current " crisis " is the result of this nominal value being called into question and tested at its very foundation , through the only true " mark - to - market " events that can ever apply to such assets : default , foreclosure and auction of the " collateral " — the homes of the " borrowers . "
The problem is , if there 's one thing we 've learned in the world of financial assets over the last 20 years or so , it is this : the process of questioning and testing their value invariably reveals a cesspool of scandal and fraud .
Mortgage - backed paper is no different .
In truth , lenders have been systematically concealing the market value of this paper through a fairly simple and universal manipulation of the foreclosure process : when a property is foreclosed and " publicly " auctioned , the lender itself bids in the amount it claims to be owed at the auction , thus insuring that there is never a loss on the loan itself , since the loan is always " paid in full " at the auction .
When it is the successful bidder — as it almost always is — the lender then winds up owning the property .
When the property is finally sold by the lender , there is normally a loss ; but technically , that is not a loss on the loan itself .
That does not damage the value of the original " paper . "
In this way mortgage paper and its many derivatives can be and have been marketed as very " safe " investments , providing a " good return " with " no risk of loss . "
But of course there is no such thing .
There is a risk of loss ; it has just been hidden .
Now that risk is materializing .
As defaults and foreclosures increase , the lenders have to pay out more and more to hide the losses .
But the lenders can only make this up by making more loans , because this is how they increase their cash flow ; and now it is clear they can make more loans , and thereby increase their cash flow only by simultaneously increasing their losses , since their " loans " are proving to be losers .
So no one wants their " paper " anymore , because — well — it 's the financial equivalent of toxic waste .
The " subprime " stuff is just the first surge : the tidal wave is close behind .
Because all of it , the subprime , the prime , the AAA and everything in between , is the product of a previously hidden , but now obvious … Ponzi scheme .
A Ponzi scheme that is in the process of unraveling , as all Ponzi schemes eventually do .
And what person wants to be the last idiot to buy into a Ponzi scheme ?
So now the lenders are squeezed on all sides : they have defaults bubbling up from underneath ; they can't access credit on their now questionable paper ; and it appears their whole business is structurally geared to lose money .
One by one they begin firing their CEO's , warning their investors ( closing the barn door after the horses are gone , but what else is new ? ) , being investigated , probed , etc .
We all know the drill .
Some very big names are already involved .
This is all supposedly " very scary . "
The credit markets are " seizing up . "
The Federal Reserve is doing this and that , but even they can't fix problems in the tens of trillions of dollars .
Oh sure , they can goose the stock market , but only temporarily .
They put the money in but it all comes back out within a few days .
The whole idea is just to get the lemmings to jump in after them .
But it only takes what — $ 40 billion max ? — to pull that stunt .
The mortgage backed paper problem is many , many times bigger , and can't be solved in a few days of goosing .
Now .
Why is all this a threat to the international monetary regime ?
It 's really very simple : debt cannot be money , this whole debacle is showing emphatically that debt cannot be money .
But the regime is built entirely on the principle that debt is money .
It 's an elegant deception .
In the world of accounting , my debt is an " asset " on the books of my creditor .
There is nothing really wrong with looking at it this way , and indeed it is a useful fiction to " account " for economic relationships .
But we can not lose sight of the fact that it is a fiction .
A " receivable " based upon someone 's promise to pay is not the equivalent of a hard asset that does not depend upon someone 's promise .
A " promise to pay " cannot be " payment " — by definition .
But because the regime says otherwise a worldwide home mortgage paper market with a nominal value in the tens of trillions of dollars — all debt — exists , though it appears not for much longer .
And compared with that market the Federal Reserve System itself , with all of its regional branches , its Board of Governors , its " congressional mandate , " its annual reports and so on , is a mere trifle .
We could so easily be rid of it .
And that brings us to Ron Paul .
Talk about being in the right place at the right time .

I am never disappointed in the unadulterated stupidity of our " elected " officials .
If you will recall all the way back to November of 2006 the United States held an election .
It made all the papers .
The People spoke more clearly than ever in voting in a Democratic congress with a clear mandate to end the war in Iraq and get out .
Congress being what it is , this mandate was simply brushed aside with all the relevance of last week ’s bucket of fish heads .
Let me put this as plain as possible .
The United States Congress wants war… with Iran .
Emulating the Bush / Cheney democratic double dictatorship , AIPAC and all the little Neocon weevils infesting our golden fields of grain , congress prefers to shoot first and think later … if at all .
Nothing you or I can do will stop it .
We are all statistical hanging chads in the minds of our " elected officials . "
Well congress has just crossed the Rubicon … again .
On Wednesday , September 26 , 2007 by a vote of 76 to 22 the Senate approved a resolution known as the Lieberman - Kyl Amendment urging the Bush administration to declare Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards ’ Quds Force a " terrorist organization . "
This resolution frees congress from any accountability in the next step toward Armageddon .
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards may not be our best friends , but they are not terrorists either .
Let ’s not kid ourselves here .
Diplomacy be damned .
A green light to push the red button is exactly what Bush and Cheney have wanted for some time .
The only thing holding it up has been the manipulation of public opinion .
It takes time to demonize Mahmoud Ahmadinejad into the next Saddam .
Fortunately for Bush / Cheney , Mahmoud has been making it easy .
Well now they have it .
This Senate resolution amounts to nothing more than Congressional approval for our Decider in Chief to bomb the hell out of Iran .
This of course will necessitate a follow up of " peacekeeping forces " to maintain law and order in the destroyed infrastructure on the streets of Tehran .
Oh yes … they ’ll need to spread more " democracy " like as in Iraq as well .
It also opens the door wider for the Executive Branch to label any disobedient faction a " terrorist organization " as a prelude to illegal invasion without any congressional approval at all … not that that was ever an obstacle .
Oppose the U.S. imperial agenda , get branded a " terrorist organization " and face the music of obliteration .
Your little pathetic rogue state claims the U.S. can not win wars ?
All too true .
But they sure as hell can destroy whoever stands in their way .
Best to toe the line .
And just who is going to " keep the peace " after the destruction of Iran ?
Who shall provide the liberation from another regime change at the barrel of an Abrams tank ?
The U.S. Military ?
The National Guard ?
Oh sure , they ’ve done an exemplary job in Iraq .
All we need is to up their tours of duty a bit .
Twelve months to fifteen months was insufficient .
How about a nice round figure of twenty - four months to win hearts and minds ?
Better make sure each and every U.S. soldier gets a month R&R and psychological therapy in between tours .
We must support the troops … at all costs .
But the U.S. will need a few more than the 160,000 troops currently deployed in Iraq .
Those lucky freedom fighters ai n’t going nowhere fast .
The answer is easy .
Blackwater has n’t been kicked out of Iran yet even though they are unlikely to ever leave Iraq where they have been kicked out .
Send Blackwater in .
Bush had better ask for another $ 200 billion to pay for it .
That should be easy .
The congressional rubber stamp is ready and waiting … as always .
And when all else fails … as it surely will …
The U.S. can institute mandatory conscription .
But whatever they do … it cannot be called a " draft . "
That ’s too medieval !
I like : " Compulsory Democratic Liberation Volunteering . "
It ’s a much better iSlogan .
What ’s going to pay for the next U.S. Imperial Adventure ?
Iranian oil ?
Do n’t make me laugh .
Once the Revolutionary Guard is disbanded … for being a " terrorist organization " and out of work , they ’ll have nothing better to do than … uh… become " terrorists " and take pot shots at anyone and everyone … particularly if they have a U.S. Flag flying from their Standards .
That Iranian oil wo n’t flow into U.S pocketbooks any faster than the Iraqi oil .
So that means Bush , Cheney and their Congress of Fools will do what they always do … take out another mortgage on our country .
Just how long do they think the sub - prime US borrower can defer payments before China forecloses ?
Best to brush up on your Mandarin .
At least enroll your kids in Chinese language lessons .
They ’ll need the skill while they sneak into Shanghai illegally to wash dishes , dig coal , work in the rice paddies all day and do basic housekeeping chores in order to pay for your twenty - four hour hospice care .
Oh , and let us not forget the other recent big Senatorial blunder ( I know , there have been too many to count ) .
In a " non-binding " resolution ( that gets them off the hook on this one too ) the Senate voted 75 - 23 to carve up Iraq into Sunni , Shi’ite and Kurdish regions .
It reminds one of the 1916 Sykes - Picot Agreement .
Once again the West has decided it has the power and right to hack up the Middle East as it sees fit .
What , the Iraqis ca n’t do this themselves ?
It seems they ’ve been making this decision despite the U.S. occupation for some time .
So why do they need our approval or help ?
Let ’s try to ignore the fact that Iran will probably rush in and take over the Shi’ite region .
In other words … the Lieberman - Kyl Amendment fits in nicely .
Turkey will capture Kurdistan under the guise of defeating their pet " terrorist organization " the Kurdistan Worker ’s Party , PKK , another desperate group defending their homeland from a stronger oppressor .
What both Iran and Turkey really want is our oil … er… I mean Iraq ’s oil .
Only God can imagine what the fate of the poor Sunni region will be , an extended Saudi Arabian welfare state ?
How stupid can the members of congress be ?
Never mind .
The question is rhetorical and the answer obvious .
After spending their entire careers studying the art of public manipulation and perception management , also known as " lying " and " campaigning , " collectively congress has no scruples left .
No common sense .
No understanding of cause and effect .
No respect for anyone or anything other than the all mighty … well , not so mighty anymore … dollar .
Learning from history ?
Why bother ?
We make up our own reality and write our own versions of history as we go .
When it gets right down to it , few members of congress , especially the senate , would dare risk killing their shot at POTUS .
That ’s the big pie in the sky for them all .
Now that the Executive Branch has been rendered a virtual dictatorship our " elected officials " must be drooling uncontrollably at the chunk of unitary executive meat hanging before their chompers .
Who wants to be the next Caesar… or Augustus … or Tiberius … or Caligula , Claudius , Nero ?
We can expect a long sequence of mad Emperors lusting for more blood .
I give up .
There is no point in deluding myself anymore .
Congress wants war with Iran as badly as George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Norman Podhoretz , Rudy Giuliani , Hillary , Barack Obama , AIPAC or… the list goes on and on .
All options may be on the table but our " esteemed " members of congress are quickly painting themselves into the corner furthest from that table leaving one option :
War with Iran .
Remember , congress answers to the call of the puppet masters holding the campaign contributions , powerful lobbies and big business … not We The People .

Rick was both a principal sponsor and a major financial supporter of the successful Washington state marijuana legalization initiative approved by the voters of his state in 2012 , making Washington , along with Colorado , the first two states to end criminal prohibition and replace it with a legal regulated system .
What are illegal drugs , except another commodity to be traded ?
Either our drugs policy is stupid or crafty .
I suspect the latter .
Stupid - if it believes that sending troops abroad to eradicate crops would stop drugs coming in .
The evidence in Afghanistan and Colombia proves that it has the reverse effect .
Crafty - if , under the guise of ' eradication ' or a ' war on drugs ' , it actually ' secures ' control of illegal supplies and is able to maximise profits by keeping these cheap foreign - made drugs expensive so they do n't compete with medicines produced in the UK .
It is feeble minded to suppose that today 's British elites take no pointers from our historic past or have suddenly become disinterested in margins ...
As with so much of the debate on Comment is Free , the media 's framing of discussion of UK involvement in Afghanistan assumes an alruistic intent that was never there in the first place .
A more likely scenario is that our troops are doing great work internationally ... to support our commercial interests .
Leading UK companies produce OIL , GUNS and DRUGS .
To put the following in perspective , BP 's reported profits were about £ 10 billion in 2005 .
Here are some figures for the heroin trade from Afghanistan , rounded up / down for simplicity and extrapolated from government and UN figures .
1000g opium from Afghan Farmer costs £ 50
1g street heroin from UK dealer costs £ 50
1000g opium makes around 150g pure heroin
or 375g street heroin ( 40 % pure )
Afghan Farmer gets £ 50 for 1000g opium
UK street seller collects £ 18,750 for 375g heroin
Afghan Farmer sees just 0.26 % of the final sale value
The sale value of heroin in UK is 375 x the cost of
basic raw material ( opium ) needed to make it .
4200 tonnes opium produced in Afghanistan in 2004
from which 650 tonnes pure heroin may be made
Cost to buy in Afghanistan = £ 210 million
Can make 1600 tonnes street heroin ( 40 % pure )
Street value in UK / Europe = £ 80 billion
Opium production under Taliban in 2001 = 185 tonnes
Opium production under Karzai in 2004 = 4200 tonnes

Last week , a senior member of the warez scene took part in a rare interview .
In it , he reveals some interesting things about this shadowy world but the question is :
Did he reveal too much ?
MPAA pirate - chasing lawyer Espen Tondel now says that The Scene will be " brought to justice " .
We ’ve carried articles in the past about the Scene .
So legend goes , these people are ultra-secretive but of course there ’s always a few who like to talk , despite being targeted by law enforcement in cases such as Operation Fastlink and Operation Buccaneer .
Last week , an administrator of a Topsite ( an important guy , near to the top of the so - called ‘ Piracy Pyramid ‘ ) linked to some very famous release groups , broke cover in a very rare interview with Trond Bie of itavisen .
no , seemingly giving away quite a few secrets such as the security techniques used by the Scene and the locations of some of their servers .
He also explains why the Scene dislikes torrents and sites like The Pirate Bay , and reveals how some torrent sites manage to get Scene releases so quickly .
In the interview , the Site - Op mocks the efforts of Norwegian police in trying to shutdown the Norwegian Scene , joking that Norwegian law prevents them from being caught in the traditional ways .
This attitude could ’ve been the thing that attracted the eye of Espen Tondel , the aggressive MPAA / IFPI lawyer who also talked about action against torrent sites recently .
RayJoha , a reader of TorrentFreak who did a lot of work on this article , contacted Tondel and asked him a few questions which you can read at the bottom of this article .
The Interview ( translation from Norwegian , courtesy RayJoha )
The guy we talked to is one of the few administrators of a Topsite in Norway .
He ’s in his mid twenties , is a student of programming and has been a part of the Scene for many years .
He first became a Topsite Site - Op in 2003 and has since been responsible for adding users , banning ruleset violators and programming automating IRC - scripts .
In addition to being a Site - Op he also has his own home - based server where he downloads movies , games and TV - shows to and from the Topsites .
He has a very fast Internet connection which make it possible to download a DVD movie in minutes .
Everybody keeps everybody informed
In addition to categories such as games , software , music and movies we have a news category on the Topsites warning against raids .
Lamers are also posted in this news category .
It ’s also possible to find out who leaks warez to trackers and the P2P community .
Those who leak will be banned from the Scene .
It is very easy for the police to find those people who are spreading torrents .
One of the reasons it is quite difficult to break the Scene is due to a very sophisticated security system .
The system we use on Topsites and IRC is SSL .
This comes on top of Blowfish - aggregation on IRC .
You have to log in to one of the Topsites to get the Blowkey password .
Without Blowkey everything will be encrypted .
The Topsites encrypt everything with SSL .
It ’s not unusual to have 30 TerraBytes of warez on a Topsite .
Last summer German police raided a Topsite which had 40 members .
The following was posted on Topsites news sections to warn the entire Scene , ( from German ) :
New police action in Germany .
This morning 40 members got a visit from the BKA , ( Bundes Kriminal Amt ) .
All user accounts etc… .
Everybody that has visited the site is in great danger !
I miss you
Laws must change ?
Changing the laws will have no effect .
The MP3 legislation … the only thing they do is make it difficult for ordinary downloaders / torrent users – those who download from a website , torrentsite , Limewire or with any other P2P software .
It would be easier for the government if the police could create their own ‘ entrapment servers ’ , but they could only hurt the Scene , not destroy it .
What ’s the probability of getting caught ?
HaHa , there ’s almost no chance of getting caught in Norway .
The Norwegian police cannot do anything illegal to get somebody .
By law , they can not set up servers to entice users to join .
All the users in the network know each other .
Members of the Scene have joined only through someone vouching for them .
I do it because it ’s a learning experience and fun .
I learn a lot about running servers , programming , ( C , C ++ , Java and scripting ) .
I started with this before I realized I could have a career in programming .
When you learn a few programming languages it ’s quite easy to pick up new ones .
His interest in file sharing has been there for years , but it took some time before he became a Topsite Site - Op .
He reveals that there are lot of Norwegian ISPs , especially those that deliver fiber connections , that have Topsite servers as customers .
The first time I became a Site - Op it was 2003 .
I started setting up servers on my own , but at that time we had no affiliation with the Scene .
There are lots of sites on Lyse , Hafslund and Sandefjord and I also know that servers are found around university campuses .
The Site - Op tells us that he has no plans of quitting piracy , even when he gets a real job in the software business .
It ’s real hard to catch pirates , i’ve learned .
I get to understand how it works , making it possible to protect myself against it .
Anything that comes to market is cracked even before we post it .
There ’s no point for the industry in spending millions on copy protection .
The social side of the Scene
Is there a social environment in the Scene or is it just IRC chatting all the time ?
Nobody sees anybody .
The IRC OPs knows who the others are , but normally we do n’t know who they are in real life .
We only use nick names .
The Site - Op feels it ’s easy to replace persons that are arrested in raids with some exceptions .
Game crackers [ people who remove copy protection ] ca n’t easily be replaced .
There ’s just a few people with their skills around .
It ’s correct that you ca n’t easily replace a cracker , it ’s a real genius game .
Sometimes we might lose everyone , but they ’re real hard to catch .
Let ’s say they manage to cripple the Game - Scene , but they still have to deal with movies and music , and thats something Mr. anybody can do .
[ Rip movies and music ]
The FBI are allowed to set up fake servers , but they are not successful in their endeavors .
If the Norwegian police are going to catch anyone they have to adopt the same strategy .
You ca n’t take down Topsites without resorting to illegality : they ’d have to distribute copyrighted material .
Actually doing something illegal .
note : strictly prohibited in Norway
Site - Op ’s responsibilities
I do n’t know any informants , but there is a strong possibility there are some .
If the Scene discovers this the individual will be banned with the help of Topsite news and barred from access to any resource within the Scene .
As a Site - Op he has a series of tasks perform in order for the site to work properly .
A Site - Op adds users and makes sure the ruleset are obeyed .
He ’s programming and scripting .
Linux servers are almost always running glftpd .
Pre-Information
The Site - Op is one of a selected few who has pre-information .
Pre-information is information about a specific warez that have n’t been shared with anyone yet .
The different groups , ( Razor1911 , Fairlight etc ) , have their own folders on the Topsites with not yet released content .
The competition is fierce when it comes to being the first to release a movie or a game .
When a “ ware ” is pre-released a so - called Race starts .
A Race means that every Topsite tries to be the first to distribute .
In this way the Scene is almost like an economy in itself .
First to market does n’t mean monetary survival but rather the gain of Respect .
There are unbelievably few people that has pre-information .
Only Admins can browse all Pre-folders .
One shouldn`t sneak a peak on a pre .
It ’s a rule not to browse on somebody else ’s folder .
The Site - Op ’s connections with the ‘ Big ’ people in the Scene
A Site - Op communicates with the real ‘ big - wigs ’ in the Scene – the ones that really puzzle the game and movie industries .
The largest groups use their own IRC servers to communicate , while the Topsites often use Linknet with SSL .
We are in direct contact with Fairlight and the others .
We talk to them on IRC .
A great proportion of them are Linknet .
The largest Topsites have their own servers giving them increased security .
Additionally , the Site - Op reveals that many Sceners post internal information on Wikipedia .
The scene harbours ill feelings towards the torrent community .
According to the Scene they are stealing their warez and posting it on trackers .
The Scene is of the opinion that it ’s real easy to bust people that posts warez on torrent sites like The Pirate Bay .
What happens is that people leak from the Scene to torrent sites just before a release .
That indicates that these lamers have access to early sites .
And if you are the one of those that does this you are categorized as an Insecure user and therefore banned from the Scene .
So , to be clear , this is the only connection we have to the torrent scene .
Dislike of The Pirate Bay
We , as Site - ops , have no fondness for The Pirate Bay .
We do not want to talk to the press because it pressures the police to focus on us .
As a software programmer I dislike file sharing , because of the small companies that suffers from it .
Members of the Scene learn a lot and find it to be a fun experience .
The top Sceners buy the music and the movies on DVD anyway .
As an example I have purchased , ( With money ) , FlashFXP to support the developers .
This is software I use a lot .
If you follow this thinking the best thing to do is to get rid of all the file sharers , mainly because it`s so insecure .
The police are able to just walk in and identify the sharers .
END
Q+A : Espen Tondel , MPAA / IFPI lawyer
Q : Is there anything in this interview that gives you tips on how to get these guys ?
Let me put it this way – we have a considerable amount of information about these sites .
We know how they work .
Q : Do you think this article [ the original interview ] will make it easier to bring the Norwegian Scene to justice , considering that he reveals what kind of software and which ISPs they ’re using ?
From my point of view the Norwegian Scene will be brought to justice , we possess a lot of information .
Q : Norway has always been at the forefront of technology development .
Do you think Hollywood should target Norway first ?
Norway is obviously a good place for tech development and we have necessary legislation hence Norway is a good place for pursuing these kind of activities .
We have the full backing of the Motion Picture Association in doing that .
Did this guy give away too many secrets or is Tondel simply bluffing ?
Time will tell .
Update : Some people are naturally questioning the authenticity of the guy claiming to be a Site - Op .
The author of the original article , Trond Bie from Norway ’s ITavisen has just confirmed that he conducted this interview at his home and all the time he was watching the Site - Op doing ‘ administrative stuff ’ on the topsite which he says , could n’t be mistaken for anything else .
Anyone who has dipped a toe in the wild and woolly currents of politics in the last thirty years should be familiar with the name of Richard Mellon Scaife .
As partisans go , there is n't anyone else willing to put so much of their money where their ideologies drive them , $ 340 million by some estimates .
Among the right - wing organizations substantially funded by Mr. Scaife are the Heritage Foundation , the American Enterprise Institute , Judicial Watch , Cato Institute and a working group within his American Spectator publication called the " Arkansas Project , " whose specific aim was to locate and create dirt on the Clintons in order to smear them , in hopes of removing Clinton from office .
Those rumors around Vince Foster 's suicide lay squarely on Scaife 's lap .
During the 2004 election cycle , Scaife had his targets set directly on the Kerrys ( and specifically Teresa Heinz Kerry ) , devoting a considerable sum to breaking open records to find dirt to smear the Democratic candidate through his wife .
Which makes this news story all that much more schadenfreude - licious .
Scaife is going through divorce proceedings from his wife , one that has provided lots of fodder for the gossip pages with arrests for trespassing , accusations of abuse and dognapping , of all things .
At issue now is how much of Scaife 's fortune is owed to his wife , and guess what ?
What 's good for the right wingnut gander is apparently not good for the rest of geese .
Scaife wants his records sealed and rival paper Pittsburgh Post - Gazette to return documents .
Mr. Scaife 's attempt to make court documents inaccessible is unusual for the head of a news organization .
Historically , newspapers and television stations have fought for greater rather than more restricted access .
In fact , Mr. Scaife 's Tribune - Review joined other organizations in seeking to unseal the estate records of the late Sen.
John Heinz during the presidential campaign of Sen. John F. Kerry , who is married to Sen .
Heinz 's widow , Teresa .[..]
Mr. Scaife 's attorneys say the Post - Gazette article describes " at length various highly confidential and personal matters contained in the record , none of which have any news value nor are legitimate subjects of public scrutiny . "
Karma , baby ...
George W. Bush is afraid of his own shadow .
No president , it seems , has ever been this terrified of the American people , this hidden away or secretive , this evasive in speech and behavior .
Not even Nixon , who at least faced the cameras , the reporters and the people even while his ship was going down .
But George W. Bush is so afraid of us that he can't bear to let us see him for what he is .
Thus , his fear is projected as strength or resolve .
Few are fooled any longer ( and , if so , they are indeed fools ) .
Sure as the Wizard of Oz cowered behind his curtain , our Commander in Chief is a coward .
Far be it from me to psychoanalyze why this is so .
Maybe it's as simple as his subconscious mind telling him he did n't " win " either election , that he 's not a " legitimate " president ( I 'm sure it goes far deeper than that ) .
Regardless of why this is so , his actions as President speak volumes .
One could amass a quick case study just from the public records of the past six years :
Bush spent his first few months in office hiding on his ranch , unable to face the enormous responsibilities of the Oval Office in person for longer than a few weeks at a time .
When terrorists struck on 9/11 , he froze in front of a classroom of tots , waiting for someone to tell him what to do .
He flew out of harm 's way and hid out for days before visiting the scenes of carnage .
Bush has held the fewest press conferences of any president in modern history .
Even when he does hold them , " journalists " like the male prostitute Jeff Gannon are " planted " in the audience to ask the easy questions ( e.g .
" How has your religious faith helped you in these times of peril , Mr. President ? " ) .
Too cowardly to fire his associates in person , he sends proxies like Karen Hughes and Karl Rove to do the job , or makes the lives of his maverick associates ( like Paul O'Neill and Colin Powell ) so miserable they resign , sparing him contact with people whose egos are more secure or less fractured than his own .
He refused to meet with Cindy Sheehan outside his ranch in August 2005 ( that and Katrina , soon thereafter , were the tipping points of his failed presidency ) .
And so on .
Most recently , it has come to light that the White House has a manual that provides detailed instructions to staff about " deterring potential protestors " from his public appearances , a policy in place since Oct. 2002 .
( Which , therefore , no longer makes his appearances " public , " but then Orwellian language rape is part of the coward 's package too ) .
At these " public " events , only ticket holders are allowed ; those with tickets are carefully screened .
If an " unscreened " person manages to get inside an event , " rally squads " are on hand to drown out lonely protesters ( " USA ! USA ! " ) or shield them from Bush 's eyes .
Any protesters outside the venue are cordoned off far from the event or Bush 's motorcade route .
This , again , is to prevent the Chicken In Chief from having to see them .
Thus , though America is inundated with anti-Bush bumperstickers , T - shirts , posters and billboards , there is a good chance Bush himself has never seen one of them .
Best ( or worst ) for last .
In a last ditch effort to rally a hostile public to support the war in Iraq , Bush has begun a massive media campaign , called " Freedom 's Watch . "
On all the campaign 's ads , a phone number is provided to connect you with your " members of Congress . "
My friend Nick called the number .
This is his account :
A very young - sounding girl answered and rapidly said , " Thank you for calling Freedom 's Watch .
Do you feel that abandoning our mission in Iraq will increase the threat of terror ? "
I said , " No . "
She said , " Thank you , " and hung up .

You have a good relationship , you love her , you ’ve been together for a while and you ’ve started thinking ( or she ’s started hinting ) that maybe she could be the one , maybe you should pop the question .
But you ’re not sure … it ’s a big step , a major change in your life .
It ’s one of the biggest decisions you can make in life .
Even if you get a divorce , the marriage will be part of you , and part of how people think of you .
So how do you know ?
How can you be sure that she ’s the one ?
A lot of things go into compatibility … it ’s impossible to list them all .
What follows is a list of some of the most important factors , things you should consider very seriously before proposing .
After you read and answer all these questions , you should have a pretty good idea as to the answer for the question “ Should I ask her to marry me ? ” :
Do you love her ?
This one is simple … do n’t get married to take care of her , or protect her , or because you feel sorry for her .
Only get married if you do , in fact , love her .
Do you miss her when you ’re away ?
If it ’s easy for you to be distracted and not think of her , if you do n’t miss her pretty much all the time when you ’re apart ( it can be more and less consciously , but you should definitely feel it any time you think of her ) , you ’re not committed enough to marry her .
Does she understand you ?
If you feel like she does n’t understand you on a regular basis , the two of you are not ready to be married , plain and simple .
Can you easily picture growing old together ?
If you ca n’t easily picture getting older together , if you have to work at it , then she ’s not the one for you , at least not at this time .
Do you share the same taste ?
This can be in many areas … if your tastes in clothes , music , food , etc. are not generally compatible , it ’s likely to cause problems down the road .
This may not be a deal breaker , but deserves real consideration .
When you compare her , overall , to other women , do they ALWAYS lose ?
She does n’t have to come out ahead in every specific trait , but overall , there should n’t be anyone who even comes close .
If she ever loses , or even ties , you ’re not ready to marry her .
Is one of you a big spender and the other a penny pincher ?
Financial differences are the biggest killers of relationships … they cause conflict , so you do n’t spend time together , so you grow apart , which causes more conflict , and on into a downward spiral .
Let me emphasize this : if you are not financially compatible , think REALLY seriously before you ask her to marry you !
Is one of you a neat freak and the other a slob ?
Disagreements over keeping things clean can really wear a relationship down .
Even if there is no other conflict , this one tends to be present enough to make the relationship go sour .
If one of you is a neat freak and the other a slob , again , you need to think really seriously before proposing .
Is she controlling ?
Even if you do n’t think it ’s a big deal right now , if she ’s controlling it ’s almost certain to become one eventually .
You can only handle being controlled for so long … at some point you are going to want to be out from under her control .
Are you ?
Be honest with yourself … if you are controlling , work on that before proposing .
It isgoing to cause problems down the road if you are controlling , and getting rid of being controlling is a HUGE personality change , so you should give her a chance to make sure that you ’re still right for each other after doing so .
Do you both want children ?
You really need to discuss children before discussing marriage .
If one of you wants more children than the other ( I do n’t mean the difference between 2 and 3 … though the difference between 0 and 1 is huge ) , it will almost certainly cause significant problems in the relationship at some point down the road .
Does she have anything she seems to consider more important than you / your relationship ?
If there is something that seems more important to her than your relationship , and it ’s not a child she already has , that ’s a huge red flag .
If you and your relationship are not the most important thing to her now , chances are n’t very good for that changing after you get married .
Do you ?
The same thing from above applies to you , too … if there is something that ’s more important to you than her and your relationship , and it ’s not your child , you really should n’t ask her to marry you .
Having other things you value over her is a recipe for disaster in a marriage .
Are you hiding anything from her ?
Trust is critical in a good relationship .
Not important , critical .
If you distrust her enough to hide something from her , work on that first … then you can come back and think about proposing again later .
Do you feel like she ’s hiding something from you ?
Again , trust is critical .
If you do n’t trust her , and feel like she ’s hiding something , even if you do n’t think it ’s that big of a deal , be careful .
You really should trust her before you propose … and you should be pretty certain that she trusts you , too .
Do you have to change something important to you to make her happy ?
Is there some part of you that you would have to change in order for her to be happy ?
Is that part of you important to you ?
If the answer to both of these is yes , be very , very careful .
You may come to resent her for it , and that ’s a horrible thing to have in a marriage .
Does she have to change to make you happy ?
If there is something that she has to change in order for you to truly be happy with her , even if you think she will , be careful .
It ’s very easy to be in love with the idea of someone , rather than who they really are , and you ca n’t make her change … so if you ’re not happy now , do n’t ask her to marry you now .
Can you imagine getting a divorce ?
If either of you can imagine getting a divorce , and it is absolutely something you should discuss before proposing , then you really should n’t get married .
Marriage is too big an investment of your time , energy , attention , and to be honest , you for you to get into if you are already not sure it ’s going to last .
Has she ever cheated on or left someone before ?
This might be something you do n’t really want to think about , but it ’s important , because it ’s much easier to do the second time than the first … and each repetition makes it easier .
That does n’t mean you should n’t propose just because she hasdone one or the other , it just means that you need to take extra caution , and be even more certain than otherwise that you trust her .

A recent survey , carried out on behalf of The Space Review , has revealed that the average American believes a quarter of the country 's public purse goes towards funding NASA .
The survey found that most people reported the belief that NASA is almost as well funded as the military .
The Department of Defense does receive roughly 21 per cent of the nation 's wonga , but most people overestimated this by a further 12 per cent .
In reality , NASA gets something like 0.6 per cent of the natonal budget , a fact which researchers report came as a surprise to those being surveyed .
According to The Space Review , one participant replied " No wonder we have n’t gone anywhere ! " .
The survey formed part of a larger analysis of the costs and benefits of having a publicly funded space agency .
The writers argue that people have scant knowledge of what NASA actually does .
Combined with the huge overestimates of the cost of running NASA , it is not surprising that people often regard it as being poor value for money . ®

Big Lies that You Must Believe
Michael Collins
Washington , D.C .
Because if you do n't , the whole scam may fall apart .
In the first two parts of this ongoing series on The Money Party , we discussed the fact that there is only one political party in the United States , The Money Party .
It has two wings , Republican and Democratic .
That party represents excessive concentrations of wealth in the hands of corporations , other organizations , and individuals .
They put up the money and get what they pay for every time .
They make sure that the election system is rigged to rely on money like a junkie relies on heroin .
The system takes care of them .
They do n't have to obey the same rules that we do .
Why ?
Because they 're above the law .
The Money Party owns the mainstream media entirely .
NBC is really General Electric , ABC is Disney , CBS was Viacom but now it 's just the name for a mega- corporation , and Fox is News Corp. , the Rupert Murdoch financial empire .
That 's why it 's called the corporate media .
They 're publicity shops , " corporate communications divisions , " owned and controlled by Money Party members .
Their job is to emulate George Orwell 's " 1984 " by generating meaningless concepts that bind us to false choices .
It 's a series of interconnected lies .
Let 's look at some of the key lies that we must believe to keep them in power .
Big lie 1 : " We 're the world 's leading democracy . "
Not since Bush - Cheney took over .
We 're dropping fast .
Maybe it has something to do with the Patriot Act and all that illegal wire tapping of U.S. citizens ?
Maybe it has something to do with a Congress that does nothing to stop an out of control president .
Ratings on democracy show us behind 14 other countries .
Big lie 2 : " Just let the markets handle it .
The free enterprise system will work it out . "
This is supposed to appeal to our love of capitalism .
Well , we do n't have capitalism in the United States .
We have socialism for the rich and survival of the fittest for the rest of us .
When you hear about the wisdom of " the markets , " you know that The Money Party is attacking some new law or regulation that might give us an equal footing and create real competition .
The party can't stand free enterprise because it wo n't play any game that it might lose .
Count on it .
NAFTA - just let the markets handle it .
Health care – it's the market at your service .
Pollution – you guessed correctly , it 's a " market thing .
" We would n't understand . "
Dumping mercury in the Great Lakes , it all makes sense to the party .
Big lie 3 : " There are two sides to every issue . "
Does that have anything to do with two parties ?
Where in the world did this come from ?
Who knows ?
But the corporate media rides this one into the ground .
Take climate change for example .
Two sides , really ?
Well just about every respectable scientist in the world , at least those who get published in real science journals , says climate change is real , it 's man made , and it 's dangerous .
The explanations are varied ( many sided ) but there 's only one side of the larger issue if you want your children to survive .
Climate change is a very real , scary deal .
We 're all threatened .
But a correction might hurt their short term profits .
As a result , the dangerous lies persist brought to you by The Money Party " communications divisions . "

Government has encouraged use of stop and search and detention without charge
Armed police will use anti-terrorism powers to " deal robustly " with climate change protesters at Heathrow next week , as confrontations threaten to bring major delays to the already overstretched airport .
Up to 1,800 extra officers will be drafted in to prevent an estimated 1,500 people disrupting the airport over the period of the camp for climate change , which is due to begin on Tuesday .
The police have been told to use stop and search powers against the protesters , who have pledged to take direct action on August 18 and 19 but not to endanger life .
The Metropolitan police chief , Sir Ian Blair , has said he fears a minority of protesters intent on breaking the law could cause massive disruption as Heathrow prepares for its busiest week of the year .
Yesterday Met commander Jo Kaye , in charge of the specialist firearms unit , said some people would " want to get their message across using criminal means " .
Scotland Yard 's plans for handling the protests are revealed in a document seen by the Guardian , which was produced by Met commander Peter Broadhurst during a legal hearing at the high court which imposed restrictions on a number of named campaigners .
" Should individuals or small groups seek to take action outside of lawful protest they will be dealt with robustly using terrorism powers .
This is because the presence of large numbers of protesters at or near the airport will reduce our ability to proactively counter the terrorist act [ threat ] , " the document says .
The police report makes it clear that the government has encouraged police forces to make greater use of terrorism powers " especially the use of stop and search powers under s44 Terrorism Act 2000 " .
The law gives police powers to :
· Stop and search people and vehicles for anything that could be used in connection with terrorism
· Search people even if they do not have evidence to suspect them
· Hold people for up to a month without charge
· Search homes and remove protesters ' outer clothes , such as hats , shoes and coats .
Last night the protesters said they would not be intimidated .
" We are trying to prevent climate change by stopping the expansion of the airport .
There is no intention to endanger life .
Our quarrel is not with passengers but with BAA and the government , " said a spokesman .
The civil rights group Liberty said it was alarmed at the police use of the anti-terrorism powers to deter peaceful protest .
" Stop and search powers created to address the threat of terrorism should not be used routinely against peaceful demonstrators , " said James Welch , Liberty 's legal director .
The police tactics have echoes of the 2003 anti-war demo at RAF Fairford where law lords eventually ruled police had acted unlawfully in detaining two coachloads of protesters , who were stopped and searched and then turned back even though they were on their way to an authorised demonstration .
Police used section 44 of the act 995 times at the Fairford peace camp , even though there was no suggestion of terrorist overtones .
The Guardian has established that at least two climate change campaigners have been arrested recently at Heathrow by officers using terrorism powers .
Cristina Fraser , a student , was stopped when cycling near the airport with a friend and then charged under section 58 of the Terrorism Act .
This makes it an offence to make a record of something that could be used in an act of terrorism .
" I was arrested and held in a police cell for 30 hours .
I was terrified .
No one knew where I was .
They knew I was not a terrorist , " she said .
Ms Fraser , a first - year London university anthropology student , has been on aviation demonstrations with the Plane Stupid campaign group , but claims she was carrying nothing at all .
The police later recharged her with conspiring to cause a public nuisance .
I learned Lisp as merely a programming language .
But as I watched , it began to evolve .
And I came to view it more as a space of languages , unified by a set of common design principles -- a terrain upon which one could move freely among certain camps and still be within the warm and friendly confines of a larger community called Lisp .
Lately , however , that terrain seems rougher than I once had thought -- perhaps indeed rougher than it once actually was .
Some of the camps have fallen away , while others have thrived .
The paths among them seem less simple to navigate .
And always I am acutely aware of the distances along these paths , for it is those distances that have created the political divisions among us which I deal with day - to - day in my work on language standards .
In this article , I will survey the landscape claimed by the Lisp Community in an attempt to identify the issues that divide us , the issues that unite us , and why it all matters .
Just Words on Paper ?
“ It 's a language , right ?
Languages are defined by their specifications .
I 'll read the specification thoroughly , and then I 'll know what it 's all about . ”
Statements like this sometimes leave me dumbfounded .
I feel like I 'm watching the episode of Star Trek : The Next Generation called “ The Measure of a Man , ” where the android Data has just read a book on the rules of poker and thinks he therefore understands what poker is really about .
You 're going to read a specification -- just one -- and then you 're going to understand what Lisp is ?
To me and many others , Lisp is not just a language , but a language family , and at times perhaps even more than that .
Reading the specification for a single language in the Lisp family might leave you equipped to program in the language , if that was all you wanted , but I find it hard to believe you 'd really have a sense for Lisp as a whole .
So let 's just boldly trek ahead and see what else is out there .
Linked by Incredibly Standard Procedures ?
“ If they 're all Lisps , presumably they 're all built around some common core .
Right ? ”
Not necessarily .
Some years ago , when I was first becoming involved with language standards , I did a personal study of languages in the Lisp family to determine whether there was a common core of operators that were present throughout the family with the same name and semantics .
LAMBDA ?
No commonality here .
The syntax for lambda lists varies widely .
LAMBDA makes lexical closures in some languages , and dynamic closures in others .
Sometimes closures are first - class ( i.e. , can be returned upward ) and sometimes second - class ( i.e. , downward only ) .
CAR and CDR ?
These names are almost universally available throughout the Lisp family , but the semantics are not always the same .
Sometimes CAR and CDR of NIL is permitted , but not always .
And in some Lisps , CDR is also used to access property lists and / or locatives .
EQ , EQL , EQP , EQUAL , or EQUALP ?
No .
While the concepts of structure and identity seem universally important , the names and semantics of the comparison operators vary widely across Lisps .
For example , a number of Maclisp variants had EQUAL , but most varied in subtle ways relating to which datatypes would be descended for recursive comparison .
Similar differences existed among substitution functions such as SUBST and SUBLIS .
IF and COND ?
Well , some Lisps offer only one or the other and they differ as to which is primitive .
And in dialects where IF exists , there is disagreement about whether it takes one , two , or many arguments -- or whether the alternative starts in the third position or is introduced by a keyword .
In some dialects of Scheme , COND takes the unusual but popular “ = > ” syntax .
And the notation for `otherwise ' clauses varies as well .
I could go on and on , but perhaps you can already see where this is leading .
I did find that CONS was present in every Lisp I looked at with pretty much the same meaning , but that seemed to be an isolated case and was n't quite enough for me to conclude that there was any naturally occurring “ common core ” of operators characterizing Lisp .
Lots of Irritating , Silly Parentheses ?
“ What about all those parentheses ?
That might be a clue . ”
Parentheses plainly dominate the visual landscape of Lisp , and many would call them the signature feature of Lisp .
But on balance , in spite of their ubiquitous nature , I do n't think they 're the primary force that has bound Lisp community together for so many years .
The Dylan language , which some ( myself included ) might say is in the Lisp family -- or at least descended from it -- chose to abandon Lisp 's traditional heavily parenthesized notation in favor of a more traditional syntax .
The sense among the Dylan designers was that while there was a strong notational tradition within Lisp , and there was even a sound technical basis for this tradition , overall it served as an entry barrier to Lisp , and kept people from getting close enough to appreciate Lisp 's more important properties .
Some are content with this decision by the Dylan designers , and some hold that it was ill - advised , but probably no one would deny that there are aspects of Lisp more important than parentheses .
Loads of Innovative Semantic Paradigms ?
`` What about all those cool features most languages overlook ? ''
Now you 're getting closer .
Lisp has been a fertile breeding ground for a number of exciting language features that are hard to find in most other languages : structural macros , the EVAL function , dynamic variable binding , and so on .
But for each of these features , you can find some dialect of Lisp that does n't have it .
So while these features are strongly correlated with Lisp , none is apparently criterial .
Automatic memory allocation and garbage collection might be almost an exception -- it 's present in nearly all implementations .
But mostly as a pratical need - - not as a linguistic element .
The Common Lisp specification does not require an implementation to support garbage collection for example -- indeed , the concept is barely mentioned .
The decision to include it is left to implementors .
But since it's not part of the textual specification of the language , it 's hard to call it a linguistic element .
Look Instead for Social Patterns
``So if not the operators or syntax , what unifies the Lisp family , and sets it apart from other languages ? ''
Well , with increasing frequency , when asked by someone why a certain technical choice was made in Lisp , I find myself offering a political reason , not a technical one .
Each of the choices to be selected among is generally technical in nature , but the decision to select one instead of another is often political .
I do spend a lot of time on standards , so you might just say I 'm seeing it through the eyes of what I do for a living , but I 'm going to claim for purposes of this article that what unifies dialects of Lisp is not the operators themselves , but rather the set of people who provide them .
In essence , I 'll suggest that Lisp is a social phenomenon , akin to a political party , and that what unifies Lisp are the people who are its leaders , and the ways in which they respond ( or fail to respond ) to the needs of that community .
For example , at both the Lisp & Functional Programming ( L&FP ) and the Lisp Users and Vendors ( LUV ) conferences last year , there were sessions devoted to planning future conferences .
In both cases , the most promising strategies seemed to involve alliances with other groups .
In both cases , conversation seemed to focus not on ``what communities use languages that are syntactically or semantically like mine at the level of language specification ' ' but rather ``what communities are solving problems like those I have to solve , and what communities are led by people who offer to listen to my problems . ''
One thing the LUV conference discussion focused upon specifically was the issue of who would set the agenda for the conference if an alliance were created with another conference or body of users .
There seemed to be a fear that if a large additional community were brought in which had a definite agenda of its own , there would be a loss of power by the Lisp community , and a correspondingly diminished sense of value about the conference .
Not everyone seemed to agree on which communities were most like them , but people did seem concerned that only the communities which they perceived as being similar in needs should be invited .
No one seemed to want to see the Lisp identity lost in a larger community whose needs were not Lisp 's needs .
So , for example , when a poll was taken of whether to invite the Smalltalk community , the answer was a nearly unanimous ``No , '' while when a poll was taken about whether to invite the Dylan community , the answer was a nearly unanimous ``Yes . ''
The reason for the difference seemed not to be a concern that Lisp could n't stand up to Smalltalk in a technical way , but rather a concern that the personality of the Smalltalk community might dominate discussions .
No similar concern was raised about the Dylan community , whose needs probably seemed more aligned with those of the Lisp community .
Also , several of those who spoke identified a key value that they got from the LUV conference as being a chance to talk one - on - one with others in the Lisp community , including those they perceived as establishing the trends for that community .
A Thought Experiment
`` What does it mean to say that a language is defined by its community ? ''
To help me think about the degree to which Lisp is defined by its semantics and the degree to which it is defined by its community , I constructed the following thought experiment :
Suppose that the designers of some Lisp dialect L concluded for some reason that language design was a popularity contest and in a desperate attempt to narrow the gap , they exactly replaced the text of their definition of L with the definition of C in order to make L more attractive .
Suppose that for some reason no one in the C community took notice , and so the Lisp community remained the sole consumers of L , which differed from C only in name .
Think about L today and how it would change in future years .
Starting from the same point , would C and L continue to look the same after some years had passed ?
I believe that the Lisp community has different needs than the C community , and that the L designers -- partly because they grew from this different community , and partly out of a sense of ongoing responsibility to that community -- would respond very differently than the C community and that the two languages , L and C , would again diverge .
Now think again about the set of changes that would be made to L in response to the Lisp community 's needs over the years following this radical surgery on the definition of Lisp .
If the L community had changed its allegiance to C , how hard would it have been for them to have gotten the same set of changes from the C designers ?
My best guess is : much harder .
The reason is really the same as before -- in a world of trade - offs , different priorities yield different decisions .
The same differences in priorities that have led the Lisp community to become a different community than the C community would lead to resistance by the C designers to changes necessary to support the Lisp community .
The C designers have their own community to support , and probably already consider that to be a full - time job .
A Dynamic Community for a Dynamic Language
``Can you give an example of how the Lisp community differs from other language communities ? ''
Myths and old negative stories about Lisp seem very hard to kill completely -- that Lisp is an interpreted - only language , that it has only lists and not arrays , and so on .
For a long time I puzzled about how such misinformation could persist for so long .
Would n't the person carrying it decide at some point that their information was probably out of date ?
Eventually I arrived at a theory that I feel explains the observed behavior : People who are used to static languages expect languages to be static .
Lisp has undergone tremendous change over time and its community has stood by it .
I think the dynamic nature of Lisp has arisen as much to support the needs of a changing community as to support the needs of changing programs .
Lisp users are accustomed to being able to write programs that take program texts in different dialects ( or older versions of the same dialect ) and process them to bring them up to date .
No single common linguistic feature supports this .
And yet , Lisp users are accustomed to expecting that there will be some way to accommodate the needs of compatibility and translation .
Languages are a reflection of the community they serve .
They become the way we express process , and so they inform our sense of what processes we expect .
With static languages , one is encouraged to make early choices and to stand by them ; with dynamic languages , to delay choices and to flexibly adapt .
And if other languages do not accommodate change well , we should n't be surprised to find that sometimes their users do n't either .
All for One and One for All - - Or Every Lisp for Itself ?
``Does this dynamic community always behave as a single unit ? ''
No .
Just as there are multiple Lisp languages , there are multiple distinct subcommunities of Lisp users .
Within standards organizations , there is continual pressure for people to join existing standards efforts , rather than to start new ones .
Sometimes , standardization can be good .
Other times not .
The limiting case on one end is a world full of ``standards '' where no two users use the same one .
These are very efficient to produce because no one has to agree , but very useless since no one cares .
The limiting case on the other end is a world with just one ``standard '' that serves no one 's needs ; this would take forever to produce and no one would want it when it was done .
The key is to make enough standards -- but not too many .
The Lisp community is made up of distinct user bases with widely varying needs , and I have come to the conclusion that many problems which we are undergoing today in the standards arena -- especially international standards -- are due to an ill - advised desire on the part of some to force compromise among those communities when there is really no common ground .
When Not to Compromise
`` Is n't compromise always good ?
Does n't refusing to compromise just mean you 're stubborn ? ''
Not necessarily .
Change , regardless of how well - intentioned , can be highly disruptive in any established community .
Also , it may be that only a certain amount of compromise can be made before the ``solution '' no longer suits the original need .
To see the issue , imagine two parties that use purple a lot trying to convince a certain paint company to produce their favorite color of paint , which they both call ``purple . ''
The vendor agrees , but only if he can serve the entire community with a single color .
Imagine that upon closer inspection we discover that one of them describes purple ( using Red / Green / Blue values in the range 0 - 255 ) as ( 200,0,200 ) and the other defines purple as ( 160,32,240 ) .
The parties are sent to a room whose door says ``Purple ' ' on it , where they negotiate until they agree they can each live with ( 180,22,210 ) rather than nothing at all .
But just as they are about to report back to the vendor , another person enters the room and also wants to try a hand .
He wants a ``light purple , '' ( 230,230,250 ) .
The vendor , hearing the word ``purple '' in the name ``light purple '' sent him to the room where ``purple '' is being defined saying , ``I do n't have the resources to make more than one purple , so you guys will just have to work it out . ''
After much aggravation , a proposal is passed for a compromise which is much darker than lavender but much lighter than the other purple that the first two had discussed -- and perhaps that satisfies no one .
It might be , for example , that the lavender proponent did n't really care about the purpleness at all .
Perhaps he only cared about the ``light '' part and would have been just as happy with ``light red '' or ``light blue . ''
Perhaps each of the rooms ( red , orange , yellow , etc. ) has one `pastel person ' lurking in it waiting to make a mess of things when all of the pastel people should really be off in a room together , and the others should be defining dark colors .
It is a mistake to assume that a naming similarity ( in this case ``purple ' ' and ``light purple '' ) automatically implies a close functional relationship , or that an absence of naming similarity implies no such close relationship .
The key in the standards arena is to get people to compromise on things that do not matter , but to provide them with enough space that they need n't be forced to compromise on things that really do matter .
`` But why would a group compromise on something none of them wanted ? ''
It may be that someone involved knows that he wo n't be able to make use of the resulting color but is so aggravated at the others spoiling his chance of getting what he wants that he refuses to back down .
Or it may be that someone has lost track of his original goal and does n't realize how far he is from achieving it .
Or it may just be that someone has simply been charged with doing his best and feels that it 's better to put up a good fight than to appear to have given in .
The myriad reasons that can lead to an agreement among people about a solution that none like are varied and often very personal to the situation of each participant .
But it 's easier than you might think for this to happen if you 've never been involved in such a negotiation yourself .
A Rosy Future Where the Lisp Community Does n't See Red
Languages in the Algol family , such as Algol and Pascal , tend not to have overlapping names , and as a consequence are more easily accepted side - by - side in the standards world .
Languages in the Lisp family , however , tend to use the word Lisp in their name even when they have differences as syntactically and semantically striking as distinct languages in the Algol family -- Common Lisp , Eulisp , and ISLISP are such examples .
In standardization efforts for Common Lisp ( by ANSI 's X3J13 in the US ) and ISLISP ( worldwide , through ISO 's SC22 working group , WG16 ) , explicit decisions were made not to attempt to standardize ``Lisp . ''
By informal agreement among these parties , ``Lisp ' ' is considered the language family , not of any particular language .
However , now that ANSI has approved Common Lisp we are at an odd position because the Common Lisp community ( which involves companies world - wide , even though the language itself was designed in the US ) might like to proceed toward an International Standard for Common Lisp .
Yet I have heard concerns voiced that this could infringe the needs of the WG16 ISLISP project .
I was recently asked by a member of the Lisp community from Europe , ``Given that there is now an ANSI standard for Lisp , what is the purpose of ISLISP , the language being defined by WG16 , the ISO SC22 working group on Lisp ? ''
Of course , we could respond by comparing the technical aspects of the two languages , which differ quite a bit , but I hope I 've established already that Lisp ( and perhaps languages in general ) are only superficially about the technical content and are mostly about politics .
So I reflexively translate the question in my mind into one that emphasizes political concerns : ``Once the US community has made up its mind , is there any point to worrying whether other countries are happy , too ? ''
My personal answer is a strong ``Yes . ''
Common Lisp addresses a very definite global market -- that of large , commercial development working on large , complex , highly dynamic problems not addressable by commodity solutions .
But there are other markets that Common Lisp has not targeted for which ISLISP might serve usefully .
Rather than require ISLISP to become very large and cumbersome , or to require Common Lisp to lose important functionality critical to existing communities , my present belief is that it is reasonable and appropriate to allow both Common Lisp and ISLISP to stand side - by - side in the standards arena and the marketplace , to stand or fall on their own merits , rather than to be pushed into the same room to compromise with one another , perhaps in the process destroying the merits of both .
If it 's possible to view Algol and Pascal as distinct languages , or it 's possible to view even C and C++ as distinct languages ( which ANSI does ) , then it 's certainly possible to view ISLISP and Common Lisp as distinct .
Their semantics is different , but more importantly , the communities they serve are different .
Conclusion
For purposes of discussion here , I 've tried to paint Lisp not as a technical specification but as a political party .
Your mileage with this analogy may vary .
However , what cannot be denied is that politics has an influence even on the heavily technical aspects of our lives , and it 's worth sometimes taking time out to think about how they affect us -- so that we can be sure our interests are protected .
Sometimes it 's best for us all to act as a single body -- when we have a common need or when we can help each other on our separate needs by acting as one body .
On those occasions , it might be to the advantage of some or all of us to view Scheme and Dylan as members of the Lisp family .
At other times , it 's best for us to act independently , to avoid stepping on each other 's toes .
On those occasions , not only might Scheme and Dylan not be Lisps , but it might be important even to say that Common Lisp and ISLISP are sufficiently distinct that it is better to treat them as non-overlapping languages .
What the right thing is depends , I think , on the impact it will have upon people .
If unifying two communities will result in minor disruption to each but will bring obvious benefit to both , it may be worth it .
Certainly , for the purpose of having a joint conference or a joint newsletter , the cost of unifying the communities for the duration of that event is well worth the benefit .
But for the purpose of asking established communities to rewrite their programs and retrain their programmers , the costs and benefits must be evaluated more carefully .

BEIJING , Nov 26 ( Reuters ) - France ’s Areva clinched on Monday the biggest commercial nuclear power contract on record , agreeing to sell China two reactors and to provide atomic fuel for nearly two decades in a deal worth far more than expected .
At 8 billion euro ( $ 11.86 billion ) the wide - ranging contract is worth far more than the figures first mooted 10 months ago , when Beijing signalled it would give the French state - owned firm a slice of its ambitious nuclear expansion plan .

PA said its deal was " unprecedented in the world nuclear market " and marked the start of global cooperation with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp ( CGNPC ) , which will help build the plant in China 's southern manufacturing hub .
“ It reaffirms our global nuclear leadership and reinforces our presence in one of the most promising markets for the decades to come , ” said Areva Chief Executive Officer Anne Lauvergeon .
French utility EDF EDF .
PA would finance 30 percent of the deal in return for a stake in the plant , Lauvergeon said , and the package includes around 600 tonnes a year of fuel for the reactors from start - up in 2014 through 2026 .
China has also secured uranium for several other plants , as it plans a near quadrupling of capacity through 2020 , she told a news conference after the signing .
CGNPC has agreed to buy 35 percent of the lifetime production of UraMin , an Areva unit focused on mining in Africa , which is expected to extract some 65,000 tonnes of the metal through 2022 .
Beijing is growing increasingly anxious about securing the imported energy and commodity resources necessary to fuel its economic growth , and has tended to favour investors in these sectors who are able to guarantee supplies .
SURPRISE
A year ago Areva appeared in danger of losing out on China 's nuclear rush , when U.S. - based Westinghouse Electric , now owned by Japan 's Toshiba Corp 6502.T , won a two year battle for a contract to build four " third generation " reactors , which are promoted as safer and more efficient than current ones .
But Beijing later surprised both sides by expanding the original tender to six plants from four , giving the French company a fresh chance at pitching its new European pressurised reactors to China , where it has long had a presence .
In return for the flow of funds to France , the firm is transferring its technology -- a key demand Beijing also made of Westinghouse -- through a consortium they are setting up with their Chinese partner , Lauvergeon said .
The announcement was part of a raft of deals agreed during Nicolas Sarkozy ’s first visit to China as president of France , which included a framework pact to sell 160 Airbus planes , the planemaker ’s largest order to date .
Sarkozy has pressed Beijing to help curtail Iran ’s nuclear plans .
But a brace of deals announced during his visit showed France is eager to court China ’s own atomic power sector .
Areva and the China National Nuclear Corp agreed to study whether to build a spent nuclear fuel reprocessing - recycling plant in China that could be worth 15 billion euros and to create a joint venture in zirconium .
The euro denomination of many of the deals -- although uranium sales are in dollars -- will please Paris , which has been expressing growing concern about the weakness of the dollar .
The U.S. currency last week fell to a record low against the euro .

A US soldier was sleeping in his own urine at Walter Reed , the wife of a Republican congressman witnessed it and complained , and nobody did a damn thing .
God bless Dana Priest .
THIS is what reporting looks like .
It 's not about being partisan .
It 's about doing your job , and hopefully making the world a better place at the same time .
From the front page of tomorrow 's Washington Post :
Top officials at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , including the Army 's surgeon general , have heard complaints about outpatient neglect from family members , veterans groups and members of Congress for more than three years .
A procession of Pentagon and Walter Reed officials expressed surprise last week about the living conditions and bureaucratic nightmares faced by wounded soldiers staying at the D.C. medical facility .
But as far back as 2003 , the commander of Walter Reed , Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley , who is now the Army 's top medical officer , was told that soldiers who were wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan were languishing and lost on the grounds , according to interviews .
In 2004 , Rep. C.W. Bill Young ( R - Fla . ) and his wife stopped visiting the wounded at Walter Reed out of frustration .
Young said he voiced concerns to commanders over troubling incidents he witnessed but was rebuffed or ignored .
" When Bev or I would bring problems to the attention of authorities of Walter Reed , we were made to feel very uncomfortable , " said Young , who began visiting the wounded recuperating at other facilities .
Beverly Young said she complained to Kiley several times .
She once visited a soldier who was lying in urine on his mattress pad in the hospital .
When a nurse ignored her , Young said , " I went flying down to Kevin Kiley 's office again , and got nowhere .
He has skirted this stuff for five years and blamed everyone else . "
GOP congressman was rebuffed when he brought problems to the attention of the authorities at Walter Reed : Kiley is now the US Army 's Surgeon General .

Actually , in all fairness to Salon , they had this story on Tuesday
By Tom Geoghegan
BBC News Magazine
The simplest of everyday tasks - using scissors , opening a microwave oven or peeling a potato - are all reminders to left - handers that this is a world designed for others .
And now this frustration is reaching a new level .
With the number of left - handed people growing - as schools reject enforced right - handedness - so is their sense of identity and grievance .
They wo n't be marking Left - Handers ' Day on Monday by mounting street barricades and shouting through megaphones .
But its organisers say the day does hold an important message about the difficulties the one in eight so - called sinistral people in the UK encounter every day .
We do n't sit in the corner and say ' That does n't work . '
We think outside the box
Lauren Milsom
Left - Handed Club
" People are finding a voice about it more .
Until 20 years ago , people would be quite quiet about being left - handed .
It was n't something you shouted about .
We would n't be militant about it , but now people are saying ' hold on , this does n't work for me and I 'm not happy about it ' . "
The very language of left - handedness is pejorative , with " gauche " , " sinister " and " awkward " among the broad translations from French , Latin and German , compared with the right 's " adroit " and " dextrous " .
But it is the practical difficulties that bother left - handers the most .
Irritations
" They are not life - threatening , they are unnecessary frustrations , difficulties which you should n't have to worry about , " says Mrs Milsom .
IS LEFT -HANDEDNESS BAD FOR HEALTH ?
Scientists say there has been a higher incidence of stuttering , dyslexia , autism and breast cancer among left - handers
But many excel in sports like tennis , baseball , cricket and swimming
These include creative and sporting prowess , a theory given added weight by the likes of Da Vinci , Michelangelo , Brian Lara , John McEnroe and Diego Maradona .
Scientists have linked handedness to the different functions of the brain 's right and left hemispheres .
Three of the last four US presidents have been left - handed ( George Bush Junior , being the odd man out ) , while research from the US National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that among graduates the earning power of left - handed men is 15 % greater than that of men who are right - handed .
FAMOUS LEFT-HANDERS
King George VI , George Bush Snr , Bill Clinton , Reagan Napoleon , Alexander the Great Da Vinci , Michelangelo , Rubens JS Bach , Jimi Hendrix Pele , Maradona Robert de Niro , Nicole Kidman
" The big advantage to being left - handed is that you have to overcome situations organised against you , so you become adaptable .
You think around things and you think outside the box : ' That does n't work for me so how can I make it work for me ? '
It 's a good trait to have . "
But with all the different kinds of adversity faced by people today , is a day of action really necessary ?
" I think we still need to have a day .
It 's a kind of tongue - in - cheek day .
Rather than have a big event in London , our members are doing things more personally , creating a ' lefty zone ' in the office , kitchen or schoolroom and every right - handed person has to perform tasks in that area .
It 's a bit of fun but gets the point across . "
The number of left - handers has increased steadily since 1910 , when it was thought there were only 3 % in Western society , and schoolchildren were forced to use their right hands .
The fact there are now 13 % in the UK suggests a weakening of the taboo .
Mrs Milsom 's husband , Keith , who owns the shop Anything Left - Handed , says his father Reg had his knuckles rapped with a ruler at school in the 1930s if he wrote with his left hand .
The teacher even tied his left arm to his chair .
The experience brought on a stutter .
" What we see now is not teachers being anti-left - hand but being apathetic and not knowing how to help left - handers .
" They 're told to sit at the back of the class and get on with it , whereas simple instruction about how to hold the pen and the paper can help . "
Injuries
Although the stigma and the prejudice have gone , campaigners want proper records kept in schools on the numbers of left - handed pupils and help in writing and providing left - handed equipment like scissors .
The case for left - handers has gone right to the top
In March , a strongly - worded e-petition was submitted to Downing Street calling upon the government to apologise for the continued oppression of left - handed people and " to legislate to end the discrimination - particularly in the manufacture of tools - that causes thousands of needless injuries to left - handed people every year " .
It collected a fairly unimpressive 44 signatures .
Making power saws and microwaves for right - handed people puts the health and safety of 10 % of the population at risk , says Professor Chris McManus , author of Right Hand , Left Hand .
He has described left - handed people as the " last neglected minority " .
I had polio as a baby and was in hospital initially for 10 months .
When I went in to hospital I was apparently using my left hand ( like my two older brothers ) but whilst incarcerated , my left hand was tied behind my back to make me use my right hand .
Who knows what damage this did , if any ?
A graphologist I met was horrified when I told her but apparently this was standard practice in the 50s .

Hurray , I`m finally in a minority

I am left handed since birth 47 years ago , and I have never experienced any problems or discrimination , cannot see what all the fuss is about ...........

Oh , come on !
There are a lot of things that use the left side more than the right , and right handers do n't ask for them to be changed !
I am right handed , but can write left handed , and I am certain that if I practised I could write left handed almost as well .
The fact is that some tools ( including writing ) can be done easier with the right hand than the left , - so USE the right hand !
After all , playing the piano uses both hands equally , as does playing the guitar .
When playing stringed instruments that use a bow , the left hand does MORE work !
I never heard of a right handed cellist insisting that it had been designed for a left hander !
I sometimes think the old fashioned way of insisting that we all learn to write with the right hand is the right way , given that writing is designed that way .
However , if a child insists on using the left hand , let them do that , but at least give them an incentive to try writing right handed first !
It 's all about co-ordination , or are some left handers incapable of this ?
PJ , W. Yorks , UK
When I was at junior school in the 70s only one male teacher would constantly straighten my paper when I was writing as most left - handed people need the paper to be at an angle .
I was very young and tried to write his way but struggled .
The thought of getting into trouble was terrifying .
My daughter is left handed and going into the juniors this new term and I will make sure she is not treated the same way .

My husband and I are both left handed , yet our two children are right handed .
I have the mouse to the right of the computer , whereas my husband uses the mouse on the left hand side .
We both have left handed cheque books , this really confuses right handed counter staff !
Have there been any studies regarding choice of profession for left handers ?
I'm a librarian and in some libraries in which I have worked there has been a high proportion of lefthanders .
My husband is a surveyor and he 's noticed that many surveyors and architects are left handed .
In our first house we had the kitchen designed for left handed use , for example , the single drainer was on the left hand side , there was more worktop space to the left of the cooker .
Madeleine , Whitton , Middx .
England
I agree with the dangers of left handedness ...
I have been looking for a set of sharp kitchen knives for some time now and all the best sets are right - handed ... take a look at the blade on your knives , they are inevitably angled for right handed use , this makes cutting upside down a very dangerous pastime for us lefties .
William Murray , Glasgow , Scotland
I 've found that lots of public IT facilities e.g. internet cafes , public libraries , have the mouse on the right hand side with the lead too short to move over to the left hand side !!
Kim , Dartford
As a left - hander , I can't tell you the number of times I 've tried to open a microwave oven and failed , had serious trouble trying to cut a piece of paper with Facist - inspired scissors , or even tied my hands in a knot trying to sign a reciept with a chained pen in a bank .
It 's a miracle most left - handed people make it through the day without serious injury .
I think the government should consider tax credits to compensate us for the daily oppression and disadvantage we have to undergo .
Thank goodness organisations such as the Left - Handed Club exist to raise awareness of our suffering .
Lucy Martin , Berkshire
I bought my son left - handed scissors for school , and always made sure his teacher realised he was left handed and would struggle sitting next to a right handed person as they would knock elbows when writing .
My son's writing is fairly untidy and says he finds it hard to write from the left margin as the page becomes crumpled .
Things are easier in high school where he can type assignments rather then write them .
In soccer he kicks with both left and right legs which makes him a bit of a whizz .
He is definitely a problem solver , and has not yet found a situation difficult because of his left - handedness - except writing .
His electric guitar is a left handed version , and his music book written for left - handed people , so in that regard I feel he has been catered for .
There seems to be a growing awareness of the needs of left - handed people .

Juggling involves the repeated tossing and catching of three or more objects .
Find out how juggling works and learn how to juggle multiple objects .
Photo courtesy stock.xchng
The art of juggling has entertained audiences and challenged jugglers for thousands of years .
Although it was once confined to vaudeville and music halls , today you can watch juggling competitions on television and see jugglers keep seemingly endless numbers of objects aloft .
The term is not exclusive to objects thrown in the air , though .
Everything from plate spinning to playing with devil sticks falls under the umbrella of juggling .
In fact , you could define juggling as using feats of dexterity to manipulate one or more objects .
Most people tend to think of toss juggling when they hear the word " juggle . "
Toss juggling means the performer is throwing and catching at least one object more than the number of hands he 's using .
In other words , you can juggle two objects with one hand , but if you use both hands to juggle two objects , you 're really just playing catch with yourself .

In this article , we 'll primarily concentrate on toss juggling .
We 'll have a quick lesson on how to juggle three objects and look at the patterns almost all juggling sequences are based upon .
We 'll also look into the science behind juggling , including a glimpse into the surprisingly complex mathematical theories behind throwing stuff into the air and not letting it drop .
Over a million children in the UK have asthma
Bronchial thermoplasty uses radio frequency currents to reduce the amount of smooth muscle in the airways , stopping the narrowing seen in asthma .
The research , carried out in hospitals in the UK , Canada , Brazil and Denmark , showed the therapy led to fewer attacks and more days without symptoms .
UK asthma experts said it may be another treatment option in the future .
However , it is likely most people would still need to make some use of their medication .
Inflammation
Asthma affects the small tubes - airways - that carry air in and out of the lungs .
When something triggers asthma , the muscle around the walls of the airways tightens so that the airway becomes narrower .
The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell and mucus or phlegm can be produced .
These reactions cause the airways to become narrower and irritated , which leads to the symptoms of asthma - such as wheezing , shortness of breath and a tight chest .
More than five million people in the UK are currently being treated for asthma .
Bronchial thermoplasty involves putting a flexible tube through the nose or the mouth in order to target the smooth tissue in the airways .
In the study , the results of which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the treatment was given in three one - hour sessions over around nine weeks under a mild anaesthetic .
The researchers , from 11 centres including hospitals in Newcastle , Manchester , Leicester and Glasgow as well as others in Canada , Brazil and Denmark , monitored 112 people with asthma aged 18 to 65 over the course of one year .
All continued to have access to the inhalers and relievers they commonly used to treat their condition .
However , half of the group were also given the bronchial thermoplasty treatment .
These people had an average of 86 more days without asthma symptoms during the year than those who only had access to medication .
The bronchial therapy group also needed to use their inhalers and relievers less , and had better overall control of their asthma .
Refinement
Dr Gerard Cox , from St Joseph's Healthcare Foundation in Ottawa , Canada , who led the research , said : " These findings are very encouraging and are consistent with earlier trial results on bronchial thermoplasty .
" These results make us hopeful that bronchial thermoplasty may be a new option for asthma patients who have asthma symptoms despite use of current drug therapies . "
" Our experience suggests that the bronchial thermoplasty procedure is quite well - tolerated , and it holds considerable promise for patients with asthma . "
Victoria King , research development manager at Asthma UK , said the charity had been monitoring research into bronchial thermoplasty with interest .
" As this is an innovative technique we would welcome further research into the long - term effects and benefits for people with asthma .
" Results from these studies provide us with interesting information which enhances our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the process of asthma and might potentially extend treatment options in the future . "

County welfare officers may conduct routine searches of the homes of welfare recipients to combat fraud under a ruling in a California case that the Supreme Court let stand Monday .
The justices refused to hear a challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union , which contended that San Diego County ’s policy of requiring home searches without a warrant violated privacy rights .
The 4th Amendment to the Constitution forbids the police to search a residence without a warrant .
But the home inspections in San Diego County are different , judges said , because they do not seek evidence of a crime .
Instead , they are intended to determine whether welfare recipients qualify for benefits .
The San Diego district attorney adopted a policy in 1997 under which applicants for welfare benefits must agree to a “ walk through ” of their residence while they are present .
The inspectors check on whether the applicant has an eligible dependent child and has the amount of assets claimed .
They also check on whether a supposedly “ absent ” parent lives at the residence .
If residents refuse to permit a home visit , they can lose their benefits .

“ No applicant has been prosecuted for welfare fraud based upon anything observed or discovered during a home visit , ” County Counsel John J. Sansone told the high court .
In its suit , the ACLU contended that the mandatory home searches , based on no evidence of wrongdoing , violated the 4th Amendment and its ban on unreasonable searches and seizures .
But a federal judge ruled for San Diego County , and a three - judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling in a 2 - 1 decision last year .
Judges A. Wallace Tashima and Andrew Kleinfeld formed the majority , while Judge Raymond Fisher dissented .
Afterward , eight judges filed a dissent and argued unsuccessfully that the full 9th Circuit should reconsider the panel ’s ruling .
“ This case is nothing less than an attack on the poor , ” said Judge Harry Pregerson , writing for the dissenters .
“ This is especially atrocious in light of the fact that we do not require similar intrusions into the homes and lives of others who receive government entitlements .
The government does not search through the closets and medicine cabinets of farmers receiving subsidies . ”

Pregerson noted that San Diego is alone among California ’s 58 counties in mandating home searches for welfare recipients , but “ this ruling will surely set a new standard , ” he added .
The ACLU asked the Supreme Court to take up the case of Sanchez vs. County of San Diego , but it was dismissed in a one - line order Monday .

Banks have been hit by record defaults on sub - prime mortgages
It is to spend another $ 600 m supporting some of its funds because the value of their investments is uncertain .
But Bank of America said that it considered the potential losses to be " manageable " .
It is the latest bank to reveal losses as a result of investments linked to the US sub - prime home loans market .
Citigroup has already said it will write down as much as $ 11bn and Morgan Stanley expects to write off up to $ 6bn before the end of the year .
But there was some better news from Goldman Sachs on Tuesday .
Its chief executive Lloyd Blankfein told a conference that his bank would not have to take significant charges to cover sub - prime losses .
Impossible to value
Sub - prime mortgages are offered to people with inferior credit records or unpredictable incomes .
A vast number of these loans were dished out over the past few years when borrowing costs were cheaper and more affordable .
But a steep rise in US interest rates over the past two years has resulted in many borrowers unable to pay these mortgage repayments , leading to record defaults and foreclosures .
It then turned out that the debt from sub - prime loans had been packaged together and sold to other banks around the world .
Because the market for such debt has largely disappeared , banks are left holding debt to which it is almost impossible to attach a value .
The secret life of plant networks
October 10 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Everyone has secrets .
Now I ’m finding even plants have secrets .
Plants such as strawberry and clover can instant message each other along a linked network .
These types of plants send out runners along or under the ground and the runners become new buds .
Eventually , you end up with an entangled network that shares food , water and …. communication .
Scientists have discovered that during times of stress , say if plants are being attacked by some nasty fungus or leaf - eating insect , the network buzzes into action sending messages about imminent danger .
The message is sent through the phloem – a tube system plants use to transport organic compounds like carbohydrates – and plants who receive the message beef up their resistance in order to face the danger .
The plants undertake chemical changes to make their leaves less tasty to a caterpillar for example or harder to nibble on .
But these defensive changes inhibit the ability of the network plants to grow so I ’m hoping that the plants are pretty smart when it comes to knowing there ’s a real danger out there .
The fitness of the network relies on a plant being able to communicate with its neighbour .
If the neighbour has been knocked out , then the plant second down the line will be more vulnerable to attack .
Plant networks are also capable of spreading viruses .
I ’m writing this post on my balcony , sitting opposite a lot of plants with interconnecting runners ( see photo ) .
I bet these plants are all whispering : “ those humans are onto us at last , we ’d better use secret code from now on ” !

Washington is a city of paper , specifically of letters .
Congresspeople write letters to presidents .
Agencies write letters to other agencies .
Letters are an art form in D.C. — and the letter now blanketing Capitol Hill is a masterpiece of deceit .
Forty - three former Democratic officeholders signed this letter , which demands Congress pass trade deals with Peru , Panama and Colombia — pacts that will expand the job - killing , wage - destroying North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
The letter employs a corporate lobbyist 's smooth touch .
As I learned , that is no coincidence .
NAFTA expansion will " support jobs in the United States , " write the 43 Democrats , without mentioning that NAFTA resulted in the net loss of thousands of American jobs .
Another passage says Latin American labor abuses are " serious matters . "
But it says Congress must ratify these new NAFTAs anyway , even though they include no enforceable labor protections .
This letter materialized just as a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll detailed widespread opposition to America 's current trade policy .
Nonetheless , those pushing the deals held the letter up as a trophy .
The conservative Weekly Standard said that " former Democratic congressmen , diplomats , and policy advisers , plus retired senators " were taking a courageous stand .
The New York Times ' pro-NAFTA editorial board hailed the signatories as " Democratic leading lights . "
The Competitive Enterprise Institute — the industry - funded group famous for praising global warming — reprinted excerpts of the letter on its website .
And President Bush cited it in a speech last week , specifically thanking former Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston for signing .
When I heard Bush utter the name , I realized he was talking about the same Bennett Johnston who heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy , manufacturing and defense industries — industries empowered to cut costs when such NAFTA - style pacts aid outsourcing , depress wages and diminish environmental standards .
I wondered :
How many others on this letter are paid by industries that stand to make a buck off these trade policies ?
Checking federal records , I discovered that the letter 's first signatory , James Bacchus , is a former Clinton trade official now employed at convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff 's old firm .
Bacchus helped the firm this year rake in $ 40,000 from a client accused by watchdog groups of running sweatshops abroad .
Another signatory , Ira Shapiro , is at the same firm and is also a former Clinton trade official .
He lobbies for Dole Foods , whose South American operations will undoubtedly benefit from the NAFTA expansion .
Going through more signatories , I kept finding the same thing .
Stuart Eizenstat , a Clinton deputy Treasury secretary , now deals with " international business transactions and regulations on behalf of U.S. companies and others around the world , " according to his corporate law firm 's website .
Former Democratic Rep. Cal Dooley is the lobbyist for large food , beverage and consumer products companies .
And former Clinton Chief of Staff Mack McLarty provides " advocacy services to U.S. and multinational businesses involved in Mexico and Latin America , " according to the website of his private investment fund .
In sum , the majority of those who signed are lobbyists , corporate lawyers or business consultants representing interests with a financial stake in the trade policies the letter endorses .
Yet , this letter has been trumpeted by the media without a single mention of that inconvenient truth .
The whitewashing says a lot about the Washington press corps .
But the affair says even more about the struggles within the Democratic Party .
The party of the little guy may have won Congress in 2006 by promising to reform America 's trade policy and curtail lobbyists ' power , but the party is under assault by mercenaries cashing in their public service for the riches of private influence peddling .
These shills present their reverse Robin Hood ideology as altruism .
But they are really just leveraging their billing as " leading lights " to represent Big Money interests — all under the media - provided guise of objective statesmanship .
In response to the push for the new NAFTAs , at least a few principled business leaders are saying enough is enough .
Private equity executive Leo Hindery , a longtime Democratic fundraiser , told me in a recent interview , " The wealthy are now a political constituency unto themselves that is decidedly nonpartisan .
" Those who have personal skin in the trade policies game can't really be trusted to present things objectively or unselfishly , " he said .
" These folks are only interested in keeping the current system going and even expanding it , as grossly unfair to workers as it has become . "
Thanks to Washington 's invisible culture of corruption , their schemes may yet succeed .

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction A polytope of n dimensions is the convex hull of a finite collection of points in an n-dimensional vector space
Rn that is non-degenerate in the sense that it does not lie in some subspace of n - 1 dimensions .
" Convex " here means , roughly , that the shape bulges out .
" Hull " means that the actual corners , or vertices , of the figure are among the original set of points .
In two dimensions , polytopes are just polygons , such as this hexagon :
In three dimensions they are polyhedra , such as these familiar ones :
There is a vast theory of such geometrical objects .
The most interesting ones are those with some important connection to branches of mathematics other than geometry , for example bringing to light situations where geometry says something about algebraic structures .
In this note , I 'll say something about the polytopes known as associahedra , and try to say something about their algebraic significance as well .
There is exactly one associahedron of each dimension .
It is labeled by an index n+2 .
Thus K 5 looks like this :
This is not at first sight a lovable figure , not elegantly symmetrical like the more familiar regular polyhedra , and indeed to all appearances assembled rather randomly .
But then true beauty is never based on superficial appearances , is it ?
Simplices I 'll start with the ... well , simplest ... examples of polytopes .
They are called simplices ( singular : simplex ) .
Suppose we are given in Rn(n - dimensional space ) a collection of n+1 points that do not lie in n -1 dimensions .
For example , in R2 we would be given three non-collinear points A , B , C ; and in three dimensions four points , not lying in a plane .
The simplex determined by them is their convex hull .
In two dimensions this is a triangle and in 3 dimensions a tetrahedron .
The faces of any polytope are ... well , its faces - the flat subsets making up its boundary .
They come in different dimensions .
The vertices are its extremal points , its edges are the links between neighbouring vertices , and so on .
For a simplex , the faces are simplices of lower dimension , parametrized precisely by the subsets of its vertices ( all of them but the empty set , and sometimes it is thrown into the collection as well ) .
In two dimensions the faces of triangle ABC are thus vertices : A , B , C
edges : AB , AC , BC
the triangle itself : ABC
For a tetrahedron associated to ABCD they are vertices : A , B , C , D
edges : AB , AC , AD , BC , BD , CD
the two - dimensional triangular faces : ABC , ABD , ACD , BCD
the tetrahedron itself : ABCD
The faces of any polytope make up a set with an order relation :
One face is considered to be less than another when it is properly contained in it .
For simplices , one face is less than another when its parametrizing subset is contained in that of the other .
Thus the edge AB of the tetrahedron ABCD is contained in both the faces ABC and ABD , and no other proper faces .
This set and this order are the most important feature of a polytope , rather than the explicit geometric object realizing it .
Thus in two dimensions all triangles are essentially the same polytope ; in three dimensions all tetrahedra are essentially equivalent ; and in general all n-dimensional simplices are essentially the same .
Simplices are , in fact , somewhat dull objects .
Too ... uh ... simple to be interesting .
( But although a single simplex is not so exciting , several simplices assembled together may very well be fascinating .
Just as the relatively simple single cells of a multi- celled organism become much more interesting in the assembly . )
Exercise .
The convex hull in Rn of all points ( x i ) with x i = + 1 or - 1 is an n-dimensional cube .
It has 2n vertices .
Describe explicitly all of its faces at least when n=2 , 3 , or 4 .
How many are there of each dimension for a general n ?
The face graph of a polytope
The essential nature of a polytope lies somewhere in between its metric structure and its topological structure .
We do n't care about the exact size of things .
All tetrahedra are equivalent in this business , but we do want to distinguish between a tetrahedron and a cube , even though they have the same topological structure ( since both can be smoothly deformed into a sphere ) .
This combinatorial structure is pretty much captured by the face graph of the polytope that displays the set - plus - order I have mentioned above , and does this so that all faces of the same dimension are somehow seen to be of that dimension .
This I 'll call a ranked graph - that is to say , each node of the graph is assigned a rank ( here , the dimension of the face ) and if one node is less than another than it has lower rank .
Here is the face graph of the triangle ABC :
One very general question considered in this theory is , How can one tell whether a given ranked graph is the face graph of a polytope ?
This can be a very , very difficult question , even for a particular graph .
Associahedra
The essential nature of the simplex lies in its face graph , but this can be described in purely combinatorial terms - i. e. purely in terms of the subsets of its set of vertices , and the way they are contained in one another .
There are many other polytopes that can be described in purely combinatorial terms .
Among the more curious are the associahedra .
I describe first the combinatorial object .
Start with a product xx ... x of n copies of a single variable x .
List what you get when you start inserting balanced parentheses into it , subject to two exclusions : ( a ) you do not put parentheses (... ) around the whole thing and ( b ) you do not put parentheses around just a single variable .
Thus x ( x ) x and ( xxx ) are not allowed .
If n=4 , you start with xxxx .
Inserting just one pair you get ( xx ) xx
( xxx ) x
x ( xxx )
xx ( xx )
x ( xx ) x
Inserting two pairs you get ( xx ) ( xx )
( ( xx ) x ) x
( x( xx ) ) x
x ( x ( xx ) )
x (( xx ) x )
You can't insert any more , according to the rules .
At first it might seem that this is a largely messy process .
But now I associate to these lists its face graph .
At its top is xxxx .
This is linked to each one of the expressions with just one pair of parentheses .
And one of these expressions is linked to any one of the expressions with two pairs if the one with two pairs is obtained by adding a suitable pair to the first .
For example , x ( xx ) x is linked to ( x ( xx ) ) x and also x ( ( xx ) x ) .
The graph we finally get is this one : which can be rearranged to look like this :
Thus , we see that the associahedron K 4 is a pentagon ( vertices blue , edges green ) .
Not too exciting .
What about K 5 ?
It will be a three - dimensional solid .
We start with xxxxx to represent the entire solid .
Adding a single pair of balanced parentheses we get ( xx ) xxx
( xxx ) xx
( xxxx ) x
x ( xx ) xx
x ( xxx ) x
x ( xxxx )
xx ( xx ) x
xx ( xxx )
xxx ( xx ) ( There is a systematic way to make this list - list first all expressions where the ( occurs at the far left , then where it occurs between the first and second characters , etc . )
These parametrize the two - dimensional faces of K 5 .
Next one could list the edges , and finally the vertices .
I wo n't make those lists , but I will tell you that there are 14 vertices , that you can tell how many edges there are by keeping in mind that any edge lies on exactly two 2D ( two - dimensional ) faces , and that each edge has two vertices as its end points .
If you have made a list of all vertices , it is an interesting exercise to figure out how to assemble them into faces .
As the first image of K 5 shows , among the 2D faces there are three quadrilaterals , and the rest are pentagons .
Rendering
Even when one knows that a given combinatorial structure comes from a polytope , it is not necessarily a trivial matter to construct it explicitly .
This is certainly true of associahedra .
The very first description of an associahedron is to be found in the Ph. D. thesis of the topologist Jim Stasheff , but he was unable to represent it as a strict polytope .
Instead , he had to be content with a somewhat curvy shape .
Here is his K 5 : Of course , it is easy to see how to modify this to be a true polytope .
In fact , John Milnor showed up at Stasheff 's thesis defense with a cardboard model .
But is is not at all easy to see how to straighten out Stasheff 's curvy associahedron in all dimensions .
There are by now many , many constructions of the associahedron as a true polytope .
Nearly all of them are intimately related to some deep theoretical understanding of the structure , but ultimately there is some more or less arbitrary decision to be made .
This is what one expects , since after all the " essence " of the shape is not , as I have said , in its explicit metric structure .
What seems to be the the simplest rendering in all dimensions is that of Loday .
He sets this up in terms of a natural tree structure associated to a well - balanced expression , but I 'll describe it in ternms of the expression itself .
It works by mathematical induction on the length of the expression .
First of all , we write our expressions with indexed variables x i , increasing from 0 left to right .
So a typical expression might look like ( x 0 ( x 1 x 2 ) ) x 3 .
Any saturated expression can be expressed as a product of two such expressions of lower degree .
Thus x 0 ( x 1 x 2 ) is the product of x 0 and x 1 x 2 .
These left and right factors may in general themselves be factored .
There will be some expression in the final collection of compound sub-expressions with an x i - 1 at the far right end of its left half and x i at the far left of its right half .
We label this expression as e i .
For example , in the expression ( x 0 ( x 1 x 2 ) ) ( x 3 x 4 ) we have e 1 = x 0 ( x 1 x 2 )
e 2 = x 1 x 2
e 3 = ( x 0 ( x 1 x 2 ) ) ( x 3 x 4 )
e 4 = x 3 x 4
We set a i equal to the degree of the left factor of e i , b i equal to that of its right half .
Thus a 1 = 1 , b 1 = 2
a 2 = 1 , b 2 = 1
a 3 = 3 , b 3 = 2
a 4 = 1 , b 4 = 1
To the total expression e of degree n we associate the point M( e ) an n- 1 - dimensional point whose coordinates are the products a i b i .
The expression above thus gives us ( 2 , 1 , 6 , 1 ) .
Here is Loday 's very pretty result : Theorem .
The associahedron of dimension n may be realized in n+1 dimensions as that polytope whose vertices are the points M( e ) as e varies over all saturated , balanced expressions of degree n+2 .
For n=3 we get the vertices ( in compressed format ) 1261 1621 1612 2161 1234 1414 2134 4141 3124 4123 4321 4312 4213 3214 .
These all lie in the 3D hyperplane x 0 +x 1 +x 2 +x 3 =10 , which can be rendered in ordinary 3D .
You can see in Loday 's paper how these assemble to make the associahedron K 5 : ( Hidden edges are in red . )
History
The history of associahedra is curious .
They were first constructed by the topologist Jim Stasheff in his 1961 Princeton University thesis , where they were used to explore various kinds of topological associativity .
Stasheff tells me that his thesis was received with no fanfare , and that in fact he had some trouble getting his research published .
It was turned down by one prestigious journal , then accepted by the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society .
Nonetheless time passed , and after a while things began to appear in a different light .
Stasheff 's work was taken up into the theory of operads , of importance today in physics as well as in homotopy theory .
Independently , around 1978 these structures were rediscovered , but this time by combinatorialists instead of topologists .
The combinatorial structure of associahedra was specified as I have given it here in a paper by Huguet and Tamari , and it was asserted without proof by them that this was the face - graph of a polytope .
I am not sure what the background to that construction was , but Gil Kalai tells me that Tamari had been interested in general questions of associativity in algebra since his thesis of 1951 .
It was Kalai himself who named this structure an associahedron , and he called the problem of constructing the polytope explicitly to the attention of Mark Haiman , who then wrote down what was apparently the first detailed proof .
From that point on , the subject expanded rapidly , but Stasheff 's priority and the connection of associahedra with homotopy theory was not recognized by the combinatorialists until Mikhail Kapranov pointed it out .
He was one of the first to extend significantly the family of associahedra to include other polytopes of combinatorial interest .
The interest in associahedra and related polytopes continues to rise .
New relations with widely spread fields of mathematics are still appearing .
Developments have taken place in several different directions , all rather intriguing developments for such an intrinsically simple object .
One closest to the original combinatorial invention is that explained in work of Satyan Devadoss ( and a colleague or two ) which associates a polytope rather explicitly to any finite graph whatsoever .
Simplices come from a collection of unconnected nodes , associahedra from lines of connected ones .
This is Devadoss ' rendering of K 5 :

In chapter 9 , he discusses efficiently the theory of fiber polytopes , which extends the family of associahedra and has proven to be extremely useful in many branches of mathematics .
This in turn originated in the secondary polytopes of Israel Gelfand , Mikhail Kapranov , and Andrei Zelevinski , an earlier surprising extension .
Fiber polytopes have arisen most recently in the work of Gill Kalai 's colleague Erez Lapid and his associates in some work on James Arthur 's trace formula Bill Casselman

Most people would agree that in a hypothetical world where you had to kill one person from your own country ( a stranger to you ) versus one person from some other country ( also a stranger ) you would kill the foreigner .
But what if the question were , for example , a choice of killing one citizen from your own country versus two from another country ?
How about ten from another country , or a hundred ?
Where ’s your balance point ?
Assume none of the people “ have it coming . ”
In this hypothetical situation , we ’re not at war , and there is no greater good in the long run .
It ’s a simple choice of us or them .
How many from another country would you kill to save one of your own ?
Rudy Rucker has posted his kick - ass , weird - ass post - cyberpunk novel Postsingular to the net as a free , Creative Commons - licensed download .
I reviewed Postsingular when it came out earlier this month :
In Postsingular , a mad scientist creates a race of nants — nanites — that digest the planet and turn it into a computational simulation of Earth , called Vearth .
However , an autistic child memorizes a long string of numbers that poisons the nants and causes them to reverse themselves ( luckily , they 're engaged in reversible computation ) and put the planet back .
That 's the setup .
Some time later , another race of benign nanos are released on the earth , the Orphids .
Orphids are mezzoscale computers that organize themselves into an intelligent global network , tapping into every human brain and giving people access to outboard cognition facilities , so that anyone can drop out , tune in , and become hyperintelligent .
The orphidnetters are haunted by spooks from a parallel dimension , who seek to prevent them from using the smarts of the orphidnet to develop interdimensional travel .
Is Big Brother a Big Deal ?
This essay appeared as part of a point - counterpoint with Marcus Ranum .
Marcus ’s side , to which this is a response , can be found on his website .
Big Brother is n’t what he used to be .
George Orwell extrapolated his totalitarian state from the 1940s .
Today ’s information society looks nothing like Orwell ’s world , and watching and intimidating a population today is n’t anything like what Winston Smith experienced .
Data collection in 1984 was deliberate ; today ’s is inadvertent .
In the information society , we generate data naturally .
In Orwell ’s world , people were naturally anonymous ; today , we leave digital footprints everywhere .
1984 ‘s police state was centralized ; today ’s is decentralized .
Your phone company knows who you talk to , your credit card company knows where you shop and NetFlix knows what you watch .
Your ISP can read your email , your cell phone can track your movements and your supermarket can monitor your purchasing patterns .
There ’s no single government entity bringing this together , but there does n’t have to be .
As Neal Stephenson said , the threat is no longer Big Brother , but instead thousands of Little Brothers .
1984 ‘s Big Brother was run by the state ; today ’s Big Brother is market driven .
Data brokers like ChoicePoint and credit bureaus like Experian are n’t trying to build a police state ; they ’re just trying to turn a profit .
Of course these companies will take advantage of a national ID ; they ’d be stupid not to .
And the correlations , data mining and precise categorizing they can do is why the U.S. government buys commercial data from them .
1984 - style police states required lots of people .
East Germany employed one informant for every 66 citizens .
Today , there ’s no reason to have anyone watch anyone else ; computers can do the work of people .
1984 - style police states were expensive .
Today , data storage is constantly getting cheaper .
If some data is too expensive to save today , it ’ll be affordable in a few years .
And finally , the police state of 1984 was deliberately constructed , while today ’s is naturally emergent .
There ’s no reason to postulate a malicious police force and a government trying to subvert our freedoms .
Computerized processes naturally throw off personalized data ; companies save it for marketing purposes , and even the most well - intentioned law enforcement agency will make use of it .
Of course , Orwell ’s Big Brother had a ruthless efficiency that ’s hard to imagine in a government today .
But that completely misses the point .
A sloppy and inefficient police state is no reason to cheer ; watch the movie Brazil and see how scary it can be .
You can also see hints of what it might look like in our completely dysfunctional “ no - fly ” list and useless projects to secretly categorize people according to potential terrorist risk .
Police states are inherently inefficient .
There ’s no reason to assume today ’s will be any more effective .
The fear is n’t an Orwellian government deliberately creating the ultimate totalitarian state , although with the U.S. ’s programs of phone - record surveillance , illegal wiretapping , massive data mining , a national ID card no one wants and Patriot Act abuses , one can make that case .
It ’s that we ’re doing it ourselves , as a natural byproduct of the information society .
We ’re building the computer infrastructure that makes it easy for governments , corporations , criminal organizations and even teenage hackers to record everything we do , and — yes — even change our votes .
And we will continue to do so unless we pass laws regulating the creation , use , protection , resale and disposal of personal data .
It ’s precisely the attitude that trivializes the problem that creates it .

This is the party of the Southern strategy — the party that ran , like panting dogs , after the votes of segregationist whites who were repelled by the very idea of giving equal treatment to blacks .
Ronald Reagan , George H.W. ( Willie Horton ) Bush , George W. ( Compassionate Conservative ) Bush — they all ran with that lousy pack .
Dr. Carolyn Goodman , a woman I was privileged to call a friend , died last month at the age of 91 .
She was the mother of Andrew Goodman , one of the three young civil rights activists shot to death by rabid racists near Philadelphia , Miss. , in 1964 .
Dr. Goodman , one of the most decent people I have ever known , carried the ache of that loss with her every day of her life .
In one of the vilest moves in modern presidential politics , Ronald Reagan , the ultimate hero of this latter - day Republican Party , went out of his way to kick off his general election campaign in 1980 in that very same Philadelphia , Miss .
He was not there to send the message that he stood solidly for the values of Andrew Goodman .
He was there to assure the bigots that he was with them .
“ I believe in states ’ rights , ” said Mr. Reagan .
The crowd roared .
In 1981 , during the first year of Mr. Reagan ’s presidency , the late Lee Atwater gave an interview to a political science professor at Case Western Reserve University , explaining the evolution of the Southern strategy :
“ You start out in 1954 by saying , ‘ Nigger , nigger , nigger , ’ ” said Atwater .
“ By 1968 , you ca n’t say ‘ nigger ’ — that hurts you .
Backfires .
So you say stuff like forced busing , states ’ rights , and all that stuff .
You ’re getting so abstract now [ that ] you ’re talking about cutting taxes , and all these things you ’re talking about are totally economic things , and a byproduct of them is [ that ] blacks get hurt worse than whites . ”
In 1991 , the first President Bush poked a finger in the eye of black America by selecting the egregious Clarence Thomas for the seat on the Supreme Court that had been held by the revered Thurgood Marshall .
The fact that there is a rigid quota on the court , permitting one black and one black only to serve at a time , is itself racist .
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Former world number one Martina Hingis said on Thursday she had tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon this year and announced her retirement from professional tennis .
“ I have tested positive but I have never taken drugs and I feel 100 percent innocent , ” the five - times grand slam champion from Switzerland told a news conference .
Fighting back tears and with her voice cracking , Hingis read from a written statement before leaving the room without answering questions .
In an expanded version of the statement later released by her management , the 27 - year - old said she found the accusation of drug - taking “ so horrendous , so monstrous , that I have decided to confront it head - on by talking to the press . ”
The statement added : “ I would personally be terrified of taking drugs .
When I was informed ( about the test ) I was shocked and appalled . ”
Hingis added that she had undergone a private test that came back negative and consulted an attorney .
“ The attorney and his experts discovered various inconsistencies with the urine sample that was taken during Wimbledon .
“ He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me . ”
Hingis said she had also been advised that any fight to clear her name could drag on for years .
“ I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials , ” she said .
“ I am frustrated and angry .
“ I believe that I am absolutely , 100 percent innocent .
The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me , physically , to keep playing at the top of the game .
“ And frankly , accusations such as these do n’t exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so . ”
She added : “ And so , considering this situation , my age and the problems I have been having with my hip , I have decided to no longer play tennis on the Tour . ”

After rising to the top of her sport with a much - admired blend of grace and tactical astuteness , Hingis suffered a string of injuries that forced her to first hang up her racket in 2003 .
SURPRISE RETURN
She made a surprise return to the courts in 2006 , proving her doubters wrong as she went on to win two more titles and end the year as world number seven .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
A further , final , title followed in Tokyo this year before her injury problems returned .
In October , Hingis announced an early end to her season , citing hip problems .
Thursday ’s media conference was widely expected to see the former world number one announcing her retirement -- but not in the circumstances now set out .
The WTA Tour released a brief statement from chief executive officer Larry Scott on Thursday , mainly paying tribute to Hingis ’s achievements on the court .
“ The WTA Tour has not received any official information regarding the positive doping test result referred to ... and as a result we are not in a position to comment , ” Scott began before going on to praise the player ’s “ incredible touch , on - court intelligence and off - court professionalism . ”
Switzerland ’s national tennis association also highlighted Hingis ’s attributes as a player .
“ Martina Hingis was a great player who was always a role model and a figurehead for Swiss tennis , ” association president Rene Stammbach said in a statement .
“ We regret very much that Martina is ending her career faced with these recriminations . ”
After the deadly mayhem of September 16th , when gunmen paid by the private army Blackwater killed 17 civilians in Baghdad , Condoleezza Rice created a panel to review the State Department ’s use of mercenaries and propose new rules for their conduct :
Neither the U.S. military nor the State Department 's Diplomatic Security Service is prepared to assume responsibility for guarding diplomats and other official U.S. civilians , according to a Rice - appointed review panel that recommended the changes ...
The future of Blackwater , the security company involved in the Sept. 16 shooting incident , remains unresolved .
Once the FBI completes an investigation in Iraq , the panel 's report said , the embassy should recommend to Rice whether Blackwater should be allowed to continue working in Iraq .
The Baghdad government has publicly insisted that the company be held culpable but has made no formal demands , an administration official said .
" But my gut feeling is they have to leave , " the official said . [...]
" We do n't see the clarity here , " agreed Patrick F. Kennedy , the State Department official who headed the review .
The panel was " unaware of any basis for holding non-Department of Defense contractors accountable under U.S. law " and recommended that State " urgently engage " with the Justice Department " and then with Congress , to establish a clear legal basis " for accountability . [...]
They concluded that there is no real alternative to the use of private contractors to protect U.S. diplomats traveling outside the protected Green Zone in Baghdad .
The military , the report said , " does not consider it feasible or desirable . . . to take on responsibility " for diplomatic protection , although the need for such security will increase as U.S. troops begin to draw down .[ emphasis added ]
According to this report , the Iraqis have not made a " formal demand " that Blackwater leave Iraq , which contradicts earlier reports , and implies that all those public statements Iraqi prime minister Maliki has made were , I dunno , friendly suggestions .
This new report also implies that Blackwater will probably avoid any legal repercussions for its gunmen ’s wilding last month in Baghdad .
And what do we do about the problem ?
According to this report , there ’s nothing we can do : we ’re screwed .
But we already knew that :
In the short term , taking over in Iraq would require pulling [ Diplomatic Security Service ] agents from other assignments .
Training new agents " would take anywhere from 18 months to two years to identify them , do all the backgrounds , do the clearance work , seven months of basic training [ and ] follow - up training for high threats , " said Richard Griffin , the assistant secretary of state for Diplomatic Security , in recent testimony ...
But as criticism of State 's security operations grows , the downside of having a contractor army at its disposal -- and under its responsibility -- has become more apparent , the official said .
" With perfect 20 / 20 hindsight , " he said , " maybe four years ago we should have seen this coming . "
This is n’t just another example of the catastrophic incompetence of the Bush administration to plan for anything in post- invasion Iraq .
It ’s a perfect example of something I ’ve been writing about recently , the radical privatization of government .
We ’re paying for - profit entities to do something the government should be doing .
[ And Spencer Ackerman at TPM Muckraker points out that in the past the military did protect diplomats in war zones . ]
But think about the claim that the government can’t field sufficient numbers of properly vetted and trained personnel to protect US diplomats .
It leads to one of two possible conclusions .
There are qualified people but they tend to work as independent contractors for the only three private contractors ( Blackwater , Dyncorp and Triple Canopy ) authorized to bid on these contracts and not for the federal government .
The private companies offer no long - term job security or protections , they offer no health insurance when the mercenaries are n’t in the field , and they offer no pensions or other long - term benefits .
Therefore , we would have to conclude the individuals either do n’t want all the comparative perks of direct government employment , or the DS just wo n’t hire the qualified people already vetted , trained and available to do the job .
The other possible conclusion , of course , is that diplomats are getting sub - standard protections from private gunmen who do n't meet the high standards of full - time agents employed by the DS .
Neither conclusion is acceptable .
Either the federal government is giving private armies money that should and could be spent on soldiers or government employees , or it ’s giving money to private armies that are n’t qualified for the tasks they ’re being asked to perform .
The new rules authorized by Rice call for additional training of the gunmen working for the private armies .
You can bet the extra costs of the training wo n’t be eaten by the private armies , but will just be added to the rising bill already being paid by taxpayers .
Since the State Department has increased payments to private armies from $ 1 billion to $ 3 $ 4 billion per year since 2001 , one would think that State would also expand it ’s auditing and oversight capacity to meet this change .
Well , one might think that if we were n’t talking about an administration determined to give away to private crony businesses as much public money as possible :
Today , the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , the small State Department office that oversees the private security contractors in Iraq and elsewhere , is overwhelmed by its responsibilities to supervise the contractors , according to former employees , members of Congress and outside experts .
They say the office has grown too reliant on , and too close to , the 1,200 private soldiers who now guard American officials overseas . [...]
But the number of government employees issuing , managing and auditing contracts has barely grown .
" That ’s a criticism that ’s true of not just State but of almost every agency , " said Jody Freeman , an expert on administrative law at Harvard Law School .
Indeed , this is simply one of the more extreme and public cases of the federal government giving away more public money and not bothering to figure out if it ’s being properly spent .
We are now reaching the point where if the World Bank had lent us the money we ’re tossing around to private contractors in almost every area of government , we ’d probably be criticized as having lax financial controls and be accused of being a kleptocracy .
And with the amount of money ending up in the hands of private armies , pretty soon another epithet might end up applied to the recipients of our tax dollars : warlords .
Just now the furor over illegal immigration from Mexico is most wonderful a’boil , with much billingsgate and vituperation emanating from practically everywhere .
Well and good .
People should all afflict each other as vigorously as they can .
I mean , why were we put on earth if not to be disagreeable ?
Howsomever , I ’ve received email telling me how poorly educated the Mexicans are .
Hmmm . Maybe .
You can make a case for it .
I know that immigrant kids do terribly in school in the US , which augurs ill indeed .
Most kids do n’t read here either .
Still , I found myself wondering just how bad the Mexican schools really are .
My stepdaughter , Natalia , aged fourteen and in the eighth grade , attends a public school in downtown Guadalajara , La Escuela Estatal Secundaria Manuel M. Dieguez Numero 7 para Senoritas .
I am not an authority on Mexican education and cannot say whether hers is typical of urban Mexican schools .
Nor do I know enough about American middle schools in general to make comparisons .
The following are scans of pages from her texts of mathematics and biology accompanied by a few observations .
I found them interesting .
The translations are mine .
Please excuse the sloppy scans and slow loads .
From Mathematicas 2 ( ISBN 970-642-210-2 )
 Consider two urns , one with 13 balls numbered from 1 to 13 , and the other with 4 balls marked with the following figures : a red triangle , a red square , a black circle , or a black rhombus .
How many combinations can be obtained by drawing one ball from each urn ?
The possibilities can be represented by ordered pairs .
For example , if from the first urn is drawn the ball marked with 2 , and from the second , the ball with the square , the result is expressed thus : ( 2 , square ) .
The 52 pairs listed in the column to the left represent all possibilities
The probability of drawing an even number from the first urn is P ( even ) = 6/13 and the probability of drawing a red shape from the second urn is P ( red ) = 2/4 = ½.
If the two probabilities are multiplied , the following is the result :
P( even ) P( red ) = ( 6/13 ) ( 1/2 ) = 6/26 
Not Nobel math , but not too bad , I thought .
From Biologia 2 , her biology text :
" An important property of phospholipid bilayers is that they behave as liquid crystals ; the carbohydrates and proteins can turn , and move laterally … . "
Note internal hydrophobic tails and external hydrophilic heads .
This is not too shabby .
In the next pages is an account of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration , the 36 molecules of adenosine triphosphate resulting from aerobic glycolysis , and so on .
Early in Biologia 2 is a treatment of the role of RNA , including the substitution of uracil for thymine , transcription as distinct from translation , and the functions of messenger , transfer , and ribosomal RNA .
Polypeptides are described and peptide bonds mentioned , but not with the NH3 - COOH dehydration synthesis .
A typical vocab list :  Endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , endocytosis , ribosomes , cellular membrane . 
Then ,  The synthesis proceeds only in the 5 ′ - 3 ′ sense , which means that the chain that is being copied is read … . "
Also , ( above ) " DNA is formed by the union of five atoms : carbon ( C ) , oxygen ( O ) , hydrogen ( H ) , nitrogen ( N ) , and phosphorus ( P ) .
The DNA molecule can be decomposed into the monomers that form it .
There are called nucleotides , each of which contains three parts : a sugar of five carbons , deoxyribose ; the phosphate ; and a nitrogenous base , either adenine ( A ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , or thymine ( T ) .
Two of these bases , adenine and guanine , are structures of two rings and are called purines , while the other two , thymine and cytosine , have only one ring and are called pyrimidines . 
All of this has a notable resemblance to real if basic molecular biology .
I ’m not sure that it is anything to be embarrassed about .
Biologia 2 has a 31 - page section on human reproduction that is purely scientific as distinct from socially propagandistic .
There is no indoctrination about homosexual rights or oppression of the transgendered .
The coverage is detailed and complete , with cutaway drawings of the genitalia , detailed discussion of meiosis as compared with mitosis , primary meiotic division , secondary meiotic division with prophase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase nicely laid out ; chromatin , centromeres , and centrioles explained , and so on at length .
There is an explanation of the menstrual cycle complete with a graph of variations of body temperature ; description of embryonic growth ; a table of tissues and organs arising from endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm ; and explanations of various venereal diseases and how to avoid them .
The treatment is neither prurient nor prissy .
It is just biological :
Here is how the lungs work , here is how the heart works , here is how the reproductive organs work .
Consequences however are presented straightforwardly .
For example , there is a photograph of a primary syphilitic sore , which doubtless persuades students that they do n’t want any and , in the section of what we would call  substance abuse ,  a photo of a badly cirrhotic liver , sectioned .
There are no pretty pictures for the sake of having pretty picture .
All graphics have a direct bearing on the material being studied .
It may be that all of this is now standard in the eighth - grade in the United States .
For all I know , American texts may be more advanced .
I ca n’t make comparisons with things I do n’t know about .
But these do not seem to me to be bad books .
Certainly when I was an eight - grader we did n’t get much of this ; when I went on a physiology kick , I had to find a university text .
Still , I have my doubts as to whether the big-city schools in America are greatly ahead of Guadalajara .
Detroit recently had , and probably still has , a forty - seven per cent rate of functional illiteracy .
Guadalajara does n’t .
If someone were inspired to compare the foregoing material with what students , if so they can be called , are learning in downtown schools in , say , Washington , DC , Chicago , and New York , I would be interested to see the results .
It will be said , correctly , that the cities of America are populated by extensive underclasses of blacks and Hispanics .
True enough .
However , they are still American kids ( now or soon to be ) who are learning nothing .
Natalia would eat them alive .
I have some familiarity with the suburban , mostly white schools of Arlington County , Virginia , just outside of Washington , because my daughters went to them .
At least one of these schools served populations living in very pricey neighborhoods .
The girls came home with misspelled handouts from affirmative - action science teachers , and they learned about Harriet Tubman and oppression .
Of the sciences they learned very little .
I knew bright kids who had trouble with the multiplication tables .
Yes , there are schools and schools , some better than others , and advanced - placement and such .
I do not suggest that Mexico has a great school system , because it does n’t .
Yet Natalia , in her particular school , is better off than she would be in Washington , heaven knows , or the Virginia suburbs .
Ain’t that something ?

Why search for parking for hours in a crowded place with our cars when there is an environment friendly , electric mini car that is easily rented , driven and parked .
When I visited Belgium last year , I saw a number of spots where bicycles were stationed next to each other .
This service brought by Cyclocity , provides sturdy and comfortable bicycles to be rented by tourists and others every hour and day of the week .
These were placed in different strategic places in Brussels , and it was very nice to see different people using this service instead of taking a car , taxi , or bus .
Especially in large cities that are highly congested , driving your car sometimes just does n’t pay off .
Finding parking , paying for gas , and time spent for the two can sometimes be a burden .
The MIT Media Lab Group , Smart Cities , is currently developing an electric CITY CAR , which will enrich our lives , change mass transit , and help reduce pollution .
It is being tested and further developed in New York City .
If you have visited NYC you probably know how parking and transportation there is a never ending dilemma .
The concept of these cars is similar to the shopping carts at your local super market : easy , convenient , and space efficient .
These are to be â€˜stackedâ€™ behind one another in convenient and prime locations .
By being stacked , they take up less space and are able to be provided for more individuals .
The City Car has space for two and is strong enough to take a trip around the city with it .
So how does it stack up ?
A part of the car stands up in order for the one behind it to stack up straight against it ( also charging the electric motor ) .
A group of six or eight of the City Cars would occupy approximately one conventional space .
The design of the car is based on a “ robot wheel ” that holds the motor , suspension and steering .
These little cars look so fun to drive and park , I hope to try them out one day .

Ray Bradbury : Real problem not censorship but television David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 4 , 2007 Print This Email
This Contrary to widespread critical and mass opinion accumulated over fifty years , author Ray Bradbury insists that his classic novel Fahrenheit 451 , originally published in 1953 during the McCarthy era , is n't really about government censorship .
According to the renowned author , " We 've never had censorship in this country and we 've never burned books .
There are temporary lapses . "
He says that when teachers or librarians tell him his books have been removed from the shelves , he simply tells them to put them back again .
Bradbury explains that when he wrote Fahrenheit 451 , " I was n't worried about freedom .
I was worried about people being turned into morons by tv . "
He insists that the book was about " the proliferation of giant screens " and that we are now living in the period of history described in his novel .
In an August 2001 interview with Salon , Bradbury said of George W. Bush , " He 's wonderful .
We needed him .
Clinton is a shithead and we 're glad to be rid of him . "
In 2004 , he became extremely upset over Michael Moore 's use of the title " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and was quoted by Swedish interviewers as saying , " " Michael Moore is a screwed asshole ....
He is a horrible human being . "
The following video is from Ray Bradbury 's website .
Earlier this week , I read an article that really made me reconsider my tentative decision to send my child to private school .
More Parents Uproot Their Lives
In Search of a Perfect Education tells the story of the O’Gorman family , who basically sacrificed the home their children had grown up in and their lifelong social environment in order to enroll their children in a private school in another state .
Why ?
They felt that the educational options near them were not good enough for their child and they were willing to drop $ 50,000 a year on that assumption .
In the past , I ’ve been
a big believer in private school for my child , as I bought into the general idea that not only are America ’s public schools vastly inferior to private schools , but they were also far worse than public schools in other countries as well .
This fact is consistently pounded into our head by not only the mainstream media , but also by the government itself via the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
What ’s the basis for this criticism of America ’s schools ?
One big piece of this criticism comes from documentation produced by the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
In particular , in July 2006 , they released a report entitled Comparing Private Schools and Public Schools Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling ( link goes to pdf of the report ) .
Right off the bat in this report , when discussing fourth grade reading , the report says “ the average private school mean reading score was 14.7 points higher than the average public school reading score . ”
Wow , that ’s a talking point right there , is n’t it ?
From just that sentence alone , media reports condemning the public schools in America flew forth , probably helping the O’Gorman family to make their $ 50,000 decision .
But the next sentence is quite interesting : “ After adjusting for selected student characteristics , the difference in means was near zero and not significant . ”
What does that mean ?
It merely means if they divide the fourth graders up into smaller pieces of pie ( such as divisions based on race , income level , and so forth ) and compared equivalent pie pieces between private schools and public schools , there was no statistical difference between private schools and public schools .
How can this possibly be ?
This is the result of a statistical phenomenon known as Simpson ’s paradox .
Simpson ’s paradox says that the successes of several groups appear to be reversed when the statistics are combined
Let me show you how this works .
Let ’s say that we wanted to compare private school students and public school students based solely on the income levels of their parents .
Of the 50,000 public school students tested , 49,000 had parents that made less than $ 200,000 a year , while only 1,000 had parents that made more than $ 200,000 .
On the other hand , of the 50,000 private school students tested , only 1,000 had parents that made less than $ 200,000 a year , while 49,000 had parents that made more than $ 200,000 a year .
Now , according to this report , all of the students whose parents made more than $ 200,000 a year , regardless of whether the school was private or public , did roughly the same on these tests – let ’s say these students averaged a 90 on the test , while the poorer students averaged a 70 on the test .
If you look at just the private schools , their students averaged an 89.6 on the tests , while the public school students averaged a 70.4 on the tests even though all of the poor children did the same and the rich children did the same regardless of their schooling .
This paper fell completely into Simpson ’s paradox
It actually reports that public education and private education in America are roughly equal , even though private school students score higher .
Why ?
Demographics .
Private school test scores are better because the demographics of their students are tilted highly towards groups that do well no matter whether they ’re schooled in public or private schools .
If you ’re paying for private school , you ’re not paying for a great education – you ’re paying for demographics
The report actually says that on average , your student wo n’t do better on standardized tests in private school compared to public school ; the only thing that makes a difference is their race , their income level , and their parents ’ involvement in their education .
You know all of those doomsday stories about how America ’s schools are falling behind those of other nations ?
Those reports are similarly flawed because of Simpson ’s paradox .
Take South Korea , for example .
Their test scores in math and science dominate America and I do admire their strong education system .
But read that article more closely : only 60 % of their students of high school age actually attend high school ; the “ bottom ” 40 % are actually funneled into separate vocational schools .
Thus , when standardized tests compare 12th graders in Korea and 12th graders in the United States , if you individual compare demographic groups , the United States does at least as well as Korea , but if you combine all students as a whole , South Korea appears to dominate the United States .
That ’s because their high schools , much like private schools in the United States , are full of students whose personal demographics are universally geared towards greater educational success regardless of the schools .
This same phenomenon is true in many countries ; the United States is relatively rare in that they place all students in the same high schools and they have compulsory attendance requirements .
Most of the nations that exceed the United States in average scores have high schools that are demographically skewed in some fashion .
The best investment you can make in your child ’s education is by being involved .
Your involvement is a factor you can control – your race and ( to a degree ) your other demographics ca n’t be changed .
Instead of dropping $ 50,000 on getting your kid into that ultimate private school , tone down your career a bit and get involved : find out what your child is interested in , be involved and interested in their homework , and let them know that they really are important to you .
Love is the one investment in your child that can really pay off .

Earlier today Nicole posted video from a House hearing dealing with allegations that State Department Inspector General Howard " Cookie " Krongard impeded investigations into corruption in Iraq .
During the hearing , Krongard repeatedly denied rumors that his brother , Buzzy Krongard was on Blackwater 's advisory board -- but on tonight 's Countdown we learned that lo and behold , after returning from a break in testimony , Krongard informed the Committee that he had just spoken with his brother and that he did , in fact , sit on Blackwater 's board and that he was recusing himself from any further matters dealing with the mercenary contractor .
He may want to consider lawyering up .
Cookie said under oath that he had spoken to his brother six weeks prior to the hearing and claims his brother failed to tell him he was going to join Blackwater 's advisory board , but according to an interview given to TPM , Buzzy claims he DID tell Cookie he was going to join Blackwater 's board two or three weeks before the hearing , which would put his brother 's claims in question .
Who should be believe , Cookie or Buzzy ?
Quotas on arrests or citations are never a good idea , and are illegal for California traffic officers , but the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department has been doing the next worst thing .
A Times investigation discovered that the department has been holding informal competitions among deputies since July to see how many people they could arrest in a 24 - hour period , or how many vehicles they could impound .
A contest that encourages officers to boost arrests without regard to their quality leads to abusive police conduct and public cynicism .
Aside from the obvious fact that it could prompt questionable arrests by officers eager to win , it could taint some criminal cases .
Indeed , on Thursday , the county public defenders office launched an investigation into the arrests made during one of the contests , and may challenge them in court .
The organizer of the contests , Lt. James Tatreau , says they were simply an effort to motivate deputies , and the award for winning was nothing more than “ bragging rights . ”
Good - conduct citations are a more fitting motivational tool .
To his credit , Sheriff Lee Baca stopped the contests after he was informed about them by a reporter .
But why did he find out about them from The Times , which learned of the contests from an internal Sheriff ’s Department memo ?
Baca operates the nation ’s biggest jail system and oversees about 8,000 deputies .
The scale and complexity of his agency are such that he usually gets the benefit of the doubt when , say , a jail inmate is improperly classified and ends up strangling his cellmate , as happened in May ; or a celebutante sentenced to 45 days in jail is released after less than four , as happened in the Paris Hilton case in June ; or auditors reveal that sheriff ’s executives have been accepting expensive gifts and entertainment from a jail contractor , as happened last week .

These things do start to pile up , though .
In addition to the above , Baca has failed to break up a disturbing , gang - like clique of deputies in Lynwood even though the same station was hit with multimillion - dollar lawsuits for similar activity in the 1990s , and his claims of poverty as an excuse for not fixing overcrowding in the jails have worn thin in the face of ever - larger budget allocations from county supervisors .
Whether the Sheriff ’s Department is a rudderless ship or one that ’s too unwieldy for any captain to steer straight is an open question , but it ’s hitting too many rocks .
The teaser ads posted in New York showed an open lock and a headline : either " The best devices have no limits " or " Phones should be open to anything " .
They must have mystified a few people , but Apple fans had no doubt what they were about : Nokia was exploiting the furore over last week 's iPhone firmware update .
This not only plugged a bunch of security holes , it wiped out users ' unapproved applications , and " bricked " some phones hacked to unlock them from AT&T .
How galling to see Nokia promoting its N Series phones with lines like : " Open to applications .
Open to widgets .
Open to anything .
So go ahead and load it up .
What it does is up to you . "
But there was no deceit on Apple 's part .
Right from the beginning , its chief executive Steve Jobs had told Newsweek : " You do n't want your phone to be an open platform , " and that AT&T " does n't want to see their West Coast network go down because some application messed up " .
( Except that AT&T encourages people to run apps on its other smart phones . )
It seems remarkable that so many people could either fail to get the message , or could somehow convince themselves that Apple did n't really mean it .
The answer , I think , is that Apple has been a personal computer company for 30 years , and everybody knows you can run whatever applications you want on your own computer .
The iPhone was launched at a computer event ( MacWorld ) , it runs a computer operating system ( OS X ) and it does computer things like web browsing .
How could it not be a computer ?
Well , the fact is that Apple has launched the iPhone as an old - style locked - down system , just like it was 1999 .
Meanwhile the mobile phone industry is going in the opposite direction .
That is partly because today 's top - end smart phones are based on operating systems that originated in the computer industry , not the phone industry .
Examples include Symbian ( which came out of Psion ) , Palm , Microsoft 's Windows Mobile and Linux .
Nokia has even stopped calling them phones .
In its press releases , it says things like " the Nokia N95 is an all - in - one multimedia computer " .
Nokia also makes clear that : " Because multimedia computers have a programmable operating system , people can download and install software applications . "
What seems odd is that Apple is going in the opposite direction .
It has already dropped the Computer from its name , and is becoming a consumer electronics company .
Yes , it still sells Mac Pro tower systems that can be expanded at will , but the bulk of Apple 's computer sales are of relatively closed portables and the iMac , which is basically a large portable with the keyboard detached .
The Mac mini and Apple TV designs , all the iPods and the iPhone show a company increasingly in love with sealed boxes designed for consumers , not for geeks .
Of course , this was always Steve Jobs 's way .
The original 1984 Mac - which succeeded Steve Wozniak 's " open " Apple II design - was a sealed box with no expansion slots .
It was intended to be an appliance , like a Maytag washing machine or drier .
" And have you ever heard of a Maytag users group ? " quipped Jobs ( tinyurl.com/yu5x8l ) .
There 's nothing wrong with this idea , of course : the number of ordinary consumers is very much bigger than the number of people who want to tinker with their systems .
But Jobs may just have gone a bit too far in locking down the iPhone .
This could mark the beginning of the end of the geek love affair with Apple .

Polygamous husbands settling in Britain with multiple wives can claim extra benefits for their " harems " even though bigamy is a crime in the UK , it has emerged .
Opposition MPs are demanding an urgent change in the law , claiming that the Government is recognising and rewarding a custom which has no legal status and which is " alien " to this country 's cultural traditions .
scroll down for more
Officials said yesterday a review was now under way into whether the state should continue to pay out income support , jobseeker 's allowance and housing and council tax benefits to ' extra ' spouses .
Islamic law allows a man to take up to four wives , providing he can provide for them fairly and equally .
But British law only ever recognises one spouse , while bigamy is punishable by up to seven years in jail .
However , if a husband and his wives arrive and settle in Britain having wed in a country where polygamy is legal , then the UK benefits system recognises his extra wives as dependents and pays them accordingly .
The Department of Work and Pensions admitted yesterday it had no figures on how many families are claiming for multiple wives .
Official DWP guidelines on housing and council tax benefit states : " If you were legally married to more than one partner under the laws of a country that permits this , then your relationship is called a polygamous marriage .
" In this case your household consists of you and any partners who live with you and to whom you are married . "
Officials were unable to say when the rules were brought in , claiming they had " evolved over decades " .
Tory MP for Monmouth David Davies condemned the arrangements as " appalling " , and called for an immediate halt to the payments .
He said : " People who come to this country must be prepared to abide by our laws and rules .
Polygamy is completely alien to our cultural and legal tradition , and it 's disgraceful that our benefits system is recognising and rewarding it .
" Why are some people in Government falling over themselves to undermine every tradition that has made this country what it is ? "
Mr Davies warned that human rights laws and equality regulations could open the door for gays to demand similar recognition for multiple partnerships , with groups of men or women presenting themselves as polygamous " families " .
Hugh McKinney , of the National Family Campaign , said : " Polygamy has never been tolerated under Britain 's legal system .
" People arriving from another country should conform to our laws rather than the other way around . "
There are thought to be thousands of polygamous marriages in Britain not recognised in law - mostly within the Muslim community .
Muslim couples are only married in the eyes of the state if they undergo a register office wedding as well as a Nikah , or religious ceremony .
A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said it was quite common for men here to undergo more than one Nikah with different wives .
This does not count as bigamy since only the first marriage is legally recognised .
A DWP official insisted the rules did not " reward " polygamy , as second wives receive less in benefits than single women .
A single person can claim just under £ 60 per week in jobseeker 's allowance , while couples receive up to £ 92.80 , but each ' additional spouse ' in a polygamous marriage receives an extra £ 33.65 .
The custom that refuses to die out
Marrying multiple wives remains a widespread custom in many countries in North Africa and the Middle East - and is tolerated unofficially in parts of the United States .
Some more secular Muslim countries such as Turkey and Tunisia do not allow polygamy at all , while it is relatively common in traditionalist Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia , although it is estimated that as few as 3 per cent of Islamic marriages across the world are polygamous .
Most of the major world faiths allowed multiple wives in ancient times , including Judaism and Christianity .
The Christian church has condemned polygamy - since the late 4th and early 5th century AD .
The U.S. Mormon Church promoted polygamy in the mid 19th Century , but the practice was outlawed in 1862 , and the church followed suit 30 years later .
Today , mainstream Mormons are excommunicated for polygamy , but the practice survives among an estimated 40,000 members of extremist splinter groups in Utah , with spin - off " colonies " in neighbouring states , Canada and Mexico .
Police in Utah mostly tolerate polygamy provided those involved do not break other laws .
The issue still causes deep concern , however , surrounding underage marriage , forced marriage and inbreeding .

Unlike Internet Explorer toolbar , Windows Explorer does not allow you to customize the toolbar to the point of adding shortcuts to folders , programs or icons for frequently used commands .
But fortunately there is a way to simulate adding items to the toolbar , by using the Favorites menu in Windows Explorer .
By using the Favorites folder , adding frequently accessed folders or executing commands will allow quick access with out the need to navigate through the file system .
A lot of people may get confused with Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer .
Windows Explorer is the program used to navigate around your file system .
When you click on a folder or a shortcut to a folder , Windows Explorer opens .
Just like Internet Explorer , Windows Explorer also has a Favorite menu :
The Favorites folder is where you can add folders , programs or commands that can be quickly launched as if you added them to the toolbar area .
To get started , open the Favorites folder found in your user profile directory ( C: \Documents and Settings\username \ Favorites ) or by clicking on Start \ Run… and type favorites in the run box and click OK .
Once you have opened the Favorites folder , clean up and delete any items you no longer need .
When finished with clean up , navigate to any folder you want to add to Favorites , highlight the folder , and click on Favorites \ Add to Favorites … from the menu then click OK .
You can add the folder to the root of Favorites , or organize into separate folders .
As a System Administrator , I have a need to quickly execute commands , batch files or launch programs when I 'm working in Windows Explorer .
To do this , open the Favorites folder using the same method as above .
Once in the Favorites folder , right click on a blank space and and select New .
From here , select Shortcut and add any executables , programs or applications that you want to launch from the Favorites menu while using Windows Explorer .

( Representing the district in Washington State I grew up in )
Representative Inslee ,
It has been with great pride that I have read of my original home stateâ€™s leadership in the growing movement across the nation to hold the Bush Administration accountable for their plethora of crimes and misdemeanors through the process of impeachment .
As one of three states – Vermont and New Mexico being the others – that have impeachment resolutions broiling in their capitals , Washington Stateâ€˜s citizens are doing their patriotic duty to insist that their public officials honor their oaths of office to defend our nation against the domestic enemies to the Constitution of the United States of America currently residing in the White House .
As a native Bainbridge Islander , where you now reside , I am appalled by your stance against the impeachment resolution proffered by State Sen. Eric Oemig ( D - WA ) as being â€ œa waste of timeâ€ .
Your political partner in this obstruction of justice mission at the behest of the national Democratic Party leadership , Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) revealed her shallow knowledge of the impeachment bill , Senate Joint Memorial 8016 itself when she offered two words in opposition to it : â€ œDick Cheneyâ€ .
Oemigâ€™s bill calls for impeachment investigations to commence against both President Bush AND the Vice President .
Vice President Cheney , who has indicated he may ignore subpoenas , will be triple indicted for every â€ ˜Wâ€™ crime revealed and could easily be convicted through â€˜open sourceâ€™ evidence discovered by a googling Bainbridge High School â€ ˜Câ€™ student .
As sympathetic as I am to Democrats wishing to move forward with their positive agenda , choosing to ignore the past six years would be as naive as a victim of domestic assault not wanting to press charges .
The result will eventually be more of the same .
You are just going to get beaten again , and probably much more viciously .
It is not a matter of â€œifâ€ , but â€œwhenâ€ – maybe next time to death .
We were bitten by a snake .
The wound must be lanced and the venom removed , or it will leech into our collective bloodstream and inevitably target our national heart .
Allowing this wound to â€œheal overâ€ not only wonâ€™t lead to a healthy future , it will assure the exact opposite .
Crimes have been committed .
Not a few .
Very , very many .
Not just the break - in of a campaign office or a President getting lipstick on his cigar in the Oral Office .
People have died because of these crimes – the lives of hundreds of thousands of families irretrievably destroyed .
Some of these crimes are gross violations of the Geneva Accords and Nuremberg Principles – identical to those for which Nazis were convicted and put to death .
Our national treasury has been looted to the benefit of crony corporations – the largest surplus in U.S. history â€˜mismanagedâ€™ into the largest deficit , and we are still counting as news of billions of taxpayer dollars in cash having been shipped on crates into the Iraq War zone surface .

Anyone who has taken the time to read the Military Commission act as I have knows that the U.S. Constitution has had its throat cut and is lying in the gutter with no promise of a single Democratic Senator or Representative bending a knee to save its life .
The investigative work into prewar lies and related matters by Head of the House Judiciary Committee , Representative John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , has already been comprehensively executed , it just needs to be spoken into the Congressional Record during impeachment hearings as published in George W. Bush versus the U.S. Constitution .
More crimes are likely to be unearthed in the process as the antiseptic of truth throws light on this dark era .
The Center for Constitutional Rights , The Bush Crimes Commission , WorldCantWait.org , AfterDowningStreet.org , Democrats , com , Progressive Democrats of America and ImpeachforPeace.org , among others , have also laid out remarkably comprehensive reports on the crimes of George W.

We are a nation of laws .
No American is above the law .
The appropriate remedy for the temporary resident public servants in these federal offices who violate the law is impeachment .
We arenâ€™t shopping for shoes here , Condi .
This isnâ€™t an optional step .
This is prosecution of law deeply seated in the Constitution of the United States as it used to exist – indeed our very , inalienable moral fiber .
To not enforce these laws is to set ourselves up for history to repeat itself in short order , as we are experiencing now at the hands of those not prosecuted for their Iran - Contra crimes .
To not undo the new preposterously overgrown Executive authority is to invite some future President – ANY future President – to snap his or her fingers and become a virtual dictator in a heartbeat .

A waste of time ?
Consider this :
Senate Republicans , when handed a recommendation to impeach by the House will be faced with a very tough choice as the world watches them confront a most stubborn , arrogant and unrepentant Connecticut Cowboy President and his mephistophelian inner circle :
a ) .
Fight impeachment and continue to be revealed as rubber - stamping , lick spittle enablers of Treasonous War Criminals who were intent on a heavy - handed crackdown and takeover of all things American .
Vote â€ œNoâ€ and get washed out in the second Blue Wave of 2008 .
b ) .
Play the â€œI had no idea all of this was going onâ€ card to desperately distance themselves from Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , Ashcroft , Abramoff , Ney , DeLay , et al , vote â€ œYesâ€ and possibly hang onto their cushy position of power through the next election cycle .
Would you go down with this â€˜soaringâ€ ™ Hindenburg ?
Impeachment isnâ€™t a good or bad idea .
Impeachment is a moral imperative .
It is the proper remedy prescribed by our founding fathers for circumstances precisely such as these .
Impeachment is essential for the hope of future health of our nation .
We the People must impeach those who regard America , its military , its electorate and sovereign foreign nations simply resources to exploit in order to fatten their bank accounts and expand their personal power .
Representative Inslee , leaders all over the United States of America are calling out for Justice .
Lead , follow , or please have the decency to step down from your office .

An Australian woman is facing child abduction charges in the US after trying to bring her 17 - year - old World of Warcraft boyfriend back to Oz .
Tamara Broome , a 31 - year - old university student , was arrested on June 26 after she flew from Adelaide to the boy 's home in Greenville , North Carolina to pick up her internet beau .
Broome allegedly had an online relationship with the boy for more than a year , which began in the online game World of Warcraft .
The two had also exchanged copious amounts of email and even discussed marriage .
The Azerothian love - affair has sent Broome to Pitt County Detention Centre where she will get a July 11 court date .
Police have seized her laptop computer and charged Broome with attempting to abduct a child .
If convicted she will face more than two years in a US jail .
Broome is currently being held on a $ 2.35 m bond .
( WoW equipment could not be seized by authorities , as it is soulbound . )
Tamara Broome
According to Australian news sources , Broome 's relatives allege the teenager 's parents set her up , even springing for the [ air fare ] to frame her .
But Pitt County Sheriff detectives call the allegations " ridiculous , " claiming they will not discuss who fronted for the ticket " because that 's part of the evidence , we can't get into that . "
Authorities became involved when the parents reported the boy missing June 12 .
He was found later that day at Raleigh - Durham International Airport trying to catch a flight to Australia to see the woman .
Investigators later discovered that Broome was coming to the US and apprehended her as she stepped of a train at Rocky Mount station in North Carolina .
Under North Carolina law , a minor is considered someone under the age of 18 .
Besides , any WoW player could tell you in a 18/31 spread , the experience would be lousy anyway . ®

The suit against Coors for a drunk driving accident
Anthony J. Sebok , FindLaw Columnist
Special to CNN.com
FOR THE PUBLIC Select a topic Autos Bankruptcy Consumer Criminal Law Divorce Employment Estate Planning Family Immigration Landlord - Tenant Personal Injury Taxes Legal commentary from FindLaw's Writ LAW DICTIONARY
( FindLaw ) -- Recently , in Nevada , 19 - year - old Ryan Pisco drank beer at a party , got drunk , drove his car into a pole , and died .
Now Ryan 's mother , Jodie , is suing Coors Brewing Co. for allegedly causing Ryan 's death .
Pisco alleges that Coors " promotes " underage drinking , and by doing so , breached a duty to protect Ryan from drinking and driving .
Like the " Big Fat " lawsuit against Burger King Pisco 's lawsuit is interesting from both a legal and a social point of view .
In the end , it may turn out to be frivolous .
Yet it 's possible that even " frivolous " lawsuits serve a useful purpose in the messy world of American tort law .
Is there a legal basis for Pisco 's lawsuit ?
I have not read Pisco 's complaint , but based on media accounts of her case , it seems that she is , at a minimum , on very thin ice legally .
Coors has a number of duties , under tort law , to the public -- but they probably do not include the duty for which Pisco is arguing .
To begin , Coors was not the seller or server of the beer Ryan drank -- so it does not have the duties that a bar or , in some states , a party host , has .
As a manufacturer , Coors has a duty to produce a defect - free product -- one that is not adulterated , for instance .
But Pisco is not saying Coors 's beer was defective .
In addition , if there were an unusual aspect of Coors 's product that might lead to injury , Coors would have a duty to warn the public .
( For instance , the manufacturers of Pop Tarts were sued on the theory that microwaved Pop - Tarts are allegedly deceptively cool on the outside , leading consumers to burn their mouths . )
But Pisco does not seem to be saying that Coors failed to adequately warn Ryan about the effect its beer has on driving skills .
Moreover , any such failure to warn was probably harmless , in the sense that teenagers typically know , from high school health classes and the like , about the effects of alcohol and the reasons one should not drive drunk .
As a licensed driver , in addition , Ryan was likely educated on this subject as a prerequisite for getting his license .
Is Coors 's advertising unreasonable ?
Is there any legal basis , then , for Pisco 's suit ?
Possibly -- but it would have to come from Coors 's advertising , not its beer .
Pisco may try to predicate her suit on Coors 's advertising -- on one of two theories .
The first is that a message in the advertising created an unreasonable risk to Pisco , and that this unreasonable risk was foreseeable to Coors .
The argument , I suppose , is that the message Coors 's advertising might have been reasonably safe for adults , but not for minors such as Ryan .
What facts might support this argument ?
If evidence were to show that Coors knew that its advertising ? especially print ads in magazines with under - 21 readers ? would get minors interested in drinking Coors beer , that might be helpful to Pisco 's case .
( The U.S. government is making a similar argument , based on similar evidence , in its current racketeering suit against the tobacco industry . )
But making this argument will be an uphill battle .
Coors , like all businesses , has a First Amendment right to advertise .
And advertisers can , at times , be held liable under tort -- but only in limited circumstances .
Proof that Coors 's ads increased underage drinking would not be enough .
More proof would be required : First , Pisco would need proof that the advertising was unreasonable .
Second , she would need proof that the aspect of it that was unreasonable caused Ryan 's death .
Was Coors 's advertising unreasonable ?
Or , put another way , is it unreasonable to expose minors to the message that drinking beer is fun , or associated with other traits desired by young adults ( such as sex ) ?
Probably not .
Unlike in the case of tobacco , there 's nothing inherently or directly harmful in drinking beer .
What is harmful is the risk that one will drive afterwards , and get into an accident .
And Coors 's ads do n't endorse or encourage drunk driving .
Is Coors 's advertising deceptive ?
Alternatively , Pisco could argue that the advertising by Coors was deceptive .
To succeed on this theory , Pisco would not have to show that Coors created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk .
Instead , she would simply have to show that Coors 's advertising was false or misleading in some way , and that the false or misleading aspect of the advertisement played a causal role in the plaintiff 's injury .
Plaintiffs in cases against " Big Tobacco " have used just this type of consumer fraud claim in a number of contexts .
They have alleged , for instance , that advertisements misled youth into thinking that smoking was healthy -- and that advertisements misled smokers into believing that " light " cigarettes were less harmful than normal " full flavor " cigarettes .
What similar theory could Pisco use ?
The alleged misrepresentation would have to connected to drinking and driving -- the direct cause of Ryan 's death .
If Pisco could show that Coors 's advertisements misled Ryan into believing that he could drive while intoxicated , that proof might work .
Alternatively , if Pisco could show that the advertisements misled Ryan into believing that driving while intoxicated was not dangerous , that proof might also work .
But unless a Coors advertisement actually showed , say , an adept drunk driver , such proof would probably be impossible to come by .
Can an attack on ' glamorizing ' ads work ?
What if Pisco suggested , instead , that Coors advertisements were misleading and deceptive in that they glamorized drinking , and made drinkers seem powerful and invulnerable -- a message to which Ryan , as a teenager , was especially vulnerable ?
This theory , too , is weak .
But there is one precedent that supports it .
In 1983 , in Committee on Children 's Television , Inc. v. General Foods , the California Supreme Court allowed a consumer fraud suit to go forward based on similarly vague , general allegations .
There , the plaintiff argued that General Foods -- through advertisements shown between Saturday morning cartoons -- misled children into believing , for instance , that " breakfast [ cereals ] inherently possess and / or impart to those ingesting them magical powers . "
General Foods argued that since the harm alleged was the cost of the cereal , and parents -- the cereal purchasers -- would not be misled by such claims , that should be the end of the matter .
But the court disagreed .
This California decision , however , is unusual .
Most courts would only let a consumer fraud suit proceed based on specific allegations directly connecting an aspect of the advertising at issue , to the harm the plaintiff suffered .
And Pisco , it seems , will probably not be able to make this type of allegation closely connecting particular aspects of Coors 's advertising with her son 's death .
Even a ' frivolous ' suit may be useful
So why do I still think that Pisco suit against Coors serves a useful purpose ?
It is because suits like this remind us that contemporary advertising is a powerful and potentially destructive force in society .
I have no doubt that many advertisements are causally related to a wide range of outcomes which I deplore ?
from smoking , to the consumption of fast food , to the purchase and use of gas - guzzling SUVs .
But tort law , with its strict rules about individual responsibility and causation , is not the right way to correct advertising 's ills .
Some things have to be confronted politically , through collective action and regulation .
The bottom line is this :
If Jodie Pisco does n't like the effects of advertising on minors , she should seek out her congressperson , not her lawyer .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani urged NATO to admit Australia , India , Israel , Japan and Singapore on Wednesday as part of proposals to combat Islamic extremism .
Speaking to a U.S. - British conservative group in London , Giuliani said Britain and the United States must stand side - by - side in tackling Islamic terrorism .
“ This is no time for defeatism and appeasement , ” he said .
He also ruled out a “ pre-determined timetable ” for a U.S. pullout from Iraq and said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was right to reject such a timetable for British forces .
Victory there should depend on reaching a point at which Iraq could be maintained as a U.S. ally “ in the terrorist war against us ” , said Giuliani , Republican frontrunner in the race to succeed George W. Bush in the November 2008 election .
Iraq was part of a much larger war , Giuliani said , urging Washington and London not to be distracted from Afghanistan , where he called for a redoubling of efforts .
Among his proposals for the United States and Britain to take the lead in “ winning this war ” , Giuliani urged the two countries to push for an expansion of NATO into a global body .
“ We should open the organization ’s membership to any willing state that meets basic standards of good governance , military readiness ( and ) global responsibility , regardless of location , ” he said .
“ I think we should consider countries such as Australia , Singapore , India , Israel , Japan ... and there are probably a whole group of others that we could put on that list , ” he said .
The defense alliance has expanded in recent years but its current membership is 26 countries in North America and Europe .
CALL FOR EXPANDED U.S. MILITARY
Facing increasing war - weariness in the United States , Bush last week ordered gradual troop reductions in Iraq but defied calls for a dramatic change of course .
Giuliani , giving the first “ Margaret Thatcher Atlantic Bridge ” lecture to an audience that included the former British prime minister , called for an expansion of the U.S. military , saying it had cut back too much after the Cold War .
“ We need to add at least 10 new combat brigades , that ’s probably just the beginning , ” Giuliani said , adding the United States faced not only Islamic terrorism , but also had to consider the possibility of a “ large war with a nation state ” .
Speaking earlier , Giuliani said the United States should spell out clearly to Iran that it would not allow Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons .
Giuliani said he had discussed Iran with Brown , his predecessor Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the past few days .
The West suspects Iran is developing atomic weapons but Tehran says its nuclear program is aimed solely at generating electric power .
“ The policy of the United States of America should be very , very clear : we will use any option we believe is in our best interest to stop them from being a nuclear power , ” Giuliani said .
Habitual sex offender Ross Wollschlager has bounced from one Ventura County hotel to another in the weeks since his release from a state mental hospital , getting ejected each time the owner learned of his identity .
Publicity about his release has made it impossible for the 44 - year - old convicted rapist to find a rural landlord willing to give him a place to live .
After seven evictions , Liberty Healthcare Corp. , a San Diego company hired by the state to help Wollschlager get resettled , gave him a tent and he began living in the Ventura River bottom .
He is overseen by a taxpayer - funded security guard who stays in a vehicle nearby .
Wollschlager ’s predicament has reignited debate on whether strict new laws governing sex offenders are making it harder to monitor them .
Advertisement
Jessica ’s Law , passed overwhelmingly by voters last fall , bars Wollschlager from living within 2,000 feet -- about half a mile -- of any school , park or beach .
He wears two monitoring devices on his ankle and shuttles between his campsite and a friend ’s home in Oxnard each day .
“ It ’s harder to protect the public when he is homeless , ” said Margaret Coyle , a county prosecutor who opposed Wollschlager ’s release .
“ Were he in a condo or an apartment , we could supervise him more effectively . ”
But Will Smith , chief of staff for state Sen. George Runner ( R - Lancaster ) , who sponsored Jessica ’s Law , said he believes it is effective in protecting residents .
“ We ’ve never made any argument that it would n’t be harder to find housing , but we ’ve always argued that it would be safer , ” Smith said .
“ We think the safety of residents in California outweighs any inconvenience on [ Wollschlager ’s ] part . ”

Liberty Healthcare is continuing to look for a more permanent placement for Wollschlager , a search that began 17 months ago , said Nancy Kincaid , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Mental Health .
It ’s not the first time a sex offender has become homeless upon release , Kincaid said .
Last summer , before Jessica ’s Law was approved , child molester Timothy Boggs was “ chased from hotel to hotel ” in Sacramento until a bail bondsman stepped forward to offer him a place to stay in his office , she said .
In San Luis Obispo County , felon Frederick Hoffman is scheduled to live in a trailer near military training grounds after his release .
On Friday , the state Department of Corrections announced that it had notified 2,741 sex offenders , who were paroled after Nov. 8 , 2006 , that they were in violation of housing restrictions mandated by Jessica ’s Law .
The parolees now have less than 45 days to comply with the law .
Advertisement
The problem is only going to get bigger , Kincaid said .
More than 650 convicts are being treated as repeat sex offenders , and at least 11 of them could be released within a year .
Meanwhile , Jessica ’s Law expanded the definition of who should be treated for sex offenses , and referrals to the state - run sexually violent predator treatment program have grown from 50 a month to more than 700 , Kincaid said .
“ How on Earth do we do what the voters asked for -- that is , how do we track these people ?
I really do n’t know , ” she said .
A 146 - page report titled “ No Easy Answers : Sex Offender Laws in the United States , ” scheduled for release next week by the nonprofit group Human Rights Watch , is expected to be critical of such laws and policies and to urge state and federal reforms , including the elimination of residency restrictions .
Wollschlager said he understands why society feels the way it does about sex offenders .
He was convicted of two rapes in the 1980s , and later , of molesting a 10 - year - old girl as she slept .

“ I hated myself for a lot of years for what I did .
But I ’ve made a lot of changes in my life , ” he said .
“ I know a lot of people do n’t care about that .
I hope my actions will speak louder than words . ”
Wollschlager ’s attorneys say his case demonstrates how a tangle of sex offender laws , court orders and public fear can produce unintended consequences .
At age 19 , he was convicted of the rapes , in which he entered his female victims ’ homes in the middle of the night .
He was paroled after serving half of his eight - year sentence .
Two years later , after a day of drinking and drug use , Wollschlager again sneaked into a stranger ’s home one night .
He recounted how he entered a bedroom where a 10 - year - old girl was sleeping .
He lay next to her , Wollschlager said , fondling her and asking if she wanted to be his girlfriend .
He fled when the girl ’s mother snapped on a light , he said , eventually turning himself in to police .

Wollschlager , who grew up in Ventura County and committed his crimes there , said his actions were prompted by rampant alcoholism , drug abuse and “ deviant thoughts and fantasies . ”
Psychological treatment over the last decade has helped him to understand and control his vices , he said .
“ I know I ca n’t repair the damage I did to that family , and to that child , ” he said .
“ I make every effort today to make sure I never do something like that again . ”
He was convicted of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and was sent back to prison for 13 years .
In 1996 , when he was up for release , Wollschlager was instead transferred to Atascadero State Hospital to participate in a then - new program for habitual sex offenders .
Designated a “ sexually violent predator , ” he was barred from leaving the hospital for 11 more years while he underwent treatment .
Last year , Ventura County Judge Rebecca Riley ordered him released after hearing testimony on his progress from state experts , including a psychiatrist .

But he remained in Atascadero 17 months longer as Liberty Healthcare tried without success to find him a Ventura County home .
On Aug. 8 , an appellate court ruled that he must be released immediately even if a placement could not be found .
Ventura County prosecutors and the Department of Mental Health opposed the decision , noting that Wollschlager had completed only half of a five - phase program while in Atascadero .
Sheriff Bob Brooks said he was against his release for the same reason .
“ It ’s a minimum standard , and not completing it demonstrates a lack of desire to change , ” Brooks said .
He added , however , that Jessica ’s Law should be modified to make it workable .
“ The 2,000 - foot distance makes it so hard to find housing , ” the sheriff said .
Todd Howeth , Wollschlager ’s county - provided lawyer , said his client is committed to turning his life around .
He wears a global positioning anklet and an alcohol monitoring device , attends counseling sessions almost daily , and consults with layers of security and bureaucrats before making a move .
The public defender ’s office recently filed a petition challenging the restrictions , arguing that Jessica ’s Law went into effect months after Riley ordered Wollschlager ’s release from Atascadero .
Howeth said his client has received death threats and is being treated like a leper .

“ Government should provide some kind of facility for these men to transition into , ” he said .
“ Wollschlager has paid his price to society , and if you have this system , they should have housing to go to . ”

Michael Perscheid announced that the Hasso - Plattner - Institute has just finished a new Seaside Tutorial .
Thanks for your hard work !
Great Job !
From Michael :
Dear list ,
We proudly present a new Seaside tutorial ( for Squeak 3.10 and Seaside 2.8 ) .
This tutorial was produced by the Software Architecture Group at the Hasso - Plattner - Institute ( University of Potsdam ) .
In ten chapters we describe step by step the development of a ToDo- application and thereby demonstrate the main parts of the sophisticated web framework Seaside .
Since this is the first version we hope that you can help to improve the quality by providing feedback .
Have a look at : http://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/seaside/tutorial
Regards
Michael Perscheid
Bush sees progress in Iraq because that ’s what he wants to see .
Yet another study shows Iraq is a disaster :
Iraq ’s security forces will be unable to take control of the country in the next 18 months , and Baghdad ’s national police force is so rife with corruption it should be scrapped entirely , according to a new independent assessment .
The study , led by retired Marine Corps Gen. James Jones , is a sweeping and detailed look at Iraq ’s security forces that will factor heavily into Congress ’ upcoming debate on the war .
Republicans see success by the Iraqi forces as critical to bringing U.S. troops home , while an increasing number of Democrats say the U.S. should stop training and equipping such units altogether .
The 20 - member panel of mostly retired senior military and police officers concludes that Iraq ’s military , in particular its Army , shows the most promise of becoming a viable , independent security force with time .
But the group predicts an adequate logistics system to support these ground forces is at least another two years away .
Constituent members of the Silicon Valley Impeachment Coalition ( SVIC ) gathered at the Campbell office of Representative Mike Honda ( D - 15 ) on October 22 , 2007 to present an SVIC ad in the Mountain View Voice to Mike Honda .
In the ad the SVIC demands an answer to whether Dick Cheney has committed impeachable offenses .
We also presented the following letter .

Re : District 15 constituents demand answers regarding executive wrongdoing , as stated on page 3 of The Mountain View Voice , Volume 15 No. 41 .
Dear Congressperson Honda :
Despite our repeated questions , appeals and demands , you have not answered whether or not you think or believe that Vice President Cheney has committed impeachable offenses .
Nor have you answered whether or not you think or believe that Vice President Cheney continues to commit impeachable offenses .
As far as we know , you have not answered these questions in any public speech , printed publication , e-mail communication , website posting or other media accessible to your constituents .
You also did not adequately address our questions , appeals and demands that we expressed at your recent Town Halls held in the 15th District .
Your constituents have a right to know your position on these important questions as these questions involve and pertain to serious issues of constitutional right .
Our privacy , our security from unwarranted surveillance , our right to trial , our right to habeas corpus and numerous other constitutional protections are involved .
The Silicon Valley Impeachment Coalition ( SVIC ) , on behalf of District 15 constituents , demands your answers to the questions published in the ad on page 3 of The Mountain View Voice , Volume 15 No. 41 .
We also demand an explanation of your answers .
The published demand in The Voice is enclosed with this letter .
We look forward to your reply published in The Mountain View Voice .
On behalf of your District 15 constituents and other Bay Area residents ,
SVIC members

Her clients : Modern - art collectors , museums , gallerists and artists , who might need to replace the elephant dung from a Chris Ofili work or ( in the case of the artist Kelley Walker ) refine a recipe for chocolate .
Restoration emergencies :  A lot can happen in someones home ,  says Hoffmann , the chief conservator for Contemporary Conservation .
 One clients daughter had a pillow fight and knocked a painting off a wall .
The daughter tried to fix it herself .
A disaster !
Other people have artwork damaged by , say , someone vacuum cleaning . 

How your product can inspire The Nod
Sit in a cafe with a Mac PowerBook , and chances are you 'll get The Nod - - that acknowledging , approving , knowing , we 're - special look .
MINI Cooper owners give each other The Nod at intersections .
Display GNOME on your ThinkPad and you 'll get The Nod. But run Windows on your Dell and you wo n't .
( Never confuse the " I feel your pain " look with The Nod . )
To give The Nod is to recognize and appreciate another person who " gets it " , whatever it is .
The Nod is NOT simply a " you have something I have " look .
I do n't get The Nod when I wear , say , my standard - issue Nike Air trainers .
But I DO get it when my SmartWool socks are spotted by another SmartWool fan .
I never got The Nod using a Pentax point - and - shoot , but when I pulled out my new Nikon D200 on a train , another D200 owner on the train not only gave me The Nod , but greeted me like a long lost friend .
I do n't get The Nod when I wear a plain white T - Shirt .
But slap a Parelli logo on the shirt and I get The Nod from other like - minded horse owners .
Carrying a JavaOne backpack at the JavaOne conference does n't earn me The Nod ... everyone gets one when they register .
Why , then , do so many conference alumni use their older JavaOne bags ?
The ones from previous years ?
Because demonstrating that " I was here at the beginning ... way back in 1997 " earns The Nod .
Why do some things get The Nod but not others ?
And is n't it really the user that gets The Nod , and not the product ?
When we give The Nod to another , it 's NOT about the thing we have in common -- it 's about what having that thing says about us .
Maybe the message for us -- as product / service creators -- is :
It 's NOT about having a remarkable product -- it 's about helping our users be remarkable .
The Nod is a way for one user to tell another :
" We 're smarter . "
Or
" We 're risk - takers . "
Or
" We 're more indie . "
Or
" We 've been at this from the beginning ( unlike these clueless newbies ) . "
Or
" We 're more concerned about the environment . "
Or
" We 're more fun . "
Or ...
The Nod means we recognize an attribute of the person who has that - thing - we - also - have ... an attribute we value .
In other words , simply by having / wearing / using / participating in this thing , I 'm inherently assumed to possess intelligence , sense of humor , thriftiness , coolness , courage , independence , social responsibility , acquired taste , geekiness , trendiness , cutting edginess , sexiness , experience , expertise , or whatever that 's linked to that thing .
The Nod says " I acknowledge something meaningful about you . " and could be as simple as , " You discovered the same little - known indie band that I did .
We know something most people do n't . "
To help your product , service , or cause get The Nod you need at least two things :
1 ) The product says something about the person who has it .
2 ) There 's a way for others to spot another person who has it .
I can't give you The Nod for being One - Who - Gets - It if I have no way to know -- one more reason that Pride / Tribe Items like T - Shirts and stickers are so important !
We are defined in some ways by the things we choose , and having the T - Shirts and stickers is a way to help express who we are to others .
It 's a way of revealing to the world a little of ourselves , and also a way to connect to others with whom we share that attribute .
Attributes that earn The Nod
We do n't need to make cars or computers to have our users give The Nod to one another .
The attribute ( i.e. what having that thing says about the user ) does n't even need to be about the product itself .
The fact that I use trash bags does n't say much about me .
But buying them from some obscure , expensive - but - environmentally - friendly company might ( as long as I have the T - Shirt to prove it ) .
Having an iPod does n't say much about me ( everyone else has one too ) .
But keeping it in a cat - shaped case might .
The important thing is that it 's the case maker , not Apple , that earns The Nod there .
Drinking wine does n't say as much about me as being One Who Drinks Stormhoek might .
So we must always be asking , " What does being a user of my product say about the user ? "
If the answer is ... nothing nod -worthy , we do n't necessarily have to change the product itself ... we can sometimes retrofit an attribute onto it through community , the values of the company , changing the user - experience in some external way ( like improving user training and support ! ) , or even the look - and - feel of the marketing .
Here 's a list of some attributes that earn The Nod .
Could your product have one or more of these ?
Is there a way for people to know ?
( In no particular order )
1 ) Little - known Treasure
Surprise , delight , and approval ...
" You 've discovered the same ' secret ' I have . "
2 ) Sheer coolness
" You 're cool ( like me ) for having this . "
3 ) Acquired Taste
" Most people are n't able to appreciate this .
You 're obviously one of the special ones ( like me ) . "
4 ) Fun
" You 're someone who likes to have fun . "
5 ) Risk - taking / Rule - breaking / Edgy / Bold
" As the saying goes , If you are n't on the edge , you 're taking up too much room .
You 're obviously out on the edge ( like me ) . "
6 ) Advanced / Expert / Elite
" The fact that you have this means you 're truly an expert , like me . "
8 ) Smart / Intellectual
" Only truly intelligent people would have this . "
9 ) Not Trendy , individual , more indie - than - thou
" You 're someone who does n't follow the crowds ( like me ) , and does n't give a s*** about what 's popular "
10 ) Geekier - than - thou
" Like the joke says , there are only 10 kinds of people in the world ... those who know binary , and those who do n't . "
( GNOME , MAKE magazine , etc. )
11 ) Highly - engineered
( Like acquired taste , only geekier .
Few people would appreciate the elegance of the design / construction of this device ... )
12 ) Socially Responsible
" You 're someone who respects the environment ( or some other cause ) , like me . "
13 ) Wacky , crazy , weird
( Like ' not trendy ' , only ... weirder )
14 ) The finer things ...
" You appreciate the best ... and are n't afraid to pay for it . "
15 ) Cutting edge
" You 're a brave early adopter . "
( or a trend - setter )
16 ) Founding member
" You 're someone who 's been at this from the beginning , not like those newbies today who do n't have to hike 10 miles in the snow uphill both ways to get something to compile ... "
( This is one of my favorites ... think how many people love to play the , " I 've been at this longer than you " card .
Do you have a way to let others recognize your long - time / alumni users ? )
17 ) Rational , Logical , Sensible , Thrifty
" You 're not like those idiots out there paying a premium for something just because it has a cool logo ... "
One more time -- The Nod is not really so much about having a remarkable product .
It 's about helping your users be remarkable .
It 's about your users getting The Nod-- earning the respect of others for being a fellow user .
So , who are you helping get The Nod today ?
Your ideas ?
Anything you 'd add to the list of attributes that might get The Nod ?

I 'd say anyone who knows what point 7 was going to be would be worthy of serious nodding .
Sorry - could n't resist .

Belonging , but not to scary evil - eye - guy 's club , that 's not a nod :(

I recently bought a Harley Davidson .
That is another product that gets ' the nod ' .
Though I doubt i will ever get a double nod for getting off my harley and pulling out my PowerBook .
Also , I think the nod dissipated with ubiquity .
The iPod used to get the nod , now everyone has them and unlike a JavaOne bag you are unlikely to get a nod for carrying a 1st generation iPod around these days .
Posted by : Jackson | Jul 7 , 2006 2:35:18 PM
I am virtually nodding your Smart Wool socks even now ( mine feel very nice , thank you ) .
What is the emoticon for The Nod ? >-} ?
We drive a VW Eurovan -- not really a " cool " car , but when we pass somebody we always wave and they always wave back .
Of course , we really want a Microbus , but VW is too stupid to make them here .
Do you think everyone likes to get The Nod , just about different things , or are some people just the " early adopter " types that like to be out on the fringe a bit ?
What about when something that once earned The Nod begins to get The Smirk ?
Moving from Wired to Tired ( did Wired magazine ever put itself in the Tired column ... ?)
I 'm trying to think of some examples of this , like an Australian Chardonnay , or my iPod Mini , or a Hummer , or a Dean for President button ...
Posted by : Charlie Evett | Jul 7 , 2006 2:59:46 PM
Jackson : " carrying a 1st generation iPod around these days . "
But carrying a newton might : )
I reckon a first - gen iPod is just outdated , and without the vintage / retro / cool aspect .
But I 'd definitely give you the double nod for whipping out a PowerBook ( even more for a black MacBook ) on your Harley .
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jul 7 , 2006 3:00:18 PM
Charlie : " What about when something that once earned The Nod begins to get The Smirk ? "
Excellent point !
Oooohh and what about when you do n't know the difference ?
I reckon that I 've kept more than one thing way past it 's sell - by / shark - jump date and what I thought was a " you 're one of us " look was really a " you 're SUCH an idiot " look without recognizing it ; )
Then again , getting The Smirk could be yet another " statement " of one 's independent - I - do n't - give - a - rat 's - a ** - about - what - you - think attitude .
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jul 7 , 2006 3:09:46 PM
The Nod comes in other forms .
' Back in the Day ' when I imported a Beamer zwie tousand und zwie , before any of the TI models , we used to blink our headlights at one another .
For sure the Porsche 's did this , and for the prior decade ( we 're talkin ' early ' 50s here ) , so did the Volksbuggy drivers .
By the end of the 17 years in which I drove it , other models had invaded , yuppies got invented , and ' huh ? ' replaced the blink !
Posted by : Marty McGowan | Jul 7 , 2006 3:29:46 PM
white guys in the south who are members of the klan get the nod ( one of the reasons i moved away from the south ) .
so do n't be so proud of it .
sounds like just more class -ism , elitist behavior from people who need attention .
i could care less if i get a nod because someone thinks i'm part of their little clique .
get over it and get on with you life .
Posted by : zeebleoop | Jul 7 , 2006 3:42:30 PM
Flying first class can definitely get you The Nod .
It is saying : you belong with us not with the rest of the pee-ons back there ...
I can only imagine the kind of nods one must be getting when chartering a private jet ...
Posted by : Marian Crkon | Jul 7 , 2006 4:00:14 PM
Marty : thanks for the headlamp flash thing ... and for getting me to think about other Nod Variants .
zeeb :
It 's also simply about humans wanting to connect with other humans and " belong . "
One person 's " clique " could be someone else 's " tribe " or even " family . "
It 's both human and healthy to want to discover others who are just a tiny bit like ourselves in any dimension .
And one might suggest that inserting an comment about the " klan " in a light - hearted post about acknowledging someone 's socks could be a " need for attention " ( which of course I 'm now giving you ) .
Telling us that we need to " get over it " -- and that you personally could care less -- is itself elitist ( certainly judgemental ) .
That said , there 's obviously some truth to your point , so I appreciate it .
You could have made that point without being insulting , though .
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jul 7 , 2006 4:28:56 PM
Hmm , the article was thought - provoking , because I do believe that everyone wants to belong to some group .
However , it reminded me of two things :
1 . When my son simply HAD to be different , JUST LIKE ALL HIS FRIENDS .
( Maybe the " get over it " poster sparked this thought . )
2. The South Park episode " Smug Alert , " where the hybrid car owners were emitting dangerous levels of smug .
While their air of superiority was a parody , it was n't that far from some of the examples given .
Finally , I wonder if it is somehow necessary to highlight our differences with others in order to reinforce our commonalities within the group .
( WE have the X , and THEY do n't .
WE are n't obsessed with material things and THEY are . )
It 's seems rare that we simply say " hey , I 'm like YOU in this way " -- and NOT slam on anyone else .
Posted by : Lisa Guinn | Jul 7 , 2006 7:45:15 PM
" Never confuse the " I feel your pain " look with The Nod . "
I do n't necessarily agree with you on this .
I think that the thing that gets you the most sincere nod is " shared experience " and sometimes that includes " I feel your pain " .
Cases in point of share experiences that gain you the nod :
- People that have never met but at some point of their lives have served in the same place ( even many years apart ) .
- New parents .
You never get a bigger nod ( the " I feel your pain kind of nod " ) , that when two newly fathers / mothers with their strollers meet in an elevator with severe sleep deprivation .
This usually leads to the big nod , it 's kind of a communion thing .
People who have n't been parents yet , are a million of miles away to understand and those of us with older kids have already buried this period of our lives in the subconscious mind .
I also think that common aspirations can also gain you the not in some situations .
Posted by : Angel Municio | Jul 7 , 2006 9:25:59 PM
Something that might get The Nod is a variation on # 16 .
Not necessarily about being a founder , or the one who 's been at something the longest , but rather having played a part in a historical event .
You were the one there - not your competitors .
I 've seen companies leverage that in their messaging .
There was an ad for Plantronics ( a telephone headset ) that said they were the headset of choice for the first Moon Walk .
Or , how about the Kingsley Baby Tee shirt that Shiloh Jolie Pitt wore in her magazine cover debut ?
Sure landed that brand .
Also , in addition to The Nod and The Smirk , there 's The Huh ( followed by period , not question mark , then a pause and thoughful gaze ) .
That 's when someone wants to give The Nod , so they appear in the know , but they can't quite get there .

@Jackson :
It 's all I can do to refrain from giving you Harley drivers the * opposite* of The Nod .
Your idea of cool shakes whole city blocks and wakes people up at 3 am , scares babies and animals , drowns out conversations , and is extremely rude at any time of day .
Harleys are a case where your passion is way too much of an imposition on everyone else in an 8 - block radius to be socially acceptable .
( It 's not because of how you dress while riding , or your hair , or the bandanas , or because my passions are better than yours , etc. ) .
It 's the noise .
Now that you know this , you must either choose to remain belligerent , or go and have a muffler installed on your hog .

Posted by : Mark | Jul 8 , 2006 9:07:48 AM
I can't resist to reply this once - again - brilliant post either for the excitement of having Kathy blogging back , but also because I think there 's a kind of Nod surprisingly missing !
( or maybe it is n't considered a current Nod anymore )
Either way , I will approach it with an example , if you do n't mind , mashing john dodd 's comment ,
It would be like :
18 ) The " Looser ! " ( aka the * L* hand sign ) :
You 're someone ( like me ) who lives in a place like where Mrs. Sierra goes for hiking ( meaning , sketchy wireless , almost total all - media - blackout , analog mode ) therefore you will probably never have neither the chance to buy the fans club t- shirt nor any of her books , not to mention having her speaking here , so , you know you she rules , BUT , you can't get any !
In other words , you want the product , but for whatever geopolitical reason , you will never get it , it 's like the sensation right after reading the message " We apologize for the inconvenience but we 're currently not delivering in your area " and you know that implicitly means " Sorry looser , we know you love us but , mmm , keep watching ! " :D

Glad to see you back in the blogosphere .
I know that I do n't really get the nod from most of your blog readers because I am not a coder , I do n't know what binary is , and I glean most of my technie knowledge from my own curiousity and willingness to click it till it stops working or does what I want .
I am an educator .
I read this blog because I think that education is in need of creating passionate users .
Our product is quite literally our craft and delivery .
Our users are an ever - changing net generation that seeks the nod in all areas of their life .
I would venture to say that the nod is harder to get in the education world .
I am loving this post and will pay homage to the nod on my blog with my own list of ways to get the nod .
( teach2geek.blogspot.com )
It may take a little thinking , but if I can make the list good enough , there might be a nod somewhere for me .
Kathy , you of course get the biggest nod for insightful posts .
Thanks for your blog !

Lisa : you got me thinking as well ... it does seem like some -- but not ALL -- of the time , it feels like an us vs. them , and I put a lot more of that in this post than I realized .
I reckon it depends somewhat on the scenario ( and , in some cases , the gender of the person ) .
Many of the attributes on that list , though , do n't necessarily fall in that category .
I do n't feel " better " than someone else for having discovered SmartWool .
I do , however , feel lucky to have found it , and I 'm always delighted when I find others who feel the same way .
Although a big part of that , no doubt , is about getting confirmation / validation that I 'm not just * imagining * that they feel better ; )
I agree that part of * belonging * to a particular group , no matter how many groups / tribes we 're a part of , does imply some sort of * difference * from others .
Whether that difference is viewed as a value judgement depends ...
Berkeley 's Danah Boyd has a whole lot to say about this -- her main field of study is on social groups and especially what it means to belong to -- and not belong to -- a particular culture , ranging from a MySpace clique to the workplace .
Thanks ( and I hear you on the " have to be different just like everyone else " thing , having a teenager to remind me )
ANGEL : I guess I was using The Nod to distinguish it from The Sympathetic Look or whatever it is that -- and you 're so right about that -- new parents give one another .
Although in that case I 'm not even sure they need to do anything -- the lack of sleep on their face speaks for itself ...
NANO : Awwww ... now I feel bad .
Where exactly DO you live ?
You have no idea the kinds of places I can turn up in , whether against my will or not ; )
GREG : I should n't have used Dell as an example , but I was being honest .
And trust me , I SO do n't get The Nod for my car ( run - of - the - mill Subaru ) , but ... so what ?
That still does n't take away from the fact that I enjoy those little tiny " shared experiences " when they do happen .
Even if it 's for nothing other than my socks , it 's still fun .
MARK : Thanks , I 'm happy to BE back .
( Although man oh man , being off - grid can be pretty darn lovely , and so de-stressing ! )
BRANDI : I 'm giving you a big Nod : )
Not everyone on this blog is a geek ... it 's just where me ( and my co-authors ) are coming from .
But the world needs good educators a lot more than it needs more geeks , so I 'm glad you 're out there .
Cheers !

Hi Kathy , welcome back !
Hm , The Nod .
It also helps to be part of not - totally - accepted - crowd , comic readers in Germany for example ( though it ’s getting better ) .
Or being an anglophile–it ’s always nice to see a fellow Pratchett fan reading the original .
But of course to be able to give The Nod ( and do n’t be misunderstood ) , you must have a book on yourself , same as with the comics , Doctor Who , Firefly –especially if you do n’t have good access to fan articles :-(
Nodding ,
Jens

The Nod == pure snobism .

Inspired by this post , I just changed the ringtone of my mobile to the sound of adventure : the sound of the Tardis engines .
I 'm curious how many people will get it and how many will complain about " this terrible grating noise " .
And it has the added advantage that I will not confuse
my mobile with any other in the office anymore ...
What a fun way to procrastinate on a sunny Sunday morning :-)
P.S. : Do n't know what I 'm talking about ?

The federal government needs to do a better job addressing how climate change is transforming the hundreds of millions of acres under its watch , according to a congressional investigative report to be released this week .
The 184 - page Government Accountability Office report , which Sens. John F. Kerry , D - Mass. , and John McCain , R - Ariz. , requested in 2004 , highlights the extent to which global warming already is affecting the nation 's parks , forests , marine sanctuaries and monuments .
Looking at agencies ranging from the U.S. Forest Service to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , accountability office officials gathered reports of dramatic changes across the nearly 30 percent of U.S. land that lies under federal control .
Since 1850 , the glaciers in Glacier National Park have declined from 150 to 26 ; climate - triggered coral bleaching in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is eroding the area 's tourist appeal .
Non-native grasses are fast replacing native shrubs in the Mojave Desert , where the grasses also are fueling hotter and longer - lasting wildfires .
Even pinyon pines hundreds of years old that have survived droughts before in the Southwest are dying off .
For the most part , the men and women overseeing these 600 million acres of land and 150,000 square miles of protected waters have little direction on how to respond to these shifts , according to the report .
The office said the Interior , Agriculture and Commerce departments have failed to give their resource managers the guidance and tools they need - computer models , temperature and precipitation data , climate projects and detailed inventories of plant and animal species - to cope with all the biological and physical effects from the warming .
It states these managers " have limited guidance about whether or how to address climate change and therefore , are uncertain about what action , if any , they should take .
...
Without such guidance , their ability to address climate change and effectively manage resources is constrained . "
In addition to the oceanic agency and the Forest Service , investigators for the General Accountability Office - an arm of Congress - examined the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service .
Interior Department spokesman Chris Paolino said he could not comment on the report because he had not read it , but he noted that Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne established " a department - wide task force " on climate change this spring and is awaiting a final report from the panel next month .
Kempthorne instructed the task force , Paolino said , " to look at the potential impact of climate change on Interior Department lands and to develop procedures and policies to proactively and reactively respond to those impacts . "
Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh said that although he could not comment , " our research and development folks have been working on climate change for years and years , and will be eager to look at the report . "
The GAO investigators looked at four representative areas : the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary , Alaska 's Chugach National Forest , Montana 's Glacier National Park , and grasslands and shrubs managed by Interior 's Bureau of Land Management in northwestern Arizona .
From those studies , investigators concluded : " Climate change has already begun to adversely affect federal resources in a variety of ways .
Most experts with whom we spoke believe that these effects will continue and likely intensify over the coming decades . "
Kerry now wants legislation requiring more climate change science .
" We waited a long time for this report to confirm the daunting prospect that climate change is impacting our public lands from coast to coast , and this administration is ill - equipped to respond , " Kerry said .
Jamie Rappaport Clark , who was director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the Clinton administration and is now executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife , called the report an urgently needed call for the nation .
" Global warming is and will continue to contribute to species extinctions , flooding of coastal refuges and massive movements of wildlife populations in search of more hospitable habitat , " she said .
" Polar bears and other imperiled species , wildlife refuges , parks and myriad natural resources are at risk and Congress clearly needs to provide more legislative direction because the agencies have failed to do so . "

Adding folic acid to bread supplies may significantly damage the nation 's health , food scientists have warned .
A plan to fortify flour with the B vitamin in a bid to reduce birth defects could backfire by increasing cases of bowel cancer and trigger problems for people with leukaemia and arthritis .
But it might take 20 years before the effects of increased consumption by millions of people become known , says the Institute of Food Research .
The IFR 's warning will fuel debate over whether the benefits of fortifying flour with folic acid outweigh the health risks .
It comes as the Food Standards Agency has in principle approved putting folic acid in bread flour , although Government ministers have yet to make the final decision .
By boosting the diets of pregnant women , it would cut the rate of defects such as spina bifida in the unborn baby which can cause serious disability .
However , research has suggested the human body might struggle to break down folic acid in even half the amounts proposed for supplementing foods .
That would mean two slices of fortified bread a day every day could be a danger to those at risk .
While the institute said pregnant women continue taking folic acid supplements , it warned that in the future just two slices of fortified bread a day every day could lead to problems in people who are not deficient .
In the UK , women trying to conceive and in the early stages of pregnancy are recommended to take supplements to prevent birth defects .
Most breakfast cereals are already fortified here , while the recommended dose for anyone wanting to top up low levels is 200 micrograms a day .
Dr Sian Astley from the IFR said : " Fortifying UK flour with folic acid would reduce the incidence of neural tube defects .
" However , with doses of half the amount being proposed for fortification in the UK , the liver becomes saturated and unmetabolised folic acid floats around the blood stream .
" This can cause problems for people being treated for leukaemia and arthritis , women being treated for ectopic pregnancies , men with a family history of bowel cancer , people with blocked arteries being treated with a stent and elderly people with poor vitamin B status .
" This has important implications for the use of folic acid in fortification , because even at low doses it could lead to over - consumption , with its inherent risks . "
She said it also increased the likelihood of multiple births for women undergoing fertility treatment .
Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate , a B vitamin , found in leafy green vegetables , cereals and fruit .
A paper published in the British Journal of Nutrition found folic acid is broken down by the liver , whereas natural folates are broken down in the stomach .
Scientists claim a liver flooded with folic acid may end up releasing it undigested into the blood .
Excess levels of folic acid in the blood have been linked to bowel and breast cancer , and could accelerate brain decline in some elderly people .
The scientists said the full impact of putting folic acid in food may only become apparent in 20 years ' time .
There has been ongoing concern about the impact of mandatory fortification of bread flour on elderly people with B12 deficiency , but IFR scientists say an even broader range of people could be at risk .
Dr Astley said there had been a long - held assumption that folic acid was digested in the same way as naturally - occurring folates , but this appeared to be wrong .
" We challenge the underlying scientific premise behind this consensus .
The FSA came to a carefully considered verdict but this field of research has moved on extraordinarily fast , and it would be irresponsible of us not to make our findings public . "
Dr Astley said 13 million Britons did not eat enough folate , which could equally put them at risk of health problems , and as many as 900 pregnancies a year are affected by birth defects for the same reason .
" It 's a complicated and confusing issue .
We want to encourage those who do n't eat enough to increase their intake , but we do n't want people eating too much in a sledgehammer approach to fortification .
" We have to work out the groups it might be helpful for , " she added .
It has been added to bread , flour , cereals , pasta , rice and other grains in the U.S. since 1998 .
There has been a fall in the number of folate - deficiency birth defects , but there are concerns it might be causing a rise in bowel cancers .
Americans of all ages can't go very long without the Internet — in fact , they prefer the Internet over everything else , including their friends and one of nature 's most primal instincts .
The world 's fourth - largest advertising agency , JWT , made the findings in a survey of 1,011 American adults , and discovered that the Internet has become such an integral part of our lives that some of us are willing to make major sacrifices for it .
Survey respondents were asked how long they could go without an Internet connection and still feel " OK . " 15 percent of the group admitted to being weak - willed and said that they would only be able to last a day or less without feeling isolated and disconnected from the world .
Another 21 percent did n't do much better , saying they could only go a couple of days , with 19 percent saying they could go " a few days . "
Only about 18 percent of the group said that they could go a week or more without being connected , according to the results seen by Ars Technica .
Notably , respondents over the age of 55 were just as likely to say that they live part of their lives online as those under 35 ( 43 and 44 percent , respectively ) , and roughly half of both age groups said that they feel like " something is missing " if they cannot access the Internet .
But that 's not the juicy part .
The old adage that sex is on people 's minds x times per second may still be true , but that apparently did n't outweigh the desire for the Internet in 20 percent of the survey 's respondents .
Members of this group said that they knowingly spent less time having sex as a result of Internet use , and another 28 percent of the group acknowledged that they spent less time with their friends because of the amount of time spent online or playing with gadgets .
" Sorry , I can't go out tonight .
I 've got a killer new iPod to check out . "
( Wait , I think I might have actually said that to someone once ... )
That said , young people were much more likely to integrate Internet access into their everyday lives so that they could actually leave the house and face the daystar every so often — that is , they were much more mobile with the help of laptops and other connected gadgets .
" Older Americans are happy to sit in the same place to go online , while younger people expect to be able to connect anywhere at any time , without being tethered to a particular location or time frame , " said JWT executive VP Marian Salzman in a statement sent to Ars .
" Mobility represents the next big shift .
Consumers who have integrated digital technologies into their life now want to move into connectivity whenever they feel like it . "
With both wired and wireless broadband becoming more ubiquitous throughout the US , it truly is hard for some of us to imagine our lives without constant connectivity .
With Americans admitting to being addicted to e-mail and data that BlackBerry users are increasingly chained to work , it 's clear that finding a balance between being connected and still having a life has become a new challenge for many of us .
Technion Israel Institute of Technology researchers have developed a theoretical model of a time machine that , in the distant future , could possibly enable future generations to travel into the past .
An article on this research was published last week in the scientific journal Physical Review .
“ In order to travel back in time , the spacetime structure must be engineered appropriately , ” explains Prof.
Amos Ori of the Technion ’s Faculty of Physics .
“ This is what Einstein ’s theory of general relativity deals with .
It says that spacetime can be flat .
That is – it has a trivial , simple structure .
But it can also be curved with various configurations .
According to the theory of relativity , the essence of gravitational fields is in the curving of spacetime .
The theory of relativity also defines how space is curved and how this curvature develops over time . ”
The main question is – if according to the principles of curvature development in the theory of relativity - can a time machine be created ?
In other words – can we cause spacetime to curve in such a way as to enable travel back in time ?
Such a journey requires a significant curvature of spacetime , in a very special form .
Traveling back in time is actually closing time - like curves so we can go back to an event at which we were present in the past .
In flat space , it is not possible to close curves and go back in time .
In order for closed time - like curves to exist , there has to be a curvature of a specific form on spacetime .
The question Prof .
Ori is investigating is – do the laws of gravity permit the development of spacetime with the required curvature ( closed time - like curves ) ?
In the past , scientists raised a number of objections to this possibility .
Prof .
Ori is proposing a theoretical model for spacetime that could develop into a time machine .
The model overcomes some of the questions , which , until now , scientists have not succeeded in solving .
One of the difficult claims against a time machine was that , in order to create a time machine , it would be necessary for it to contain material with negative density .
And since we do not have such material – and it is also not clear if the laws of nature enable the existence of such material in the quantities required - it is not possible to build a time machine .
Now , Prof .
Ori comes along and proposes a theoretical model that does not require material with negative density .
The model that he proposes is , essentially , a vacuum space that contains a region field with standard positive density material .
“ The machine is spacetime itself , ” he explains .
“ Today , if we were to create a time machine – an area with a warp like this in space that would enable time lines to close on themselves – it might enable future generations to return to visit our time .
We , apparently , cannot return to previous ages because our predecessors did not create this infrastructure for us . ”
Prof .
Ori emphasizes that we still do not have the technology to control gravitational fields at will , despite the fact that the theoretical principles of how to do this exist .
“ The model that we developed at the Technion is a significant step but there still remains a number of non-trivial open questions , ” he stresses .
“ It may be that some of these questions also will not be solved in the future .
This is still not clear . ”
As an example , he brings up the problem of instability according to which in spacetime with a time machine there could be disturbances with increasing strength so that spacetime would be disrupted to such an extent that it would cancel out the time machine .
Prof .
Ori , one of the few scientists in the world investigating this issue , hopes that continued research will present a clearer picture with respect to these questions .

Squeak running on FIC Neo1973 Open Source Phone 20 September , 2007
Tony Garnock - Jones reports that
he has succeeded in getting Squeak running on the new FIC Neo1973
open - source GSM cellphone , which runs OpenMoko , based on OpenEmbedded .
He used Squeak VM version 3.9 , running a stripped 2.8 image ( though he has also had a 3.9 image running ) , and is now looking at accessing the phone ’s hardware , including GSM modem , GPS , Bluetooth , touchscreen , audio , battery and auxiliary buttons .
To manage user interaction , he ’s looking at using Faure to construct a stylus - or
finger - driven UI .
Tony is working with the OpenMoko team to get the necessary changes integrated into the main code - base , making this an easier exercise for other developers to follow .
He ’s also looking at getting Spoon running on the phone .
Keep an eye on the LShift blog for progress reports .

Everywhere you turn there 's more bad news on the environment .
According to a new report released by the UN , it 's not just other species that are in danger , humans are too .
The United Nations Environment Program has released the Global Environment Outlook : environment for development ( GEO - 4 ) report , and it does n't make for happy reading .
Covering environmental news can be a bit depressing at times ; you 're constantly reading about disappearing polar bears or fish or bees , or the fact that new data suggests that CO 2 is rising faster than we thought and it 's going to get even hotter .
Unfortunately for the optimists , GEO - 4 compounds that stream of bad news .
Compiled by almost 400 leading scientists in their fields , the report paints a picture of a planetary population living well beyond their means .
Although there have been a few notable successes , such as the Montreal Protocol that stopped the continued depletion of the ozone layer , they 're very few and very far between .
On the other hand , crises are brewing anywhere one chooses to look .
The seas , studies show , are rapidly being depleted of fish stocks by overfishing .
At the same time , warming temperatures are eradicating the coral reefs , sources of massive biodiversity , and agricultural run-off is creating enormous dead zones of deoxygenated water , devoid of life .
Consumption of sea food tripled in the 40 years following 1961 , and subsidies for fishing fleets have created a huge excess capacity .
Many fish stocks have been depleted to the point where they will never recover .
The oceans are n't our only water problem .
Fresh water , an absolute necessity , is also in trouble .
Water supplies are increasingly polluted ; contaminated water is the leading cause of death worldwide .
The report points out that 70 percent of all fresh water is used for irrigation , but meeting the food needs of our ever expanding global population would require doubling current output over the next five decades .
With precipitation changes already being seen thanks to climate change , that 's a bleak prospect .
Industrial pollutants , from heavy metals to organic compounds , abound in the biosphere , and that means they abound in our food supply .
While all of these problems disproportionately affect the poorer regions of the planet , the industrialized world is hardly exempt .
According to studies , our use of natural resources is unsustainable .
We currently use a third more than the planet has to offer , and that 's with less than a 6th of the global population living in industrialized countries .
Despite the rapid development of China and India , the resources simply do not exist to allow their billions of citizens to enjoy the same lifestyles seen in the US or Europe .
The human population of planet Earth is , in effect , maxed out on its credit cards and soon will have problems paying the mortgage .
Unless concerted global efforts are made to address these mounting problems , GEO - 4 concludes that we shall shortly pass the point of no return .
From where I 'm sitting , that 's the most depressing part .
Despite the stakes being so very high , a global consensus regarding how to tackle these mounting problems seems virtually impossible to come by .
National interests and politics , vested interests and a degree of short - sightedness remain the order of the day .
Populations are going to continue to skyrocket , with a predicted 9 billion by 2050 .
What kind of world will that be to live in , I wonder ?
Plame : Disclosure of classified status amounted to ' treason '
Disclosure of her covert identity for political purposes was nothing short of " treason , " outed former CIA agent Valerie Plame told Hardball host Chris Matthews Thursday on MSNBC .
Plame , whose classified status as an undercover agent was exposed in 2003 , said she could n't possibly have known that a New York Times column disputing White House rationale for war -- penned by her husband , Ambassador Joseph Wilson -- would prompt what she views as a vicious attempt by the White House to ruin her career .
" When your husband filed that story , " Matthews said , " he must have known , did n't he , that he was gonna light a match that was going to lead all the way to you ? "
Plame responded that her outing was not only unexpected , it was also treasonous .
" You cannot possibly be suggesting that with Joe 's credentials , my airtight cover , that we actually anticipated that senior government officials would commit treason by blowing my covert identity , " she said .
Matthews asked Plame how , if she believed the Bush administration had covered up a " false case for war , " that she did n't also anticipate that the White House would strike back at her personally .
" Call me naive , " she said , " but that was n't on our list of options ... we did n't actually consider they would betray our country 's national security to get at me . "
Edwards : Clinton would perpetuate US occupation of Iraq Nick Langewis
Published : Sunday November 18 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This With the Iowa caucuses approaching , Senator John Edwards ( D - NC ) , on a Sunday campaign stop , calls the position of Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) on the United States ' occupation of Iraq a tacit approval , and continuation , of war , reports the Associated Press .
At town hall meetings in western Nevada , Clinton and Edwards , both seeking the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , aired their proposals for handling Iraq if they were to take office .
While Clinton would withdraw troops " as soon as I can , " with no timetable offered , Edwards says he would immediately withdraw up to 50,000 troops , and bring the rest home within ten months .
" She says that she will end the war , " says Edwards , " but she also says she will continue combat missions in Iraq and keep combat troops stationed in Iraq . "
" From my perspective , " continues Edwards , " that 's not ending the war ...
In fact , it 's continuing the occupation . "
" This is a bogus attack from a candidate who is angry that his own campaign has n't taken off , " responds Clinton spokeswoman Hilarie Grey .
As The Swamp breaks down , Edwards disagrees that he is " mudslinging , " as Clinton has accused him of doing , as if " out of the ' Republican playbook ' . "
" We 're talking about substantive issues of war , " contends Edwards on CBS ' Face the Nation Sunday .
" If anybody , including Sen .
Clinton , thinks this is mudslinging  this is milquetoast , compared to what we 're going to see next fall . "
While Edwards does n't call Clinton " corrupt , " he does allude to the tendency of people in certain circles to be insulated by Washington culture .
Edwards tells CNN's Late Edition that he is not angry , but he is understandably passionate about issues such as Iraq , and moreso , candidates are using this time leading up to the primaries to make sure that Democratic voters have a clear understanding of their positions .
Caucus participants , says Edwards , are " looking for the candidate who they believe is ready to be the president . "
Also , they seek a person who can win a general election , " because they do n't want another eight years of a Republican White House . "
After sharing 10 Tips To Choose A Good Gym , let ’s look at the contract .
Every health club requires you to sign a membership contract before you can start working out .
A good contract can protect both the interests of the gym and your right .
Here are top 6 things you should be aware of before you sign a gym contract :
1 ) Bargain for the best deal .
Negotiate with the salesperson .
Ask whether any student package or retiree membership is available .
You can often get reduced rates .
If the salesperson gives you free gift , either you get it on the spot or be absolutely sure anything you agree on written into your gym agreement .
2 ) Do not sign if you are under pressure .
If you are under any sort of pressure to sign or hear things like these “ This deal is for today only and you have to sign up now . ”
Do n’t bother , walk away .
Take the contract home with you to read carefully .
You are the one who pay .
So , never sign it under pressure .
3 ) Find out the flexibility of payment .
If you can afford , ask whether monthly membership , which you pay as you go , is possible .
This is the best option if you are not sure if you are going to commit to a club for 2 or 3 years .
4 ) What happen when the contract expires ?
Find out if the membership automatically rolls over when your contract is completed .
This means you will be signed up again automatically even if you do not want to be .
You may have to write in officially to cancel the membership .
5 ) What if you want to cancel or freeze your membership ?
Check out whether the club allows you to cancel you contract within 3 or 7 business days without penalty .
Some gym will give partial or prorated refund .
Also , find out whether you can freeze your membership when you are pregnant ( for women ) , injured or when you will be away for months .
If you ca n’t cancel the membership , ask whether you can sell or transfer your membership .
In rare case , your gym may move across town and making the gym inaccessible to you .
Check what your rights are – does it allow you to cancel the contract ?
6 ) Read the contract .
Last but not least , do n’t trust the sales person .
Always read the small little words – the fine print .
If you find anything in the contract you do n’t understand , do n’t be shy , ask for an explanation .
It is your money .
So , take your time and get things clear before you sign any gym contract .

Six Lessons from the London Airline Bombing Plot
What we now know about the London - based plot to destroy ten civilian airplanes points to six conclusions .
First , what stopped this plot was law enforcement .
Law enforcement .
Not a military invasion of Pakistan , Iran , Lebanon , Egypt , or Iraq .
Old - fashioned surveillance , development of human sources , putting pieces together , and cooperation with foreign police and intelligence services .
Second , the conspiracy — if it resembles the London bombings of last summer — will likely be home - grown , another of the troubling jihad " fashion " in Europe that comprises the new street gangs of this world .
It is not a religious movement , it is not fundamentalism .
These are thin veneers .
It is at root sheer violence undertaken by young men resentful of many things ( not least the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon ) and ready to kill in return .
Under different cirucmstances , it could be Tamils or Red Brigades or Michigan Militiamen , and has been .
Third , if al Qaeda was involved ( allegedly from Pakistan ) , we can thank the failure of the war in Afghanistan and the cozying up to Musharraf .
Fourth , there was no involvement by any American - based “ cells , ” according the FBI Director Robert Mueller .
As many of us have been saying for nearly five years , and as the 9/11 Commission Report showed , there is virtually no plausible American jihad organization at work , and never has been .
Fifth , the plot again reveals how ill - equipped the U.S. Government has been in anticipating plausible attack scenarios and taking steps to prevent them .
Liquid bombs were so hard to figure out ?
Al Qaeda already tried it .
DHS has almost completely missed the threat , just as they are missing the vulnerability of cargo holds and God knows what else .
Thomas Kean , the former GOP governor and co-chair of the 9/11 Commission , called this liquid bomb error “ appalling ” and wondered , on an NBC program four months ago , why no progress had been made .
Reports since Aug. 10 demonstrate how the administration was attempting to delete funding for research on liquid explosives .
What are the tens of billions being spent on ?
This is Katrina II .
Sixth , and most important , we must end our involvement in Iraq and sharply refocus our presence in the region .
The war president ’s approach is not working .
It ’s a diversion from the real threat .
It ’s a spur to bitter revenge .
It ’s a big feedback loop that will endanger us for years , if not decades .
Our lives are now at stake because the Bush catastrophe has created thousands of new terrorists .
Naturally , the politically expedient are trying to gain an edge .
Defeated Senator Joseph Lieberman immediately attacked his victorious primary challenger Ned Lamont , saying that Lamont ’s " leave Iraq " policy is somehow connected to threats like the London plot .
It ’s the opposite — the war distracts and inflames .
We will see the crowing from the Bushies now , when in fact they were again asleep at the wheel , only this time the Brits saved the day .
The war v. law enforcement contrast — remember how John Kerry was ridiculed by Cheney for suggesting that aggressive police work and human intelligence were anti-terror linchpins ? — is now buried by conflating the “ war against terror ” in Iraq with this Scotland Yard and MI5 success .
Reversing America ’s colossally destructive series of interventions in the Middle East — a cause , a trigger , a recruitment fountain , and a charity for jihad — will require an entirely different mindset , not just an adjustment or a measured retreat .
When America responded , after being prodded , to the tsunami victims in Indonesia early last year , it profoundly changed Indonesians ’ views of the United States .
New attitudes of support and cooperation suddenly sprang forth .
This “ natural experiment ” should be examined to learn from , possibly to emulate , in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere .
We ’re now viewed as destroyers , and destruction is the retort .
This is the “ new Middle East ” that is aborning — one of relentless violence — if we do not end our own relentless violence there .
The would - be bombers in London are a reminder of how close it is .

Rioters blocked roads with burning cars
Aftermath of riots
Police said 21 officers were injured in the rioting in the northern suburbs of Villiers - le - Bel and Arnouville .
A prosecutor has ordered an internal police inquiry into possible manslaughter and " non-assistance to persons in danger " .
The violence - reminiscent of riots in 2005 - lasted for more than six hours .
In 2005 , the deaths of two youths in nearby Clichy - sous - Bois led to France 's worst civil unrest in more than 40 years .
On Sunday night Villiers - le - Bel police station was set ablaze and another in Arnouville was pillaged , police say .
At least seven people were arrested .
Burning cars
Clashes broke out on Sunday night after two teenagers - aged 15 and 16 - were killed when the motorcycle they were driving collided with a police car .
Police sources said the two were riding a stolen mini-motorcycle , and that neither was wearing a helmet .
The police car was on a routine patrol and the teenagers were not being chased by police at the time of the accident , police said .
The collision wrecked the front of the car and smashed the windscreen .
Witnesses have accused the police of leaving the scene and of preventing local people from trying to help the youngsters as they lay in the road .
The brother of one of the victims has called for the officers involved to be convicted .
After the accident , dozens of youths went on a rampage , setting the police station in Villiers - le - Bel on fire , ransacking the Arnouville police station and torching two petrol stations .
Riot police were sent to the area , but youths blocked their way with burning cars .
French media report that the rioters also damaged the Arnouville - Villiers - le - Bel railway station and nearby shops .
Police inquiry
Meanwhile , a state prosecutor ordered the National Police General Inspectorate ( IGPN ) to carry out a detailed inquiry on the circumstances in which the two teenagers - named only as Moushin , 15 , and Larami , 16 , lost their lives .
The Interior Minister , Michelle Alliot Marie , visited the trouble spots
In a preliminary report , the IGPN excluded any responsibility of the policeman driving the car .
" The driver did not see the motorcycle arrive and was surprised by the violence of the collision , " the report says .
Two witnesses said the police car was driving at 40 - 50 kph ( 25 - 30 mph ) and had no revolving lights or siren on .
Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie , speaking in Villiers - le - Bel , deplored the deaths and called for " responsibility from everyone " , adding " of course the circumstances [ of the accident ] have to be totally clarified and this will be the job for the judiciary . "
The mayor of Villers - le - Bel , Didier Vaillant , appealed for calm and said he would ensure there was " an impartial investigation , for full light to be shed " on the accident .
A brother of one of the dead teenagers , Omar Sehhouli , said the rioting " was not violence but an expression of rage " .
In 2005 , country - wide riots erupted after the electrocution of two teenagers from another Parisian suburb - Clichy - sous - Bois - in an electricity sub-station .
They were reported to have been fleeing police at the time .
Relations between police and young people in many deprived areas have continued to be tense ever since .
“ EARTH materialises , rotating majestically in front of his face .
Hiro reaches out and grabs it .
He twists it around so he 's looking at Oregon .
Tells it to get rid of the clouds , and it does , giving him a crystalline view of the mountains and the seashore . ”
That vision from Neal Stephenson 's “ Snow Crash ” , a science - fiction novel published in 1992 , aptly describes Google Earth , a computer program that lets users fly over a detailed photographic map of the world .
Other information , such as roads , borders and the locations of coffee shops can be draped on to the view , which can be panned , rotated , tilted and zoomed with almost seamless continuity .
First - time users often report an exhilarating revelatory pang as they realise what the software can do .
As the globe spins and switches from one viewpoint to another , it can even induce vertigo .
Google 's virtual globe incorporates elevation data that describe surface features such as mountains and valleys .
Other data is then overlaid on it , notably a patchwork of satellite imagery and aerial photography licensed from several public and private providers .
The entire planet is covered , with around one - third of all land depicted in such detail that individual trees and cars , and the homes of 3 billion people , can be seen .
All this has long been imaginable but has become possible only recently , thanks to high - resolution commercial satellite imaging , broadband links and cheap , powerful computers .
Keyhole , an American firm , released the first commercial “ geobrowser ” in 2001 .
Google bought Keyhole in 2004 and launched Google Earth in 2005 .
Its basic , free version has since been downloaded over 250 m times , says Michael Jones , one of Keyhole 's founders and now Google Earth 's chief technologist .
In 2004 America 's space agency , NASA , released another geobrowser , called World Wind .
More than 20 m copies are in use .
But Google 's main geobrowsing rival is Microsoft .
Both Encarta , Microsoft 's encyclopedia , and TerraServer , a database demonstration project , had geobrowser - like features in the 1990s .
At the end of 2005 Microsoft bought GeoTango , which contributed to the development of Live Search Maps , a web - based geobrowser that uses data from Virtual Earth , Microsoft 's digital model of the planet .
( Google also provides a web - based geobrowser via Google Maps . )
An overlay shows desroyed villages in Darfur ; sunbakers on Sydney 's Bondi Beach ; the city of Berlin , with detailed 3 - D buildings
Vincent Tao , GeoTango 's founder and now director of Virtual Earth for Microsoft , allows that Microsoft has spent at the “ couple of hundreds of millions of dollars level ” on Virtual Earth .
Most of that has been spent on the acquisition of imagery , which now totals 14 petabytes on 900 servers .
( One petabyte is 1 m gigabytes . )
The company is also adding detail in the form of textured three - dimensional models of cities devised from aerial photographs ; ten cities are added each month .
For its part , Google is relying on “ crowdsourcing ” — enlisting its users to build and contribute images , 3 - D models of buildings and other data to enrich its digital planet .
So far 850,000 users have contributed millions of annotations and more than 1 m images , vetting one another 's contributions .
Wikipedia , which uses a similar system , is itself available through Google Earth .
Users can read Wikipedia articles placed on the globe using “ geotags ” — spatial co-ordinates encoded into each entry .
Other sites including Flickr , the leading photo - sharing site , and Google 's YouTube , also support geotags .
These virtual globes are being put to an unexpected range of uses .
Google Earth was used to co-ordinate relief efforts in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Tax inspectors in Buenos Aires are using it to see whether people are correctly reporting the size of their properties .
An Italian programmer who was using the software noticed odd markings on the ground near his home town which turned out to be a previously unknown Roman villa .
Roofers , landscape gardeners and solar - panel installers use the virtual maps to scout for potential customers .
Rebecca Moore , a member of the Google Earth team , used the software to galvanise her neighbourhood in the Santa Cruz mountains in opposition to a nearby logging project .
And the Amazon Conservation Team , an American charity , equipped 26 indigenous tribes in the Amazon with hand - held global positioning system units and computers running Google Earth , to enable them to assert their legal sovereignty in the face of threats from loggers and miners .
“ It 's turning into a map of historical significance , ” says John Hanke , head of Google 's Earth and Maps division , and another of Keyhole 's founders .
“ It is going to be a map of the world that is more detailed than any map that 's ever been created . ”
He may be understating the technology 's importance .
The world - wired web
Geobrowsers are a stunningly effective means of visualising the planet .
But they are just one part of a broader endeavour , the construction of a “ geoweb ” that is still in its infancy , much as the world wide web was in the mid-1990s .
The web did away with many geographical constraints , enabling people with common interests to communicate , regardless of location .
Yet placelessness jettisons some of the most useful features of information , which are now attracting new attention .
At present the most feverish excitement surrounds the combination of virtual maps with other sources of data in “ mash -ups ” .
One of the earliest examples , housingmaps.com , created in 2005 , combines San Francisco apartment listings from Craigslist.org with Google Maps .
Mash - ups have since become commonplace — Google says its maps are used in more than 4 m of them .
In April the company added features to Google Maps to make it easier to create mash - ups .
Microsoft is at work on a similar tool .
Another site , platial.com , provides free mash - up tools for bloggers , spawning a new genre in self - absorption : autobiogeography .
The geoweb has obvious appeal to those in the property business .
Zillow.com mashes Microsoft's Virtual Earth with other data to create maps of home prices in America .
But property is just the start .
At gasbuddy.com , visitors can map local petrol prices to plan fill - ups .
ExploreOurPla.net brings together thousands of sources of images and data to let users investigate climate change .
House prices overlaid on a satellite map at Zillow.com ; San Francisco , seen on Google 's Street View ; a GIS view of an air - force base
These examples illustrate the emerging architecture of the geoweb : data , such as information on traffic jams or seismic tremors , is hosted separately from the images and models of the geobrowser , which assembles , combines and displays the information in new ways .
GeoCommons.com hosts data , from crime rates to melanoma statistics , that can be combined to create colour - coded “ heat maps ” of intangibles such as “ hipness ” .
Visitors to Heywhatsthat.com can generate a diagram of the view from any high spot to see the names of visible mountain peaks .
Here the neogeographers , as mash - up enthusiasts are known , have crossed into the terrain of “ geographic information systems ” ( GIS ) , the fancy software tools that are used by governments and companies to analyse spatial data .
Geobrowsers are still quite primitive by comparison , but are much easier to use .
For its part GIS deals with critical infrastructure , so its data tend to be of impeccable quality .
Jack Dangermond , the founder of ESRI , a private firm that dominates the GIS market , says interest stimulated by the geoweb has helped to boost business by 20 % this year .
Ron Lake of Galdos Systems , a firm that specialises in integrating civic geodata , says geobrowsers have led to a push for better public access to such data .
When the analytical insights and data quality of GIS are combined with the geoweb 's visualisation and networking prowess , startling efficiencies emerge .
Last year Waterstone , a consultancy , assembled the geodata for 13 American air - force bases and wrapped them up in a modified version of NASA 's World Wind geobrowser .
This makes it possible to walk through a 3 - D model of each base and call up multiple layers of data .
A project manager can view live video from a construction site and identify the contractors and their vehicles .
A planner can assess a proposed building 's effect on runway visibility .
And an environmental engineer , while viewing a plume of contaminated groundwater , can delve into 45 years ' worth of documents associated with the site .
Carla Johnson , Waterstone 's boss , says the project cost less than $ 1 m and is expected to save the air force around $ 5 m a year through faster decision - making .
Smile , you 're on Google Earth
Like any technology , the geoweb has both good and bad uses .
When geobrowsers first introduced easy access to satellite imagery , something that had previously only been available to intelligence agencies , many observers worried that terrorists might use such images to plan attacks .
Google Earth seems to have been used in this way by Iraqi insurgents planning attacks on a British base in the city of Basra , for example , in which individual buildings and vehicles can be clearly seen .
After this came to light in January , the images of the area in question were replaced with images from 2002 , predating the construction of the camp .
This summer a member of the Assembly of the State of New York called on Google to obscure imagery after the geobrowser was used by plotters in a foiled airport attack .
Yet Mr Jones says Google has been formally contacted by governments in this regard only three times ( including by India and by an unspecified European country ) , and that in each case the issue was resolved without making changes to the imagery in Google Earth .
Although some buildings or areas are blurred for security reasons , Google says this is done by the firms from which it licenses the imagery .
Microsoft says it blurs photos in response to “ legitimate government and agency requests ” .
But the images are typically between six months and three years old , which limits their tactical usefulness ; and satellite and aerial images are available from many other sources , and have been for some time .
So in some respects , geobrowsers have not made possible anything that was not possible before — they have just made access to such images much cheaper and easier .
“ It 's a question of the policy and the thinking catching up with the technology , ” says Mr Hanke .
“ Ease of access alters the debate . ”
Google insists that it takes security concerns very seriously , and points out that the American government 's official position is that the benefits of making satellite images widely available outweigh the risks .
Indeed , some jurisdictions are embracing the exposure .
The Canary Islands have donated high - resolution imagery to Google in the hope that virtual visitors might become real tourists , and the city of Berlin has made its painstakingly detailed digital models available through Google Earth .
For governments that are used to hiding things from each other 's spy satellites , the advent of the geobrowsers does not change things very much .
Ordinary members of the public can now call up images of Chinese nuclear submarines via Google Earth , but intelligence agencies around the world have had access to far more detailed satellite images for years .
And the fact that the submarines can be seen at all means that China is not trying to keep their existence a secret .
Even so , armed forces do find the geoweb useful .
The American military is a big user of both World Wind and the enterprise version of Google Earth .
And some governments do have grounds for concern : the government of Sudan , for example , would undoubtedly prefer the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum not to highlight destroyed villages in Darfur via an overlay in Google Earth .
Close to home , the geoweb turns out to have implications for personal privacy as well as geopolitics .
Google 's new Street View feature , launched in May , lets users of Google Maps move through stitched - together street - level imagery of several American cities , giving private citizens a taste of “ crowdsourced ” surveillance .
All the views are of public streets yet , in aggregate , they challenge accepted notions of privacy — especially for those caught doing something naughty as Google 's specially equipped camera van swoops past .
Shortly after the feature was launched , users uncovered a car getting a ticket from Miami police , a man scaling a locked gate in San Francisco and another man entering a shop selling sex toys .
“ When the coverage is everything and everywhere , there is going to be a big problem , ” says Lee Tien , a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , an internet campaign group .
Satellite images are not detailed enough to allow individual people or vehicles to be identified , but faces and licence plates can be seen in Google 's Street View .
There are few legal precedents .
In 2003 , Barbra Streisand sued to keep her Malibu estate out of an online library of images of the California coast .
She lost .
Although movie stars are more stalked than most — several sites provide geobrowser links to celebrities ' homes — it is easy to imagine innocent annotations that could be unintentionally dangerous .
Shelters for battered women , for example , often prefer not to make their locations widely known .
Google 's Mr Jones believes the benefits are strong enough to overcome these concerns .
“ I think there 's a social barrier to everything new , ” he says .
The availability of useful information will outweigh concern over surveillance and loss of privacy , he believes .
Five or six years ago , he notes , people worried about the spread of camera phones .
But now “ everyone just presumes that everybody has a camera on their phone — it 's nothing special . ”
The lesson of previous technologies , he says , is that “ we all are happy to tolerate things that would have previously been considered intolerable . ”
Indeed , all the features — good and bad — of the internet will eventually gain new dimensions on the geoweb .
Bots and intelligent agents will crawl it .
It will be populated by avatars , as Second Life becomes first life , and it will enable the inverse : telepresent machines roaming the real world .
Ghostly , private worlds will be overlaid on reality , sensitive only to members .
The malicious possibilities are sobering : location - based viruses , geohacking and , worst of all , geospam .
Despite these concerns , the potential of the geoweb is not lost on investors .
Since the beginning of last year more than 20 geospatial firms have been the targets of mergers and acquisitions , with Google , Microsoft and ESRI among the buyers .
But it is not quite time to declare the dawn of Web 3.0 .
For one thing , consumer geobrowsing does not make any money .
Microsoft's Mr Tao says that revenue has to come from advertising for now , until critical mass enables location - based transactions .
Google , true to form , is investing first and worrying about revenue later .
The road to Web 3.0
A more immediate hurdle is on the verge of resolution .
Google recently submitted KML , the tagging protocol that describes how objects are placed in Google Earth , to the Open Geospatial Consortium ( OGC ) , a standards body .
This will let other firms support it .
GML , a protocol developed by the OGC to encode spatial - information models , was formally adopted as an international standard this year .
Standards for dynamic geodata , the sharing of 3 - D models of buildings and geodata from sensor networks ought to be in place by next year .
All this will ensure interoperability and do for geodata what the web did for other forms of data , says Carl Reed , the OGC 's chief technologist .
At the same time , the incorporation of satellite - positioning technology into mobile phones and cars could open the floodgates .
When it is available , simply moving about one 's neighbourhood can then be tantamount to browsing and generating content without doing anything , as demonstrated by a company called Socialight .
Its service lets mobile users attach notes to any location , to be read by others who come along later .
Taken further , the result could end up being a sort of extrasensory information awareness , annotation and analysis capability in the real world .
“ When that happens ” , says Mr Jones , “ then the map is actually a little portal on to life itself . ”
The only thing that can hold it back , he believes , is the rate at which society can adapt .
Two Irresistible Reasons Housing Will Retrace to 1997 Prices
( August 23 , 2007 )
Two historically irresistible patterns suggest speculative - bubble housing values will eventually retrace back to their 1995 - 1997 levels :
the symmetry of speculative rises and retraces the unbreakable links between income and housing values .
To get started , let 's stipulate that the Great Housing Boom of the past decade was not a housing boom -- it was a speculative debt - fueled bubble which happened to occur in the asset class known as real estate .
As a speculative bubble , it shares the same characteristics as other speculative manias in tulips , stocks , toilet paper , etc .
( Note that there is one key difference between worthless stock certificates and toilet paper : the TP has a practical use . )
Let 's look at a speculative bubble in real estate which is finally running its course : the one which has unfolded in Japan over the past 15 years :
While the symmetry is n't perfect -- the decline took 50 % longer than the rise -- for purposes of illustrating what lies ahead I 've prepared a chart of California housing prices :
Speculative bubbles in the stock market tend to shoot up and then plummet in relatively short time spans .
Here we see that the dot - com era bubble in NASDAQ took a mere 3 years to reach euphoric heights in which risk was banished , and a roughly similar length of time to give up all the bubble 's gains , and then some .
Real estate trends stretch out over much longer time spans , and as a result we can foresee a lengthy , painfully drawn - out decline in housing values over the coming decade .
Just as stocks break free of fundamental metrics of value in speculative manias , so too do houses .
But just as stocks retrace to historical levels of price - earnings ratios , so too will housing retrace to historical levels of income - to - value ratios .
Historically , this is about 3 - to - 1 : long - term , houses cost about 3 times household income .
Since the median household income in the U.S. is abour $ 46,000 , U.S. incomes would support house values of abour $ 125,000 - $ 140,000 .
As I have noted before , my parents / step - parents each bought houses in highly desirable locales in the early 70s ( Honolulu and Pasadena ) at 2:1 ( twice annual income ) and 4:1 ( four times a schoolteacher 's annual income to buy in highly desirable Manoa Valley in Honolulu . )
As recently as 1997 , friends were purchasing small homes in very desirable S.F. Bay Area communities for $ 160,000 - $ 175,000 - - four times a modest ( for this area ) household income of $ 40,000 .
In other words , to return to a normal trendline , one that was in place a mere decade ago , even the most desirable areas will command no more than 4 times median income .
That would put house prices in Honolulu , the S.F. Bay Area , West L.A. , Connecticut , Northern Virgina , etc. at about $ 180,000 - $ 200,000 -- not $ 600,000 .
New correspondent Jim V. provides an excellent overview of how the market could return to historical norms :
After reading yours and other blogs I now have a firm understanding of the housing bubble and credit crisis .
What I have not seen is a solution to these issue .
I 've seen statements saying millions will lose their homes to foreclosure .
These are said in a manner like it is a foregone conclusion .
Here is an idea on how to prevent the foreclosures :
- If buying a house , first find out the medium family income for the area you are interested .
Then offer 3 times that amount and not a penny more .
- If selling a house , do the same thing by pricing the house at 3 times the medium annual income for that area .
- Assessors should start re-assessing homes using the above guidelines .
- Institutions that service existing loans should immediately restructure the loans terms so that the principle amount equals 3 times the medium family for the area .
I 've been reading that traditionally ( in the not to distant past ) , paying 2 1 / 2 to 3 times your annual income for a house was typical .
An end must come to this idiocy and it will come from a grass roots movement .

( From the diaries -- kos )
Now that the British military has all but left southern Iraq , the International Herald Tribune is reporting that violence has fallen by 90 percent in Basra — Iraq ’s second largest city .
Here ’s why it ’s happening :
The thing you have to understand about an occupation like the one in Iraq , is that much of the violence results from the unrest that occurs when people have no sense of a permanent presence of authority .
At the risk of going completely unscientific here , it ’s like a class that wo n’t behave for a substitute teacher .
The people have no need to please or respect the occupier , because they know that ultimately , that occupier will give way to a more long - term power .
In such a situation — where there is no sense of permanent authority — dozens and dozens of groups vie for power .
They all want to end up being that more long - term power .
And their agendas are varied — as are their methods for causing trouble .
I described it this way when I returned from the middle of the Iraqi insurgency :
There are a few fighters who have a real political agenda for killing both the invaders and those who would build a new government ; there are a few foreign zealots , a few religious zealots , a few more foreign religious zealots , and then there are the rest of them — the overwhelming majority of whom are young , impressionable , male , unemployed , bored , and pissed about , among other things , the fact that their uncle was killed in an air strike or their cousin was killed at a traffic control point for not stopping soon enough .
Without this last group there would be no insurgency .
::
And with these types of insurgencies , the longer you stay there the worse it gets .
On a long enough timeline , an occupying force will eventually piss off everyone .
That ’s just what happens , even when you come with the best of intentions .
When I wrote that , I failed to include the category of common criminal gangs and thugs — the other major problem in Iraq .
Either way , the presence of foreign troops in Iraq is exacerbating the already prevalent tension and conflict between the many groups there .
When we pull out , there may very well be an uptick in violence at first , but there is no reason to believe Republican fear - mongering when they argue that a general conflagration will ensue .
A prominent Iraqi activist and blogger summed up in the Washington Post earlier this year why this conflagration is not likely to occur :
Raed Jarrar , an Iraqi who directs the Iraqi Project of the human rights group Global Exchange , said it is time to bring the troops home and turn over control to the Iraqi people , who , he said , have been governing their country for centuries .
“ Governing their country for centuries , ” he said .
The logic of the Kagans and Kristols of the world is asinine and arrogant when you consider Jarrar ’s statement .
There is no reason to believe that Iraq ’s only means of national survival is to depend on a 160,000 - person fighting force of Americans .
And the British withdrawal from Basra just highlights that .
Even Ron
Paul got this one right recently :
The people who say there will be a bloodbath are the ones who said it will be a cakewalk or it will be a slam dunk , and that it will be paid for by oil .
Why believe them ?
That ’s a good question .
And now , I think the British have finally begun to answer it in a very concrete way .
They ’ve pulled out of Basra .
And violence is down 90 percent .
It is now time for American forces to implement a similar plan , over time , throughout the rest of Iraq .
Mr Barroso came ahead of the likes of Mr Blair and Mr Brown
Mr Barroso , who is unelected , received 22 % of the vote in the BBC Radio 4 shortlist which included Rupert Murdoch and internet search engine Google .
Prime Minister Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and Parliament were deemed less influential but still made the top 10 .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson says voters may be using the poll to say Europe has too much power .
Mr Blair got 7 % and the chancellor 4 % , which was less than the 10 % polled by Cabinet Secretary and chief civil servant Sir Gus O'Donnell .
Who Runs Britain ?
poll 1 . Jose Manuel Barroso - 22 % 2 . Rupert Murdoch - 15 % 3 . Parliament - 14 % 4 . The British People - 12 % 5 . Gus O'Donnell - 10 % 6 . Terry Leahy - 7 % 7 . Tony Blair - 7 % 8 . Google - 6 % 9 . Gordon Brown - 4 % 10 . Shami Chakrabarti - 4 %
Nick Robinson's Newslog
Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy received 7 % and Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil rights group Liberty and the only woman in the top 10 , got 4 % .
The European Commission is the EU 's executive body and the only EU institution that can propose legislation .
That is where the commission has its power , Nick Robinson says .
Commenting on the Who Runs Britain ?
poll , Roger Knapman , leader of the UK Independence Party , congratulated those who voted for Mr Barroso .
" Of course it is the only chance you 'll get to vote for him or for that matter against him , " he said .
" He is now a bureaucrat perceived as the most important man in this country and that is quite shocking . "
But former Europe Minister Dennis McShane said it was " an urban myth " to suggest that Britain 's laws were decided by Europe .
What works best online ?
Funny still does .
In fact , the Web has become the world ’s biggest comedy club , where cutting - edge and too - profane - for - prime - time players — from Hollywood heavies like Will Ferrell to alt - comedy godfathers like Bob Odenkirk — are trying out their best material , for free .

The Tories say they would push the government 's academies further
He said Tory leader David Cameron 's advisers were largely ex-public schoolboys , and many backbenchers were " very tired of the Cameron project " .
A decision to end traditional support for grammars has angered many Tory MPs .
But education spokesman David Willetts defended the policy , and said it was not an attack on existing grammars .
Earlier in the week the Tories announced they would end their traditional support for such schools and instead take Tony Blair 's city academies project even further .
Backbench anger
But it has been denounced as " ridiculous " and " absurd " by some angry Tory backbenchers .
On Sunday , Mr Farage said only his party could offer a choice on the issue .
I think this is a disconnect between the David Cameron set and real people
Nigel Farage
Farage on Tories
" It 's UKIP that believes in academic selection and believes in grammar schools - we know they work , " he told BBC One 's AM programme .
" The electorate will say : ' What 's the difference between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party ? '
The answer is , not very much . "
He accused Mr Cameron's " set " of being largely former Eton public schoolboys , suggesting they were out of touch with the " real world " .
Possible defections
" I think this is a disconnect between the David Cameron set and real people , " he said .
Asked whether the policy would cause Tory MPs to defect he said there were an " awful lot " of MPs who were tired of David Cameron 's efforts to change the party .
He added : " Whether this proves to be the straw that breaks the camel 's back , I do n't know .
I do think we are not very far away from that point . "
I am confident that that is going to improve social mobility in this country today
David Willetts
Willetts on U- turn
Earlier in the week Mr Willetts said it was a " fantasy " to say selection at the age of 11 could be fair .
And he said a " shockingly low " number of children from poor backgrounds were getting into grammar schools , while middle class children were being coached to pass the exam .
But on Sunday he told the AM programme the Conservatives were not attacking existing grammar schools .
He said the party wanted to improve social mobility in the " large parts of the country where grammar schools have gone " .
And he said a return to grammar schools would not be feasible or would not tackle the " big problem of declining opportunities in Britain today " .
He added : " I am confident that that is going to improve social mobility in this country today which I think is a fundamental Conservative principle and I 'm thinking afresh about how we can deliver that in education . "
Former Conservative leader Michael Howard , who has been reported to be furious at Mr Willetts over his speech , has said he is making no comment on the row .
The German - based Energy Watch Group will release its study in London today saying that global oil production peaked in 2006 - much earlier than most experts had expected .
The report , which predicts that production will now fall by several percent a year , comes after oil prices set new records almost every day last week , on Friday hitting more than $ 90 ( £ 44 ) a barrel .
" The world soon will not be able to produce all the oil it needs as demand is rising while supply is falling .
This is a huge problem for the world economy , " said Hans - Josef Fell , EWG 's founder and the German MP behind the country 's successful support system for renewable energy .
The report 's author , Joerg Schindler , said its most alarming finding was the steep decline in oil production after its peak , which he says is now behind us .
The results are in contrast to projections from the International Energy Agency , which says there is little reason to worry about oil supplies at the moment .
However , the EWG study relies more on actual oil production data which , it says , are more reliable than estimates of reserves still in the ground .
The group says official industry estimates put global reserves at about 1.255 gigabarrels - equivalent to 42 years ' supply at current consumption rates .
But it thinks the figure is only about two thirds of that .
Global oil production is currently about 81 m barrels a day - EWG expects that to fall to 39 m by 2030 .
It also predicts significant falls in gas , coal and uranium production as those energy sources are used up .
Britain's oil production peaked in 1999 and has already dropped by half to about 1.6 million barrels a day .
The report presents a bleak view of the future unless a radically different approach is adopted .
It quotes the British energy economist David Fleming as saying : " Anticipated supply shortages could lead easily to disturbing scenes of mass unrest as witnessed in Burma this month .
For government , industry and the wider public , just muddling through is not an option any more as this situation could spin out of control and turn into a complete meltdown of society . "
Mr Schindler comes to a similar conclusion .
" The world is at the beginning of a structural change of its economic system .
This change will be triggered by declining fossil fuel supplies and will influence almost all aspects of our daily life . "
Jeremy Leggett , one of Britain 's leading environmentalists and the author of Half Gone , a book about " peak oil " - defined as the moment when maximum production is reached , said that both the UK government and the energy industry were in " institutionalised denial " and that action should have been taken sooner .
" When I was an adviser to government , I proposed that we set up a taskforce to look at how fast the UK could mobilise alternative energy technologies in extremis , come the peak , " he said .
" Other industry advisers supported that .
But the government prefers to sleep on without even doing a contingency study .
For those of us who know that premature peak oil is a clear and present danger , it is impossible to understand such complacency . "
Mr Fell said that the world had to move quickly towards the massive deployment of renewable energy and to a dramatic increase in energy efficiency , both as a way to combat climate change and to ensure that the lights stayed on .
" If we did all this we may not have an energy crisis . "
He accused the British government of hypocrisy .
" Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have talked a lot about climate change but have not brought in proper policies to drive up the use of renewables , " he said .
" This is why they are left talking about nuclear and carbon capture and storage . "
Yesterday , a spokesman for the Department of Business and Enterprise said : " Over the next few years global oil production and refining capacity is expected to increase faster than demand .
The world 's oil resources are sufficient to sustain economic growth for the foreseeable future .
The challenge will be to bring these resources to market in a way that ensures sustainable , timely , reliable and affordable supplies of energy . "
The German policy , which guarantees above - market payments to producers of renewable power , is being adopted in many countries - but not Britain , where renewables generate about 4 % of the country 's electricity and 2 % of its overall energy needs .
· This article was amended on Tuesday October 30 2007 .
We said that an Energy Watch Group report found that output peaked in 2006 and would fall 7 % a year .
The report said several per cent , not 7 % .
This has been corrected .
CBS : Only A Handful Support Impeachment ; Its A Bluff Posted by Pile ( 7859 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ News Media ]
In reaction to Dennis Kucinich 's bill to pursue impeachment proceedings for Vice President Cheney , CBS 's Harry Smith called the effort a " bluff , " that only a " handful of people " are in favor of impeachment and merely a political tactic to get a failing presidential candidate some attention ...
Watch this embarrassing hit - piece on a politician who is actually trying to do something about the administration 's impending rhetoric for invading Iran ....
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , whose impeachment resolution against Vice President Dick Cheney was kept temporarily afloat on Tuesday -- largely with the help of House Republicans -- says the measure was no bluff .
During an appearance on CBS's Early Show , host Harry Smith told Kucinich that Republicans had " basically called your bluff " in wanting to debate the impeachment of Cheney on the House floor .
" They did n't call my bluff , " Kucinich shot back .
" I was fully prepared for debate -- with a three - inch thick binder annotating the violations of law and the violations of the Constitution committed by the vice president which would justify an impeachment . "
Smith responded that Kucinich had " certainly called the bluff of the Democratic leadership , " adding that the congressman did not have the support of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) , who had introduced a motion to kill debate on the subject , nor Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
" There 's really , what , a handful of you who are really interested in this , " Smith added .
But Kucinich said his impeachment resolution had little to do with the lack of support he was receiving from fellow Democrats .
" Harry , you have to remember there are millions of Americans who are part of a national movement to defend the constitution , " said Kucinich .
" And they understand that the vice president made a false claim for war and is trying to beat the drums for a war against Iran and they 're calling for action to be done . "
Impeachment , said Kucinich , was a move on his part safeguard the Constitution .
" It 's really abut the American people and their insistence that their government not be lost , " he continued .
" People are worried that we 're losing democracy , and they 're demanding that the Constitution be protected .
And that 's exactly what yesterday was about . "
Smith later asked the congressman if the impeachment resolution was all part of a publicity stunt in aid of his presidential campaign .
" The nay - sayers , though , " said Smith , " would say ' Dennis Kucinich this is a way to get your name on -- at least on page six of the newspaper and a failing bid to win the Democratic nomination for president . ' "
Not so , said Kucinich :
" We have men and women with their lives on the line in Iraq , a war based on lies , " said the former Cleveland mayor .
" Over 3,800 soldiers have died , over a million innocent Iraqis have died in this war .
This is about our moral caliber here as to whether or not Washington can see the truth . "
" Let me tell you something , " concluded Kucinich .
" In Washington , the truth is an unidentified flying object .
And it 's time that someone stood for the truth .
The American people demand nothing less . "
In a strict party - line vote , Democrats sent the Cheney impeachment resolution to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday , where it will be considered by Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) .

At least 25 rebels attacked a cultural festival in the state of Jharkhand early on Saturday , firing on the crowd , India 's Press Trust news agency said .
The son of ex-chief minister Babu Lal Marandi was attending the event .
The border with the neighbouring state of Bihar was sealed to prevent the rebels fleeing , police superintendent Arun Kumar Singh told the AFP agency .
The cultural festival followed a football match that was played on Friday afternoon .
Serious threat
" The police security personnel deployed left the place after the football match , " Mr Singh told AFP .
" They did wrong .
They should have stayed . "
Another four people were reported to have been injured in the attack .
Maoist rebels operate in 182 districts in India , mainly in the states of Jharkhand , Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra and West Bengal .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said the Maoists pose the most serious threat to national security in India .
More than 6,000 people have died during the rebels ' decades - long fight for a communist state in parts of India .

Jauzion ( centre ) is congratulated for his match - winning try New Zealand ( 13 ) 18
Try : McAlister , So'oialo
Pens : Carter ( 2 )
Cons : Carter
France ( 3 ) 20
Try : Dusautoir , Jauzion
Pens : Beauxis ( 2 )
Cons : Beauxis , Elissalde France set up a World Cup semi-final with England after a stunning win over hot favourites New Zealand in Cardiff .
The All Blacks dominated the first half but only had Luke McAlister 's try to show for it , with Lionel Beauxis 's penalty being France 's lone score .
After McAlister was sin-binned early in the second half , Thierry Dusautoir took advantage to score and level the game .
Rodney So'oialo's try restored New Zealand 's lead before Yannick Jauzion scored France 's match - winning try .
France made their intentions clear by staring down the New Zealand haka before kick - off , but the early loss of Serge Betsen , knocked out cold in a fourth - minute ruck , disrupted their plans .
606 : DEBATE
Dan Carter 's early penalty put New Zealand ahead and it looked like a try was sure to follow when McAlister ran straight through the French defensive line minutes later .
But a brilliant tackle by Vincent Clerc forced Ali Williams 's feet into touch as he tried to go over in the corner .
That McAlister cameo showed just what a threat he was , though , and it was not long before that threat was converted into points .
Carter 's expertly - timed pass sent Sale 's new recruit through the French defence once again and he flew over after swapping passes with Jerry Collins .
Another Carter penalty extended the lead as France failed to live up to their pre-match theatrics with any positive action .
They chose not to run the ball out of defence in the first half - hour and only had one Beauxis penalty on the board at the break .
Rodney So'oialo troops off as France celebrate victory
But the game turned just after the restart , when McAlister was sin-binned for deliberate obstruction on Jauzion as he chased Beauxis 's kick - through .
France 's backs finally sprung into life as a meaningful attacking force , Dusautoir finding a way through on the right to touch down behind the posts .
So'oialo slid under several challenges to claim New Zealand 's second try and restore the lead , but the introduction of Frederic Michalak had instant effect as France promptly went ahead for the first time .
Damien Traille fed the fly - half , whose burst of speed took him away from the chasing New Zealand players before he off - loaded to Jauzion to touch down .
Jean -Baptiste Elissalde 's conversion put France on top and , inspiring comparisons with their legendary 1999 semi-final win over the All Blacks , they held on for a famous win .
New Zealand 's defeat meant they failed to reach the semi-final for the first time in World Cup history .

In recent years , the world has done a complete 360 - degree turn on plastic use .
Instead of it being the most versatile and convenient option around according to its users – it has become the most burdensome for the planet and a thorn for sustainability .
Because most of this generation has grown up with plastic products , it can be hard to flick that switch off right away to focus on sustainable , eco-friendly materials .
Some people may not even know what they can use instead .
So , what can replace plastic in your everyday life ?
Read on to find out .
Single - Use Servingware
When you are playing host at a barbecue or community event , it can be hard to find serving ware that ’s both convenient and safe for the environment .
While you could encourage people to bring their own plates and cutlery , it ’s just not practical .
Sometimes , plastic seems like the only way .
But it ’s not .
Instead of plastic cutlery and plates , which will end up in the rubbish bin within minutes of its one - time use , you can use wood or bamboo .
There is now a myriad of different eco-friendly serving ware options .
While they , too , can be single - use , they break down in the environment and release nutrients into the soil .
You ca n’t say the same about plastic .
Shopping Bags
There are now 127 countries that have adopted legislation regarding single - use plastic bags .
Mostly , they are now banned in those countries .
So , what are you supposed to use instead ?
Muslin pouches and other cloth and material bags should be your go - to option from now on .
Store them in the boot of your car , so you never forget them .
You can also use these bags while retail shopping .
Straws
Did you know the world is using around half a billion plastic straws every day ?
That means as many as 8.3 billion straws pollute the world ’s beaches .
Do n’t contribute to these saddening statistics .
Instead of buying plastic straws , you can make use of several other options for sale that promote sustainability in the best way .
You can now buy silicone , stainless steel , and other reusable straws that you can clean and stow away in a pouch in your handbag .
The next time you visit a restaurant , you can say “ no thanks ” to their offering of a plastic straw , and pull out your own that will continue to serve you well for years to come .
Packaging
There are going to be some parts of your life that appear a little harder on the surface without plastic .
Take deli- made foods and bulk buys , for example .
How are you supposed to store those pick and mix lollies that generally come in plastic bags ?
Glass is your new best friend .
Have no doubts about visiting your local supermarket with glass jars in your trolley .
The shop assistant will be impressed at your dedication to sustainability .
Plastic may have been our past , but it ’s not our future .
Everything from shopping bags to packaging and single - use serving ware is now in the spotlight .
Jump on the sustainability bandwagon and invest in products that will help , not harm the environment .
A surgeon accidentally kills a patient , undoes the error and starts over again .
Can mathematics make such science fiction a reality ?
The day is rapidly approaching when your surgeon can practice on your “ digital double ” — a virtual you — before performing an actual surgery , according to UCLA mathematician Joseph Teran , who is helping to make virtual surgery a viable technology .
The advantages will save lives , he believes .
“ You can fail spectacularly with no consequences when you use a simulator and then learn from your mistakes , ” said Teran , 30 , who joined UCLA ’s mathematics department in July .
“ If you make errors , you can undo them — just as if you ’re typing in a Word document and you make a mistake , you undo it .
Starting over is a big benefit of the simulation .
“ Surgical simulation is coming , there is no question about it , ” he said .
“ It ’s a cheaper alternative to cadavers and a safer alternative to patients . ”
How would virtual surgery work ?
“ The ideal situation would be when patients come in for a procedure , they get scanned and a three - dimensional digital double is generated ; I mean a digital double — you on the computer , including your internal organs , ” Teran said .
“ The surgeon first does surgery on the virtual you .
With a simulator , a surgeon can practice a procedure tens or hundreds of times .
You could have a patient in a small town scanned while a surgeon hundreds or thousands of miles away practices the surgery .
The patient then flies out for the surgery .
We have to solve mathematical algorithms so what the surgeon does on the computer mimics real life . ”
How far off is this virtual surgery ?
“ A three - dimensional double of you can be made , but it would now take 20 people six to nine months , ” Teran said .
“ In the future , one person will be able to do it in minutes .
It ’s going to happen , and it will allow surgeons to make fewer mistakes on actual patients .
The only limiting factor is the complexity of the geometry involved .
We ’re working on that .
Our job as applied mathematicians is to make these technologies increasingly viable . ”
The technology will be especially helpful with new kinds of surgeries , he said .
“ A virtual surgery cannot be a cartoon , ” said Teran , who works with a surgeon .
“ It has to be biologically accurate .
A virtual double needs to be really you . ”
Teran is organizing a virtual surgery workshop that will take place at UCLA from Jan. 7 to 11 as part of UCLA ’s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics .
For information , visit www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/vs2008/vs2008_poster.pdf.
Making virtual surgery a reality will require solving mathematical equations , as well as making progress in computational geometry and computer science .
An applied mathematician , Teran works in these fields ; he develops algorithms to solve equations .
Advances by Teran and other scientists in computational geometry , partial differential equations and large - scale computing are accelerating virtual surgery .
How human tissue responds to a surgeon , Teran said , is based on partial differential equations .
Teran solves on a computer the mathematical equations that govern physical phenomena relevant to everyday life .
He has studied the biomechanical simulation of soft tissues .
“ Most of the behavior of everyday life can be described with mathematical equations , ” he said .
“ It ’s very difficult to reproduce natural phenomena without math . ”
Tissue , muscle and skin are elastic and behave like a spring , Teran said .
Their behavior can be accounted for by a classical mathematical theory .
Progress in his field is already rapid , Teran said , noting that “ things in geometry that used to take days and days start to take hours and minutes . ”
Teran believes medical schools will increasingly train physicians using computer surgical simulation .
Teran ’s applied mathematics can also be used to design more durable bridges , freeways , cars and aircraft .
“ I would like people who design bridges to be able to use a virtual model — I ’m interested in making that a reality and in creating numerical algorithmic tools that let people who design bridges have more computational machinery at their fingertips , ” he said .
As an undergraduate , Teran realized “ you can use math problems to solve real problems and can help people in ways that seem totally unrelated to math . ”
He earned his doctorate at Stanford University , where he took graduate classes in partial differential equations and worked on new ways of solving the governing equations of elastic biological tissues .
He was a postdoctoral scholar at New York University before joining UCLA ’s faculty .
“ I started with math because I like problem - solving , and I like how elegant math is , ” Teran said .
“ I like how much careful analysis is required , and that there ’s a right answer .
Now I ’m completely fascinated by what you get from a simulation , the kinds of complex behavior you can reproduce on a computer and the kinds of questions you can answer .
Math will tell you how the world is .
It will give you an answer , and it ’s intellectually stimulating and fun .
It really pays off . ”
Teran , who is teaching a course on scientific computing for the visual effects industry , said he came to UCLA because it is one of the country ’s best universities for applied mathematics , because its medical school is among the country ’s best and because it is near Hollywood , where he helps to make movie special effects .
Teran , who works with UCLA ’s Center for Advanced Surgical and Interventional Technology , spoke this fall as part of Intel Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner ’s keynote address at the Intel Developer Forum on the rise of the “ 3 - D Internet . ”
Teran demonstrated virtual surgery applications .
The future 3 - D Internet will include an “ avatar ” — a virtual representation of you — that could look “ just like you , or better than you , ” Teran said .
The graphics will be astonishingly realistic and three - dimensional , he said , but the simulation needs to be much more accurate , a goal Teran is working to achieve .
“ As virtual words get more realistic , modern applied mathematics and scientific computing are required , ” he said .

Wall Street executives also defend the industry as necessary to keep the peace at a time of rapid change in China .
They point out that New York has begun experimenting with surveillance cameras in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city , and that corporations make broad use of surveillance cameras in places like convenience stores and automated teller machines .
“ Is New York a police state ? ” said Peter Siris , the managing director of Guerrilla Capital and Hua - Mei 21st Century , two Manhattan hedge funds that were among the earliest investors in China Security and Surveillance .
Mr. Lantos and human rights advocates contend that surveillance in China poses different issues from surveillance in the West because China is a one - party state where government officials can exercise power with few legal restraints .
Mr. Lantos is part of a Democratic Congressional majority that is increasingly eager to confront China at a time of high Chinese trade surpluses and considerable economic insecurity in the United States .
He is also a longtime ally of Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House and a fellow Californian , who made her reputation in Congress as a critic of China on human rights issues .
A White House spokesman , Tony Fratto said the White House would not comment on specific companies , adding , “ It ’s not appropriate to interfere in the private decisions of Americans to invest in legally incorporated firms . ”
The New York Stock Exchange said that it had no comment except to confirm that China Security and Surveillance was expected to list on the exchange “ later this year , subject to the usual conditions , including approval by the S.E.C . ”
Because the company already has shares traded in the United States and is not selling any additional shares , Securities and Exchange Commission regulations say approval is automatic once the company fills out a notification form and the New York Stock Exchange confirms it has approved the listing .
In recent years , medical authorities have tried to impress more and more upon pregnant women the importance of being careful about what they ingest ( especially in the early states of pregnancy ) .
What ’s good for a pregnant mother is n’t necessarily good for the child she carries ; substances that an adult woman can tolerate without harm may still have deleterious effects on a fetus .
Two activities pregnant women are strongly urged to avoid are smoking cigarettes and drinking alcoholic beverages , to the extent that those two products now carry government - mandated warning labels directed at mothers - to - be :
SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING : Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury , Premature Birth , And Low Birth Weight .
GOVERNMENT WARNING : According to the Surgeon General , women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects .
In this context , many people found it anything from puzzling to ludicrous to see a newspaper photograph of a woman expressing concern about the effect of jackhammer noise on her unborn child while visibly puffing away on a cigarette .
So much so that quite a few readers believed the picture to be part of a phony , mocked - up newspaper article , but it was the real thing :
The photograph accompanied a 20 September 2004 article published by the Times of Roanoke , Virginia , about complaints over a road construction project which had been disrupting traffic in that town :
Traffic - calming efforts along Bullitt Avenue Southeast are making Robert Parsley furious .
Parsley , 44 , said he has lived in Southeast Roanoke all of his life and has witnessed many changes .
But this current construction project , Parsley said , “ is the dumbest thing the city has ever done . ”
Complaints from both residents and drivers about traffic on Bullitt Avenue from Sixth to Ninth streets have been “ numerous , ” said Mark Jamison , the city ’s traffic engineer .
The article included a picture of an obviously pregnant woman holding a cigarette above the following caption :
Mellisa Williamson , 35 .
a Bullitt Avenue resident , worries about the effect on her unborn child from the sound of jackhammers .
The perceived disparity between Ms. Williamson ’s words and her actions did n’t escape notice , as scanned copies of the Roanoke Times article in which she appeared began circulating on the Internet , most of them featuring a variety of snide , reader - added comments .
Within a few days the photograph had sparked so much controversy that Roanoke Times columnist Joe Kennedy penned an article about it the following week :
Mellissa Williamson came to her door smoking a cigarette Thursday morning .
It was a sign that the Southeast Roanoke woman did n’t know or did n’t care about the furor her photograph had ignited since it appeared in The Roanoke Times on Sept. 20 .
The photo showed her seven months pregnant and smoking a cigarette .
It accompanied a story about unpopular “ traffic - calming ” measures under way on Bullitt Avenue , where she lives .
The caption said she worries about the effect of jackhammer noise on her unborn child .
She could n’t have touched off a controversy more quickly if she ’d called President Bush an Islamic extremist .
Dozens of calls and e-mails came to The Roanoke Times impugning her reputation and criticizing the paper for printing the photo .
It glamorized or promoted smoking while pregnant , some people said .
At least one syndicated talk radio host mentioned it , and the picture proliferated on Web sites , with the caption and some wise remark like , “ Yeah , the noise is what the baby needs to fear . ”
Williamson said she knows smoking is bad because people have criticized her since she took up the practice 20 years ago .
“ I really do n’t pay that much attention to it , ” she said .
“ If people do n’t like it , that ’s their opinion .
They ’ve got theirs and I ’ve got mine . ”
She has tried every way to quit without success , she said .
As for smoking while pregnant , she said her doctor told her “ it would be good if I cut back , but if I totally quit , it would not only cause stress on me but it would cause stress on the baby . ”
Joe Kennedy visited with Mellissa Williamson and her partner — and their new son — a few months later :
What could possibly go wrong with a scheme to introduce tens of thousands of young , stressed out soldiers fighting a guerrilla war in a Muslim country to a particularly bloody - minded brand of aggressively evangelical apocalyptic Christianity ?
As Max Blumenthal reports in The Nation , the Pentagon is on a quest — one might say a crusade — to find out .
As an official arm of the Defense Department 's America Supports
You program , [ Operation Straight Up ] plans to mail copies of the controversial apocalyptic video game , Left Behind : Eternal Forces to soldiers serving in Iraq .
OSU is also scheduled to embark on a " Military Crusade in Iraq " in the near future .
" We feel the forces of heaven have encouraged us to perform multiple crusades that will sweep through this war torn region , " OSU declares on its website about its planned trip to Iraq .
" We 'll hold the only religious crusade of its size in the dangerous land of Iraq . "
Well , it 's just a harmless video game and a traveling ministry , right ?
A bit of entertainment and spiritual solace ?
Not exactly .
The Left Behind videogame is a real - time strategy game that makes players commanders of a virtual evangelical army in a post - apocalyptic landscape that looks strikingly like New York City after 9/11 .
With tanks , helicopters and a fearsome arsenal of automatic weapons at their disposal , Left Behind players wage a violent war against United Nations - like peacekeepers who , according to LaHaye 's interpretation of Revelation , represent the armies of the Antichrist .
Each time a Left Behind player kills a UN soldier , their virtual character exclaims , " Praise the Lord ! "
To win the game , players must kill or convert all the non-believers left behind after the rapture .
They also have the option of reversing roles and commanding the forces of the Antichrist .

Blumenthal also notes that the Operation Straight Up care packages for troops " include a copy of evangelical pastor Jonathan McDowell 's More Than A Carpenter -- a book advertised as " one of the most powerful evangelism tools worldwide " -- that is double - published in Arabic . "
So along with introducing troops to " kill or convert " theology , the Pentagon , via OSU , is encouraging troops to embrace imperial evangelism among Iraqis : gunpoint conversions , just like in the video game .
Hey , it worked for the Conquistadors ...
This is so obviously insane that words fail me .
Thanks for flagging Blumenthal 's story go to David Neiwert , who offers some additional and no less depressing context here .

Tucker : ' I do n't want to know ' what Americans believe about 9/11 Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne

This A 2006 poll about the causes the causes of 9/11 -- which indicated that more than a third of Americans suspect government involvement in the tragedies -- is too " frightening " for MSNBC 's Tucker Carlson to even think about .
Discussing the booting of a 9/11
Truth heckler from the audience of last week 's edition of Real Time with Bill Maher , Carlson brought up the year - old Scripps Howard / Ohio University survey to underscore how " almost unbelievable " it was that so many people bought into conspiracy theories .
When the Washington Post 's Eugene Robinson , a guest on the show , mentioned that he received frequent emails from individuals accusing the mainstream media of hiding the truth about Sept. 11 , Carlson interjected that another cover - up was underway .
" Here 's what we 're hiding , " he said .
" We 're hiding the fact that hundreds of thousands , many millions apparently , believe this . "
" I wish I had a factual explanation for this , because you know , on it's face , it 's absurd , " responded Robinson , who added that the numbers could be a " reflection of the unpopularity of President Bush . "
But Carlson demanded a better explanation for why such a large swath of the population was considering the possibility of federal involvement in a wider conspiracy .
" If you 're willing to even entertain the notion , " said Carlson , " I mean think about what that means :
You are willing to believe that the president or the Congress or somebody , them , the people in charge , would kill more than 3,000 people who did n't do anything wrong because it helped them pass the Patriot Act or invade Iraq . "
" That 's so evil , " he continued , " how could you still live in this country if you believe that ? "
Responding to a suggestion that cynical Americans were " ready to believe just about anything negative " about their government , Carlson proposed that those individuals might want to skip the country .
" If you have a population that stupid and reckless and they 're in charge of the government , maybe it is time to leave the country , " he said .
" I do n't even want to think it through it any more .
This is why we never do this topic on the show .
It just upsets me too much .
I do n't want to know these kind of facts about America . "

The Recording Industry v. The People blog reports that the University of Oregon has gone to court to fight a recording industry subpoena seeking the identities of 17 students .
Oregon is not the first university to resist a boilerplate subpoena that targets students for lawsuits for file - sharing , but they are among the few that have put up a fight in court .
In its brief , the university makes 5 arguments :
1 ) the university is already preserving information , so no need for ex parte subpoenas ;
2 ) the subpoena imposes an undue burden because the university cannot tell who the file - sharer was without additional investigation ;
3 ) the language of subpoena is overbroad ;
4 ) the FERPA bars disclosure of the identifying information ; and
5 ) Section 512(h ) of the DMCA provides the exclusive mechanism for ex parte subpoenas to ISPs in these circumstances .
The last argument , if accepted by the court , could radically change the nature of the RIAA 's 4 - year litigation campaign against music fans .
Currently , the recording industry 's strategy relies on pressuring universities into handing over student targets , either by having the university deliver " pre-litigation settlement letters " to students or , failing that , forcing universities to respond to subpoenas obtained after filing a " John Doe " lawsuit .
If these avenues are blocked , the recording industry would have to undertake its own investigatory efforts to determine who to sue .
Whether the university wins or loses its effort , it 's nice to see it standing up on behalf of its students , rather than simply giving in to recording industry demands .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq wants to tighten control over security contractors after a deadly shooting incident involving the U.S. firm Blackwater , ending their long immunity from Iraqi prosecution , the Interior Ministry said on Friday .
Blackwater guards were back on the streets of Baghdad on Friday after the U.S. Embassy eased a three - day ban on road travel by U.S. officials outside the capital ’s heavily fortified Green Zone .
Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul - Kareem Khalaf said the ministry had drafted legislation giving it wider powers over the contractors and calling for “ severe punishment for those who fail to adhere to the ... guidelines . ”
Iraq has said it would review the status of all security firms after what it called a flagrant assault by Blackwater contractors in which 11 people were killed while the firm was escorting a U.S. Embassy convoy through Baghdad on Sunday .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki suggested the U.S. Embassy should stop using Blackwater and said he would not allow Iraqis to be killed “ in cold blood . ”
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday she had called for a full review of State Department security policy in Iraq .
“ I take very seriously , and called up Prime Minister Maliki to regret , the loss of life , ” she told reporters in Washington .
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo said the decision to allow “ mission essential ” trips , some guarded by Blackwater , was taken after consultation with Iraqi authorities .
“ There is n’t a lot of movement in general ...
But it is likely Blackwater will support some of them , ” she said .
The shooting has incensed Iraqis who regard the tens of thousands of security contractors working in the country as private armies that act with impunity .
Khalaf said the new draft law , which he expected parliament to pass soon , gives the ministry powers to prosecute the companies and to refuse or revoke contracts .
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said he hoped Iraqi authorities would coordinate with the United States before passing legislation on security contractors .
“ They are free to pass whatever legislation they deem appropriate .
It ’s their country , ” Casey told reporters in Washington .
“ What I think we would hope , though , is that before anybody move forward on their own that what we could do is have a discussion about some of these issues ... that it be done in that kind of coordinated manner . ”
NEW RULES
Many security firms operating in Iraq have no valid license .
A law issued by U.S. administrators after the 2003 invasion which overthrew Saddam Hussein granted them immunity from prosecution and has not been formally revoked .
The New York Times reported on Friday that the Interior Ministry will also propose that foreign security companies be replaced by Iraqi firms .
“ These American companies were established in a time when there was no authority or constitution , ” the newspaper quoted a ministry report as saying .

The head of an association of security firms in Iraq said replacing foreign companies with Iraqi security companies was not a new suggestion and was unlikely to happen overnight .
“ One alternative would be partnerships with Iraqi companies , putting an Iraqi face on what we ’re doing , ” Lawrence Peter , director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq , told Reuters .
Peter said about 30,000 people , half of them Iraqis , worked for security firms in Iraq .
U.S. and Iraqi officials have launched a joint inquiry into Sunday ’s deadly shooting incident involving Blackwater , which employs around 1,000 contractors to protect the U.S. mission and its diplomats from attack .
In the latest violence , one U.S. soldier was killed on Thursday by a bomb near his vehicle in Diyala province , east of Baghdad , the military said .
The Romanian Defense Ministry said a Romanian soldier was killed and five others were severely wounded in an explosion on Friday during a patrol next to their base in Tallil in the south of the country .
In the southern city of Basra gunmen killed Sheikh Amjad al - Jinabi , a religious aide to Iraq ’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani on Thursday evening after he had attended a funeral in the Shi’ite city , Sistani ’s office said .
Another Sistani aide was killed in a drive - by shooting in Diwaniya , 180 km ( 110 miles ) south of Baghdad , police said .
Some Shi’ite mosques in Basra canceled Friday prayers in protest at the killings , residents said .
Schools have to spend huge sums on ICT
The government agency has complained to the Office of Fair Trading .
It says talks with Microsoft have not resolved " fundamental concerns " about academic licensing and about Office 2007 and the Vista operating system .
Microsoft says it wants as many people as possible to benefit from its technology at the best possible price .
Information and communication technology ( ICT ) is an essential subject in schools , which have to spend huge sums on installing , upgrading and maintaining equipment and software .
Becta is determined to get the best deal it can for schools
Becta statement
The outstanding issues centre on the limitations Microsoft places on schools using its subscription licensing arrangements , the agency says .
Becta 's advice to schools considering moving to Microsoft 's School Agreement subscription licensing model is that they should not do so .
It reminds schools they are legally obliged to have licensed software , but suggests they use instead what is known as " perpetual licensing " .
This gives the permanent right to use the software and requires no ongoing payments beyond the purchase price .
The advantage to schools in using a subscription service such as Microsoft 's is that smaller , annual payments are involved rather than a larger one - off cost .
But a spokesman for Becta said the problem was that Microsoft required schools to have licences for every PC in a school that might use its software , whether they were actually doing so or running something else .
' Impediments '
It hopes that by referring the case to the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) , " Microsoft will move promptly to address the issues raised " .
If schools have already signed up with Microsoft , Becta says " they should consider their renewal and their buyout options " alongside any findings the OFT may make .
And it advises them to deploy Office 2007 only " when its interoperability with alternative products is satisfactory " .
In a previous report , Becta said primary schools could typically save up to 50 % and secondary schools more than 20 % of their ICT costs if they switched to what is known as " open source " software .
In its complaint it also identifies potential difficulties for schools , pupils and parents who wish to use alternatives to Microsoft 's Office suite , such as Open Office or Star Office , because they may not be compatible .
" Becta is determined to get the best deal it can for schools and indeed for the wider educational system , and to make it as cost - effective and convenient as possible for educational customers to acquire the ICT products and services they choose , " the agency said in a statement .
" This demands an effective educational ICT marketplace and the avoidance of impediments to effective competition and choice . "
A Microsoft spokesperson said : " Becta has referred Microsoft to the Office of Fair Trading and at this early stage no indication has been given as to how this issue will progress .
" We want to reassure our customers , partners and the education sector that it is business as usual .
" This means we will continue working towards the same goal : enabling as many individuals and schools as possible to benefit from the transformative power of technology at the best possible price . "
最近みた TechTalks : Mondrian Code Review On The Web
Python の親玉である Guido Van Rossum が , Google での初仕事 ( ? ) として Mondorian というコード・レビュー用ウェブアプリを 作ったよ , という話 .
ミーハー的に視聴 .
前半はレビューとは何か , なぜそれが必要なのか , OSS でのレビューなどについて説明し , 後半から Mondrian 以前の Google 社内でのレビュー体制とその問題点を指摘 , Mondrian の話と続く .
Google では SCM に Perforce を使っており , レビューは patch + メールベース .
Mondrian 以前は Perforce の CL クライアントをラップする g4 というスクリプトを使ってレビューを支援していた .
これを使うと patch をメールでレビュアに飛ばしたりできる .
その飛ばしたメールを起点にレビュアとレビュイが議論し , " lgfm " ( looks good for me ) となったらチェックインする .
レビューのところだけ見ると , Google は大半の OSS と似たやりかたをしている .
つまり , チェックインの前にメールベースで patch をレビューする .
チェックイン前にレビューをするのは , Google の codebase が基本的に ブランチなしの trunk 一本だからだという .
trunk にはヘンなものを入れたくないわけ .
( trunk 一本が 良い方法なのかはわからないけれど ...)
OSS の方法と似ている以上 , OSS のプロジェクトと同じような問題がある .
まず , 他人の修正によって patch はすぐに陳腐化する .
だから review が終わった時点ではもう obsolete でした , というのはよくある .
それに patch 単体では見通しが悪いから , レビュイは実際にそれを apply してから眺めたい .
でも自分がいじってる作業コピーは変更したくない.
複数の patch をレビューする必要があるなら( 活発に作っていたら普通におこる状況 ) , それぞれの patch を適用するために作業コピーが手元に必要になる .
かなりかったるい .
メールも問題だ .
紛失することもあるし , 見落したまま放置してしまう可能性もある.
そもそも添付ファイルを保存して apply して ...という時点で面倒だろう .
( メールの他に sourceforge の patch manager の話も出てくるが , これも does not help だとしている . )
レビューは指摘と修正を反復する .
レビュアはその修正の遷移を見たいけれど , 手元にあるのは複数の diff だけだ. diff の diff , みたいのはない .
少しずつちがう( でも大半は同じ ) 変更を眺めているど , だんだんうんざりしてチェックがおざなりになる .
レビューの仕組みは開発者のルールとしてまわっているもので , それを強制する仕組みはない. だからうっかりレビューなしでチェックインしてしまっても , 誰もきづかないままかもしれない .
...というような問題を解決すべく作ったのが Mondrian である. というのが前半の話 .
( 上の説明は私の補足が色々入っており , Video とはやや内容が異なります . )
Mondrian
入社後 , さて何を作ろうか考えていたところに先人の提案を受け , Guido は
Web ベースのレビューツールを作ることにした. それが Mondrian . 実物は Video を見るのが手っ取り早い . デモがある .
基本的には patch manager と patch viewer と議論用 form のセット .
Trac や ViewSVN みたいな
Web ベースの SCM ビューアがあるけれど , ああいうかんじで patch の差分を表示できる .
また , 同じく Trac のバ グ( ticket ) のように patch を一覧する機能もある .
コメント相当の部分にレビューの議論を記録する.
議論のコメントはコードの特定の行にくっつけることができる. この " inline comment " が目玉機能らしい .
差分表示の画面からコード行をクリックして , 直接コメントを書き込める . ( このへん は Ajax なんだぜ , と自慢していた . ) たしかに欲しい .
g4 を使ったワークフローからのインクリメンタルな移行を支援するため , メールと web の相互乗り入れはけっこう頑張って作ったといっている .
たとえば( おそらくシステムへと CC される ) メールのヘッダをパースして , パッチやバグ( ? ) の ID があったらそれを Mondrian のコメントに反映する . 逆に Web のコメントからメールへのながれもある .
このへんは社内固有の話で面白い .
社内固有といえば , Google は開発者毎に " Dashboard " というポータルページがあるらしい .
Mondrian もその一部に組みこまれているかリンクしていた .
Mondrian の Dashboard には , " 自分がすべきレビュー " , " 自分が結果を待っているレビュー " の一覧が表示される .
時間に応じて色がきつくなるあたりがお茶目でいい.
Guido の Dashboard にも真っ赤な項目が 1 件あり , なにか言い訳していたのが面白かった .
( ところでこの " Dashboard " は , UI の世界だと割と知られた概念なんだろうか . 以前 Amazon を見ていたら " Infortion Dashboard Design " という本があり , これひとつで本になるのかといぶかしんだ記憶がある.
まあいいけど ...)
実装には , Perforce を叩くのに p4lib , ストレージには BigTable を使っているという .
よっ , でました BigTable !
ここでも履歴を保存できる機能が有効活用されているという.
Scalable でいいぜ , みたいな話をしていた .
そのほか , 何かの都合でユーザ毎にコードの snapshot をとることがあり , その時には NFS でユーザの workspace を直接見るのだろう .
つまり社員の Workspace は基本的に公開されているわけ .
すごい. 善し悪しはともかく , Google らしさのようなものはある .
今は多くの社員が Mondrian を使っているという . 全て Python で書いているけれど性能上の問題はあまりなく , 処理時間の大半は BigTable なり Perforce なりの外側のサービスだと言っていた .
おしまい .
スライドが丁寧なせいであんまし英語の勉強にはなっていない...
レビュー支援ツールあれこれ
さて , Web ベースのレビュー支援ツールには庶民の手に届くものもある .
( IEEE DL が読める人は 紹介記事 参照 . )
たとえば , BTS の古株 Bugzilla は patch ビューアを備えている ( マニュアル . 以前紹介した Cycle Collector のバ グ( Bug 333078 ) を 例にとると , ページの添付ファイル一覧には " Diff " というリンクがあり , ここから patch を diff 形式で表示できる .
Mozilla の開発ワークフローは Bugzilla に集約されている : 彼らはここに patch をアップロードし , レビューの議論を行う .
このように Mozilla コミュニティは Bugzilla をレビュー支援ツールとして使っている .
Guido のいう OSS 流より少しはましになっているがわかるだろう .
少くともメールを紛失することはない.
とはいえもともと Bugzilla の UI は若干 ugly な上 , patch ビューアの出来は寂しい .
改善の余地は大きそうだ .
こちらはよりレビューに特化している. patch ビューアだけでなく , インラインコメントもサポートしているらしい .
UI が地味なので , Trac くらい熟れた UI になれば流行りそうに見える .
ただレビューツールという立場上 , 既存 BTS との連携が弱そうなのは気になる .
路線としては Bugzilla のような BTS の追加機能として作る方が良いのかもしれない .
Eclipse の plugin として動く , らしい .
Web ベースではないな .
商用のツール .
まだベータみたいだけれど , Clover や FishEye を開発している Cenqua の製品なので気になっている .
( ブックマークしたのは昨 年 9 月だった. リリースはまだかなー . )
このように , 色々やろうとしている人はいる .
個人的には Trac に Dashboard と patch ビューア( ちゃんと文脈を参照できるやつ ) と
Ticket 連携つきインラインコメントが付けば決定打だと思う .
Guido を崇める Python ファンの若者が勢い余って作らないかと期待しているけれど , 甘いかしら .
レビューを afford するツール ( が欲しい )
もっとも現実には , こうしたツール支援以前に難しいのがレビューそのものの運用だろう.
Mondrian が強いのは , Google に存在し た( であろう ) solid な開発スタイルに フィットする形でアプリケーションを作った点にあると思う .
良い開発プロセスがなければ良いツールは生まれない.
逆に , よいレビューをしている人達が必要に応じて作ったツールを公開したら , そのツールによってレビューそのものが afford され , 草の根ソフトウェア開発の底上げがおこるかもしれない.
あるスーパーグダグダプロジェクトが , Trac を使いはじめてからいくらか改善されたのを見たことがある .
かくいう私もここ一年レビューをしていない . 確実にコードの質は落ちている. 悲しい. レビューしたい .
みんなレビューしましょう. ひまな人は " レビューで手を抜く " も 参照ください .
There is a term for this sort of political discourse : propaganda .
The word has a bad odor , but it is not necessarily a bad thing .
Propaganda is often true , and it can be deployed on behalf of a worthy cause ( say , the fight against Nazism in World War II ) .
Still , propaganda should not be confused with intellectual inquiry .
Propagandists do not follow their logic wherever it may lead them ; they are not interested in originality .
Propaganda is an attempt to marshal arguments in order to create a specific real - world result–to win a political war .

Protein folding is critical to most biological functions
Guinness World Records has recognised folding@home ( FAH ) as the world 's most powerful distributed computing network .
FAH has signed up nearly 700,000 PS3s to examine how the shape of proteins affect diseases such as Alzheimer's .
The network has more than one petaflop of computing power - the equivalent of 1,000 trillion calculations per second .
" To have folding@home recognized by Guinness World Records as the most powerful distributed computing network ever is a reflection of the extraordinary worldwide participation by gamers and consumers around the world and for that we are very grateful , " said Professor Vijay Pande of Stanford University and a leader of the FAH project .
Disease link
Distributed computing is a method for solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
CELL SPECS 256 billion calculations per second 2.5MB of on - chip memory Able to shuttle data to and from off - chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors
The Cell 's hard sell
The technique has been used by several groups to study everything from how malaria spreads to searching for new cancer drugs .
One of the most high profile projects is seti@home , which uses computer cycles to search through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
FAH uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
Proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer 's , Huntingdon's , BSE and many cancers .
Speed test
Until March this year , FAH only ran on PCs .
The program had around 200,000 computers participating in the program , the equivalent of about 250 teraflops ( trillion calculations per second ) .
The addition of 670,000 PS3s has taken the computing power of the network to more than one petaflop .
By comparison BlueGene L , which tops the list of most powerful supercomputers , has a top speed of just 280.6 teraflops .
The boost is in part because of the PS3's powerful processor , known as the " cell " , which runs up to 10 times faster than current PC chips .
" It is clear that none of this would be even remotely possible without the power of PS3 , it has increased our research capabilities by leaps and bounds , " said Prof Pande .

Indian NDTV is reporting Tuesday morning that Turkish Cobra helicopter gunships have fired into Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) positions inside northern Iraq .
The action comes after following on an engagement in the border region on the Turkish side that began on Monday and went late into the night .
AP does not mention the strikes inside Iraq , but NDTV apparently has a reporter in the area .
If the Indian account is true , it is a step up in the building Turkish - Kurdish confrontation .
Turkey is also squeezing Iraqi Kurdistan economically , putting embargoes on firms connected to Kurdistan leader Massoud Barzani .
In an interview this weekend , Barzani had threatened that any Turkish incursion would “ mean war . ”

ISTANBUL , Oct. 24 — Turkish warplanes and helicopters on Wednesday attacked the broad mountain passes that Kurdish separatist rebels use to travel from hide - outs in northern Iraq into Turkey , the state - run Anatolian News Agency reported .
The report did not disclose the number of aircraft involved or whether they had entered Iraqi airspace .
Some unconfirmed news reports said they had flown into Iraqi territory .
The use of warplanes followed days of Turkish shelling in response to a raid by Kurdish militants into Turkey that killed 12 Turkish soldiers on Sunday .
In Baghdad , the American second in command , Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , said he could not confirm that any warplanes from Turkey , a NATO ally , had flown into Iraqi airspace , which is under United States control .
BALTIMORE ( ESPN.com news services ) --
It was a comeback victory in every sense of the word .
The Cleveland Browns literally had to come back onto the field to complete a 33 - 30 overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday after it appeared the game ended with a missed field goal by Phil Dawson .
The Browns trailed 30 - 27 on the final play of regulation when Dawson attempted a tying 51 - yard kick .
The ball hit the left upright and seemingly bounced off the crossbar before bounding into the end zone .
The officials called the kick no good .
The Ravens ran off the field , celebrating a victory in which they scored 16 straight points in the fourth quarter , the last three on a 47 - yard field goal by Matt Stover with 26 seconds left .
Many of the Browns walked off in stunned silence after Dawson 's kick .
Several Cleveland players , however , insisted Dawson 's kick hit the curved center support behind the crossbar .
They gathered in the end zone , pointing at the spot where the football struck before bouncing back .
They were right .
After a lengthy discussion , the officials ruled the kick passed through the uprights and called the teams back onto the field .
Referee Pete Morelli had announced over the public address system that he would " take a look at this play " before he went to the review booth and manned the headphones to replay assistant Howard Slavin .
According to league spokesman Greg Aiello , Slavin told Morelli that he could n't show him the kick because field goals are not reviewable under the rules .
Morelli proceeded to further discuss the kick with his crew and Aiello said one of the back judges , Keith Ferguson , " felt more strongly " that the ball had crossed through the goal posts .
Morelli based his reversal on Ferguson 's opinion .
Referring to the initial call , Morelli said , " It was a ruling by one of the officials .
The other official informed me that the ball hit the back of the extension of the goal post .
...
We determined that was what it struck .
Therefore , it made the field goal good . "
From half a football field away , Dawson was n't positive his kick made it through .
" I could n't tell for sure .
I could tell by the way it glanced off the upright , it looked like it went forward , " he said .
" But we had people down near the goal post who were screaming at the top of their lungs that it had hit whatever that bar you call it . "
Baltimore coach Brian Billick and half the team were in the locker room when a team official told him the game was n't over .
Linebacker Ray Lewis , who returned an interception for a touchdown earlier , was peeling tape off his ankles when told he might have to return .
" It 's over .
We won , " he said .
But it was n't , and now the Ravens ' slim playoff hopes appear done .
Baltimore ( 4 - 6 ) has lost four straight , none more painful than this one .
" It 's crazy , it 's weird , " Ravens receiver Derrick Mason said .
" Just when you thought everything that had gone wrong you had overcome it , then there 's another thing .
They probably made the right call . "
The Browns ( 6 - 4 ) took the kickoff in overtime and drove 43 yards in nine plays before Dawson kicked a 33 - yard field goal with 9:10 left .
" This team , for whatever reason , thrives on adversity .
The tougher the situation , the better we do , " Dawson said .
" We all had a feeling when we got the call and went into overtime , what a shame it would have been to not capitalize on it . "
Cleveland forced four turnovers , had a season - high six sacks and earned its first season sweep of the Ravens since 2001 .
But it took one surreal scenario for it to happen .
" I was going out to meet Brian and go into the locker room and saw the referees huddling in the end zone , " Browns coach Romeo Crenell said .
" I 've never seen anything like this .
There 's a first time for everything .
It was crazy . "
After a team - record , 100 - yard interception return by Cleveland 's Brodney Pool put the Browns up 27 - 14 , Kyle Boller led the Ravens on a pair of drives that produced field goals to cut the gap to 27 - 20 with 7:20 left .
Boller then produced the tying touchdown operating in a no-huddle attack .
A 42 - yard pass to Devard Darling and an 11 - yarder to Willis McGahee preceded a 27 - yard TD pass to Darling in the left corner of the end zone with 3:31 to go .
After a Cleveland punt , Boller went 4 - for - 8 for 45 yards before Stover came in to kick what appeared to be the winner .
Starting in place of an injured and ineffective Steve McNair , Boller threw two interceptions and lost a fumble .
But he went 22 - for - 41 for 279 yards , eclipsing Vinny Testaverde as the Ravens ' career leader in passing yardage .
Former Ravens draft pick Derek Anderson went 24 - for - 38 for 274 yards and a touchdown .
Another former Raven , Jamal Lewis , ran for 92 yards and a touchdown .
Operating against the league 's 32nd - ranked defense , Boller led the Ravens on four scoring drives in the fourth quarter .
But Anderson got the ball last , and he burned his former team by getting Dawson in position for the tying and winning kicks .

Cleveland DB Eric
Wright ( knee ) left in the first quarter .

Chillis could be soon hot stuff in dental surgeries and operating theatres .
The compound which gives the peppers their zing has been used to make the ' holy grail ' of anaesthetics - a drug that wipes out pain without numbness and paralysis .
Such a painkiller could have a multitude of uses , from easing the trauma of childbirth , to making trips to the dentist more bearable .
It could even be used to calm the chronic itching of eczema and other skin conditions .
Scientists say the drug , which is a combination of the chilli chemical capsaicin and a compound related to the commonly - used anaesthetic lidocaine , is unique in its ability to dull pain without affecting movement or touch .
Traditional anaesthetics have a more wide - ranging effect , acting on cells involved in movement and touch as well as those that sense pain .
Dr Story Landis , of the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , which funded the study , said : ' The Holy Grail in pain science is to eliminate pathologic pain without impairing thinking , alertness , coordination or other vital functions of the nervous system .
' This shows that a specific combination of two molecules can block only pain - related neurons .
It holds the promise of major future breakthroughs for the millions of persons who suffer with disabling pain . '
Rats given an injection of the anaesthetic were able to tolerate more heat than usual , while moving around normally , the journal Nature reports .
Researcher Professor Clifford Woolf , of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in the US , said : ' We 're optimistic that this method will eventually be applied to humans and change our experience during procedures ranging from knee surgery to tooth extractions .
' Eventually this method could completely transform surgical and post - surgical analgesia , allowing patients to remain fully alert without experiencing pain or paralysis .
' In fact , the possibilities seem endless .
I could even imagine using this method to treat itch , as itch - sensitive neurons fall into the same group as pain - sensing ones . '
In time , it may be possible to package it in pill form , rather than giving it as an injection .
There are , however , several hurdles to be crossed before the technique can be tested on human patients .
Scientists will have to find a way of removing the temporary burning sensation associated with the use of capsaicin , as well as prolonging the pain - relieving effect of the drug .
This is not the first time that capsaicin has been shown to have promise in medicine .
The chemical , which is also found in pepper sprays used to control riots , has been shown to make cancer cells self - destruct .
Capsaicin helps prevent and heals stomach ulcers and has anti-inflammatory properties - something which could lead to new treatments for arthritis .
Chilli is also thought to speed up the metabolism , aiding weight loss , and ancient cultures used the spice as an antiseptic and to treat cholera and bronchitis .
Are you ready to join Osama Bin Laden and his band of world - wide terrorists ?
If death , destruction and mayhem are n't enough to convince you to reject Western style democracy and become a part of the global jihad , then Osama 's got another enticement :

That 's right , Osama promises that under Islamic rule , you 'd be free of the Tax Man forever .

Hey , with promises like that , he 's all set to run for the U.S. presidency .

FOR THE RECORD :
Nicholas lawsuit : An article Wednesday in Business about Broadcom co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III quoted attorney Joseph Kar as saying his client , Kenji Kato , was unfamiliar with allegations in court papers against Nicholas by contractor Roman James but knew of the court case because “ Nicholas had mentioned it infrequently . ”
Kar said Nicholas mentioned James infrequently , not the case .
But there was more , according to a claim made in court documents : plans for a “ secret and convenient lair ” with hidden entries for Nicholas to indulge his “ manic obsession with prostitutes ” and “ addiction to cocaine and Ecstasy . ”
The filing in Orange County Superior Court added that Nicholas had the interior built in warehouse space nearby , which became his “ personal brothel ” until his wife caught him having sex with a prostitute there .
The allegations by a construction team , denounced as fabrications by Nicholas ’ lawyer , echoed others in a recently surfaced lawsuit filed late last year by Kenji Kato , a Nicholas assistant from 1999 to 2006 .
In his suit , Kato claims that Nicholas and his companies owe him $ 150,000 in back wages .
Filings in the suit allege drug use and debauchery at a Newport Coast home owned by Nicholas , who denies the accusations .
Responding in a lawsuit pending in Orange County Superior Court , Nicholas has alleged that Kato is bound by confidentiality agreements that bar him from disclosing information about the billionaire and his businesses .
Kato ’s allegations are being examined by federal authorities probing Nicholas ’ role in the manipulation of stock options at Broadcom , according to people with knowledge of the investigation .
Through his attorney , Nicholas has denied any wrongdoing .
Nicholas , 47 , co-founded Broadcom in 1991 and served as its chief executive until 2003 .
Broadcom ’s success made him one of the nation ’s richest men , and he has given millions to schools , the Orange County Performing Arts Center and other causes .
The alleged plans for the covert underground hideaway , to be connected to Nicholas ’ Laguna Hills home , were detailed by Roman James of Newport Beach , the lead contractor on the project , and six other contractors , engineers and construction workers who worked on it and filed a lawsuit against Nicholas in 2002 .
The construction team accused Nicholas of failing to pay millions of dollars for work performed between April 1998 and April 2002 .
Nicholas was said to have used “ manipulation , lies , intimidation and even death threats ” to pressure “ nearly every contractor and vendor ” on the project to perform extra work without pay “ at warp speed . ”
The allegations were contained in a draft complaint that was prepared but not filed as part of the contractors ’ lawsuit , which was resolved in a confidential settlement in 2002 .
The draft complaint , however , was attached in 2005 as a supporting document to a lawsuit against the attorney for James , James R. Traut , by another man who sought a larger share of the 2002 settlement .
There was a 2006 judgment in that case , but the outcome was not clear in court documents and attorneys involved in that case could not be reached for comment .
Nicholas was not named in that case .
The Times obtained the draft complaint from the Orange County Superior Court file -- and blanket denials of its allegations from the Nicholas camp -- on Tuesday .
Nicholas attorney Steven A. Silverstein said Tuesday that “ all of the allegations are denied ” and charged that the similarity between the Roman and Kato cases was not coincidental .
“ Basically , where Kenji got his idea for his extortion came from Roman James , ” Silverstein said , contending that Kato was familiar with the previous case .
James could not be reached Tuesday .
His lawyer , Traut , did not return repeated messages left at his Santa Ana office .
In court filings in his lawsuit , Kato said Nicholas made him oversee supplies of cocaine and other drugs , pay prostitutes from a “ petty cash ” fund and conceal his boss ’ illicit activities .
Kato ’s lawyer , Joseph Kar , said his client knew of the James case only because “ Dr. Nicholas had mentioned it infrequently . ”
But Kar said he and his client “ have not seen that complaint ” and were unfamiliar with its allegations .
Any similarity in the lawsuits “ goes to corroborate the abuse and misbehaving of Mr. Nicholas ” detailed in Kato ’s court papers , Kar said .
Nicholas made no secret of the underground passageways and rooms under his Laguna Hills home , but the filing by James contended the subterranean complex was more elaborate than even Stacey Nicholas was aware of and ultimately cost $ 30 million over three years .
Nicholas took his wife to Hawaii for a week in August 2000 while work on his secret chamber was being completed , the filing claimed .
Stacey Nicholas has since filed for divorce .
“ Plaintiffs were promised payment and / or threatened with financial ruin -- whatever it took -- if they failed to complete the task within a week , ” the draft complaint said , and hundreds of workers began toiling 18 hours a day to excavate and pour concrete .
The noise and presence of armed guards hired to block access to community horse trails near the project prompted neighbors to complain to Laguna Hills authorities , who discovered the work was being performed without a permit and shut it down , “ although the room ceiling was covered over so it was not observable from above ground , ” the contractors said .
In a September 2000 Times story about the dispute , Nicholas said the newest underground structure was “ a pump house ” to handle water runoff from the horse trails .
The draft complaint disputed that account and claimed the new construction was tied to the alleged separate underground facility being built by Nicholas .
It said Nicholas , anticipating he would eventually obtain a permit from the city “ to complete his lair , ” implemented a backup plan , arranging “ to completely fabricate the interior ” of the hideaway at a Laguna Niguel warehouse .
The location , referred to as the Pond or the Ponderosa , “ was infamous for its excessive extravagance , its sex rooms and its million - dollar sound equipment , ” the document alleged .
Nicholas had his private jet pick up prostitutes in New Orleans , Chicago , Las Vegas and Los Angeles “ and bring them back to the Pond for his rock star friends , ” the draft complaint said .
“ He provided his guests with transportation and cocaine , Ecstasy , methamphetamines , marijuana , mushrooms , and nitrous oxide [ laughing gas ] ” -- and even arranged for his private helicopter to land at a nearby hospital helipad , it said .
The lawsuit alleged that Nicholas required pledges of loyalty and secrecy from the contractors and at one point threatened James ’ life .
Nicholas , in an interview with The Times last week about the Kato suit , said the allegations of drug use against him were especially absurd because he had been recognized by authorities for his efforts to boost law enforcement .

When it comes to picking a mate , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young had an answer : “ If you ca n’t be with the one you love , love the one you ’re with . ”
As it turns out , that may be a cardinal rule in the animal kingdom , too .
New research that crosses several species boundaries shows that when animals must choose less - than - preferred ( to them ) mates , females and males apparently have ways to compensate that increase the chance their offspring will survive .
The study , just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , adds weight to the Compensation Hypothesis , a proposal that has given insight into how individuals can pass on their genes even under less than ideal circumstances .
“ It ’s always better for offspring if parents can mate with preferred partners , but it ’s becoming clear that when parents can’t have that preferred partner , they have ways of making up for it , ” said Patricia Adair Gowaty , a Distinguished Research Professor of Ecology and Genetics at the University of Georgia and lead author of the study .
“ When female ‘ choosers ’ were in enforced pairs with males they did not prefer , they laid more eggs .
Similarly , when males are paired with females they do not prefer , they ejaculate more sperm .
This compensation seems to be a way of making the best of a bad job . ”
Co-authors of the paper were Wyatt Anderson , Alumni Foundation Distinguished Professor of Genetics , and Yong - Kyu Kim , an assistant research scientist in Anderson ’s lab , both at UGA ; Cynthia K. Bluhm of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station in Canada ; Lee C. Drickamer of Northern Arizona University ; and Allen J. Moore of Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom .
One of the new study ’s strongest arguments for the Compensation Hypothesis is that it includes experimental results in Tanzanian cockroaches , fruit flies , pipefish , wild mallards and feral house mice .
When each species faced experimental constraints on free expression of their mate preferences , individuals found ways around the predicament that could improve the chances that offspring could survive and perhaps even flourish .
“ Just how an individual finds its best mate is n’t really known , ” said Gowaty , “ though there ’s some evidence that he or she may be somehow sensing the advantage of the potential mate ’s immune system in relation to the chooser ’s own . ”
She points out that many factors are probably at work , including behavioral cues and what potential resources a mate may bring .
While the strategies for dealing with nonpreferred mates can help offspring , advantages for the mating pairs themselves are less clear .
In experimental situations , for example , females mated to non-preferred males did n’t live as long as females mated to their preferred choice .
One interesting aspect of the study is its implication that all individuals in a species have a flexible response to such problems as constraints on expression of their mating preferences .
If that ’s true , it hints that compensation may evolve — which could add an unexpected wrinkle to the story of natural selection .
“ How compensation evolves is crucial , ” Anderson said .
The issues at stake are , in fact , even broader .
“ The study also has implications for conservation because it suggests that the best way to keep species alive may be , if possible , to let individuals choose their own mates , ” said Gowaty .
The Compensation Hypothesis is Gowaty ’s work and was first published only four years ago , though she has been working on it for more than a decade .
Just how — and if — the hypothesis works in humans remains unknown , since studying the subject remains practically ( and ethically ) improbable .
Still , the idea remains a deep part of popular culture .
When Mick Jagger sings “ You ca n’t always get what you want , ” most of us nod .
And then we start to plot a way around the problem .

Too many beginning runners have but one speed : medium .
And as someone who ’s run a marathon , a few half marathons and a bunch of shorter races , I know that such a one - speed workout program can be not only boring , but it also does n’t maximize your workouts .
Throw some variety into your running program to make things interesting and become a better runner .
I ’m not saying you have to start a marathon training program , or some kind of sprint workout program .
But if the only speed you ’re running right now is medium , you should consider and at least try some other types of workouts .
Why ?
Just a few reasons :
They make things interesting .
Doing the same workout , day after day , is n’t a lot of fun .
Sure , I enjoy running as much as the next guy , but changing things up is good .
Too much repetition is hard on the mind .
It can make you faster and stronger .
Throwing a little speed into your workouts can make you a better runner .
If you have the same 5 K time every time , it may be that you need some faster workouts .
It can help you run longer .
If you ever want to do a longer race , such as a 20 K , half marathon or marathon , you need to switch from medium speed to slow … in order to work on your endurance .
Slowing your speed down ( lowering intensity ) allows you to run longer .
And if you slowly lengthen the distance of your longest run , you can slowly build up endurance .
Your body adapts .
After a month or so of doing one type of workout , you body will adapt and you ’ll no longer be getting the same kind of benefits from that workout .
You need to change things up every 3 - 4 weeks … and if you do , you ’ll most likely see continued improvements .
I should note that if you ’re just starting out as a runner , I would n’t do the harder workouts below for at least a couple months .
Your body is still adjusting to running … once it ’s done that , you can add a little variety .
I should also note , as always , that I ’m just an intermediate runner myself , and not a coach or trainer or doctor or anything .
Take my advice with a grain ( or bucketload ) of salt … I ’m only sharing things that have worked for me , and your mileage may vary .
So , let ’s take a look at just a few different types of workouts you can do to add spice to your running program and improve your performance :

Mr. Brokaw put in a bravura performance .
Rather than ask everyone the same question — which leaves each candidate answering like “ a trained seal , ” as Newt Gingrich aptly put it recently — Mr. Brokaw asked questions that were appropriate to the various candidates , so that the debate took on the aspect of an extended and well - informed conversation .
He questioned Democrats and Republicans separately , during four 30 - minute segments , but the format allowed candidates of one party to criticize those of the other party , which several did .
In the process viewers heard the talking points and propaganda of not just one party but of two , and the prospect that the other side would soon get its turn to speak may have deterred candidates from the kind of cheap shots which would evoke cheers from a one - party audience .
My impression , which was reinforced by reading the transcript this week , is that there were fewer of these than in the debates I ’ve watched this year .
And viewers got more of a preview of the arguments that would be made by either side once the nominees were determined , along with some basis to measure the candidates of one party against those of the other .
Why have n’t there been more such two - party debates during the primary season ?
In 1992 , 1996 and 2004 incumbent presidents were running for re-election , and presumably they would have rejected invitations to debate a bevy of candidates , some of them arguably unserious , from the opposition party .
In 2000 , there were only two serious candidates for the Democratic nomination , Al Gore and Bill Bradley , who would have been heavily outnumbered by Republicans on a two - party stage .
But this year there are roughly equal numbers of candidates in both parties .
A two - party debate at this point might be cumbersome : eight Democrats and nine Republicans have been participating in one - party debates , and even in a two - hour confrontation ( about as long as viewers can be expected to watch these days ) each of 17 candidates would get to speak for only five or six minutes .
That ’s a problem that could perhaps be surmounted by holding two debates , one on foreign policy and one on domestic issues .
A better opportunity may come when the early caucuses and primaries winnow the fields substantially and indicate clearly which candidates have only negligible support .
The January primary and caucus calendar — not yet entirely set in stone — will be crowded , but there may be room for a two - party debate before the parties ’ nominations are determined .
The id ( ) function does n’t have an inverse1 .
Now it does .
>>> k = object ( ) >>> print k < object object at 0x9a3b8 > >>> id(k ) 631736 >>> from di import di >>> j = di( 631736 ) >>> j < object object at 0x9a3b8 > >>> id(j ) 631736
Stupid simple module available in my SVN repository .
1 For good reason .
An object ’s id ( ) is just its address in memory .
This hack is effectively exposing a pointer — a fragile , prone to disappear out from under you , nasty , C-ism — into Python .
It is like running on marbles with scissors .
No stability and potential for loss of precious runtime fluids .
In a debugging context , though , being able to turn an id ( ) back into an object reference allows interrogation of objects where identification of “ objects of interest ” and the actual interrogation of said objects does not have to happen within a contiguous set of expressions .
Chris says :
I wish people would n’t post stuff like this .
There is never any case where this is a useful operation – the only time it works is when the object you want to retrieve is still around anyway – and there ’s never any reason to store the id of an object instead of the object reference ( or a weakref ) instead .
People asking how to do this is n’t uncommon , and being able to google for it will just lead people to doing it instead of being told that they need to fix the problem that leads to them wanting to do it instead .
“ Never any case ” ?
That is a bit unimaginative and could even be construed as arrogant .
The only safe “ never ” is in the statement “ never assume you know everything ” .
Sure — if you pass a random number or the id of a no longer existing object to di ( ) , your process is going to crash .
Totally true and I have added some emphasis on exactly why this feature is not a part of python , nor should it be .
As for this tool and the dangers therein :
So what ?
Do n’t do that .
Tools can be misused .
If something hurts , do n’t do it .
This tool has saved me hours and hours of engineering time , several hundred lines of fairly complex code , and having to make some fairly nasty & intrusive changes to several relatively complex client / server focused codebases .
More subtly , it allowed me to vastly reduce memory leaks without having to instrument the code in ways that would have very likely changed the lifespan of objects .
Lame .
Python ’s weakrefs do n’t support weak references to Dictionaries , Lists , Tuples , Strings , or None .
Four out of five of these types are very often exactly the kind of thing I need to figure out why there are tons of ’em floating around that should n’t be .

An accidental discovery could pave the way to one day coaxing stem cells to develop into human eyes in the lab
A team of scientists at the University of Warwick in England studying the development of motility in frogs found that a certain ectoenzyme ( a cell - surface protein ) injected into a tadpole embryo triggered the development of tissues that eventually form eyes .
Further experimentation led the researchers to conclude that the surface protein is , in fact , an early player in the cellular cascade that leads to eye formation .
Researchers say the finding could be harnessed in the future to make an " eye in a dish , " a tool that would be invaluable in coaxing stem cells to develop into ocular tissues .
" Our study provides clear discovery of upstream signals controlling a previously known pathway controlling eye development and therefore provides a step closer to being able to manipulate eye development , " explains Elizabeth A. Jones , a professor in the university 's biological sciences department and a co-author of the study published in Nature .
Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 ( E - NTPDase2 ) is an ectoenzyme that , along with family members E - NTPDase1 and E - NTPDase3 , is known to degrade the chemical compound ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) into ADP ( adenosine diphosphate ) for the purpose of sending messages to cells to change the fleet of proteins they are producing .
Primarily , ATP functions as the energy currency of cells but , in some varieties , a tiny amount is secreted into the space between cells , where it latches onto a neighbor to induce particular responses and modulations .
Both ATP and ADP , known as purines , can transmit signals to cells that change their developmental activity .
The research team found that when it increased levels of E - NTPDase2 in tadpole embryos that consisted of only eight cells , they could cause parts of the eye to form not only on the heads of the amphibians , but also in tissues in other parts of their bodies , including their tails .
Minute pulses of ATP are released into extracellular areas mostly by cells in the head where the eyes are supposed to develop .
Jones notes that at temporally distinct moments , other cells in the body may expel small packets of ATP , which in the presence of E - NTPDase2 can cause eye tissue to form .
Through many rounds of analysis , both by amplifying and decreasing the levels of certain chemicals as well as knocking out the function of certain genes that code for proteins that regulate eye development ( called eye field transcription factors ) , the scientists determined that E - NTPDase2 ( although not E - NTPDase 1 or 3 ) was the only ectoenzyme that could drive eye development .
Further , they determined that it must act early in the pathway that leads to the formation of the eye .
After it converts ATP to ADP , the level of the latter accumulates outside the cell and the purine can bind to a purine receptor called P2Y1 .
" It is the activation of this receptor that either directly or indirectly turns on the expression of the eye - field transcription factors , " Jones says .
" We don ?t quite know the mechanisms involved between going from the receptor and turning on the genes , and this is an area for future investigation . "
Jones and her colleagues believe that most of the eye development pathway is conserved between frogs and humans .
Damage to human chromosome 9 ( of the cell 's 24 pairs ) where the gene that codes for E - NTPDase2 resides is known to cause eye and brain defects , such as microphthalmia — literally , small eyes .
This means that down the road , researchers might be able to create an " eye in a dish . "
" This work may have interesting implications for the stem cell field , " says Richard Lang , a professor of developmental biology at the Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Research Foundation .
" The activity of purine signaling in inducing eye field precursors , " he says , " might be a very useful tool for the culture dish–generation of progenitor cells for a variety of eye cell types . "

How About Credit Card Savings Plans for Small Web Businesses ?
What about the little guys on the web ?
Why ca n’t we get savings on services we actually use ?
Credit Card Savings Plans
I ’ve mentioned before I ’m using my business credit card to build a credit history even though it does n’t offer cash back rewards .
I was hopeful when I heard my bank was offering the MasterCard BusinessCard with a rewards program but was disappointed to discover the plan was only the MasterCard Easy Savings , saving 10 – 20 % at select merchants , not the cash back rewards I was looking for .
I checked out the participating companies and was frustrated to see I did n’t do business with any of them .
The merchants fell into the following categories :
Airlines
Hotels
Car Rentals
Business Services
Print & Shipping
No Savings for Me
One of the nice things about a home web - based business is that you do n’t have to fly all over the country to meet clients , work with partners , and make deals .
That knocks out any business credit card savings from airlines , hotels , car rentals .
The business services consist of things like staffing , payroll , and human resource software , again things my one - person Web business does not need .
I do quite a bit of shipping for my eBay business but it is all through UPS or the Postal Service , not the express shipping vendor the savings program uses .
Web Businesses Savings Plan
I propose a financial institution come up with a credit card savings plan for small Web businesses that includes services we actually use .
They could offer discounts with domain registration and Web hosting companies or I would love to save even a few percent on payment processing .
How about partnering with a company like Elance so we could get rebates on a wide variety of services such as web design , application development , copywriting , search engine optimization , and more ?
I suppose if there was money to be made banks would have already pursued something along these lines and I am sure there are logistical issues .
However , as the number of netrepreneurs continues to grow maybe there would be a market for small web business credit card savings plans .
Not to be greedy but of course I ’d want it to be a cash back card as well . 🙂
Overall , US officials reported that the number of foreign fighters entering Iraq this year dropped from 80 - 110 a month in the first half of the year to around 40 in October , partly due to the Sinjar raid .
After the raid the number of suicide bombings in Iraq fell to 16 in October - half the number seen during the summer months and down from a peak of 59 in March .
US military officials believe that 90 % of such bombings are by foreigners .
The captured data has been described as an intelligence treasure trove that included biographical details and the hometowns of the more than 700 fighters who entered Iraq since August 2006 .
Of those 307 , or 41 % , were Saudis and 137 , or 18 % , Libyans , senior US military sources told the New York Times .
Saudi Arabia , former home of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers , has cracked down hard on al - Qaida in recent years .
Saudi intelligence works closely with its US counterparts , but there have long been suspicions that the country 's most dangerous jihadis have gone to Iraq .
" The border with Iraq is much more carefully controlled than it was 18 months ago , " said one British official .
The Saudis also run extensive programmes " re-educating " and rehabilitating fighters who have returned from Iraq or Afghanistan to see " the error of their ways " .
The US , Britain and others have praised the Saudis for their efforts , pointing especially to a recent appeal by the kingdom 's grand mufti , Sheikh Abdulaziz al - Asheik , who condemned " mischievous parties " who send young Saudis abroad to carry out " heinous acts which have no association with Islam whatsoever " .
The presence of a large number of Libyans among the insurgents in Iraq suggests that the regime of Muammar Gadafy has pushed its violent Islamist enemies abroad , having cleaned up its own act by renouncing support for terrorism and surrendering its chemical and nuclear arsenal after the US invasion of Iraq .
The documents , found in September , showed that the third - largest source of foreign fighters was Yemen , with 68 , followed by Algeria , 64 , Morocco , 50 , Tunisia , 38 , Jordan , 14 , Turkey , six , and Egypt , two .
These figures seem to corroborate suggestions of a worrying increase in jihadi activity across north Africa , where armed groups from Libya , Algeria , Tunisia and Morocco have united under the banner of al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb .
In the good old days when building web sites was as easy as knocking up a few HTML pages , the delivery of a web page to a browser was a simple matter of having the web server fetch a file .
A site ’s visitors would see its small , text - only pages almost immediately , unless they were using particularly slow modems .
Once the page was downloaded , the browser would cache it somewhere on the local computer so that , should the page be requested again , after performing a quick check with the server to ensure the page had n’t been updated , the browser could display the locally cached version .
Pages were served as quickly and efficiently as possible , and everyone was happy .
Then dynamic web pages came along and spoiled the party by introducing two problems :
When a request for a dynamic web page is received by the server , some intermediate processing must be completed , such as the execution of scripts by the PHP engine .
This processing introduces a delay before the web server begins to deliver the output to the browser .
This may not be a significant delay where simple PHP scripts are concerned , but for a more complex application , the PHP engine may have a lot of work to do before the page is finally ready for delivery .
This extra work results in a noticeable time lag between the user ’s requests and the actual display of pages in the browser .
A typical web server , such as Apache , uses the time of file modification to inform a web browser of a requested page ’s age , allowing the browser to take appropriate caching action .
With dynamic web pages , the actual PHP script may change only occasionally ; meanwhile , the content it displays , which is often fetched from a database , will change frequently .
The web server has no way of discerning updates to the database , so it does n’t send a last modified date .
If the client ( that is , the user ’s browser ) has no indication of how long the data will remain valid , it will take a guess .
This is problematic if the browser decides to use a locally cached version of the page which is now out of date , or if the browser decides to request from the server a fresh copy of the page , which actually has no new content , making the request redundant .
The web server will always respond with a freshly constructed version of the page , regardless of whether or not the data in the database has actually changed .
To avoid the possibility of a web site visitor viewing out - of - date content , most web developers use a meta tag or HTTP headers to tell the browser never to use a cached version of the page .
However , this negates the web browser ’s natural ability to cache web pages , and entails some serious disadvantages .
For example , the content delivered by a dynamic page may only change once a day , so there ’s certainly a benefit to be gained by having the browser cache a page–even if only for 24 hours .
If you ’re working with a small PHP application , it ’s usually possible to live with both issues .
But as your site increases in complexity–and attracts more traffic –you ’ll begin to run into performance problems .
Both these issues can be solved , however : the first with server - side caching ; the second , by taking control of client - side caching from within your application .
The exact approach you use to solve these problems will depend on your application , but in this chapter , we ’ll consider both PHP and a number of class libraries from PEAR as possible panaceas for your web page woes .
Note that in this chapter ’s discussions of caching , we ’ll look at only those solutions that can be implemented in PHP .
For a more general introduction , the definitive discussion of web caching is represented by Mark Nottingham ’s tutorial .
Furthermore , the solutions in this chapter should not be confused with some of the script caching solutions that work on the basis of optimizing and caching compiled PHP scripts , such as Zend Accelerator and ionCube PHP Accelerator .
This chapter is excerpted from The PHP Anthology : 101 Essential Tips , Tricks & Hacks , 2nd Edition .
How do I prevent web browsers from caching a page ?
If timely information is crucial to your web site and you wish to prevent out - of - date content from ever being visible , you need to understand how to prevent web browsers–and proxy servers–from caching pages in the first place .
Solutions
There are two possible approaches we could take to solving this problem : using HTML meta tags , and using HTTP headers .
Using HTML Meta Tags
The most basic approach to the prevention of page caching is one that utilizes HTML meta tags :
< meta http-equiv= " expires " content = " Mon , 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT " />
< meta http -equiv= " pragma " content = " no - cache " />
The insertion of a date that ’s already passed into the Expires meta tag tells the browser that the cached copy of the page is always out of date .
Upon encountering this tag , the browser usually wo n’t cache the page .
Although the Pragma : no - cache meta tag is n’t guaranteed , it ’s a fairly well - supported convention that most web browsers follow .
However , the two issues associated with this approach , which we ’ll discuss below , may prompt you to look at the alternative solution .
Using HTTP Headers
A better approach is to use the HTTP protocol itself , with the help of PHP ’s header function , to produce the equivalent of the two HTML meta tags above :
<? php
header ( ' Expires : Mon , 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT ' ) ;
header ( ' Pragma : no-cache ' ) ;
?>
We can go one step further than this , using the Cache - Control header that ’s supported by HTTP 1.1 - capable browsers :
<? php
header ( ' Expires : Mon , 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT ' ) ;
header ( ' Cache - Control : no - store , no - cache , must - revalidate ' ) ;
header ( ' Cache - Control : post - check=0 , pre-check=0 ' , FALSE ) ;
header ( ' Pragma : no-cache ' ) ;
?>
For a precise description of HTTP 1.1 Cache - Control headers , have a look at the W3C’s HTTP 1.1 RFC .
Another great source of information about HTTP headers , which can be applied readily to PHP , is mod_perl ’s documentation on issuing correct headers .
Discussion
Using the Expires meta tag sounds like a good approach , but two problems are associated with it :
The browser first has to download the page in order to read the meta tags .
If a tag was n’t present when the page was first requested by a browser , the browser will remain blissfully ignorant and keep its cached copy of the original .
Proxy servers that cache web pages , such as those common to ISPs , generally wo n’t read the HTML documents themselves .
A web browser might know that it should n’t cache the page , but the proxy server between the browser and the web server probably does n’ t–it will continue to deliver the same out - of - date page to the client .
On the other hand , using the HTTP protocol to prevent page caching essentially guarantees that no web browser or intervening proxy server will cache the page , so visitors will always receive the latest content .
In fact , the first header should accomplish this on its own ; this is the best way to ensure a page is not cached .
The Cache - Control and Pragma headers are added for some degree of insurance .
Although they do n’t work on all browsers or proxies , the Cache - Control and Pragma headers will catch some cases in which the Expires header does n’t work as intended –if the client computer ’s date is set incorrectly , for example .
Of course , to disallow caching entirely introduces the problems we discussed at the start of this chapter : it negates the web browser ’s natural ability to cache pages , and can create unnecessary overhead , as new versions of pages are always requested , even though those pages may not have been updated since the browser ’s last request .
We ’ll look at the solution to these issues in just a moment .
How do I control client - side caching ?
We addressed the task of disabling client - side caching in “ How do I prevent web browsers from caching a page ? ” , but disabling the cache is rarely the only ( or best ) option .
Here we ’ll look at a mechanism that allows us to take advantage of client - side caches in a way that can be controlled from within a PHP script .
Apache Required !
This approach will only work if you ’re running PHP as an Apache web server module , because it requires use of the function getallheaders –which only works with Apache–to fetch the HTTP headers sent by a web browser .
Solutions
In controlling client - side caching you have two alternatives .
You can set a date on which the page will expire , or respond to the browser ’s request headers .
Let ’s see how each of these tactics is executed .
Setting a Page Expiry Header
The header that ’s easiest to implement is the Expires header–we use it to set a date on which the page will expire , and until that time , web browsers are allowed to use a cached version of the page .
Here ’s an example of this header at work :
expires.php ( excerpt )
<? php function setExpires ( $ expires ) { header ( ' Expires : '. gmdate ( ' D , d M Y H:i:s ' , time ( ) + $ expires ) .
' GMT ' ) ; } setExpires ( 10 ) ; echo ( ' This page will self destruct in 10 seconds < br />' ) ; echo ( ' The GMT is now '.gmdate ( ' H:i:s ' ) . '< br />' ) ; echo ( ' < a href= " '.$ _SERVER [ ' PHP_SELF ' ] . ' " >
View Again</a>< br />' ) ; ?>
In this example , we created a custom function called setExpires that sets the HTTP Expires header to a point in the future , defined in seconds .
The output of the above example shows the current time in GMT , and provides a link that allows us to view the page again .
If we follow this link , we ’ll notice the time updates only once every ten seconds .
If you like , you can also experiment by using your browser ’s Refresh button to tell the browser to refresh the cache , and watching what happens to the displayed date .

One of our readers , Frank Beacham , wrote in this morning after experiencing the iPhone launch first - hand in lines at both AT&T and the Apple .
We thought his piece was well - written and quite telling about the difference in customer service between the two companies , so we posted it after the jump .
Last night , at the last minute , I succumbed to iPhone lust as I passed a line in front of an AT&T store on Broadway in the Upper West Side of Manhattan .
The line was less than a hundred , and it seemed for a while that the wait might not be too long .
Wrong !
The employees at the AT&T store at 2195 Broadway were in no hurry .
In fact , a woman employee at the door seemed annoyed by all the people in line and would offer no information about wait times or availability of the iPhones .
But one thing she did make certain , this AT&T location was closing at 11 p.m. , line or no line .
There were no promises to service those who had been waiting for hours .
A friendly restaurant next door handed free samples of a mango drink and even offered take - out food , but not one AT&T employee ever came outside to interact with waiting customers or to explain the situation .
At about 9 p.m. a customer who finally got in the store spilled the beans that all the 8 GB models were sold out .
AT&T remained silent .
At this point , several of us hopped cabs to head to the nearby Apple
store on 5th Ave .
There , we saw the other side of this take of two American companies .
Even though the line was longer than that at AT&T , the wait was short — less than 15 minutes .
Friendly Apple employees stood by with wireless credit card terminals taking orders .
The process took only
minutes .
Leaving the store , a cheering row of Apple workers high - fived new iPhone owners .
Day one revealed what all Apple aficionados fear .
That AT&T , through the depths of its incompetence , could derail the iPhone .
Kucinich :
Is it time to question Bush 's mental health ?
Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich , a dark horse contender for the the Democratic presidential nomination , questioned President Bush 's mental health on Tuesday , according to a Philadelphia newspaper .
" I seriously believe we have to start asking questions about his mental health , " Kucinich told The Inquirer 's editorial board .
" There 's something wrong .
He does not seem to understand his words have real impact . "
Kucinich was referring to President Bush 's warning of dire consequences if Iran acquires nuclear weapons during a press conference earlier this month .
Bush said that he had told world leaders the country must be prevented from achieving nuclear capability " if you 're interested in avoiding World War III . "
" We 've got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel , " Bush said , responding to Russia 's stated cautioning against military action targeting Tehran 's suspected atomic program .
" So I 've told people that , if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " said Bush .
In a press release sent to RAW STORY last week , Kucinich took Bush and other Administration officials to task for trying " to deceive Americans into yet another war this time with Iran . "
" After the lies and deception used to lead us to war in Iraq , the belligerent Bush Administration cannot be given leeway with statements that suggest a preemptive attack on Iran is necessary , " Kucinich stated .
" We are systematically destroying every available route to restoring peace and security in the Middle East .
Congress must take back its exclusive authority to declare war from the Bush Administration . "
Further excerpts from Inquirer article : # Kucinich , who thinks Bush and Vice President Cheney should be impeached and charged with war crimes , is running sixth in most national polls .
He said he does n't believe his comments about the president 's mental health are irresponsible .
" You can not be a president of the United States who 's wanton in his expression of violence , " Kucinich said .
" There 's a lot of people who need care .
He might be one of them .
If there is n't something wrong with him , then there 's something wrong with us .
This , to me , is a very serious question . " #

Via Neurophilosophy and Mind Hacks , news of new progress toward a blood test that may someday be used to diagnose Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) and mild cognitive decline .
The study is published in the most recent issue of Nature Medicine :
A molecular test for Alzheimer ’s disease could lead to better treatment and therapies .
We found 18 signaling proteins in blood plasma that can be used to classify blinded samples from Alzheimer ’s and control subjects with close to 90 % accuracy and to identify patients who had mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer ’s disease 2 – 6 years later .
Biological analysis of the 18 proteins points to systemic dysregulation of hematopoiesis , immune responses , apoptosis and neuronal support in presymptomatic Alzheimer ’s disease .
This test measures levels of proteins in blood plasma , and could certainly be used alongside nucleic - acid based tests such as this assay of white blood cell mRNA expression proposed last year .
As I pointed out at that time , it ’s likely that such tests could be made even more accurate if every patient had individual baseline measurements taken in earlier life , before any hint of dementia had emerged ; this would allow physicians to distinguish between patients who had always been at one end of the population distribution and those who had recently undergone changes in biomarker levels .
the slippery moral slope that slides both ways
The video in M. Simon 's post about medical marijuana served as a reminder that logic is wasted on moral issues .
That 's because moral issues supersede logic , and replace it with determinations based on right and wrong , good versus evil .
The problem is that a substantial number of powerful and influential people believe very strongly that marijuana is an inherent moral evil .
Arguments over the relative harm , its potential value to patients , or the logical absurdities of classifying it as a Schedule I drug along with heroin are not relevant to the moral question , because its immorality is seen as outweighing logical arguments .
It 's the same thing as arguments over animal issues .
Jessica Valenti discovered that there were people who considered her simple act of buying a dog to be a profound moral evil .
No arguments she or her supporters might make could possibly sway people who think that way -- any more than I could convince anti-gay activists that consenting adult homosexuals do no intrinsic harm to society .
Because the intrinsic harm is seen as being the immoral activity itself , arguments that the activity is not harmful go in circles .
If something is seen as harmful because it is immoral , there 's no way to argue that it is n't harmful -- not , at least , with the people who think it 's immoral .
Thus , the theory of the immorality of marijuana is not really based on any good faith belief that it " leads to harder drugs , " or that it's " addictive " or " causes brain damage . "
These arguments are used as utilitarian window dressing .
But to those who believe marijuana is immoral , the reasons are superfluous , and it is a waste of time trying to convince them .
They see marijuana as an evil because it damages the morality of society .
Period .
Legalizing it in any way is seen as countenancing decadence of the sort which leads to the fall of great empires .
Thus , pot remains classified with heroin .
But what most people do n't realize is that to a true - believing anti-marijuana moralist , marijuana is even more evil than heroin .
At least heroin is seen as containing its own punishment .
Addiction , malnutrition , wasting away , and loss of interest in most things .
Everyone knows what happens if you get strung out .
Marijuana use , OTOH , is not self punishing .
Users run around having fun , being creative , and unless they get totally stoned , they can function quite well in a number of occupations .
Thus , if it becomes legal , people might think it 's OK .
Which would mean it might cease to be seen as immoral .
As to the basis for this immorality argument , it is n't in the Bible .
It 's just manufactured morality dating from the 1930s .
But they did a damned good job of manufacturing it and scaring the hell out of an entire generation .
Many people ( especially the kids who grew into the World War II and produced all those post - war babies ) went along with it .
It has real staying power .
I worry that the same thing is happening with global warming alarmism , and the idea that guns , dog breeding and cigarette smoking are immoral .
Once successive numbers of people are conditioned into accepting a new moral view , it tends to stay .
As activists get louder , people become more and more afraid to say what they think .
The fewer people there are who speak up , the more the activists think they are winning , and the more the silent people are changed .
Initially , the first to fall silent are the ones who do n't want to make trouble by disagreeing .
The silence spreads to include people who fear social ostracism or disapproval if they speak up , because the people who have been bullied into silence by activists have a strange way of demanding that others be bullied as they were too , and the more of them that feel this way , the more the work of the activists is done by people who are n't really activists , but just go along with it .
It 's a bit like doing anything you do n't like .
" Fairness theory " sets in .
If you follow rules even though you do n't like them , pretty soon you 'll come to resent those who do n't , and eventually you 'll join in the bashing of the remaining few non-conformists .
That is how new morality comes to be created .
The reason I like to talk about mandatory spaying and neutering of animals ( see this post , this post , this post , this post , this post , this post , this post , this post , and this post ) as an example is not just because it 's highly personal and I dislike the government getting into these things , but because I have watched attitudes change dramatically in a single lifetime , without people really thinking things through .
So many people have been bullied into cutting their dogs nuts off that if you have an intact dog , they 'll now come up to you and scold you .
I say this because it has happened to me , and I understand the control mechanism .
But if I said , " you 're just resentful of me because I did n't follow recently manufactured morality , " they 'd become indignant .
Perhaps even morally indignant .
( But how is it moral to want a total stranger to cut off his dog 's nuts because someone made you think it was the cool thing to do lest you be considered responsible for " dog overpopulation " ? )
The problem is that morality does not stop with the adoption of new attitudes and new social conventions .
People who have been bullied into obeying the new conventions are easily persuaded to support changes in the law .
" We the responsible citizens are tired of doing our share while others do n't .
This law is needed ! "
Today 's moral suggestion is tomorrow 's moral imperative , and the next day 's law .
Ironically , thanks to the trendiness factor I have tried to explain , the moral tide may be shifting against the old meme that marijuana is evil .
Now , it 's become trendy to advance an argument along the lines of " people have a right to smoke pot ! "
Those who believe in the old " marijuana is immoral ! " line will be increasingly afraid to voice their views in the workplace and the country club .
Eventually , this may lead to the ridiculous laws being scrapped .
I think that scrapping the laws and reverting to the pre-1930s morality would in the case of marijuana be a good thing .
I do n't smoke pot , though , and I do n't say this in order to be cool .
But what about the people who do think things ( er , claim to think things ) in order to be cool ?
I have to say , they worry me .
Even when they 're right .
Citigroup announced last night that it was selling a $ 7.5 billion stake to a Middle Eastern sovereign fund in the latest bid to shore up its balance sheet .
The fund , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , has agreed to buy a 4.9 percent equity stake in a complex transaction that has been approved by federal regulators .
It will have no role in the management or governance of Citigroup , nor any presence on Citigroup ’s board .
Abu Dhabi ’s 4.9 percent stake will make it Citigroup ’s single largest shareholder , overtaking Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia .
He has owned close to a 5 percent stake since the early 1990s , when he made a similar investment to bail out the company .
Together , their holdings will mean that nearly 10 percent of the Citigroup will be owned by Middle Eastern investors .
“ This investment reflects our confidence in Citi ’s potential to build shareholder value , ” said A.D.I.A. ’s managing director , Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed al - Nahyan .
So 451 Press , the self - proclaimed largest blog network , has put up its new payment model , and I ca n’t say that I am impressed with it .
I tried to comment yesterday on their recent post , but my comment is still being held for moderation .
Not only does the post lack information , but when I add up the numbers , compared to the work that you would have to put in , it looks like writers would receive less than minimum wage .
This of course is once the whole system is broken down to dollars per hour .
Here is their new payment model :
0 – 2 Month Bloggers
$ 0.50 Per Post & $ 1.50 CPM 3 – 5 Month Bloggers
$ 1.00 Per Post & $ 1.50 CPM 6 – 11 Month Bloggers
$ 1.50 Per Post & $ 1.50 CPM 12 – 17 Month Bloggers
$ 2.00 Per Post & $ 1.50 CPM
Raises , Good , Lack of Detail , Bad
The first thing I noticed was missing was an explanation of the time element .
If I have blogged for two years with another network , and then came over to 451 Press , would I start at the 0 - 2 month mark , or at the 12 - 17 month mark ?
There is a huge difference in the payment amount , and so this should be described better .
Smart CPM Idea , But Bad Deal
Today , I also talked about what CPM is and how it relates to advertising .
451 Press is using CPM as part of their payment model , which will reward writers for traffic .
This is pretty much the only part of their deal that makes sense to me .
If 451 Press makes $ 3 CPM from an advertising position , then they are paying one half of their advertising revenue to their writers .
This is great if the blog is getting hundreds of thousands of visitors each day .
The biggest issue I have with this is that I know 451 Press is making more than $ 3 CPM as they are probably making that from each advertising position , so really the writer is getting one half of the revenue from one advertisement .
This is not a good deal for the writer .
The rate should be $ 1.50 CPM per advertisement on the site rather than $ 1.50 CPM for the site .
Calculating It All Out
So , let ’s say 451 Press puts me at their highest rate of $ 2 per post and $ 1.50 CPM .
I work really hard and produce 40 posts over the course of a month .
That instantly earns me $ 80 for my efforts .
The site gets 20,000 page views , which earns me another $ 30 .
So for a month of work , I have earned $ 110 .
Sounds pretty good for blogging right ?
What if I told you that it took me on average an hour to research , write and promote every two posts ?
I know that is pushing it to the long side of things , but there are very few blogs that easily get 20,000 page views in the first few months , so we have to suspend our disbelief a bit , and this is just to experiment .
So it took me nearly 20 hours to write my 40 posts during the month .
With a pay check of $ 110 from my work , that means I made $ 5.50 an hour from my work .
While that is n’t lower than the minimum wage in some states , it is much lower than the minimum wage here in Ontario , Canada .
Remember , this is the higher end of the spectrum for 451 Press , and newer bloggers will get paid far less for their efforts .
Does this seem fair ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bankruptcy courts would be allowed to alter mortgages written by “ predatory lenders ” in moves that could save 600,000 Americans from foreclosure , according to the author of a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday .
A foreclosed house for sale is pictured in the Green Valley Ranch development in Denver , Colorado July 26 , 2007 .
Bankruptcy courts would be allowed to alter mortgages written by " predatory lenders " in moves that could save 600,000 Americans from foreclosure , according to the author of a bill introduced in the U.S. Representatives on Friday .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
The legislation would repeal a provision that prohibits a bankruptcy court from modifying a home ’s first mortgage , according to Representative Brad Miller , a North Carolina Democrat , who sponsored the bill along with Democrat Linda Sanchez of California .
The bill is co-sponsored by Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
Delinquencies and foreclosures have soared as the U.S. housing market soured in the past two years , putting the spotlight on ways to modify loans that are resetting to higher interest rates .
Some 5 million adjustable - rate mortgages are slated to reset over the next 18 months , and loan modifications are still “ few and far between , ” Miller said in an interview .
“ Everyone will know what will happen in bankruptcy , so the fact that bankruptcy is an option would lead to negotations ” between the borrower and lender ahead of that event , he said .
Countrywide Financial Corp , which as the nation ’s No.1 mortgage lender has provided one in five home loans this year , on Monday said it has provided assistance on some 35,000 mortgages this year , including modifying terms on 17,000 loans .
But a report by Moody ’s Investors Service last week found that lenders eased borrowing terms on just 1 percent of subprime mortgages with interest rates that reset in January , April and July .
Under loan modifications , the lender and loan - servicing company change the mortgage terms to make them more affordable to the borrower .
This can include lower interest rates and forgiving a portion of the principal .
Wall Street and bond rating companies have criticized loan modifications since investors who bought the riskiest portion of the bonds may be treated more favorably than owners of safer slices once a loan is modified .
Most mortgages also end up as mortgage - backed securities whose covenants sometimes disallow changes to the underlying collateral .
Despite hurdles , modifications are seen as still the best alternative for the $ 7.2 trillion mortgage bond market , which is credited for both raising money for the U.S. real estate boom and the excesses that brought housing to its knees last year , according to the American Securitization Forum , a lobbying group .
Foreclosure is more costly for lenders and investors , it argued .
The bill is also co-sponsored by Democrats Carolyn Maloney of New York and Mel Watt of North Carolina .
“ Responsible lenders who made loans on reasonable terms have nothing to worry about in bankruptcy court , ” Miller said in a statement .
“ Predatory lenders ” may be saddled with the loans , he said .
One of the downsides of being known for writing a book about my sex life is that people tend to make certain assumptions .
Many conclude that I must be up for hopping into bed with any bloke who offers himself as a sexual candidate .
The other frequent assumption is that , because I have written an honest account about being a single woman happy to have casual sex , I must be making some kind of lifestyle choice .
" Do n't you ever want to settle down ? " people ask me incredulously , shocked that a woman might be content with just , well , shagging .
I do n't believe this assumption is held just because I 've documented my sexual escapades in print .
I think the fact that I am an openly happy sexually active single woman in her early 30s somehow challenges the widely - held convention that all women my age are only having sex in the pursuit of love ; that we must want to settle down with every man that we meet ; and that if we are still single , we must have failed in some way .
Almost every women 's magazine regurgitates this perspective , filling pages of content about losing weight , applying make - up , the latest sexy fashions , all suggesting that women should focus on how they look ( rather than , say , their work ) because that way they will be more attractive to men and more likely to get a boyfriend ; and surely it should all be about obtaining a man - and keeping him ?
Like many other women , I reject this philosophy .
One of the reasons I wrote about my sex life was to try to challenge this viewpoint and be able to say : I do n't need validation about my attractiveness from a man to feel good about myself ; I do n't need a partner to be happy ; and I can enjoy sex purely for pleasure .
I do n't think any of this is particularly revolutionary - and there are many more important battles for women to fight - but it still bears repeating .
Women are still surrounded by a 1950s - style old - fashioned and sexist ideology which is that to succeed at and be happy in life , we need to be in a long - term relationship with a man ( omitting the existence of lesbian relationships , of course ) .
Women like sex , just as men do .
Not all of us expect , or want , to be given cuddles or kittens every time we shag someone .
There does not have to be romance involved with sexual pleasure : some of us just like orgasms for the hell of it .
And some of us enjoy having sex with someone who is not a long - term partner .
God forbid you 're a woman who might enjoy shagging a bloke for just one night , because then not only are you seen as a failure in life , but you 're labelled a slag too .
It is 2007 - we do n't seem to have made much feminist progress , do we ?
There is still a huge double - standard when it comes to sex and gender .
Men are still slapped on the back for their achievements , rewarded for their accomplishments and applauded for their sexual dalliances .
Women , however , are forced to live out their lives with frustrating and oppressive restrictions , where they are still chastised if they do not pursue marriage , children and monogamy as their main life objective .
It still shocks me that the term " career woman " exists , with no counterpart for men ; being ambitious with one 's work or not pursuing romance still has a stigma attached if you are female .
I 'm not advocating casual sex as some kind of equivalent life - vocation , though ; it 's fun and serves an enjoyable purpose and that 's great .
I 'm just trying to say that to pursue it does not mean a woman has failed in some way or that she 's made some lifestyle choice ; it means she has an active healthy sexual appetite , which is no bad thing .
I do n't wish to suggest that my own personal enjoyment and pursuit of casual sex means I have no wish for a partner at all ; I enjoy the companionship of a man and think a partner would be a nice addition to my life , should I meet that someone special .
But I refuse to subscribe to the notion that as a woman I cannot be happy without a man by my side ; I believe it 's important that as women we challenge this limited and sexist notion .
Women should be able to enjoy their lives , their careers , their friends and their relationships without being derogatorily labelled .
And if this means a few shags and plentiful orgasms along the way , then surely that 's just a decent and enjoyable bonus ?

This is just too funny for words : NASA Global Warming Data had “ Y2 K Bug ”
I say again , the concept of current anthropogenic climate change ; except in the case of localized micro-climates ; holds no scientific water .
Honest scientists will tell you the same thing if pressed ( and if their funding does n’t depend on it ) , but the agenda politics of todays science ( admittedly on both sides of the political spectrum , but generally on different subjects ) , prevents real , honest , science from occurring anymore ; or from being reported if and when it is ( the record of suppressing global warming debunkers is long and shameless at this point )
The honest numbers are simple .
Global temperatures have risen an average of less than 1 degree centigrade since measurements started being taken .
There is no “ sudden and precipitous increase ” .
There is no hockey stick ; it was a lie , and even the climate change people have admitted it .
The ice caps are n’t melting , in fact in most areas they are thickening slightly .
The sea level is n’t rising .
Since temperature recordings have begun , volcanic eruptions have put more carbon into the atmosphere , and caused more temperature change than all of human industry ; but it was n’t by increasing temperatures with carbon , it was by decreasing them with dust in the air .
The world has been far colder than today at times when there was far more carbon in the atmosphere ; even without more dust .
The world has been far warmer than today with far less carbon in the air .
The amount of anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere is less than one half of one percent of all carbon ( the vast majority is released by soil , and rotting vegetation ) ; and considering how small a percentage of our atmosphere carbon and carbon compounds ( between 0.03 and 0.06 percent .
Not between 3 % and 6 % , 3 one hundredths of a percent ) ; that amount is completely insignificant to climate change .
All existing climate change can be fully and scientifically explained by natural endothermic cycles , and the fluctuation in output of the sun ( because earth is an exothermic system ) .
The suns output has varied greatly over the course of human history ( and of course long before ) , and periods of warming and cooling have tracked right along with that output .
The climate IS changing , and has since the moment the earth formed a climate .
As near as we can tell ( through Ice core samples and the like ) there has never been a period of more than 200 years without at least a 1 degree change in global average temperatures .
The climate will continue to change on its own ; and nothing humans do will change global climate significantly one way or the other … unless it ’s something that actually would kill us all ( incredibly massive particulate pollution over a high percentage of the earths surface – including the oceans – would do it .
It would trigger massive warming , followed rapidly by an ice age ; and likely kill all crops and food animals in the process , along with at least 80 % of humanity , if not more ) .
That is n’t to say we should n’t attempt to develop better sources of energy , we should .
We are n’t going to “ run out ” of oil , ever in fact ; a basic understanding of economics would show that ; but , oil is going to get more and more expensive as time goes on , and petroleum based fuels are inefficient , and do contribute to micro climate pollution .
In many ways , doing things greener IS in fact better .
Saving energy is generally a very good thing .
Not polluting is generally a good thing .
When it is n’t , is when it destroys economies , prevents job growth , reduces food production , increases food prices , and all the other ways that forced greenism ( I wo n’t even call it environmentalism , because it is n’t doing the environment much good ) , causes pain , suffering , misery , and general reductions in peoples health , quality of life , standard of living , and basic liberties .
“ Climate change ” is n’t about the environment ; it ’s about giving financial and political control to anti-western , anti-capitalists .
It ’s about punishing those rich capitalist nations and people , for not being poor socialists .
It is n’t science , it ’s a pseudo - scientific political movement and near religion .
The adherents do n’t need any proof , because they have faith ; and any who challenge that faith must be burned as heretics in their new inquisition .
A physicist and his biologist son destroyed a common virus using a superfast pulsing laser , without harming healthy cells .
The discovery could lead to new treatments for viruses like HIV that have no cure .
" We have demonstrated a technique of using a laser to excite vibrations on the shield of a virus and damage it , so that it's no longer functional , " said Kong - Thon Tsen , a professor of physics at Arizona State University .
" We 're testing it on HIV and hepatitis right now . "
Tsen and his son Shaw - Wei Tsen , a pathology student at Johns Hopkins University , came up with the idea while strolling in the park and discussing the need for antiviral treatments that go beyond vaccinations .
Tsen senior has long experimented with ultrashort - pulse lasers ( USPs ) , devices increasingly used outside of physics .
Raydiance , a USP laser manufacturer , signed a deal with the FDA in July to explore laser therapies .
As Wired News reported earlier this year , an FDA official estimated there could be a hundred medical uses for USP lasers , from common laser eye treatments to cell - by - cell tumor ablation .
In the latest research , Tsen and his son demonstrated that their laser technique could shatter the protein shell , or capsid , of the tobacco mosaic virus , leaving behind only a harmless mucus - like mash of molecules .
The laser shattered the capsid at low energy : 40 times lower , in fact , than the energy level that harmed human T - cells .
Other types of radiation , like ultraviolet light , kill microbes on produce , but would damage human cells .
The virus - deactivating laser works on a principle called forced resonance .
The scientists tune the laser to the same frequency the virus vibrates on .
Then they crank up the volume .
Like a high - pitched sound shattering glass , the laser vibrates the virus until it breaks .
The USP laser releases energy in femtosecond pulses – one millionth of a nanosecond – at a time .
" The extreme brevity of these pulses is creating a physical effect that traditional lasers and other types of non-laser approaches can't do , " said Scott Davison , president of the venture - backed USP laser company , Raydiance .
" What we see is a new wave of exploration and discovery in applying USP in a whole bunch of industries and applications . "
Unlike lasers used to burn through flesh in surgery , USP lasers do n't generate a lot of heat .
Tsen says the technology could provide immediate benefits for clearing viruses in blood stored in blood banks .
Some viruses , like HIV , have a window during which they are very difficult to detect .
" This technique will be very useful to disinfect all the viruses , known or unknown , " Tsen said .
" This will make blood transfusion very safe . "
The Tsens ' technology has seen success only in test tubes .
It must be tested in animals and then humans .
Treatments are still far in the future .
But with more strolls in the park , anything seems possible .
Conventional wisdom suggests that the primary reason why so many people do not accept Darwin 's theory of evolution is that they find it threatening to their religious beliefs .
There is no question that religion is a big part of the reason behind the large number of people who reject evolution .
But I am convinced that just as often , the cause and effect is reversed : people hold onto their fundamentalist religious beliefs because evolution by natural selection -- the strongest argument against an Old Testament - type creator -- is so counter - intuitive to so many .
I arrive at this conclusion in a somewhat roundabout way .
I have long been fascinated with systems that tap into the " wisdom of crowds " -- systems that , in fact , have much in common with Darwinian evolution .
Such systems doubtfully conflict with anyone 's religion , and yet , I see the same sort of resistance to them as I see to evolution .
The arguments against them are remarkably similar .
This hypothesis , if borne out , suggests that advocates of reason -- moderates , atheists , and the science minded -- might consider a different tack if they wish to convince more people to reconsider their fundamentalist , anti-scientific beliefs .
It may be easier to first go after this non-intuitiveness , starting with these places where the conceptual difficulty is not exacerbated by the conflict with their comforting and culturally embedded religious belief .
Below I cover three separate systems , each of which has strong similarity to Darwinian evolution , each of which seems to elicit a " but it just can't work " response , and none of which conflict with any religion I know of .
They are :
1. Wikipedia :
Most people who actually use the Wikipedia online encyclopedia on a regular basis recognize that it is an amazing resource , and is getting significantly better as time goes on .
However , I have spent a lot of time debating with intelligent people who simply reject that Wikipedia can be accurate or reliable , given that it can be edited by anyone .
Of course , it is true that Wikipedia has been vandalized often , that many of the entries contain poorly written sections , and that some of the facts presented are dubious .
I do n't suggest anyone use it to verify that the mushroom they found in their backyard is safe to eat .
Nevertheless , the science journal Nature published a study in 2005 concluding that Wikipedia fares quite well when compared to Encyclopedia Britannica in terms of accuracy .
A study by IBM [ pdf ] in 2004 found that vandalism is usually repaired extremely quickly - so quickly that most users will never see its effects .
Meanwhile , Wikipedia has 10 times the amount of content as Britannica , is growing much more rapidly , and , most importantly , is being refined and improved every minute of every day .
( not to mention , it is available online for free ! )
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales described the online encyclopedia as being " like a sausage : you might like the taste of it , but you do n't necessarily want to see how it 's made . "
In a Nature magazine blog accompanying the study mentioned above , Timo Hannay said that " frankly , I still can't get over the fact that it works at all . "
Indeed , the problem most people have with Wikipedia 's quality and accuracy seems to have more to do with their knowledge of how it is made , rather than any observed problem with the end results .
There is no question that there is something unsettling about the idea of a resource that can be edited by anonymous internet users .
We would expect that many , if not most , of the edits will be of poor quality .
The natural assumption might be that the quality of the end result will be the average quality of all the edits -- but nothing could be further from the truth .
Comparing it to evolution , an edit of Wikipedia might be considered equivalent to a genetic mutation .
A mutation , of course , is non-directed ... that is , " random . "
It could be bad or good , but most of the time it is bad .
If we were simply the average of all mutations that predated us , we would be nothing more than a pile of goo .
And yet we are not .
The reason that Wikipedia is as good as it is ( and the reason that living organisms are as sophisticated as they are ) , is not due to the average quality of the edits ( or mutations ) .
Instead , it is due to a much harder to observe process : selection .
Some edits survive , while others quickly die .
While one can look at the history of a Wikipedia article and see each and every edit , it is much harder to tell how many potential editors looked at an article , subconsciously thought " I doubt I could improve this much , " and chose not to try .
Each of these can be considered a " selection event " , and the number of such events vastly outnumbers the actual edits .
Selection is the heart of what makes Wikipedia -- as well as Darwinian evolution -- work .
As much as evolution impresses us with its ability to turn countless random mutations into sophistication , it is n't without its downsides .
Every time we see a person or animal that suffers from a severe birth defect we see the cruelty of the process , but we also recognize that such a mutation will probably not survive more than a generation or two due to the power of selection .
Likewise , when we see glitches in Wikipedia ( whether due to vandalism , someone pushing an agenda , or just bad writing ) , we are seeing the " random " part of the process in action .
Again , we generally see that selection kicks in rapidly , and the glitches disappear .
This difficulty in seeing and understanding the power of selection is why , in spite of the evidence to the contrary , people will claim that Wikipedia must be a poor quality source of information .
Luckily , though , the end results are there for everyone to see , and most people judging it on end results alone seem to agree that it is an excellent source of information .
And unlike living things , no one can easily doubt that Wikipedia is indeed created in the way that we are told it is .
2. Prediction Markets :
One of the purest examples of " wisdom of crowds " is prediction markets , where speculators can bet on the chances of future news events , such as the outcomes of sports events or political elections .
For instance , at intrade.com , I can see that ( on the day I clipped the data at right : October 11 2007 ) the market thinks that Hillary Clinton has about a 46 % chance of being elected president , while Rudy Giuliani has 15 % and Mitt Romney has less than 9 % .
This is n't the percentage of people who are expected to vote for each candidate ( as polls try to predict ) , but the actual percentage chance of winning -- a very different thing .
In fact , today it gives Al Gore around 10 % chance , and he is n't even running .
The market is not just guessing how people will vote and how those votes will break down by state , but it is factoring in the probability of Gore winning a Nobel Peace Prize tomorrow , and if he will in turn decide to throw his hat into the ring .
In effect , it tries to take into account everything that may factor in -- things that polls alone can't reach .

The way this works is actually rather simple .
For instance , if I think Clinton has a greater than 46 % chance of winning , I can buy a " contract " on her for $ 46 .
It will pay $ 100 if she wins , $ 0 if she loses .
Or , I can turn around and sell the contract in a week or two , hopefully for a few dollars more than I paid ( if her market price has gone up ) .
Alternatively , I could bet against her for $ 54 .
Like any market , the price of each item adjusts according to supply and demand .
It should not be surprising to hear that a great many people , when told of how prediction markets work , will claim that they can never produce meaningful results .
After all , the market price , and therefore the prediction , comes solely from random people on the internet who decide to take a wild guess at who is likely to win .
Sure , they are putting their hard earned cash on the line , but that does n't mean they are experts .
Certainly the opinion of an expert -- who has studied all the polls , and understands statistics and the math of the electoral college -- would produce a much more accurate prediction than just the average of the opinions of lots of John Q. Public's .
And yet , that is n't the case .
Prediction markets turn out to be remarkably accurate , typically more accurate than any individual expert can predict , as non-intuitive as it may seem .
Like Wikipedia , prediction markets also tap into the power of selection , but the most dramatic similarity they share with evolution is their equilibrium seeking behavior .
Imagine that lots of random people come in and make bad guesses at who will win the election .
The price of the contracts will then vary significantly from what the best expert would predict , resulting in an unstable ( i.e. non-equilibrium ) situation .
Now all it takes to make some easy money is to consult with such an expert and buy the contracts whose prices are the furthest from the experts ' estimates .
If it is indeed this easy to make money , the market will attract lots of people , including institutional investors who have the ability to invest enough to quickly move the price back to where the experts predict .
Meanwhile , those experts who consistently predict badly will tend to eventually pick another line of work which they are better at , while those who are best at picking will make lots of money doing so , and will therefore tend to be there with cash in hand whenever the prices stray far from their predictions .
Each expert tends to gravitate toward the specific things that they might have special expertise ( or inside information ! ) on and therefore has the best chance of out - predicting the other experts .
Over time , it becomes harder and harder to consistently outguess the market , no matter how good you are .
As much as this may make logical sense , this sort of equilibrium - seeking process is exceptionally difficult to directly observe .
All we can look at is the individual transactions , but we can't see all the people who might have been attracted to a particular contract had they thought that it would be relatively easy to make money .
And we can't directly see the statistical pressures that are constantly keeping the prices at a stable equilibrium .
Evolution , of course , has similar equilibrium - seeking behavior .
Imagine an animal that , were its earlobes shaped slightly differently , would be ever so slightly better able to hear the sounds made by potential prey .
No matter how long you watch such animals , you would be hard pressed to find an actual situation where that subtle change would mean the difference between life and death .
But as long as there is a statistical difference , a suboptimal earlobe is an unstable situation , waiting to be corrected .
And , typically it will be , in surprisingly short order .
The cumulative effect , of course , is what we see around us in nature : an absolutely breathtaking degree of adaptation in planet Earth 's life forms .
Such equilibrium - seeking behavior , whether in markets or in evolution , seems to defy intuition .
The problem is that when you look closely , at the level that human observation works the best , all that is visible is a whole lot of slop .
It is only when you step back far enough to see things from a statistical point of view does the true precision of the process come into view .
Clearly , this is very , very hard for many -- if not most -- people to do .
3. Recommendation systems :
Like many online vendors , movie rental service Netflix has a recommendation system : it allows users to rate movies they have watched , and , based on these ratings and the ratings of others , offers recommendations of movies the user has yet to view .
This is a form of machine - learning known as collaborative filtering .
Last year , Netflix launched a contest , where they offered a million dollars to someone who could write software that does the job better than Netflix 's own " world - class movie recommendation system . "
Specifically , the winner has to beat Netflix by 10 percent .
I tried my hand at the contest , and quickly beat Netflix by around 3 % ( putting myself at 8th place a few weeks into the contest ) , but eventually gave up as I was competing against a lot of seriously smart people who had done their PhD 's on this very type of problem , while I was basically winging it .
A year later , contestants are getting rather close to the million dollar prize , with about 8.5 percent improvement .
The contest made available the ratings of half a million real Netflix users , for 18,000 movies .
The total number of ratings in the set is about 100 million ... quite a large amount of data .
Contestants are asked to predict an additional one million ratings , unknown to anyone but Netflix , given a user id and movie id for each one .
Contestants are scored based on how far their ratings differ from the actual ratings .
While the contest attracted a lot of smart people with deep knowledge of machine learning , it attracted all types .
In the forums on their web site , the discussion seemed to all be about one thing : how do we get additional data about the movies ?
( examples here , here , and here )
Contestants wanted to be able to download and use information such as the director , the actors , the year made , whether it won any awards , how it did in the box office , etc .
But mostly , they wanted to know the genre : whether it was science fiction , horror , romantic comedy , drama , documentary , etc .
After all , if we are trying to predict which movies a particular user will like and which they wo n't , the genre is absolutely critical .
Since the dataset did contain the movie title , it was possible to get this data from elsewhere ( say , IMDB.com ) , but not without considerable expenditure .
What interested me , though , was how steadfast these people were in declaring that the this information was so critical to being able to make sense of all the data and do reasonable predictions .
I debated with a few of them , and found it impossible to convince them that such data was completely unnecessary , and that the purely numerical data supplied in the original dataset was quite enough to very accurately categorize movies , detect the tastes of users , and predict their ratings on the additional set of movies .
While the algorithm I came up with was unable to win the contest ( well , given the time I had available to put into it ) , it certainly worked well .
And unlike any other algorithm I have seen for collaborative filtering , mine is one that is easy to explain to people who do n't have advanced math degrees .
The idea is that I needed to put each movie , and each user , into a " neighborhood , " which roughly equates to " genre . "
There is a science fiction neighborhood , a comedy neighborhood , a horror neighborhood , and so on .
But the neighborhoods have blurry boundaries , just as real neighborhoods typically do .
" Alien " would be somewhere between the science fiction and horror neighborhoods , while " The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " would be somewhere between the science fiction and comedy neighborhoods .
Each user would live in a neighborhood , closest to the type of movies they prefer , and furthest from those they dislike .
To do this , my program starts by giving each user , and each movie , a random position in space .
That is , each gets a value for X , Y and Z representing its position .
For each of the 100 million ratings , the program simply adjusts the distances between each item : if a user likes a movie , it moves the user and movie closer to each other by a tiny amount .
If the user dislikes a movie , it moves the user and movie further away from one another .
The program iterates over and over , until the positions stabilize : that is , an equilibrium is reached .
This takes quite a few hours , but once it has done it , small changes ( such as modifying the data , or modifying a parameter within the program ) take very few iterations to re-stabilize the model .
If a movie is near a user -- in the same neighborhood , so to speak -- it can be predicted that that user will probably like that movie , even if the user did not specifically rate it .
Movies that are universally liked tended to move toward the center of the model ( " Shawshank Redemption " being closest to center ) , disliked movies moved toward the outside .
In practice , I found that giving 12 or so dimensions , rather than just 3 , worked a lot better , allowing a much richer categorization , and allowing each neighborhood to be adjacent to a great many other neighborhoods .
There are several other layers of complexity in order to get the best results , but the gist of the approach is just as simple as described .
What was striking to me was that this system , iterating over a massive amount of sloppy , low precision data , could organize the model with such stunning precision .
I could type in the names of two movies , and ask " how similar " they are , and the results were almost always exactly what I would expect .
I could type the name of a movie , and get a list , in order , of the top 20 movies that are seen as most similar .
And it did quite a good job at the assigned task , predicting how users would rate movies .
Those who claimed the process could n't work , after seeing the results , were shocked .
The point , of course , is that this system is very evolution - like , in that lots of messy data , with very little apparent " intelligence , " processed by a simple iterative algorithm , can find sophisticated equilibria with a great deal of precision .
Looking directly at the raw data , such as at an individual user 's set of ratings , would indicate a lot more slop than is apparent in the final model .
The system does n't " know " that a movie is a science fiction movie , any more than natural selection " knows " why a particular mutation in the DNA increases the chance of an animal surviving to adulthood .
Nonetheless , it works , against all intuition .
Nonetheless , despite new evidence in the form of higher than expected demand , capacity squeezes and price rises , there remains a view amongst some geologists and economists that the peak is many years away and even that technology , new energy sources , and new efficiencies will make it irrelevant .
Although I believe such views are driven by wishful thinking , I do not want to digress on this subject here .
Instead I want to address energy supplies after peak ; the size of the so - called supply gap and how it might - or might not - be filled by alternative transport fuels and by efficiencies .
I have been writing on oil supply issues since 1995 , in particular the imminent supply gap and the looming new energy era ; forecasting a peak in global supply arriving between 2010 and 2020 depending on demand growth .
The Energyfiles report “ Oil & Gas – Global Ten - Year Projection ” ( now in its 2007 edition ) was published in response to queries about the data used to arrive at these conclusions .
The supply gap depends on demand as well as supply .
In the past demand has been erratic but yearly demand growth of 1.8 % , based on what has happened over the last 25 years , seems to ensure economic stability .
This business - as - usual ( BAU ) growth is depicted , along with a detailed field - based production forecast of ‘ usual ’ oil , in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 . Forecast of conventional oil production plus NGLs ( click to enlarge ) .
A small supply surplus up to 2013 is followed by a deficit to the end of the period plotted .
The surplus will partly be compensated by shut - in capacity , especially heavier oil in Saudi Arabia , and partly by surges in demand ( mostly in Asia ) as prices briefly fall .
Filling the gap with alternative liquid fuels
The deficit in 2020 will match all of the current production from the Middle East but a model is needed for oils that do not fall into the ‘ usual ’ category .
‘ Time Magazine ’ has said that Canada ’s Athabasca oil sand Belt “ … could satisfy the world ’s demand for petroleum for the next century ” .
The oil sands may be huge ( or they may be a huge environmental problem ) , but they will not go close to filling the gap on their own , even if problems of energy return on investment ( EROI ) and the need for gas and water supplies to effectively develop them are overcome .
Venezuela ’s La Faja extra - heavy oil region has also been called a “ saviour ” ; however it will hardly impact on global supply after peak .
There are other such areas .
The World Energy Council has documented 54 geological basins that contain oil sands .
But , considering the time it has taken to develop Canada ’s and Venezuela ’s resources substantial short term output from these is unlikely .
Oil shales have been exploited for hundreds of years but rarely commercially due to their poor EROI .
Large operations in China and Estonia shrunk in competition with cheaper fuels but perhaps new technology and higher prices will turn this around .
In fact ‘ Rocky Mountain News ’ portrayed Shell ’s in situ method of conversion and extraction as “ … simplicity itself in concept but exquisitely ingenious in execution ” .
Exquisite it may be but the time needed to develop significant volumes of oil from shales must be measured in decades .
Gas - to - liquids ( GTL ) has been “ ready to arrive ” for at least a decade and it will still be ready to arrive a decade from now .
In a market where stranded gas is in demand for LNG , GTL can rarely compete .
Conversely coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) technology has massive potential .
Up to now CTL has only been used in non-commercial operations , notably in Hitler ’s Germany and apartheid South Africa .
China , with its huge coal resources , is trying to kick - start a new CTL industry and substantial growth is forecast .
But again the amount of growth possible within the next two decades , will hardly impact the gap .
Figure 2 . Forecast of all liquids production ( click to enlarge ) .
Finally there are the biofuels .
Growth of these is coming from a low level and biodesel and bioethanol , whose energy density is less than 70 % of crude oil , eat into valuable agricultural land .
Even with massive investment they will be incapable of filling the gap .
Conversely cellulosic ethanol ( BTL ) is the holy grail of the biofuels industry ; but , still in the pilot plant stage , real year - on - year growth is not likely for at least 20 years .
The gap has thus been pushed to 2015 as shown in Figure 2 , with the deficit in 2020 , assuming BAU demand , still equalling current production from Saudi Arabia and the USA combined .
What ’s more , with surpluses to 2014 the drive to save oil will remain with the environmentalists , whilst surplus oil , should OPEC allow it on the market , will be rapidly mopped up by the growing Chinese and Indian economies .
There may be room for additional growth in some liquids sources should massive investment programs be instigated before the peak and I have not incorporated significant hydrogen fuels made from gas , nuclear power or renewables .
Furthermore the analysis contradicts recent projections by Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) who foresee ‘ usual ’ oil growth until 2030 but fail to explain realistically where the oil will come from .
Nonetheless mine is a realistic model for a real world which moves at a rapid pace in a free market .
Closing the gap with efficiencies
Once high prices recur there will be every incentive to develop efficiencies , some of which may be realised without pain - unlike conservation , which will requires radical , unwanted and uncomfortable changes to life style .
For instance it may be possible to reduce plastics use by half in 20 years using natural alternatives and less waste .
In the USA automobile performance could be significantly increased , perhaps approaching European levels by 2025 which also has room for improvement on current trends .
Figure 3 . Forecast of supply gap with demand adjusted for efficiency measures ( click to enlarge ) .
There are few options to save jet fuel with the current airplane mix although routing modifications may offer some savings .
Conversely continued introduction of electrified train , metro and tram systems should offer significant cutbacks in oil use throughout the transport industry .
Finally full conversion of all the remaining oil - powered heat and power sources to gas , coal , and renewables could lead to substantial reductions in demand .
Such efficiencies are approximations and involve increased use of natural gas , which in Europe and North America will be difficult , and coal , which will be environmentally damaging .
But the gap , now pushed to 2016 as shown in Figure 3 , may be reduced to the approximate current output of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait by 2020 .
The only realistic option
Thus the answer to the question is no ; there is no painless way to fill the gap .
Of course it will be filled ; partly from traditional sources ; partly from new alternatives ; partly from simple efficiencies ; but a large portion will have to be filled by demand destruction .
In the real world demand destruction means poverty and conflict .
We should be working towards reducing vulnerability to such destruction .
And if we cannot do it globally we should do it locally ; at least to gain a competitive edge .
Companies and governments must take energy risks with capital intensive projects , innovative energy sources , new modes of transport and through cutting consumption with taxes and rationing systems .
Growth and decline will in truth be erratic as chaotic price movements drive demand up and down .
But liquid energy demand will want to grow faster than supply .
The global population has reached an unsustainable energy demand level to support the lifestyles we desire .
Conservation will be a necessity but it will be painful .
Oil & Gas 2007 : Global Ten - Year Projection provides a quantitative survey of every country and region in the world – forecasting world oil and gas production , consumption and trade ; onshore and offshore .
It is an essential information tool for decision - makers in oil companies , in the contracting and supply industries , and in financial institutions and government departments .

The CIA reveals it spied on opponents of the Vietnam war
Documents declassified on its website include plans to use Mafia help to kill Cuba 's Communist leader Fidel Castro .
They reveal the extent to which the CIA spied on US journalists and dissidents and on the Soviet Union .
They are part of a report commissioned by a former CIA chief in 1973 in response to the Watergate scandal .
Press reports from the period had implicated the CIA in a break - in which took place at Democratic Party offices at the Watergate Hotel .
Unflattering but part of CIA history
Michael Hayden
CIA director
Documents of troubled times
A newspaper investigation into the burglary eventually led to the downfall of the Republican President , Richard Nixon .
The spy agency 's former director , James Schlesinger , responded by ordering all " senior operating officials " to report on all activities , past and present , " which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this agency " .
The CIA is barred by law from conducting spy activities within the US .
' Unflattering history '
CIA officers in service in 1973 largely used their memory to compile the 693 - page report for Mr Schlesinger .
Documents relating to Castro [ 186 k ]

The abuses and illicit activities listed within date from the 1950s to the 1970s .
The documents were initially referred to as " skeletons " by Mr Schlesinger 's successor at the CIA , William Colby .
They were later nicknamed the " family jewels " and have been referred to as such ever since .
Much of the information contained within them was already known .
The CIA tried to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro ( left )
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed in the New York Times newspaper in 1974 that the CIA had been spying on anti-war dissidents and civil rights campaigners .
However , the documents declassified on Tuesday provide a more comprehensive account of events .
Last week , CIA chief Michael Hayden announced the decision to declassify the records , saying the documents were " unflattering but part of CIA history " .
The documents detail assassination plots , domestic spying , wiretapping , and kidnapping .
The incidents include :
the confinement of a Soviet KGB defector , Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko , in the mid-1960s
attempts to use a suspected Mafia mobster , Johnny Roselli , in a plot to assassinate Cuba 's Fidel Castro
a plot to poison the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba
the wiretapping and surveillance of journalists , including in 1972 columnist Jack Anderson who broke a string of scandals
the testing of hallucinogens such as LSD on unsuspecting citizens
Among the documents is a request in 1972 for someone " who was accomplished at picking locks " who might be retiring or resigning from the agency .
' Soviet succession '
Another set of documents , also just declassified , is known as the CAESAR - POLO - ESAU papers .
This is an 11,000 - page analysis , done between 1953 and 1973 , on Soviet and Chinese internal politics and Sino - Soviet relations .
Among the papers are an analysis of the Soviet leadership completed some four months after the death of Josef Stalin in 1953 .
The CIA 's report , stamped " Top Secret " , said the Soviets carried out a hasty shake - up of top posts to head off possible " panic and disarray " following Stalin 's death .
" It is strongly suggested that the leaders in this moment of crisis had moved swiftly to show their unity and to gird themselves for any battle that might be coming from inside and out , " the CIA report said .
By now you ’ve probably seen a lot of the brouhaha over a bug in the newest version of Excel , 2007 .
Basically , multiplying 77.1*850 , which should give you 65,535 , was actually displaying 100,000 .
Before I try to explain this , I should disclose that I did work on the Excel team , but that was thirteen years ago .
I have n’t been there for a long time .
I do n’t even think I know anyone on that team any more .
I ’m just trying to explain the bug a little bit as a public service .
The first thing you have to understand is that Excel keeps numbers , internally , in a binary format , but displays them as strings .
For example , when you type 77.1 , Excel stores this internally using 64 bits :
0100 0000 0101 0011 0100 0110 0110 0110
0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110
The display is showing you four characters : “ 7 ” , “ 7 ” , “ . ” , and “ 1 ” .
Somewhere inside Excel is a function that converts binary numbers to strings for displaying .
This is the code that has the bug that causes a few numbers which are extremely close to 65,535 to be formatted incorrectly as 100,000 .
If you use the number further along in calculations , for example , if you add 2 to the results , you ’ll get the right thing .
= 77.1*850 -> displays 100000
=77.1*850+2 -> displays 65537 , correctly .
Just to throw people off , this bug also exists for a few numbers which are extremely close to 65,536 .
They display incorrectly as 100,001 .
=77.1*850+1 -> displays 100,001 , incorrectly .
This is still only a bug in the number formatting code ; if you try to make a chart with that number in it , you ’ll get a correct chart .
Now … you may have noticed that I said that this bug exists for numbers which are extremely close to 65,535 , but not for 65,535 itself .
Indeed if you enter 65,535 you see 65,535 .
But , you notice , 77.1 * 850 should be exactly 65,535 , not extremely close to 65,535 !
Look closely at the binary representation for 77.1 :
0100 0000 0101 0011 0100 0110 0110 0110
0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110
See how there ’s a lot of 0110 0110 0110 there at the end ?
That ’s because 0.1 has no exact representation in binary … it ’s a repeating binary number .
It ’s sort of like how 1/3 has no representation in decimal .
1/3 is 0.33333333 and you have to keep writing 3 ’s forever .
If you lose patience , you get something inexact .
So you can imagine how , in decimal , if you tried to do 3 * 1/ 3 , and you did n’t have time to write 3 ’s forever , the result you would get would be 0.99999999 , not 1 , and people would get angry with you for being wrong .
The same thing happens in binary with numbers ending in 0.1 : they are repeating decimals , so when you do mathematical operations on them , very small insignificant errors creep in somewhere way to the right of the decimal point .
( PS : same for .2 , .3 , .4 , .6 , .7 , .8 , and .9 , but not .5 ) .
The IEEE has a standard , IEEE 754 , for how to represent floating point numbers in binary , and this is what almost everybody uses , including Excel , and they have for a really long time , and it means sometimes you get imprecise results when you add a lot of 0.1 ’s together , but if you ’re rounding the numbers to a reasonable number of decimal points , you wo n’t really care .
Back to the Excel bug , which is a genuine bug , not just an artifact of this IEEE 754 stuff .
Since 77.1 has no exact representation , Excel stores it as
0100 0000 0101 0011 0100 0110 0110 0110
0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110
and then when you try to multiply it by 850 , you get something very close to 65,535 , but not exactly 65,535 , because of the fact that 77.1 was n’t stored exactly because that would take infinite memory .
And this number , which is very close to 65,535 , happens to be one of only 12 possible floating point numbers which trigger this bug in Excel .
OK , Q&A .
Q : Is n’t this really , really bad ?
A : IMHO , no , the chance that you would see this in real life calculations is microscopic .
Better worry about getting hit by a meterorite .
Microsoft , of course , will be forced to tell everyone “ accuracy is extremely important to us ” and I ’m sure they ’ll have a fix in a matter of days , and they ’ll be subjected to all kinds of well - deserved ridicule , but since I do n’t work there I ’m free to tell you that the chance of this bug actually mattering to you as an individual is breathtakingly small .
Q : Should n’t they be testing for these kinds of things ?
A : I ’ll bet that most of the numeric testing done on the Excel team is done automatically with VBA code .
Cells containing this value display as 100,000 , but from VBA , they ’re going to look like 65,535 ( since the number would be passed into the Basic runtime in binary , before the display formatting . )
I ’m sure there ’s plenty of code to test display formatting , but with a bug like this that only happens on 12 out of 18446744073709551616 possible floating point binary numbers , it ’s unlikely that any set of black - box tests would cover this case .
Q : What caused the bug ?
A : I ’m not sure exactly , since I do n’t have the code .
Off the top of my head , I ca n’t think of anything that would cause this behavior .
Play around with Quanfei Wen ’s IEEE - 754 calculator , maybe you ’ll find something .
Q : Why not use “ exact ” ( decimal ) arithmetic ?
A : It ’s much slower than floating point arithmetic , since there ’s no hardware on your CPU chip to do it for you natively .
Over the years , Microsoft got so much heat for floating point rounding artifacts in the Windows Calculator that they rewrote it to use an arbitrary - precision arithmetic library .
Since you have to poke at Windows Calculator with a stick , it does n’t have to be as fast as Excel .
That said , CPUs have gotten pretty fast .
I ’ll bet an arbitrary - precision version of Excel would perform pretty well these days .
Still , the Microsoft Excel support team has spent the last 20 years defending IEEE 754 , and it ’s not surprising that they ’ve started to believe in it .
And let ’s face it — do you really want the bright sparks who work there now , and manage to break lots of perfectly good working code — rewriting the core calculating engine in Excel ?
Better keep them busy adding and removing dancing paper clips all day long .
Here is an interview with Richard Stallman about a range of free software topics including GPLv3 and comment on the Microsoft patent issue .
Stallman has a go at Linus Torvalds even suggesting that if people want to keep their freedom they better not follow Torvalds .
From the interview : “ The fact that Torvalds says “ open source ” instead of “ free software ” shows where he is coming from .
I wrote the GNU GPL to defend freedom for all users of all versions of a program .
I developed version 3 to do that job better and protect against new threats .
Torvalds says he rejects this goal ; that ’s probably why he does n’t appreciate GPL version 3 .
I respect his right to express his views , even though I think they are foolish .
However , if you do n’t want to lose your freedom , you had better not follow him . “

The Neo1973's main interface holds the phone 's default applications – an address book , an RSS reader and a media player among them .
Under the hood , there 's a Linux command line . *
Photo : Paul Adams *
The Neo1973 is the first physical manifestation of a grand idea – a new breed of wireless handheld built for the open - source age .
It is the first release from the OpenMoko project , a group working to create a fully open source software platform for smartphones , a community - driven alternative to , say , the iPhone .
Using Linux as a starting point , the OpenMoko developers have built a system which , although not everyday - usable yet , can be successfully installed and run on a variety of ordinary smartphone hardware : Treos , Motorolas , JasJars and so forth .
But it 's not just the software that 's malleable .
The phone 's components are openly documented , making it easy for tinkerers to pull it apart and modify the hardware to run any number of tasks .
The phone even ships with a Torx screwdriver , so they can get right down to business .
Even though it 's officially a pre-alpha " developer edition " device , the Neo1973 is already generating extreme excitement among the tech elite for its seemingly infinite level of hackability .
All that flexibility stands in sharp contrast to Apple 's iPhone , whose feature set is nice but rigidly locked in place , and whose software is limited to use on one specific device .
Apple recently announced it will offer a software development kit for the iPhone next February , but the saga of users ' attempts to crack Apple 's iPhone firmware and bend the tool to their needs – and beyond Apple 's wishes – will continue .
The Neo1973 is the first piece of phone hardware designed to run the open source OpenMoko software platform .
Although not yet ready for prime time , the Linux - based mobile OS has hackers excited .
Photo : Paul AdamsAccording to Asheesh Laroia , an early adopter of the Neo1973 , the Linux phone 's potential for inside - and - out customization is what has hackers truly excited .
" The key for me will not be that I write any particular app , " Laroia says , " but that I can customize the apps I 'm using on a daily basis .
If the e-mail app does n't have auto - complete , I can add it . "
As with the Palm , OpenMoko owners can expect a wealth of third - party applications .
But unlike the languishing Palm platform , Laroia points out , the OpenMoko community can customize , evolve and keep OpenMoko alive on future devices even if FIC , the maker of the Neo1973 , goes the way of the Newton .
" Open source makes it so that applications created for one device can move to another one , " he says .
Eager to put the promise of a Linux - powered iPhone killer to the test , I purchased a prerelease Neo1973 GTA01 B v4 from the OpenMoko website .
My kit , which came with some extras for developers , cost $ 450 .
The consumer version of the phone will cost $ 300 .
Even before the phone showed up , I knew it was n't going to be a smooth ride .
Perhaps the " I have been warned " check box required by the website for purchase should have given me pause , but I pressed ahead and got it anyway .
The funny - looking silver - and - black plastic device ( it also comes in orange ) is significantly lighter than my Treo , and its rounded ends make it hard to tell at a glance which end is up .
It 's outfitted with a touchscreen , a quad - band GSM transceiver , a micro-SD card slot , Bluetooth , onboard GPS and the like .
All the features a modern mobile device needs .
Or almost .
The promised Wi -Fi , it turns out , wo n't be added until the next batch rolls off the assembly line , due to some difficulty finding a chip with GPL - friendly drivers .
The planned dual accelerometers and graphics accelerator are absent , too .
It is , after all , pre-alpha – which means you should n't expect a final version for at least a couple of months .
The Neo1973 ships in a portable black box filled with hacker - friendly tools – including a guitar pick for prying open the phone 's case .
Photo : Paul AdamsI unwrapped the device , popped off the back ( using the provided guitar pick ) , slipped in my SIM card and one of the two provided batteries , closed it up , and looked for a charger .
There 's no charger .
It charges via a USB connection to my computer – good enough .
I powered on the phone and marveled at the scrolling screens of Linux bootup jargon , which terminated after a few seconds with the line , " Kernel panic . "
Time to read the manual .
The wiki for new Neo owners assured me that my kernel panic is standard , since in fact the phone ships without a file system .
The wiki guided me through downloading software onto my Debian laptop and flashing the phone 's firmware with a new kernel and root - file system .
Once I had done that , the phone booted up into the OpenMoko system at last .
The installed software has a fine complement of features : the usual calculator , address book and media player , but also an RSS reader and fully two dozen built - in games , as well as the all - important terminal application .
The terminal is a crucial tool for using the phone at this stage of its development .
Functions like GPS can only be controlled by manually typing in shell commands .
To make the phone vibrate , for instance , I can type in :
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
That command could be used as the basis to write my own little app to signal caller - ID info by Morse - code vibrations in my pocket when someone calls .
But I had more pressing projects , like getting the thing to actually let me make a phone call .
It would n't associate with the T - Mobile network my SIM card uses , no matter what twiddles I tried .
One of the largest and funnest pages on the OpenMoko wiki is the wish list , a communal brainstorming session showing the ambitious spirit driving the project .
Ideas range from simple improvements – speakerphone functionality , a note - taking application – to supercool , blue - skying hacks : Bayesian spam filtering for text messages , a Palm OS emulator , GPS - based reminders ( " You 're near the craft store , remember you need more candle wicks " ) , a walkie - talkie function , and even a feature to automatically give your location to emergency services if the accelerometer detects movement typical of a car crash .
Imagination is the only limit – why not a robust implementation of the Lovegety concept ?
Or laser tag ?
The developer release of the Neo1973 comes with a debug board , an essential tool for working out kinks in the software .
Photo : Paul AdamsActing out of frustration , I eventually violated the whole spirit of the endeavor and installed a different operating system .
I deleted OpenMoko from the phone and put on Qtopia , an alternative software platform that 's partially proprietary but much more mature .
As soon as I flashed the firmware , I was able to send text messages and make calls .
The sound quality on the phone turned out to be excellent .
I can always reinstall OpenMoko , and indeed I look forward to doing that .
Under the auspices of the open source community , the next iteration of the software is bound to be considerably smoother and cooler .
But for now , I 'll wait until OpenMoko is more fully baked – and remind myself how nice it is the phone gives me the freedom to do so .

Peter Woit has been generating an awful lot of controversy for a soft - spoken , unassuming mathematician .
But he is n’t the center of attention because of his own research at Columbia University ; it ’s his opinions about string theory that are generating the hype .
In his new book , Not Even Wrong ( Basic Books , 2006 ) , and his blog by the same name , Woit expounds at length about physics – a field he considers troubled and trapped by a theory that is so far off the mark it can barely be considered science .
Woit has never been a string theorist himself .
When he earned his doctorate degree in particle physics from Princeton in 1984 , the string theory craze was just beginning .
Woit was interested in pursuing other intersections between math and physics , so after his physics post - doctoral work , he found himself more at home in Columbia ’s mathematics department than in any of the string theory - obsessed physics departments of the time .
Over the next 15 years ,
Woit observed that , despite failure after failure , string theory remained the sole path pursued by nearly all theoretical physicists in their quest to bridge the physics of the very small with the macroscopic world .
In 2001 , he finally wrote a short article for American Scientist magazine explaining why he thought string theory had gone bad .
The response he received , both positive and negative , was overwhelming .
He decided to expand his ideas into a book , and then turned them into a public discussion via his blog in 2004 .
The blog quickly became the forum for a raging debate :
Should the physics world continue to focus on a theory that a growing number of voices decry as misguided ?
Scienceline caught up with the man who started the fire .
—Interview by Karen Schrock
SCIENCELINE :
What is so wrong with string theory that you feel it ’s Not Even Wrong ?
PETER WOIT : Well , a little history : Back in 1984 , when people got really excited about string theory , they had a calculation that said that string theory most logically makes sense in 10 dimensions .
We only see three space and one time dimension , so there have to be six other dimensions somewhere .
The hope was that there would only be a few ways of describing this six - dimensional space .
People thought , okay , we ’ll just learn more about string theory , see what happens for these six - dimensional spaces , and one of them will explain our world and we ’ll all get Nobel Prizes .
Then they discovered that there are essentially an infinite number of ways of choosing the size and shape of the six - dimensional space , and you can get pretty close to whatever you want out of the theory by massaging the six - dimensional space appropriately .
So you ca n’t use string theory to predict anything you can observe , which under the normal standards of scientific conduct is when you are supposed to give up .
SCIENCELINE :
But a lot of physicists are excited about the Large Hadron Collider being built at CERN in Switzerland .
Does n’t string theory predict the particles they might discover there when it comes online in 2007 ?
PETER WOIT :
The problem is no matter what they see at the Large Hadron Collider , the string theorists can then go out and find a six - dimensional space which will match those results .
There really is n’t a prediction at all from string theory about what they ’re going to see at this collider .
SCIENCELINE :
So what are some of the alternatives to string theory that you think are being neglected because of its popularity ?
PETER WOIT :
There are n’t really many good ideas out there .
What ’s needed is people who are going to develop new stuff , and that ’s very , very hard to do .
It requires being willing to go off and pursue some completely obscure idea and put years of your life into it .
That ’s an incredibly dangerous thing to do .
You could very easily spend a few years on an idea then find that it was n’t such a good avenue , and , suddenly , you do n’t have a job .
So if you ’re a young physicist and you want to do something with mathematics and particle theory , it ’s virtually impossible unless you do string theory .
That ’s what most directly concerns me .
SCIENCELINE :
Are there any string theorists out there who agree that their field is in trouble ?
PETER WOIT : Talking to string theorists privately , I find that we actually see eye to eye on many things .
They ’re more optimistic than I am that string theory will ultimately lead to something , but the things that I find disturbing about the subject they also find disturbing .
But it ’s really hard to find people who are willing to put their name to that publicly .
My string theorist friends have made it very clear that they do n’t want me quoting them on my blog .
They ’d soon stop talking to me if I did .
SCIENCELINE : Your blog has generated quite some controversy .
Did n’t Harvard string theorist Luboš Motl accuse you of having the intelligence of an amoeba ?
PETER WOIT : It ’s great .
Sometimes I think I ’ve been very lucky because the person most willing to engage in a discussion about this publicly is this guy who is a complete ideologue and extremist .
It ’s something of a gift to have him as my most vocal and visible opponent .
He actually does a very good job of reflecting some of the problems with how string theory has been pursued .
If you want to understand what has gone wrong in that field and what kind of attitudes have become ingrained in people , you can find an example in its most extreme form by reading his websites .
It ’s kind of hard to take him seriously .
I think there are a lot more sensible people who would make tougher opponents .
SCIENCELINE :
He and your other critics often mention that although you have a Ph.D. in physics , you are not a string theorist yourself , so you obviously do n’t understand the nuances of the field .
Do they have a point ?
PETER WOIT : Well , I have n’t worked directly in the research but I ’ve certainly spent 20 years of my life following the field .
That ’s what I ’m basing my knowledge on .
But it ’s true , one of the characteristic things about the subject is its incredible complexity .
To even start to understand string theory you need a Ph.D. in theoretical physics .
The literature is huge , there ’s now 10 , 20 , maybe 30,000 papers written on the subject .
It ’s so complicated that nobody really understands all of it , even the best string theorists .
On the other hand , if you follow the subject for a while , you see that there are certain crucial obstacles to doing what they want to do .
It ’s fairly well known what these obstacles are .
One I mentioned before — the size and shape of the six dimensions .
And you can pick up a string theory paper , after you ’ve done this for a while , and see whether they ’re addressing those crucial issues or not .
So it ’s true , I have n’t actually worked out the calculations .
But I can read what they ’re saying and understand it well enough to know whether or not they ’re getting at these critical problems .
SCIENCELINE :
Do you think it ’s unusual to spend so much of your time following a field in which you are n’t working yourself – in fact , a field in which you do n’t think anyone should be working ?
PETER WOIT : I think there ’s a lot to be said for that .
If there ’s one criticism I agree with , it ’s the idea that maybe I ’d be better off just ignoring all those people and doing something positive .
And , well , there ’s a pretty decent argument there , and I ca n’t completely disagree with it .
But I found myself in a peculiar position .
I ’m in this faculty position , which is not tenured but it ’s permanent .
This means I ’m insulated from the political pressures that most people in the physics community face .
The thing that shocked me after I first published the short piece five years ago was how many people wrote to me and said , “ You ’re so brave .
We would never dare do anything like that . ”
I started to realize that there really has been a serious intimidation factor .
People within the theoretical physics community feel that there are many , many powerful people who are very devoted to this subject , and if they start criticizing it in any public fashion they ’re going to get themselves in big trouble .
Their students are n’t going to get jobs , their grant is not going to be evaluated well , et cetera .
I felt like since I ’m immune to these pressures , I was the person in a position to say something .
SCIENCELINE :
But you must get some sort of gratification from the fact that you are the only person doing this , right ?
PETER WOIT : Yeah , when I started five years ago I was greeted with an enormous amount of skepticism .
But I really have seen the attitudes and viewpoints of people around me change , and that ’s been for several reasons .
One reason , things just have not been going well for string theorists themselves .
But many people have told me that what I ’ve been doing is also having a major effect .
And that ’s really rewarding to see that change happening .
SCIENCELINE :
So what ’s your next step ?
PETER WOIT : I ’m really happy with the blog .
It ’s been very successful , it ’s done exactly what I wanted , and I want to try to keep doing it .
But I want to figure out how to make it less time consuming so I can pursue my own research .
The really crucial idea about particle physics that was learned in the 20th century was the importance of symmetry arguments .
But there ’s a lot in mathematics about symmetries that physicists have never really used .
I want to see if I can get a new understanding about how to exploit symmetries in particle physics , which will require developing some new mathematics .
I want to push the frontiers of mathematics even further .

Scientists have been left scratching their heads with both hands , after research showed the number of left - handed people in the population has almost quadrupled over the last 100 years .
According to The Telegraph , the proportion of folks fiddling with standard corkscrews and taking their lives in their hands by using right - handed scissors has increased to 11 per cent , compared to three per cent a century ago .
The findings were made in a massive study of antique film footage by researchers from University College London ( UCL ) .
Apparently when you pointed a camera at the Edwardians they would politely wave , before breaking into spontaneous clog dancing or a rousing chorus of " Daisy , Daisy , Give Me Your Answer Do " , before marching off somewhere hot to extend the British Empire .
This means the academics only had to count the number of people waving with their left hand as opposed to their right to get a grip on the number of lefties .
What has left them puzzled is the disparity with the proportion of lefties out there today , struggling with right - handed golf clubs , musical instruments , and let 's face it , underwear .
The conclusion is that it is largely down to schooling .
Whereas the left - handed Victorian and Edwardian school child would have been soundly thrashed before having his left hand nailed to the desk , today 's kids are free to use any hand they want , teachers being pleased they 've decided to turn up at all .
Sadly , the research does n't appear to have cropped up on UCL 's website yet .
In the meantime , if you want a left - handed keyboard or mouse , check out this . ®
HOLDERNESS , N.H. -- Dartmouth College 's trustees voted to change the way the Ivy League school is run by diluting the direct influence of trustees elected via competition .
The trustees voted to double the number of board - appointed members , but keeping the number of those elected by alumni the same .
The decision ends a tradition that lasted for more than a century in which half of the revolving members were slotted for alumni selection .
College officials said the change will help trustees operate more effectively .
But critics are expected to challenge it , on the grounds it violates the Ivy League school 's charter and diminishes the role of rank - and - file alumni .
The board voted to increase its size to 26 members from 18 .
The move will double the number of trustee - appointed members to 16 from eight , but keep the number of alumni-elected trustees at eight .
The remaining two seats are held by the college president and New Hampshire governor .
 Associated Press
The following is a letter to the Dartmouth community from the chairman of the trustees , Edward Haldeman
 Special to the Sun
Dear Members of the Dartmouth Community ,
Earlier today , the Dartmouth Board of Trustees took several steps to strengthen the College 's governance .
Given the intense debate about this issue in recent months , I wanted to write to you as soon as possible to tell you what we 've done and why .
Let me start by saying Dartmouth has never been stronger than it is today .
It 's one of the most selective institutions in the country .
Our commitment to teaching has never been stronger and student satisfaction is at record highs .
The student - to - faculty ratio now stands at 8:1 .
We have expanded the faculty by 15 percent since 2000 and maintained competitive faculty compensation , reflecting the College 's sharp focus on its academic programs .
Once current building plans are completed , we will have invested $ 1.1 billion in new and renovated state - of - the - art facilities since 1998 .
Like its peers , however , the College confronts new challenges .
We are facing increasing competition for the finest students and the best faculty as well as for the financial resources needed to support the College .
And , we operate in an increasingly complex and highly regulated environment .
Having the strongest possible governance is a critical factor to ensuring Dartmouth 's continued success in the years ahead .
The changes we are making preserve alumni democracy at Dartmouth by keeping eight alumni- nominated trustees .
They expand the Board with eight additional charter trustees , adding alumni to meet the needs of the College .
And , they address the destructive politicization of trustee campaigns that have hurt Dartmouth .
These changes represent a balancing of competing interests .
They are true to Dartmouth 's founding principles .
And , they will ensure that , moving forward , the College has a strong , effective , and independent governing body .
Over the past three months , the Board 's Governance Committee conducted a thorough review of this issue .
We carefully considered input from many alumni , current and former trustees , faculty , parents , students , and other members of the Dartmouth community .
We consulted with experts in college and non-profit governance and carefully evaluated practices among 30 leading colleges and universities .
And , we developed a report to the full Board , which I encourage you to read for yourself at www.dartmouth.edu/governancereport.
After reviewing the Governance Committee 's recommendations - and after much thought and deliberation - the Board of Trustees concluded that Dartmouth should strengthen its governance by taking steps to :
 Expand the Board by Adding More Alumni to Better Meet the Needs of the College :
We are expanding the Board from 18 to 26 to ensure it has the broad range of backgrounds , skills , expertise , and fundraising capabilities needed to steward an institution of Dartmouth 's scope and complexity .
Dartmouth has been at a competitive disadvantage to its peers , with one of the smallest Boards of any comparable institution .
We have had 18 members on our Board , versus an average of 42 trustees at peer schools and an average of 34 at other liberal arts colleges .
We also are giving the Board more flexibility to select trustees who offer the specific talents and experiences that the College needs , which elections do n't ensure .
We will accomplish both of these goals by adding eight new charter trustee seats to the Board .
 Preserve Alumni Democracy by Retaining Alumni Trustee Elections :
We are maintaining alumni trustee elections at their current level and preserving the ability of alumni to petition onto the ballot .
Dartmouth currently has the highest proportion of alumni- nominated trustees of any peer institution and is one of the few schools that allows alumni to petition directly onto the ballot .
The Board believes that this gives Dartmouth 's alumni an important direct voice in our governance and fosters greater alumni involvement in the College .
Dartmouth will continue to have one of the most democratic trustee election processes of any college in the country .
 Simplify the Alumni Nomination Process : Dartmouth 's trustee elections have become increasingly politicized , costly , and divisive .
It 's not the results of these elections that are the problem , but the process itself .
So we are charging the Alumni Council and the Association of Alumni to develop and implement a process for selecting alumni trustee nominees that preserves elections , maintains petition access to the ballot , and adopts a one - vote , majority - rule election process .
 Improve Direct Board Engagement with Alumni and Other Stakeholders : A larger group of trustees representing even more diverse backgrounds will help us enhance Board engagement with key areas of the College including academic affairs , student life , and alumni relations .
We are therefore creating new Board committees focused on each of these three critical areas .
This will facilitate greater interaction and communication with individuals in each of these three areas .
While we will continue to have eight trustees nominated directly by alumni , a significant number of seats on the Board , I know some will ask why we did n't simply expand the Board through an equal number of charter and alumni trustee seats .
Given the divisiveness of recent elections we did not believe that having more elections would be good for Dartmouth .
We also believe that the Board needs more trustees selected for the specific talents and experiences they can offer the College - which elections can't guarantee .
We will still have more alumni- nominated trustees than most other schools and the opportunity for regular contested elections .
But we think this is the best balancing of Dartmouth 's interests .
I know there are strongly held views on all sides of this issue .
And I respect that many of those views are driven above all by a desire to do what is best for Dartmouth and its students .
But some of the recent rhetoric in this debate has become so harsh and divisive it is now doing harm to Dartmouth .
I want to urge everyone who cares about Dartmouth to debate this issue in a reasonable and respectful way .
As President Wright has said , there is far more that unites us  as friends , faculty , students , and loyal alumni of the College on the Hill  than divides us .
Above all , we have a shared love of and dedication to Dartmouth .
One thing that has made Dartmouth an enduring and successful institution is that its history has always been one of adapting to meet new challenges and needs , while still preserving what is unique and special about Dartmouth .
That is why a board originally composed of twelve New England men , half of them members of the clergy , today consists of eighteen men and women from many parts of the country and walks of life .
That is why Trustees who once served for life now serve four - year terms .
And , that is why elections once open only to " graduates ... of at least five years standing " are now open to all alumni .
In these and many other respects , Dartmouth 's Board has made fundamental changes to its governance structure and procedures throughout the College 's history .
The changes we 're making today are no different .
They are driven by what is best for Dartmouth and its students , and what is necessary to ensure the College continues to meet the new challenges it faces in the 21st century .
I love Dartmouth .
I honestly believe there is nowhere else in the world quite like this great College .
We need to protect Dartmouth and ensure it continues to prosper for future generations of students .
I , and the entire Board , are intensely focused on helping Dartmouth to continue building its world - class academic program .
That is what drives us forward .
And , I look forward to continuing to work with all of you - alumni , faculty , students and parents  to build on Dartmouth 's unique and pre-eminent place in American higher education .
Sincerely ,
Ed Haldeman
Chair , Dartmouth College
Board of Trustees
Are Historically Black Colleges Good for Black Students ?
My good friend Roland Fryer has taken as his life ’s mission to understand every aspect of the economic life of Blacks in America .
His latest research , co-authored with another good friend , Michael Greenstone , tackles the issues of ( a ) who attends historically Black colleges , and ( b ) does it help them or hurt them if they do .
Here are their key conclusions :
1 ) In the 1970s going to a historically Black institution was associated with higher wages and higher graduation rates than going to a traditionally White institution .
2 ) By the 1990s , however , the return to graduating from a historically Black institution fell by 20 % relative to a traditionally White school , so that in the 1990s there was a premium associated with going to the traditionally White school .
3 ) The answer to that reversal does not appear to be due to a change in the mix of students attending the two types of schools , or to differences in expenditure per student .
4 ) Rather , it appears that the traditionally White institutions have evolved to better serve the needs of Black students .
Sounds pretty sensible to me .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 30 — The United States maintained its role as the leading supplier of weapons to the developing world in 2006 , followed by Russia and Britain , according to a Congressional study to be released Monday .
Pakistan , India and Saudi Arabia were the top buyers .
The global arms market is highly competitive , with manufacturing nations seeking both to increase profits and expand political influence through weapons sales to developing nations , which reached nearly $ 28.8 billion in 2006 .
That sales total was a modest drop from the 2005 figure of $ 31.8 billion , a trend explained by the strain of rising fuel prices that prompted many developing states — except those that produce oil — to choose upgrading current arsenals over buying new weapons .
The report , “ Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations , ” was produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service , a division of the Library of Congress , and presents a number of interesting observations linking arms sales and global politics .
Coulter :
If we took away women 's right to vote , we 'd never have to worry about Dems Ron Brynaert

In an interview with the New York Observer , conservative commentator , frequent Fox guest , and alleged plagiarist Ann Coulter left this choice quote , which the Observer highlighted as " On women : " COULTER :
If we took away women 's right to vote , we 'd never have to worry about another Democrat president .
It 's kind of a pipe dream , it 's a personal fantasy of mine , but I do n't think it 's going to happen .
And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly , at least single women .
It also makes the point , it is kind of embarrassing , the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame , that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it .
I mean , you do see its the party of women and ' Well pay for health care and tuition and day care -- and here , what else can we give you , soccer moms ? '
Coulter has her own voting woes , left unmentioned in the interview , which is intended to promote her latest book , " If Democrats Had Any Brains , They 'd Be Republicans . "
In 2006 , Coulter allegedly violated Florida law by voting in the wrong precinct .
The short version , according to The Brad Blog , which has closely followed the ongoing story : " She committed third - degree voter fraud in Palm Beach County when she lied on her registration .
Period .
Dead to rights .
She also lied on her driver 's license down there ( another third - degree felony ) and knowingly voted at the wrong precinct ( first degree misdemeanor ) .
Again , all dead to rights .
The link above offers all the proof any attorney with balls bigger than Coulter 's would need .
And here 's her fraudulent Voter Registration form to boot . "
According to Brad blog , " an FBI agent interceded inappropriately in the case to claim she was being ' stalked , ' " but that an early August report in the Palm Beach Post said that the Florida Election Commission was still investigating .
" The Coulter voting saga is now known as FEC Case No. 07-211 .
The investigator assigned , Tallahassee 's Margie Wade , would n't confirm she caught the case ; FEC complaints are supposed to be confidential , " Jose Lambiet wrote for the Florida paper .
" Still , Page Two is told Coulter already has been notified she 's under investigation . "
As noted last November by RAW STORY ( article link ) after the midterm elections , Republican officials boasted that their " highly sophisticated get - out - the - vote operation " in the final hours would keep Congress in their control .
But at least two " notorious " and high profile party members did n't do enough to aid the cause , a Florida newspaper revealed .
" Mark Foley , the former U.S. congressman in rehab for alcohol and sex- related problems , did n't send an absentee ballot request to the St. Lucie County elections office , " Jose Lambiet wrote for the Palm Beach Post .
" Conservative pundit Ann Coulter , accused of voting in the wrong precinct earlier this year , did n't cast her ballot , contributing further to the demise of the GOP in Congress . "
" No ' I Voted ' stickers for them , " Lambiet added .
The gossip column in Wednesday 's NY Daily News relates , in further Coulter - related news , " Meanwhile , Media Matters , the liberal watchdog group that forced Don Imus off the air , challenged NBC to explain why it " continues to provide Coulter with an open forum . "
The group 's action was prompted by " Today 's " Monday interview of Coulter by Meredith Viera  after Matt Lauer , Brian Williams and Jay Leno all criticized Coulter 's 9/11 widow comments .
Said an NBC exec : ' Regardless of what you think of Ann Coulter , she 's a compelling interview . "
This man has problems , gets himself arrested for being generally weird and loud in a coffee shop freaking out about his laptop ... so funny .

THERE are reckoned to be 400,000 monks in Myanmar ( formerly known as Burma ) , about the same as the number of soldiers under the ruling junta 's command .
The soldiers have the guns .
The monks have the public 's support and , judging from the past fortnight 's protests , the courage and determination to defy the regime .
But Myanmar 's tragic recent history suggests that when an immovable junta meets unstoppable protests , much blood is spilled .
In the last pro-democracy protests on this scale , in 1988 , it took several rounds of massacres before the demonstrations finally subsided , leaving the regime as strong as ever .
By Thursday September 27th , with a crackdown under way , and the first deaths from clashes with security forces , it seemed hard to imagine that things would be very different this time .
The latest round of protests began last month , after the government suddenly imposed drastic fuel - price rises .
At first , the demonstrations were fairly small .
It looked as if the protests might fizzle until soldiers fired over the heads of monks demonstrating in the central town of Pakkoku .
The clergy demanded an apology , setting a deadline of September 17th .
The next day , their demand having been ignored , they took to the streets .
At first , the regime 's forces stayed out of sight .
On September 22nd , a group of monks and laymen was allowed to pray outside the normally heavily guarded home of Aung San Suu Kyi , the leader of the opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) and icon of Myanmar 's struggle for democracy .
Miss Suu Kyi's public appearance — her first since she was detained four years ago — proved a boon to the demonstrators .
On Monday the protest in Yangon , Myanmar 's main city , was said to be 100,000 - strong .
That night the regime broke its silence .
On state television and radio , it warned of unspecified action “ according to the law ” if protests continued .
The next day the protesters defied the threat , staging a demonstration at least as big as Monday's .
Soon after that march ended , troops and riot police moved into positions around Yangon .
On Wednesday the authorities announced a two - month night - time curfew and troops surrounded monasteries in the city .
But swarms of protesters again poured on to the streets , defying tear - gas , warning shots and baton charges .
The first deaths , including of monks , were reported .
On Thursday , troops burst into monasteries around the country to make arrests but , again , this did not stop monks and laymen from hitting the streets , where riot police shot at them .
The regime may be trying to calibrate its response to the protests , using limited force at first to quell opponents .
That said , it still has elite disciplined units which would be unlikely to flinch if ordered to open fire on unarmed monks and nuns .
If there are any cracks in the junta 's unity , nobody outside knows about them .
Myanmar 's junta has survived in part through diplomatic triangulation .
Like North Korea , it has borne isolation and rhetorical hostility from the West by cosying up to the neighbours , notably China .
And it has tried to avoid total subservience to any one of these by playing them off against each other .
As in the past , the world 's initial response to the junta 's violence was marked by bickering and point - scoring .
On September 27th , the United Nations Security Council met in response to pressure from the West for co-ordinated sanctions .
But Russia and China argued that the unrest was an internal matter that should not be on the council 's agenda at all .
America announced new sanctions against the regime , in keeping with a policy some Western countries have pursued for nearly two decades .
They are cheered on by a vocal and well - organised exile movement , and , when she was able to make her views known , by Miss Suu Kyi herself .
Her heroic stature has helped make Myanmar a fashionable cause .
Shareholder - activists and ordinary consumers in the West have also done their bit to encourage a boycott .
But isolation has never really been on the cards .
Any gap is eagerly filled by Myanmar 's neighbours — not just China , but also India and Thailand and other members of the Association of South - East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) .
American leaders have insisted the junta honour the 1990 election result , won by Miss Suu Kyi's NLD , and step aside .
To this end , they have already imposed wide - ranging sanctions .
The European Union has been more equivocal , and its sanctions correspondingly milder .
Japan , Burma 's biggest aid donor until 1988 , has been softer still .
If any countries can sway the junta they are the regional ones : ASEAN , especially Thailand ; India ; and above all China .
China has given the junta diplomatic support , helping for years to keep its behaviour off the agenda of the United Nations Security Council .
But Myanmar is far from a client state .
This week Chinese spokesmen called for restraint in responding to the protests .
Their pleas seem to be falling on deaf ears .
Even if pressure both from within and beyond Myanmar 's borders causes the regime to crumble , the country 's troubles would still be daunting .
Many of the ethnic minorities continue to distrust the majority “ Burmans ” , even including the democrats .
And the NLD has been gutted by years of oppression .
Miss Suu Kyi , inspiring figure though she is , is an untested leader who has perforce been woefully out of touch with events .
As in 1988 and 1990 the Burmese people have shown they want to choose their own leaders .
In the past they did not fully reckon on the ruthlessness of the people they were up against .
One day , as with all tyrannies , Myanmar 's will fall .
But much blood may flow before that day dawns .
In that letter , Moore makes point after good point ( drawing attention to the point that Gupta has n't the experience for the type of evaluation he was making is a particularly good one ) , but I 'd like to draw attention to just a couple , those having to do with the dinoraur aspect of CNN .
Moore writes :
In the old days , before the Internet , you could get away with it .
Your victims had no way to set the record straight , to show the viewers how you had misrepresented the truth .
But now , we can post the truth -- and back it up with evidence and facts -- on the web , for all to see .
On the Web , even CNN is trying to get " with it , " recognizing that there 's a new dynamic in the news field , with things like " iReports . "
On cable , however , it sticks to the old model .
We tell you , and we do n't make mistakes ( at least , we do n't draw attention to them - - to yours , yes , but not to ours ) .
Moore makes it clear that CNN can't pass this off as a one - timer :
We are now going to start looking into the veracity of other reports you have aired on other topics .
Nothing you say now can be believed .
In 2002 , the New York Times busted you for bringing celebrities on your shows and not telling your viewers they were paid spokespeople for the pharmaceutical companies .
You promised never to do it again .
But there you were , in 2005 , talking to Joe Theismann , on air , as he pushed some drug company - sponsored website on prostate health .
You said nothing about about his affiliation with GlaxoSmithKline .
Old habits die hard , and sometimes the only way to shock people out of bad habits is to embarrass them or shock them .
What Moore is trying to do with CNN is in CNN 's own best interest ( Moore makes it clear that he actually likes the people of CNN ) .
Of course , being Michael Moore , he can't keep away from CNN 's past failures :
You and the other networks were willing partners with Bush , flying flags all over the TV screens and never asking the hard questions that you should have asked .
You might have prevented a war .
You might have saved the lives of those 3,610 soldiers who are no longer with us .
Instead , you blew air kisses at a commander in chief who clearly was making it all up .
Millions of us knew that -- why did n't you ?
I think you did .
And , in my opinion , that makes you responsible for this war .
There 's never been " objectivity " at CNN , or a real position " above the fray . "
And that 's what 's so infuriating .
Fox News may spout about " fair and balanced , " but they really make little pretense at being so .
Fox is dishonest , too , of course ... but it lies to us with a wink and a smile ....
Fox knows that we know that it lies , and does n't care .
CNN pretends it is not lying ... even now , after Moore has shown so clearly that it is ... and does .
As I said at the start , if Michael Moore did n't exist , we 'd have to invent him .
Yes , the dinosauars are dying , but they could fall and crush us all .
Moore is not just warning CNN , but us , giving us time to get out of the way of an unfolding disaster .
The Dutch government will ban the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms , the justice ministry said yesterday , rolling back part of the country 's permissive drug policy after a number of incidents , including the death of a teenager who had eaten them .
The ban will go into effect within months and does not need parliamentary approval , Wim van der Weegen , a ministry spokesman , said .
Shops that continued to sell magic mushrooms would be closed .
Under the country 's tolerance policy cannabis is technically illegal but police do not prosecute people for possession of small amounts , and it is sold openly in designated cafes .
Possession of hard drugs such as cocaine , LSD and ecstasy is illegal .
Mushrooms will fall somewhere in the middle .
" We 're not talking about a non-prosecution policy , but we 'll be targeting sellers , " Mr Van der Weegen said .
Psilocybin , the main active chemical in the mushrooms , has been illegal under international law since 1971 .
However , fresh , unprocessed mushrooms continued to be sold legally in the Netherlands on the basis that it was impossible to determine how much of the naturally occurring substance any mushroom contained .
Mr Van der Weegen said that was also why the system proved unworkable .
" The problem with mushrooms is that their effect is unpredictable .
It 's impossible to estimate what amount will have what effect . "
Calls for a re-evaluation arose after Gaelle Caroff , 17 , from France , was killed by jumping from a building after eating psychedelic mushrooms while on a school visit to Amsterdam in March .
Her parents blamed her death on hallucinations brought on by the mushrooms , though she had had psychiatric problems .
Since Ms Caroff 's death other cases have been reported in the Dutch press .
A British tourist , 22 , ran amok in a hotel , breaking a window and slicing his hand badly ; an Icelandic tourist , 19 , thought he was being chased and jumped from a balcony , breaking both legs ; and a Danish tourist , 29 , drove his car wildly through a campsite , narrowly missing people sleeping in tents .
Most mushrooms sold in Amsterdam are sold to tourists .
After the health ministry launched a study , mushroom vendors suggested stricter ID controls for buyers , and strong warnings against mixing mushrooms with other drugs .
But this week the health minister , Ab Klink , said that merely tightening controls did not go far enough .
Murat Kucuksen , whose farm
Procare supplies about half the mushrooms on the Dutch market , said he stood to lose several million euros invested in setting up his legal growing facilities .
He predicted the trade would move underground , prices would rise , and dealers would sell dried mushrooms or LSD as a substitute , with no guidance for tourists .
" So you 'll have a rise in incidents but they wo n't be recorded as mushroom - related , and the politicians can declare victory , " he said .
Suzuki roshi , in his wonderful Zen mind , beginner 's mind , talks about the mental approach necessary for the study of Zen .
It 's an open , naïve attitude , without preconceptions and without habits which limit thought into certain patterns .
I think it 's the same as that the scientist should employ .
Chess players understand the game and its moves and possibilities so well that they can quickly size up a situation .
You may have seen masters playing a game by calling out moves to one another , without the presence of a board or pieces .
It 's not all about memory and concentration , but also the fact that each move is very well understood in its context within the game .
Players ' eyes flick from piece to piece moving rapidly down the lines of force and influence which the players know from experience and a deep understanding of the game .
This enables expert players to plan many moves ahead - their mental model of the board and the possibilities has become efficient .
In doing so the unlikely , disadvantageous , and extraneous moves and information have been discarded from the system .
This could be called expert mind .
Such a mind is terrifically powerful within the boundaries of the known .
Chess masters , at the beginning of their career , developed their game , their set of strategies and approaches which constitute their strength and also their weakness .
The great players continue to expand and develop this skill set , by following further and further into the intricacies and consequences of their special style of play and also by testing and understanding its weak points and learning how to counter these as best possible .
The truly great players , however , the grand masters and the giants of their generation , do something else .
Without giving up the expert mind , they never forget the mental attitude they had when first learning the game .
They can see the lines of force , the moves they have discovered are powerful and the strategies they have found are productive .
But at the same time they remember the naïve approach under which all possibilities remain open .
It 's this beginner 's mind which can find new , wild , magical possibilities where the conventional wisdom sees only defeat .
Everyone does this when they first learn a new skill or investigate a new field .
No limits exist because no limits are yet imagined .
The mind is supple , calm but interested , ready to be amazed .
It sees the whole rather than the meaning of the parts .
But like a child or a fool , this mind is full of possibility but lacking in power .
As experience grows limits are found , a mental model of the problem is formed , and the expert mind grows .
Now the mind is powerful but limited and rigid .
I 've heard people say that mathematicians do all their great work before they 're 30 .
That discipline requires a beginner 's mind more than any other , but science in general is like this .
New ideas come not from fitting the data into the current understanding , but from letting the open , still , subconscious mind bring forth an entirely new conception which can be tested against the evidence .
The expert mind is good at efficiently checking the fit of theory and data , and seeing the deep implications of data within theory .
It 's good at developing theory , massaging and reworking and conceptualising the inconsistencies .
But stand back from it all .
Be awed by the wonder engendered by the universe .
Let the whole picture strike you without attempting interpretation .
This is how to make any discipline new again .
It 's Zen mind , scientific mind .

" I do n't like reading off a computer screen "  it 's a cliché of the e-book world .
It means " I do n't read novels off of computer screens " ( or phones , or PDAs , or dedicated e- book readers ) , and often as not the person who says it is someone who , in fact , spends every hour that Cthulhu sends reading off a computer screen .
It 's like watching someone shovel Mars Bars into his gob while telling you how much he hates chocolate .
But I know what you mean .
You do n't like reading long - form works off of a computer screen .
I understand perfectly  in the ten minutes since I typed the first word in the paragraph above , I 've checked my mail , deleted two spams , checked an image - sharing community I like , downloaded a YouTube clip of Stephen Colbert complaining about the iPhone ( pausing my MP3 player first ) , cleared out my RSS reader , and then returned to write this paragraph .
This is not an ideal environment in which to concentrate on long - form narrative ( sorry , one sec , gotta blog this guy who 's made cardboard furniture ) ( wait , the Colbert clip 's done , gotta start the music up ) ( 19 more RSS items ) .
But that 's not to say that it's not an entertainment medium  indeed , practically everything I do on the computer entertains the hell out of me .
It 's nearly all text - based , too .
Basically , what I do on the computer is pleasure - reading .
But it 's a fundamentally more scattered , splintered kind of pleasure .
Computers have their own cognitive style , and it's not much like the cognitive style invented with the first modern novel ( one sec , let me google that and confirm it ) , Don Quixote , some 400 years ago .
The novel is an invention , one that was engendered by technological changes in information display , reproduction , and distribution .
The cognitive style of the novel is different from the cognitive style of the legend .
The cognitive style of the computer is different from the cognitive style of the novel .
Computers want you to do lots of things with them .
Networked computers doubly so  they ( another RSS item ) have a million ways of asking for your attention , and just as many ways of rewarding it .
There 's a persistent fantasy / nightmare in the publishing world of the advent of very sharp , very portable computer screens .
In the fantasy version , this creates an infinite new market for electronic books , and we all get to sell the rights to our work all over again .
In the nightmare version , this leads to runaway piracy , and no one ever gets to sell a novel again .
I think they 're both wrong .
The infinitely divisible copyright ignores the " decision cost " borne by users who have to decide , over and over again , whether they want to spend a millionth of a cent on a millionth of a word  no one buys newspapers by the paragraph , even though most of us only read a slim fraction of any given paper .
A super - sharp , super - portable screen would be used to read all day long , but most of us wo n't spend most of our time reading anything recognizable as a book on them .
Take the record album .
Everything about it is technologically pre-determined .
The technology of the LP demanded artwork to differentiate one package from the next .
The length was set by the groove density of the pressing plants and playback apparatus .
The dynamic range likewise .
These factors gave us the idea of the 40 - to - 60 - minute package , split into two acts , with accompanying artwork .
Musicians were encouraged to create works that would be enjoyed as a unitary whole for a protracted period  think of Dark Side of the Moon , or Sgt. Pepper's .
No one thinks about albums today .
Music is now divisible to the single , as represented by an individual MP3 , and then subdivisible into snippets like ringtones and samples .
When recording artists demand that their works be considered as a whole  like when Radiohead insisted that the iTunes Music Store sell their whole album as a single , indivisible file that you would have to listen to all the way through  they sound like cranky throwbacks .
The idea of a 60 - minute album is as weird in the Internet era as the idea of sitting through 15 hours of Der Ring des Nibelungen was 20 years ago .
There are some anachronisms who love their long - form opera , but the real action is in the more fluid stuff that can slither around on hot wax  and now the superfluid droplets of MP3s and samples .
Opera survives , but it is a tiny sliver of a much bigger , looser music market .
The future composts the past : old operas get mounted for living anachronisms ; Andrew Lloyd Webber picks up the rest of the business .
Or look at digital video .
We 're watching more digital video , sooner , than anyone imagined .
But we 're watching it in three - minute chunks from YouTube .
The video's got a pause button so you can stop it when the phone rings and a scrubber to go back and forth when you miss something while answering an IM .
And attention spans do n't increase when you move from the PC to a handheld device .
These things have less capacity for multitasking than real PCs , and the network connections are slower and more expensive .
But they are fundamentally multitasking devices  you can always stop reading an e-book to play a hand of solitaire that is interrupted by a phone call  and their social context is that they are used in public places , with a million distractions .
It is socially acceptable to interrupt someone who is looking at a PDA screen .
By contrast , the TV room  a whole room for TV !
 is a shrine where none may speak until the commercial airs .
The problem , then , is n't that screens are n't sharp enough to read novels off of .
The problem is that novels are n't screeny enough to warrant protracted , regular reading on screens .
Electronic books are a wonderful adjunct to print books .
It 's great to have a couple hundred novels in your pocket when the plane does n't take off or the line is too long at the post office .
It 's cool to be able to search the text of a novel to find a beloved passage .
It 's excellent to use a novel socially , sending it to your friends , pasting it into your sig file .
But the numbers tell their own story  people who read off of screens all day long buy lots of print books and read them primarily on paper .
There are some who prefer an all - electronic existence ( I 'd like to be able to get rid of the objects after my first reading , but keep the e-books around for reference ) , but they 're in a tiny minority .
There 's a generation of web writers who produce " pleasure reading " on the web .
Some are funny .
Some are touching .
Some are enraging .
Most dwell in Sturgeon 's 90th percentile and below .

Mostly , we can read just enough of a free e-book to decide whether to buy it in hardcopy  but not enough to substitute the e-book for the hardcopy .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 6  When Mark Klein , then an AT&T technician in San Francisco , stumbled on a secret room apparently reserved for the National Security Agency inside an AT&T switching center , he hardly expected to be caught up in a national debate over the proper balance between American civil liberties and national security .
But four years later , Mr. Klein ’s discovery has led to a spate of class - action lawsuits against the nation ’s largest telephone companies .
The threat posed to the telecommunications industry by those suits has prompted the Bush administration to push Congress to grant companies legal immunity for their secret cooperation in the N.S.A. ’s program of eavesdropping without warrants .
With many Democrats in Congress seemingly willing to grant the legal protection , Mr. Klein has come to Washington to fight back .
Mr. Klein , 62 and now retired , will begin meeting Wednesday with staff members on the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to try to persuade them to put a brake on the immunity legislation .
He says the phone companies do not deserve the legal protection .
“ I think they committed a massive violation not only of the law but of the Constitution , ” he said .
“ That ’s not the way the Fourth Amendment is supposed to work . ”
Son enfance et ses études pluridisciplinaires Benjamin Walter est né de parents juifs le 15 Juillet 1892 à Berlin .
Il restera dans la capitale allemande jusqu'à l'âge de huit ans puis de 1904 à 1907 , pour des raisons de santé , part séjourner à la campagne .
Il se lie alors d'amitié avec Gustav Wyneken à l'origine de son incorporation dans les Jugendbewegung , « le mouvement de jeunesse allemande ».
Ce courant prône le retour à la nature plutôt que les effets de l'industrialisation du XIXe siècle sur l'environnement .
De 1910 à 1914 , il publie alors des essais dans la publication de ce mouvement , intitulé « Der Anfang » En 1912 , après l'obtention du baccalauréat , Walter Benjamin étudie la philosophie , la philologie allemande et l'histoire de l'art à l'Université « Albert - Ludwigs » de Fribourg - en - Brisgau .
A Berlin et à Munich , sa thèse sur le romantisme allemand n'est pas validée .
En 1923 , il tente à nouveau d'obtenir son habilitation pour pouvoir enseigner mais ce sera à nouveau un échec .
Ses différentes influences
En 1915 , il montre son désaccord avec les idées de Gustav Wyneken qui sollicite la jeunesse allemande à servir sa patrie .
Plus généralement , il se place en retrait par rapport aux principaux courants de pensée .
A l'université de Munich , il noue des liens d'amitié avec Gershom Scholem , spécialiste de la mystique juive .
Celui-ci incite Benjamin à partager ses idées sur le sionisme progressiste , sans succès ; l'écrivain reste avant tout attaché à la poésie et au romantisme allemand .
Il échange également sa réflexion avec le dadaïste Hans Richter ou Ernst Bloch .
Puis , il noue des liens très forts avec Theodor Adorno avant de rencontrer des surréalistes comme Picabia et de s'émouvoir avec les œuvres de Louis Aragon .
Une longue correspondance correspond à ses amitiés avec Adorno et Scholem .
Des thèmes variés
De par ses études et relations , Walter Benjamin devient écrivain , essayiste , journaliste et traducteur .
Ses écrits concernent la théologie , la philosophie du langage , le marxisme .
Il est également critique d'art et critique littéraire .
Féru de romantisme , il traduit les textes de Balzac , Baudelaire , Proust , Saint - John Perse , Paul Valéry ...
En effet , c'est grâce à ses travaux de traductions que Benjamin réussit à vivre mais aussi grâce à la rente de son père jusque 1933 .
Il travaille sur la notion - même de traduction et écrit Die Afgabe des Überstezers ( La tâche du traducteur ) .
En 1927 , il termine la traduction du livre A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs .
C'est en 1928 qu'il travaille sur son récit autobiographique Enfance berlinoise vers 1900 ; texte qu'il n'achèvera qu'en 1938 à cause de ses ennuis financiers et qui ne sera publié par Theodor Adorno qu'en 1950 .
Un récit plus personnel encore concerne son fils : il s'agit d'un carnet intime dont les dernières notes correspondent à l'année 1932 .
Ses voyages voulus ou forcés Après son pays d'origine , Benjamin découvre la Suisse et l'Italie avec Capri .
Il séjourne à Paris en 1926 pour écrire son second essai sur l'auteur qu'il traduit , Charles Baudelaire et ses tableaux parisiens .
Dans Images de pensée , il s'exprime sur cette ville dont il est tombé sous le charme : « Paris est la grande salle de lecture d'une bibliothèque que traverse la Seine . » Walter devient ami avec Germaine Krull qui lui offre ses clichés des passages parisiens et il poursuit ses réflexions sur Paris , ses passages et la mode .
En France , il partira également pour le Var et Monaco .
Ses réflexions se fondent donc sur ces nombreux voyages : Moscou , à nouveau l'Allemagne puis Ibiza où il séjournera quelques mois en 1932 puis en 1933 .
Cette année -là , il doit émigrer à nouveau vers Paris jusqu 'en 1940 .
Les aléas de sa vie privée
En 1916 , l'écrivain philosophe rompt ses premières fiançailles pour vivre avec Dora Pollack qui était alors mariée .
Il l'épouse l'année suivante en retardant sa mobilisation et il aura un fils , Stephan Rafaël en 1918 .
Mais en 1920 , Walter connaît déjà des soucis financiers et la famille emménage à Berlin chez ses parents .
Il divorce et s'installe à Heidelberg .
La vie de l'auteur est semée d'embûches sur les plans personnel et professionnel .
Sa mère le nommait d'ailleurs « Monsieur Maladroit » .
En 1914 , il est d'abord éprouvé par le suicide de deux amis puis il doit renoncer à une carrière d'enseignant à l'université , sa thèse ayant été rejetée .
Son œuvre ne sera reconnue que plusieurs années après sa mort même si ses écrits sont célèbres auprès de nombreux lecteurs et chercheurs .
Plusieurs tentatives de suicide lui ont été reconnus et Walter Benjamin , surtout vers la fin de sa vie , est un être exilé , sans argent , drogué et incompris .
Dès le début des années 1930 , il est horrifié par la vie politique de l'Allemagne mais aussi par celle des autres pays dont la situation lui est contée par ses amis dans leur correspondance .
Il rédige d'ailleurs son testament dès 1933 .
Ses réflexions politiques et théologiques L'écrivain juif allemand se rend très vite compte de la déchéance politique de son pays et de la république de Weimar mais surtout de la montée de l'antisémitisme .
Dès 1918 , il prend note de l'acharnement du gouvernement envers les étudiants juifs allemands non incorporés .
En 1924 , il séjourne à Capri où l'ukrainienne Asja Lascis puis Georg Lukács l'encouragent à accepter la pensée marxiste mais Walter n'adhérera à aucun parti .
Il rejette particulièrement le matérialisme des marxistes .
Concernant la philosophie du langage , il s'appuie sur la mystique juive de Gershom Scholem et ses premiers textes tournent autour du rapport entre esprit et langage au vu de l'essai de 1916
Sur le langage en général et sur le langage humain .
Il se prononce pour le côté « mystique » du langage ; il doit lui-même , par son travail de traducteur et critique , « libérer le pur langage captif dans l'œuvre » ; il s'inspire pour cela de la pensée romantique de Goëthe .
Il a également travaillé sur le concept d'histoire : par ses réflexions théologiques , il ne considère pas le temps comme linéaire et continu .
Il est possible selon lui , de fracturer le passé par la notion de « l'à - présent » ( Jetztzeit ) .
Il prend alors exemple sur l'oppression et la violence vécues à son époque .
Walter Benjamin et l'art
Il partage son goût pour l'art avec son père qui exerce comme banquier puis comme antiquaire et marchand d'art à Berlin .
En 1921 , le critique d'art achète le tableau du peintre Paul Klee , Angelus Novus qu'il confie à Sholem durant ses voyages .
Il rencontrera plus tard ce peintre ainsi que Kandinsky .
En 1936 , dans L’œuvre d’art à l’âge de sa reproductibilité technique , l'auteur développe sa pensée aussi bien sur l'art que la culture en général , l'architecture , mais aussi sur la science , la technique , la religion , l'économie , la politique , la guerre et la psychanalyse .
Dans ce texte mais précédemment dans sa thèse et dans son essai Petite histoire de la photographie de 1931 , il concentre surtout sa réflexion sur le concept de « l'aura ».
Selon lui , l ’œuvre d'art s'inscrit dans un lieu , un temps précis et ne peut engendrer , comme lors de la contemplation d'un paysage , qu'une seule émotion ; celle - ci ne pourra être la même plus tard ou dans un autre lieu .
Ceci vient du fait que l’œuvre d'art est initiée par des rites magiques puis religieux .
Pour ce critique d'art , la reproduction a pour effet , la perte de cet aura ou « autorité de la chose » : il en veut pour preuve , le cinéma ou la photographie .
L'art devenant alors la propriété des masses , l'individu doit juger de l'authenticité de l'œuvre .
Aujourd 'hui , les sociologues français Antoine Hennion et Bruno Latour énoncent les erreurs de Benjamin concernant cette réflexion .
Son exil et sa mort Après son séjour à Ibiza en 1933 , l'écrivain et essayiste juif ne retourne pas en Allemagne où les nazis ont pris le pouvoir .
Déjà en souffrance face à sa vie privée et ses déboires professionnels , ce penseur libre ne supportant pas l'oppression vit de plus en plus mal le chaos européen .
Exilé à Paris , il entame un discours auprès de la Ligue des Droits de l'Homme puis continue ses articles sur les passages de Paris .
Il ne parvient pas à obtenir la naturalisation française et en 1939 , il est arrêté et conduit au camp de Vernuche près de Nevers .
Peu de temps après , Benjamin est libéré par des amis intellectuels .
C'est en juin 1940 qu'il part pour Lourdes , Marseille puis Port - Vendres .
D'ici , il espère franchir la frontière espagnole , aidé , pour lui et deux autres exilés , par les résistants Hans et Lisa Fittko .
A Portbou , désespéré , sous la menace des autorités espagnoles et par peur de se faire arrêter par la Gestapo , il prend une dose considérable de morphine qu'il utilisait pour ses douleurs au dos et sa myocardite .
Il meurt le 26 Septembre 1940 après avoir franchi cette frontière .
Son corps n'a pas été retrouvé mais au cimetière de Portbou , un monument funéraire a été érigé en son honneur .
De même , l'œuvre Passages créée par le sculpteur Dani Karavan a été installée dans le port .
La recherche sans succès de sa dépouille a eu pour conséquence l'émission de plusieurs hypothèses sur sa mort dont celle de son assassinat par des agents de Staline .
Elle est d'ailleurs utilisée dans le documentaire Qui a tué Walter Benjamin ... ?
de David Maus reprenant le concept de l'histoire et du temps énoncé par le philosophe .
Son œuvre La majorité des textes de Benjamin a été rédécouverte et analysée dans les années 1950 par l'intermédiaire de Theodor et Greta Adorno mais aussi par celui de Gershom Sholem .
En 2013 , le Cahier de L'Herne rassemble l'essentiel de la pensée benjaminienne et son œuvre est insérée dans le programme des agrégations de lettres et de philosophie depuis 2014 .
Ses œuvres publiées de son vivant puis traduites et rééditées ultérieurement Sa thèse de 1920 Le Concept de critique esthétique dans le romantisme allemand a été traduite et éditée en 2008 .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
His mother describes Lt. Michael Murphy as " someone who always stuck up for the underdog . "
His father says he was " honest , kind , caring -- probably the antithesis of what you would call a warrior . "
Dan and Maureen Murphy accept their son's Medal of Honor from President Bush .
Two years after he was killed in a firefight in Afghanistan , Dan and Maureen Murphy and their son John on Monday received Lt. Murphy 's Medal of Honor for heroism on the battlefield from President Bush .
" With this medal , we acknowledge a debt that will not diminish with time and can never be repaid , " Bush said .
Murphy 's honor is the first to be awarded from the war in Afghanistan .
Two Medals of Honor have been awarded to a soldier and a Marine serving in Iraq .
In June 2005 , Murphy , 29 , led his four - man Navy SEAL team into the 10,000 - foot peaks of Afghanistan 's Hindu Kush to search for a terrorist thought to be in the region .
But they were soon spotted and started taking fire from more than 40 insurgents .
According to a Navy report on the incident , the insurgents held the advantage of terrain and launched a well organized , three - sided attack on the team , forcing them deeper into a ravine .
All four men were soon wounded , said the SEAL team 's lone survivor , Petty Officer 2nd Class Marcus Luttrell .
Watch Luttrell tell the story of what happened that day »
Medal of Honor The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the U.S. government .
It is bestowed on a member of the U.S. armed forces who distinguishes himself " conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States . "
Source : Federal Code of Regulations , U.S. Department of Defense
" We were hurtin ' bad , " Luttrell said .
" We were out of ammo , and you know everybody , it was bad , it was real bad . "
Murphy exposed himself to enemy fire while trying to keep his team together , Luttrell said .
" He was in a horrible position .
He left himself open so he could move back and forth to each individual guy . "
The mountainous terrain blocked communications .
The team 's communications operator was wounded as he tried to find an area to transmit from .
According to the Navy report , Murphy moved into the open and " calmly provided his unit 's location and the size of the enemy force while requesting immediate support for his team . "
Do n't Miss Michael Murphy Medal of Honor page
The report said that at one point Murphy was hit in the back and dropped the handset but retrieved it and completed his call , even saying " thank you " at the end of his transmission .
Luttrell witnessed Murphy 's heroism .
" I looked back up at Mikey and he took two rounds to the back and sat back up , hung up the phone .
...
That was the last time I saw him . "
The day turned out to be the U.S. 's deadliest in Afghanistan and the worst loss of life for the SEALs since World War II .
Beyond the three SEALs on the ground , a Chinook helicopter carrying reinforcements was shot down while trying to reach the team , killing eight more SEALs and eight members of an Army special operations unit .
Luttrell was blasted over a ridge by a rocket - propelled grenade and knocked unconscious , according to the report .
Despite suffering a bullet wound to one leg , shrapnel wounds in both legs and three cracked vertebrae , he managed to crawl away from the fight .
He was rescued by local villagers who refused demands by the Taliban to turn him over and later got word to a Marine outpost .
Murphy 's parents in Patchogue , New York , were soon notified by the Navy of their son's death .
They said what they heard of the firefight exemplified their son .
" He was very protective of other people and he always stuck up for the underdog , " Maureen Murphy said .
" Here is a man who had been shot in the stomach , and been fighting with this wound , gets shot in the back ... and then still has the presence of mind to say ' thank you , ' which was Michael , " Dan Murphy said .
" Michael was the politest person you would ever want to meet . "
The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government .
It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself " ... conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States . "

If you have any reservations about Congress granting immunity to telecommunications companies like AT&T for illegally spying on Americans , this segment from last night 's Countdown should leave little room for doubt -- they have , and continue to betray us and should be held accountable for their crimes .
Likening himself to a character from Orwell 's 1984 , retired AT&T technician and whistle blower , Mark Klein , tells Keith Olbermann about his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during which he pleaded with them not to grant immunity to the telcom companies .
Klein contends that his former employer is lying to the American people and that they were not only spying on overseas communications , but virtually ALL domestic internet and phone traffic -- and they have been doing it for years .
Olbermann : " In talking to Congress today what did you hear ?
Did you get the sense that anybody is ready to go after not just the telecom execs , but the government officials who ordered this ? "
Klein : " I could n't tell , I 'm not a politician and they play their cards close to the vest .
All I can do is emphasize again , that they 're copying everything , this is a violation of the Constitution , it 's domestic traffic , it 's phone calls as well as e-mail and something should be done to stop it and Congress should not kill the judicial process . "
Update :
In yesterday 's New York Times , Senator Russ Feingold points out the obvious : " Telecom companies that cooperate with a government wiretap request are already immune from lawsuits , as long as they get a court order or a certification from the attorney general that the wiretap follows all applicable statutes . "
ACLU Praises Ruling as Major Civil Liberties Victory for Young Adults
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DETROIT -
In a ruling that will impact young adults throughout the state , a federal judge ruled that Bay City police may no longer force pedestrians under age 21 to take a Breathalyzer test without obtaining a search warrant , the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan announced today .
" This is a tremendous victory for the civil liberties of young adults , " said Kary Moss , Executive Director of the ACLU of Michigan .
" For years , police officers throughout Michigan have violated the rights of countless college students and others under the age of 21 by forcing them to submit to breathalyzers without a warrant .
We expect other law enforcement jurisdictions to heed the Bay City ruling . "
The case stems from an encounter involving Jamie Spencer , a Bay City resident , with the Bay City police in August 2001 , when she was 19 years old .
She , her husband and some friends were leaving a city park after rollerblading , when two officers approached Mrs. Spencer and demanded that she blow into a Breathalyzer machine .
She told the officers that she had not been drinking and did not want to take the test .
However , when the officers threatened her with a $ 100 fine , she felt she had no choice .
The test indicated that she had not been drinking .
" Even though I had done nothing wrong , the police invaded my privacy , " said Mrs. Spencer .
" I am glad that because of this decision , the police will not harass innocent young people in the future by forcing them into such a demeaning situation . "
In a 23 - page opinion , U.S. District Court Judge David M. Lawson struck down the Bay City ordinance that makes it illegal for people under age 21 to refuse to consent to a Breathalyzer test .
The ruling does not apply to drivers of motor vehicles .
Judge Lawson held that the ordinance violates the Fourth Amendment because ( 1 ) a breath test is a search , ( 2 ) the Fourth Amendment ordinarily prohibits searches without search warrants , and ( 3 ) no exceptions to the search warrant requirement apply .
Judge Lawson further emphasized that " the right to be left alone in public places ranks high on the hierarchy of entitlements that citizens in a free society have come to expect - at least in the context of citizen - police encounters . "
Since the Bay City ordinance is identical to a statewide law , the decision will bring welcome relief to college students across the state , according to Jonathan Knapp , president of the Central Michigan University Chapter of the ACLU .
" It is a well - known and common procedure on campuses across the state for the police to stop students walking across campus on weekend nights and force them to take Breathalyzers whether or not they have been drinking , " said Knapp .
" This is a great student rights decision . "
David Moran , an ACLU cooperating attorney , noted that Michigan is the only state in the nation to make it illegal for a minor walking down the street to refuse a Breathalyzer test when the police do not have a search warrant .
" We are gratified that the federal court has recognized that the state cannot take away the privacy rights of people just because they are under 21 . "
In addition to Moran , Mrs. Spencer is represented by Michael J. Steinberg , Legal Director of the ACLU of Michigan and William T. Street , a volunteer ACLU lawyer from Saginaw .

American politics is n't just theatre ; it 's dinner theatre , on par with a Medieval Times franchise .
It can put on a decent show : the way the white and black knights joust you'd think they meant it , and that the guy who falls off his horse really gets hurt and the champion wins something of meaning .
Voters are " treated like royalty " - every man a king ! - but their crowns are made of tissue paper .
And while the menu is all you can eat , all you can order is bullshit .
This is the warning I 've been repeating for years :
You do not want to try to reach the exit as millions of other people attempt to do the same thing .
Waiting for clarity is not often rewarded .
event
The tone of the emails I 've been receiving has changed dramatically over the past several days .
People are now terrified about the events unfolding inside the U.S. Panic is setting in , and for some silly reason , people think this upcoming election holds the key to the future .
Guys , wake the F up .
This Republican / Democrat thing is beyond embarrassing .
Please understand : THERE ARE NO POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THE U.S. IS FACING .
The outcome of this election is meaningless , one way or the other .
The more you keep grasping for glimmers of hope within the political system , the worse off you will be .
The appearance of choice , as a mechanism of control , has served the elite well for several decades in the U.S. Appearances broke down after the 2000 Presidential election .
And the 2004 Presidential election ...
Excuse me while I spit out the window just thinking about the candidates .
Never mind the endemic vote fraud .
Will a big Democratic win calm people down ?
Maybe that 's what They 'll allow .
It might ease the panic , so the ship of fools can sail on for another few months .
If They were smart , that 's what They 'd do .
Hell , maybe it'll be Hillary in 2008 , with the ability to designate any American as an enemy combatant ...
Sure .
Tell me another one .
But then again , maybe not .
Maybe it 's time to rub your noses in the Freedom .
I hate to be making so many Magic 8 Ball references lately , but that 's what the U.S. political system has become .
Believe in that thing and it will give you the answers you 're looking for .
You 're totally doomed and clueless , but your belief in the Magic 8 Ball is somehow comforting .
By all means , vote .
Jeff Wells recently wrote
So , let 's dispence with the bullshit about U.S. elections .
What varies , with the passage of time , is the number of people who get it .
As more people get it , the more dangerous the situation becomes .
The Machine will destroy itself rather than lose control .
As the appearance of choice fails to serve as an effective mechanism of control , more overt mechanisms of control , which have been under construction for years , will be used .
Nothing that is happening now should come as a surprise to any of you .
The entire program has been spelled out on Cryptogon and other sites --- never mind the thousands of books --- for years .
The collapse of the U.S. into overt fascism is following a fairly predictable series of events .
While the exact timetable is more difficult to nail down , when the state begins to require citizens to obtain " CLEARANCE " in order to leave , you 've pretty much arrived at the end of the line .
And then what ?
What excuses will be made ?
When soldiers are breaking down your door , will you point your TV remote control at them and try to change the channel ?
Tell them you voted ?
Tell them you paid your taxes ?
Ask them to please stay away from your daughter , because she 's not a terrorist ?
This has all happened before ( it 's happening now , actually , in many parts of the world , especially where U.S. influence is pervasive ) .
What 's different is that the technologies of political control have vastly increased the strength of the iron fist .
The options are : get out of the way of that thing , to the best of your ability , or be crushed by the grip of it around your neck .
Some might try to attack it directly , but that option should be seen as a creative form of suicide .
( Oh yeah , you can attempt to join the ranks of the regime . )
Many Cryptogon readers think that they 're going to hedge their bets , and stay put for as long as possible , before making a strategic move .
I like all of you .
I love some of you , as you are my family members and closest friends , but please hear me :
To know what 's coming and to think that you will be able to time your exit properly is the height of folly .
It is not easy to pull off a strategic move under " normal " circumstances .
Having made a strategic move , I 'm in a position to speak on this matter with authority .
The path is lined with red tape and bullshit under the best of circumstances .
And the window of opportunity is closing with each passing day .
To think that you will be able to do it after an , when borders are closed , or mostly closed , when internal passports may be required to travel across state lines , when the fascists must approve your exit plans , when your cash is not convertible into foreign currencies or maybe even worthless ... Friends and family , you 're in a clinical state of denial .
Let 's fast forward a week , a month or a year from today ; nobody knows exactly when it will happen ...
When you could have made it to a better place , with relative ease , you sat by and waited , wished and hoped it would n't come to this .
And now , the freeways are jammed , the airports are closed and soldiers are checking your " papers . "
Some number of people are being loaded onto trucks , but you can't really see past the spotlights shining at you from the checkpoint up ahead ...
" Oh , God , why did I wait for it to come to this ? " some of you will think as you look at your spouse and children , who will be looking back at you , wondering the same thing .
Introduction The Better String Library is an abstraction of a string data type which is superior to the C library char buffer string type , or C++'s std:: string .
Among the features achieved are : Substantial mitigation of buffer overflow / overrun problems and other failures that result from erroneous usage of the common C string library functions
Significantly simplified string manipulation
High performance interoperability with other source / libraries which expect ' \0 ' terminated char buffers
Improved overall performance of common string operations
Functional equivalency with other more modern languages
The library is totally stand alone , portable ( known to work with gcc / g++ , MSVC ++ , Intel C++ , WATCOM C/C++ , Turbo C , Borland C++ , IBM 's native CC compiler on Windows , Linux and Mac OS X ) , high performance , easy to use and is not part of some other collection of data structures .
Even the file I/ O functions are totally abstracted ( so that other stream - like mechanisms , like sockets , can be used . )
Nevertheless , it is adequate as a complete replacement of the C string library for string manipulation in any C program .
The library includes a robust C++ wrapper that uses overloaded operators , rich constructors , exceptions , stream I/O and STL to make the CBString struct a natural and powerful string abstraction with more functionality and higher performance than std:: string .
Bstrlib is stable , well tested and suitable for any software production environment .

The Bible is full of all kinds of interesting lore .
Most notably are the various descriptions of monsters and mythical creatures ...
Cockatrice
( Etymology : First attested 1382 , from Old French cocatris , from Late Latin calcātrīx ( " she who treads upon something " ) , from Latin calcō ( " tread " ) , from calx ( " heel , hoof " ) . )
A cockatrice is a serpent , hatched from a cock 's egg , that can kill with a glance .
They are rare nowadays .
- Jermiah 8:17 :
" For , behold , I will send serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the LORD . "
- isaiah 11:8 :
" And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den . "
- isaiah 59:5 :
" They hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper . "
- isaiah 14:29 :
" Rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent . "
Dinosaurs
( Etymology : From Ancient Greek δειν ό ς ( deinos ) , " terrible , awesome , mighty " ) + σ αῦρος ( sauros ) , " lizard " ) . )
The bible calls them " Behemoths " , but it sure sounds like a Dinosaur .
This is the passage creationists use to claim that man and Dinosaurs co-existed , for more details see Was Behemoth a Dinosaur ? :
- Job 40 :
15 - 24 Behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly .
He moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together .
His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
He lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed , and fens .
The shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the brook compass him about .
Behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth .
He taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
Dragons
( Etymology : From Old French dragon , from Latin dracō , from Ancient Greek δράκων ( drakōn ) , " a serpent of huge size , a python , a dragon " ) , probably from δρακεῖν ( drakein ) , aorist active infinitive of δέρκομαι ( derkomai ) , " I see clearly " ) . )
These verses falsely predict that Babylon will never again be inhabited and that Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there .
- Isaiah 13:21 - 22 :
" But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and SATYRS shall dance there .
And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and DRAGONS in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged . "
Satyr
( Etymology : Ancient Greek Σάτυροι , Satyroi )
A satyr is a Greek mythological creature , that is half man on the top and half goat on the botom with ears and horns from the goat .
It is a very lustful creature , and is often portrayed carrying a flute of some sort .
Satyrs make an appearance two times in the bible :
- Isiah 13:21 :
But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there .
- Isiah 34:14 :
The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
Sea Monsters
The Leviathan is a huge sea monster ( Psalm 74:13 - 14 ; Job 41 ; Isaiah 27:1 ) .
( Etymology : From Hebrew ( Biblical and Modern ) לִוְיָתָן ( " whale " ) . )
The word " Leviathan " appears five places in the Bible :
Book of Job 3:8
" May those who curse days curse that day , those who are ready to rouse Leviathan " ; NIV Book of Job 41:1 - 34 : " Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ?
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?...
He beholdeth all high things : he is a king over all the children of pride . "
KJV ( quoted 1 and 34 only ) Psalms 74:14 : " Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces , and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness . "
KJV Psalms 104:24,25 : " O LORD , how manifold are thy works !
in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
So is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and great beasts . "
KJV ; Isaiah 27:1 : " In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea . "
KJV
This creature is also mentioned twice in the Talmud : Avoda Zara ( 3 b ) , Moed Katan ( 25 b )
Job 41 goes into detail on the monster :
- Job 41 :
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ?
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
Canst thou put an hook into his nose ?
or bore his jaw through with a thorn ?
Will he make many supplications unto thee ?
will he speak soft words unto thee ?
... Behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
None is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
... His scales are his pride , shut up together as with a close seal .
One is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
They are joined one to another , they stick together , that they can not be sundered .
By his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out .
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
In his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
The flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they can not be moved .
His heart is as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold : the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon .
He esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
The arrow cannot make him flee : slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
Darts are counted as stubble : he laugheth at the shaking of a spear .
Sharp stones are under him : he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire .
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
He maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
He beholdeth all high things : he is a king over all the children of pride .
Unicorns
( Etymology : Latin ūnicornis , from unus : one + cornu - u : horn . )
Unicorns are mentioned no less than nine times in the Bible ( Numbers 23:22 , Numbers 24:8 , Deuteronomy 33:17 , Job 39:9 - 10 , Psalms 22:21 , Psalms 29:6 , Psalms 92:10 , Isaiah 34:7 ) .
Most notably the King James Version .
More modern translations have replaced the unicorn with " wild ox " .
Others speculate ancient unicorns may have been rhinoceros .
- Numbers 23:22 :
God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
KJV
Beast With Seven Heads
Take all the horror scripts from hollywood , put them in a blender and you have the Book of Revelation .
It contains some pretty radical monsters such as this 10 - horned , 7 - headed beast :
- Revelation 17:3 :
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
The beast apparently also has quite the fetish for headgear :
- Revelation 13:1 :
And I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
Zombies
What could be more fun than Zombies for Jesus !
- Matthew 27:52 -53 :
" And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose , And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many . "
Flying / fiery serpents
- isaiah 14:29 :
" Rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent . "
- isaiah 30:6 :
" The burden of the beasts of the south : into the land of trouble and anguish , from whence come the young and old lion , the viper and fiery flying serpent , they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses , and their treasures upon the bunches of camels , to a people that shall not profit them . "
- numbers 21:6 :
" And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died . "
Extra-Terrestrials
- 1 Peter 2:11 :
" Dear friends , I urge you , as aliens and strangers to this world . "
- psalm 94:6 :
" Slay the widow and the alien . "
NOTE : Some believe " alien " may be a synonym for " immigrant " .
Additional research on the original language sources may be necessary to gather more details .

On my first day of my new position as civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt my previous employer , the Stanford Center for Internet and Society , a fantastic victory .
The court 's ruling in Golan v. Gonzales is also a triumph for the First Amendment and for the overwhelming majority of creators .
In Golan , we challenged section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act , or URAA , which removed thousands of books , films and musical compositions from the public domain .
We argued that this violated the First Amendment because people could no longer use these works for their own creative expression .
As an example , our community orchestra and conductor clients could no longer freely play compositions to which they had purchased the sheet music and learned , and our film collector and preservationist clients could no longer show or make restored copies of films in their archives .
Our argument depended on the case of Eldred v. Ashcroft .
In Eldred , the Supreme Court affirmed Congress ' 20 - year extension of already - existing copyrights because it found a long history of copyright extensions .
But not all copyright laws are immune from review .
Copyright regulates speech by limiting what subsequent speakers can do with a creative work .
If Congress changes copyright 's " traditional contours , " courts must conduct a more searching First Amendment review to ensure that those changes do not overly burden free expression in an unjustified manner .
In Golan , we argued that removing works from the public domain , as the URAA did , was a change in the traditional contours of the law .
The government defended the URAA arguing that copyright laws triggered First Amendment concerns only if Congress either limited fair use or began to regulate ideas rather than just modes of expressing those ideas .
We successfully argued that those two limits on copyright protection were some but not the only ways in which traditional copyright law harmonizes with constitutional free - speech protections , and that other changes – including depredation of the public domain – were equally unacceptable .
Having agreed with our position that there are more than two " traditional contours " and that an inviolate public domain is one of them , the 10th Circuit sent the Golan case back to the District Court to determine whether the URAA goes too far in burdening speech .
Stanford CIS has another case about the constitutional limits of copyright protection , Kahle v. Gonzales , which we lost in the 9th Circuit and are now seeking a review of before the Supreme Court .
Both Golan and Kahle seek to define what " traditional contours " means .
In Kahle , the issue is Congress ' change from a self - selecting system of copyright , where people had to register and give notice to indicate that they wanted copyright protection , to an indiscriminate system where every napkin doodle is copyrighted and people are forced to license or dedicate their works to the public domain , or make some other indication that they do not want copyright protection .
This change from an opt - in to an opt - out system has produced generations of " orphan works " – creative works that are still under copyright , but for which owners are absent or prohibitively expensive to find .
People who want to make use of an orphan work cannot locate the copyright owner to obtain permission .
These would - be creators ' fear that someone will appear years later alleging copyright infringement chills new creative uses .
The 10th Circuit 's decision in Golan should make it more likely that the Supreme Court will grant a review and hear the Kahle case , because there is now a split between two federal circuit courts regarding the First Amendment 's application to Congress ' copyright lawmaking .
The prospect of arguing this issue before the Supreme Court is both thrilling and an immense responsibility .
Our hope is that the Supreme Court affirms its holding in Eldred that Congress , in considering copyright legislation , must take free speech concerns to heart , and that when copyright laws deviate from tradition , courts must actively ensure that these new laws do not overly burden free speech .
Congress and creators also need guidance from the Supreme Court about how much breathing room we are entitled to in a digital world , where every transmission is a copy and yet everyone can be a speaker or an artist .
For now , the First Amendment is alive and well in the 10th Circuit .

The Sales and Marketing manager of a Californian Porsche dealership is on the hunt for a new job .
Glen Fergusson had the bright spark idea of offering a free Porsche when you bought one from the dealership .
They ended up selling a whopping 18 in the first hour of opening but clearly made some serious losses on the sales .
" I admit I did n't really do the numbers properly on this one " said Glen who told reporters that he had " seen the concept work really well for coffee stores "
Bruce Stepper was one of the lucky few to take advantage of the promo and went on to sell the second Porsche on EBay .
This meant that he paid a measley $ 5,000 for his Porsche 911 .
Another lucky buyer took out a low income finance plan offered by the dealership and ended up selling both the cars and keeping a tidy $ 120,000 in profit .
Yup , Glen was also the genius who came up with that finance plan !
" I have never really been too good at Math and I was sure the whole time we were making money - I was initially blown away by the amount of cars we were selling in that first hour .
I had seen the " buy one get one free card " work extremely well for the new coffee shop down the road and thought what a great idea I will try it here . "

GNU RCS
The Revision Control System ( RCS ) manages multiple revisions of files .
RCS automates the storing , retrieval , logging , identification , and merging of revisions .
RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently , including source code , programs , documentation , graphics , papers , and form letters .
RCS was first developed by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University in the early 1980s -- paper : RCS : A System for Version Control ( 1991 ) ( troff , PostScript , PDF ) .
See also the Purdue RCS Homepage .
RCS design is an improvement from its predecessor Source Code Control System ( SCCS ) ( see GNU CSSC ) .
The improvements include an easier user interface and improved storage of versions for faster retrieval .
RCS improves performance by storing an entire copy of the most recent version and then stores reverse differences ( called " deltas " ) .
RCS uses GNU Diffutils to find the differences between versions .

At noon on January 20 , 2009 , George W. Bush will become a former president of the United States .
Assuming they live , he will join former presidents Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton and his father in a unique fraternity .
He will be 62 .
He is a relatively young man in good physical health .
He will be capable of a vigorous life as a former president .
He is not considered an intellectual .
What will he do for the next three decades ?
In interviews by author Robert Draper for his book “ Dead Certain , ” President Bush has been non-commital about life after the White House : “ I can just envision getting in the car , getting bored , going down to the ranch , â€ the president said .
Other than that , Mr. Bush said , he plans to “ replenish the olâ€™ coffers . ”
Perhaps he was kidding .
President Bush wo n’t be destitute upon leaving office :
His assets are estimated at between $ 8 million and $ 20 million ( and his daughters are out of college ) .
Moreover , since the 1950s , when it was clear that Harry Truman could not afford even an office staff , the federal government has taken care of former presidents .
Mr. Bush will receive an annual pension of $ 186,000 , travel funds , mailing privileges , Secret Service protection , office space , staff , stationery and transition expenses .
Presidents can make large sums as former presidents .
President Reagan was not so enfeebled by illness to pass up $ 2 million for two speeches in Japan after leaving office .
President Nixon received $ 600,000 for his interviews with David Frost and $ 2.3 million for his memoirs .
President Ford ’s income reached $ 1 million a year after he left the presidency .
Estimates of speaking fees for President George H.W. Bush reach $ 100,000 .
President Clinton accepted speaking fees up to $ 350,000 , earning nearly $ 40 million in speaking fees over the past six years .
Much of that has gone to his private foundation , but his financial turnaround since leaving office deeply in debt is remarkable .
President Ford ’s post - office years were spent in comparative quiet .
He lent his name and knowledge for fundraising and teaching to the University of Michigan , his alma mater .
President Nixon went into literal exile , then sought to rehabilitate his reputation , mostly through writing 10 books , including his memoirs , and traveling abroad .
Presidents sought his advice on foreign policy .
Sadly , Alzheimer ’s disease shortened the time that President Reagan had to establish his post - presidential record .
Both Presidents Carter , who won the Nobel Peace Prize , and Clinton , who has raised millions for initiatives on AIDS , health and climate change , have built admirable records of public service on a global scale as well as written books .
All presidents , however , have tried to influence how history views them .
Hence the memoirs and other books .
And they all raised money for presidential libraries , one of their chief means of verifying or recasting their historical records .
It ’s likely that President Bush ’s advisers in and out of the White House have long been thinking about his and their historical records .
The president will leave office with perhaps the lowest approval rating in modern history .
A war he began will still be raging â€ ” as it was for President Johnson when he left office .
President Bush can count on his political opponents ( and perhaps some White House insiders ) to write numerous examinations of his presidency with most likely to be highly critical .
What will President Bush do ?
As a former president not known for excellence in writing , how will his presidential memoirs be produced ?
If he produces an “ as told to ” series of books , will he release the presidential documents that verify his version of history ?
Will he adopt a social agenda , as Presidents Carter and Clinton have , for which he will advocate and fundraise ?
Much of his presidency has had the adjective “ faith - based ” in front of it .
To what extent will he demonstrate that in his post - presidential words and deeds ?
President Bush will have wielded unprecedented power in the United States for eight years .
How will he handle not having such power ?
What role , if any , will he seek to play â€ ” or be permitted to play â€ ” in the Republican Party ?
Or will he become a post - presidential Madonna â€ “ continually re-inventing himself under the guidance of Karl Rove and Karen Hughes ?
Frankly , my dear , I do n’t give a damn .
SAN FRANCISCO – I feel like the hoodlum Alex in Stanley Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange :
My head is held steady by a chin strap , while two technicians grease my scalp with conductive gel and slip on a cap bristling with electrodes .
I 'm about to have my brain scrambled – electrically – in the name of medical science .
Scientists are going to knock out regions of my brain while I perform a memory test .
" We 're ready to do some zapping ! " one of the technicians says excitedly .
I 'm a guinea pig in a brain - scan experiment conceived by neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley , who is testing how memory changes with age .
The " zapping " induces seizures in some subjects and cures depression in others .
I do n't know what it will do to me , but I 'm about to find out .
Brain experiments are a dime a dozen these days .
But Gazzaley 's experiment is the first to combine three brain - scan technologies in one study : functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , electroencephalography ( EEG ) and transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , which will knock out some of my memory circuits .
" Gazzaley 's research is cutting edge , " says Suzanne Corkin , an MIT neuroscientist .
" Most cognitive neuroscience labs do not have the equipment and technical knowledge to apply all three methods . "
Gazzaley directs the new imaging center here at the University of California , San Francisco 's Mission Bay campus .
He 's testing a theory that we forget things with age because we remember too much .
We can't find the important stuff among all the junk .
He hopes to identify and isolate the precise neural networks that determine how we remember some things and ignore others .
The experiment could provide important insight into a wide range of age - related memory conditions , including attention deficit disorder and obsessive - compulsive disorder and aging .
" We 'll learn how the young brain works , how this changes through aging , and maybe guide new therapy programs to improve these abilities as they change with age , " explains Gazzaley , a 38 - year - old New York City native .
Gazzaley is studying the brains of 40 volunteers : 20 younger subjects who – like me – are between 18 and 35 , and 20 older adults between 69 and 75 .
The study is split into two phases : First , to locate the neural memory circuits , Gazzaley uses fMRI , a neuroimaging technology that detects blood flow .
During a battery of memory tests , the technology indicates which parts of my brain are active while I try to remember and ignore certain information .
In phase two of the study , he applies EEG to record my brain 's electrical activity , while simultaneously scrambling my memory circuits using TMS , which suppresses neuron activity with rapidly changing magnetic fields .
If I do comparatively poorly on the test while one part of my brain is scrambled , it 's likely those circuits contributed to memory function .
So , in phase one , I lie on a cold white plank inside a giant , donut - shaped Siemens Tesla fMRI scanner .
The room is dark .
Giant headphones , restraining foam pads and strict orders not to move have me quite literally in a bind .
A mirror , situated at a slant directly above my head , reflects a flat screen showing a short film about pink flamingos .
As the machine pulsates steadily , a woman 's voice announces through the intercom : " We 're starting . "
A loud beeping noise like an emergency alarm pervades the room .
The words " GET READY " appear in bright green letters across the screen .
My anxiety is replaced with determination : I want to beat this brain game .
Black - and - white photographs of grim faces and nature scenes ( many of which Gazzaley took himself ) flash before me .
I click the right button for photos I 've seen before and the left button for the ones that I do n't remember seeing .
I 'm instructed to either ignore faces or scenes .
It seems simple , but it can be confusing .
An hour and 40 minutes later , I leave the scanner feeling cold and stiff .
Its magnetic field – 3,000 times stronger than the earth 's – made me drowsy .
A research assistant shows me a picture of my brain ( " It looks pretty normal " ) , and gives me $ 60 for participating in the trial .
" The fMRI generates maps of my brain such as this one , which shows the regions I used during a memory game I played as part of the trial . "
Image : University of California , San FranciscoPhase two : A week later , a man is measuring my head .
Then he draws a pink dot on my forehead and brushes my hair .
" I am abrading your scalp so we can get a better connection , " he explains .
He 's referring to the 64 - channel EEG cap that will record my brain 's electrical activity .
On my right , a computer screen displays my brain from five different angles .
Different areas of it are colored purple , yellow , green and red .
Sensors near my eyes and ears are equipped with amplifiers that connect through fiber - optic wires to a digital box where analog brain signals are digitized using software called Analyzer ( and some proprietary scripts ) .
I don plastic goggles ( festooned with what appear to be small disco balls ) , which triangulate my exact position .
Once I 'm wired in , the technician takes a giant blue gadget that looks like the head of a vacuum cleaner – the TMS – and points it at my head .
Using a method called fMRI - guided stereotactic localization , Gazzaley 's researchers scramble my prefrontal cortex to see how I do during a battery of memory tests without access to some of my neural networks .
Four hours later , I finally leave the nondescript UCSF office , this time feeling groggy and crampy .
I do n't know if it 's from sitting in that uncomfortable contraption or from the brain scrambling .
Another week later , Gazzaley shows me a simple bar chart on his desktop .
" As you get older , you have a harder time ignoring information , " he explains .
" Your data shows that you 're really good at ignoring and remembering . "
Another chart mapping the performance of older people at memory tests shows they did n't do as well .
" The old have a problem with this .
They do n't modulate as much ... they have a harder time ignoring information . "
With the myriad of variables that can influence the results – tiredness , machine noise , motivation , slippery fingers – it's impossible to tell whether I truly have a better short - term memory than the next guinea pig my age .
But Gazzaley hopes that when he has enough data to publish , he 'll be able to say something meaningful about memory .
Corkin thinks he's on the right track – and that we 'll likely see more studies combining various brain - scan technologies .
" Multimodal experiments in humans will expand knowledge in all cognitive domains , " she says .
" These kinds of experiments are highly appealing to funding agencies and faculty search committees . "
Centerton , Arkansas mayor Ken Williams resigned last week after , er , an injection of " truth serum " made him realize that he was , um , brainwashed by satanists in the 1970s .
Apparently , Williams also remembered that he is actually Don LaRose , a former preacher in Indiana who was married with two kids .
In 1980 , he ran away and changed his identity to escape the unspecified satanists .
Williams 's secret came out when his former family tracked him down through a Web site that , stay with me here , Williams himself runs about LaRose 's disappearance .
From 4029tv.com :
" I had no choice .
The choice was to watch my family killed before my eyes or go with these people , and I chose instead to run , " Williams said .
He would n't explain from who he was running , saying only that he had been brainwashed .
" I had multiple shock treatments , " Williams said .
" It took five years to get my memory back … "
Williams said his current wife is standing by him and the two of them want to continue living in Centerton .
He said he plans to continue living as Ken Williams .
Also , his resignation was signed with two names , he said .

Hopes dwindle for closing Guantanamo
" The U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , not long ago appeared headed for closure , " The LA Times reports .
" But the latest attempt to shut it down is facing collapse :
The detention facility has been embraced by many Republicans as a potent political symbol in their quest to seize the terrorism issue ahead of next year 's elections . "
Sen .
Chuck Hagel , one of the few Republicans calling for the closure of the Guantanamo camp explained , " The Republican Party has won two elections on the issue of fear and terrorism .
[ It 's ] going to try again . "
Excerpts from the LA Times article follow :
#
GOP presidential candidates have jockeyed to demonstrate their support for the prison .
One candidate has called for doubling its use .
Another praised the menu and health plan offered to detainees .
The Senate Republican leader has accused Democrats of wanting to move terrorists " into American communities . "
And the president , who last year told German television that he " would like to end Guantanamo , " is now threatening to veto any move to " micromanage the detention of enemy combatants . "

“ Roughly a third of patients will remain cancer free for a long time , ” Dr. Choti said .
“ About half will still be alive after five years .
In a minority , there ’s a long - term cure .
In some , we turn it into a chronic disease , if you will .
She may recur , and we might be able to reoperate .
We can prolong survival significantly . ”
A few days after surgery , Ms. Pasqualetto was walking laps around the hospital corridors , thinking about things she had not allowed herself to consider , plans she had not dared to make , like whether Isabel would someday like to have a horse .
“ I ca n’t believe it , ” she said .
“ This is pretty exciting . ”
But weeks later , at home again , she found herself back in the trenches , unsure of what the next step in her care would be .
Her oncologist refused to see her until he spoke with the surgeon , and yet neither of them had called the other .
Meanwhile , she was trying to decipher a worrisome report indicating that a CT scan had found minute lesions on her spleen .
“ It ’s like I ’m flapping in the wind , ” she said .
Far From Typical
Karen Pasqualetto is exceptional not only for her determination and confidence in dealing with problems that would intimidate many other people , but also for her financial wherewithal .
So far her treatment has cost more than $ 400,000 , almost all of it covered by health insurance from Starbucks , where her husband works in disaster - response planning .
When she joined a cancer support group , she recalled , “ It was amazing to me the different experiences people were having based on what they could afford or who their provider was .

Proton believes it may have found a huge gap in the market
Proton is planning on teaming up with manufacturers in Iran and Turkey to create the unique vehicle .
The car could boast special features like a compass pointing to Mecca and a dedicated space to keep a copy of the Koran and a headscarf .
The idea came during a visit to the Middle East by a delegation of Malaysian politicians and businessmen .
Malaysian press reports say officials in Iran originally suggested the idea .
Safety features or fuel economy is one way of selling a car , but Proton thinks vehicles designed specifically for Muslims across the world represent a huge gap in the market .
Proton is the most dominant car on the streets here but the company has suffered recently after the government allowed more foreign cars to be imported .
The firm has been in talks recently with VW about a takeover by the German car giant .
Photograph by Darcy Padilla One Tuesday morning in early May , Michael Arrington was sound asleep in his bedroom in Atherton , California , when three men burst in .
Naturally , he was startled .
His first reaction , he recalls , was to tell them to " get the fuck out . "
But he quickly realized they meant no harm .
Clad in white business suits and speaking English with a Dutch accent , the apologetic men looked more like dandies on their way to a garden party than criminals .
They were , it turns out , overeager entrepreneurs from Amsterdam making the rounds of Silicon Valley big shots .
All they wanted — desperately — was to tell Arrington about their startup .
Over the last two years , Arrington has gotten used to entrepreneurs beating a path to his door .
( His cluttered office is in his rented house , just across the hall from the bedroom . )
Since he launched TechCrunch — an obsessively updated blog that chronicles Web startups — in 2005 , he 's been getting at least one unannounced visitor practically every week .
The drop-ins have become a distracting side effect of being among the most influential — and quite possibly the richest — business writers in Silicon Valley .
Indeed , he wonders if he 'll soon need to move .
" It 's hard , because in some ways I want to help these guys , " he says .
" But sometimes I feel like I need a little privacy , and I end up taking it out on whoever shows up . "
To the world outside Silicon Valley 's tight - knit community of startups , venture capitalists , and angel investors , TechCrunch is just another mouthy blog .
But to entrepreneurs in the white - hot consumer Internet boom — known to many as Web 2.0 — Arrington has become a power broker .
In April , after an onstage conversation with the director of Web technologies at Sun Microsystems , he looked like a groom in a receiving line :
For nearly an hour , the procession of entrepreneurs was 10 deep — all wanting to give Arrington a business card and an elevator pitch .
At a recent conference in San Francisco , Rodney Moses , founder and CEO of FatSecret , an online dieting site , followed Arrington around for about 30 minutes to secure 10 minutes with him .
" I had read that 's just what you do , " Moses says .
" You wait your turn . "
The wait can be worth it .
A positive 400 - word write - up on TechCrunch usually means a sudden bump in traffic and a major uptick in credibility among potential investors .
In early March , for example , the site profiled Scribd , a San Francisco startup that bills itself as a YouTube for documents .
CEO and cofounder Trip Adler says he had 10 calls from venture capitalists within 48 hours .
" We did n't want to raise venture capital initially , " Adler says .
" But the offers were at such good valuations that it finally did n't make sense not to do it . "
VCs and entrepreneurs read Arrington for the same reason they pay attention to any top journalist or columnist :
He 's smart , sourced up , and ahead of the curve .
" He has more information than any of us , " says David Hornik , a partner at August Capital and an occasional source for TechCrunch .
Arrington breaks news — like his scoop about Google buying YouTube or Yahoo's internal financial analysis of acquisition target Facebook — well ahead of the mainstream media .
One day he 'll review the pros and cons of all the online photo - editing sites , another day he 'll give you the blow - by - blow on why a company like Filmloop was sold , and on yet another day he 'll rant about how Silicon Valley could use a downturn .
And unlike most solo bloggers , Arrington has turned his passion into a tidy business .
Revenue from advertising , job listings , and sponsorships now totals about $ 200,000 a month .
He says he could have sold the operation last fall to a media company ( which he wo n't name ) for $ 8.5 million , and he may still .
But with a new top - flight CEO from Fox Interactive Media , roughly $ 1 million in the bank , and VCs lining up around the block to invest , Arrington talks like a man who wants to build an empire .
There are lots of blogs with more raw traffic — mostly celebrity or political sites like A Socialite 's Life and Daily Kos — but few with as much business influence .
Based on how many times other Web sites link to his content — an unscientific but accepted yardstick — Arrington is the world 's fourth - most - powerful blogger , according to Technorati .
Photograph by Darcy PadillaBy any measure , it has been a remarkable rise .
Two years ago , Arrington was a nobody — a former attorney and entrepreneur who , at 35 , looked as if he might never hit it big .
Now , without a journalism background or media - giant bankroll , he is mentioned in the same sentence as big - shot tech journalist Walt Mossberg and venture capitalists John Doerr and Michael Moritz , two of the guys who backed Google .
But Arrington is not only a self - made Silicon Valley rock star , he 's a textbook example of how to turn intelligence , tenacity , and arrogance into an Internet brand .
" He 's become an icon and done it in record time , " says angel investor Ron Conway .
While mainstream media outlets have been scrambling to figure out how to make blogging work , Arrington has emerged as a blogosphere phenom .
When he realized that no one was writing about the explosion in new consumer Internet companies , he began working 16 hours a day , seven days a week , to build an audience .
Originally a solo operator , he now has a half dozen writers and researchers pumping out three to 10 posts a day in addition to maintaining an opinion blog called CrunchNotes , a gadget blog called CrunchGear , a classified - ad site called CrunchJobs , and a portable - computing blog called MobileCrunch .
He says he has looked at , however briefly , more than 7,000 startups in two years and has written about nearly 500 of them .
" I saw a parade , " he says , " and I got in front of it . "
Arrington 's longtime associate and mentor , Keith Teare , says he 's never met anyone with as much drive as Arrington has .
He says it 's part of the reason Arrington has had so many employers — six ( not including part - time consulting gigs ) since graduating from Stanford Law School in 1995 .
Arrington always wanted more power and responsibility than his employers were prepared to give him , and he was never good at concealing his frustration — or any emotions , really — when he did n't get his way .
Arrington has ended many an argument with Teare by essentially declaring their friendship over .
" Keith , we 're done ! "
Arrington will say , only to apologize the following day .
Arrington 's impatience extends to the niceties of traditional journalism as well .
He sees no problem commingling the roles of entrepreneur , investor , publisher , reporter , and columnist .
Most journalists work hard not to write about friends .
They avoid covering people or companies that would create even the appearance of a conflict of interest .
Arrington does n't observe any such boundaries .
He 's better today at disclosing his conflicts than he was when he first started TechCrunch , but he 'll tell you that it is exactly those conflicts — and his refusal to pull punches in spite of them — that give him his competitive advantage .
" One of my friends , Tom Ball , is mad at me because I just trashed his startup , Jigsaw .
He 'll get over it — I hope , " Arrington says .
" I 'm an investor in a company called Daylife , and I shredded them . "
He 's also happy to use his friends as sources .
" When I broke the YouTube story , it 's only because I was online at 2 am , and a friend told me about it . "
__Arrington 's four - bedroom __ranch house sits on a 1 - acre plot in Atherton , which is ranked number two on the Forbes 2006 list of the nation 's richest zip codes .
But do n't be fooled ; he 's not living large .
The place is a rental — and it's a dump .
The kitchen looks like it has n't been redone since the ' 70s , and the beige shag carpet badly needs a shampoo .
One of the bedrooms is unfurnished save for a bed " where out - of - town entrepreneurs can stay if I like them , " Arrington says .
Another bedroom is outfitted with a desk and a futon on the floor .
His new CEO , Heather Harde , uses the room as an office during the day .
His research assistant , Nick Gonzalez , often crashes on the futon on weeknights .
Arrington 's office at the end of the hall looks like it belongs to a grad student : two computer monitors , papers stacked everywhere , a bottle of generic antacids .
The seeds of Arrington 's fascination with entrepreneurs were planted during his years as a young corporate attorney .
Not long after graduating from Stanford Law School in 1995 , he joined the Valley 's premier high tech law firm , Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati .
He specialized in helping companies prepare for initial public offerings .
He even coauthored a book on the subject .
He was , by his own account , " an exceptionally average attorney , " but he always loved hanging around startups .
" Entrepreneurs are crazy , " he says admiringly .
" It makes no sense to quit a job as a lawyer or an investment banker making $ 200,000 a year to take a one - in - ten chance of getting rich . "
In 1999 — at the peak of the Internet bubble — Arrington took just such a chance himself .
He left the law firm and went to work as head of business development at Real Names , a hot startup with an idea that seemed sexy at the time : Replace long , nonintuitive Internet addresses with simple , natural - language entries .
Teare was the Real Names founder and CEO , and Arrington was captivated by both the idea and the entrepreneur .
The hoped - for IPO riches never came .
Instead , the Internet boom went bust , taking Real Names down with it .
But instead of going back into law like a lot of boom - time washouts , Arrington jumped to another startup :
Achex , a service that promised to make online money transfers a snap .
That did n't work out very well either .
A little upstart called PayPal swooped in to dominate the sector .
The Achex founders ended up selling the payment architecture to a financial services firm for $ 32 million .
" I made enough to buy a Porsche .
Not much more , " he says .
He spent the next three years living in England , Denmark , Canada , and Los Angeles working for companies that bought and sold domain names .
It was easy work for a generous paycheck , and by the middle of 2004 , with a few hundred thousand in the bank , he rented a beach condo in LA and took nine months off .
" All I did was work out , surf , and watch movies , " he says .
" I watched almost every movie at Blockbuster — three a day for a year . "
But in 2005 , Teare told him he was starting an online - classified site called Edgeio .
The idea was to compete with craigs­list .
Arrington was intrigued , and the two again struck up a partnership .
The invention of TechCrunch happened pretty much by accident .
Arrington started blogging as a way to get up to speed on new business models .
" Remember , I was gone in 2004 when Flickr came out and Bloglines and all the cool new Web 2.0 stuff , " he says .
" So half my day was spent researching old startups .
I figured at the very least I 'd use it as a networking tool . "
Instead , TechCrunch became so popular , so fast , that Arrington quit Edgeio less than six months after he started working there .
To drum up excitement for the blog , he started hosting barbecues at his house in Atherton .
The first attracted only 20 guests .
But the second drew 100 , and the third 200 .
For the fourth , he put up a tent in his backyard , and more than 500 people came .
Before long his wild parties , which lasted into the wee hours , became a major stop on the Valley social circuit .
Of course , Arrington 's success is about more than partying like a frat boy and schmoozing like a Hollywood agent at a cast party .
With the exception of a three - week vacation ( during which he worked half - time ) at the end of 2006 , he says he has worked every day for two years straight .
He gets up at about 10 or 11 am , is at his desk 10 seconds later , and tends to the business side of his operation until early evening , seeing entrepreneurs , doing phone interviews , tracking the news of the day , and writing posts .
He 's often at parties or other events until 10 .
It 's typically not until 10 or 11 pm , when things quiet down , that he has time to think and write more thoughtful , analytical blog entries .
" I 've actually cut back , " he says .
" In the beginning , I got up every day and worked until I passed out .
I 've always been like that .
It 's probably why I 'm not married yet . "
Arrington relishes the rough - and - tumble of online feuds , comment wars , and one - upmanship .
And as an A - list blogger , he 's obliged to wade into controversy most every day .
Online and in person , he can be intimidating .
At 6 ' 4 " , he projects a persona somewhere between an aging linebacker and Tony Soprano — a large man always on the verge of losing his cool .
Indeed , a couple of his online tantrums have become legendary .
Last fall , for example , he was pilloried by journalists during a panel discussion in Washington , DC .
They trashed him for saying that a New York Times technology story was so flawed it could only have been " generated from back - scratching or lack of understanding of the product . "
He blasted back with a 1,200 - word rebuttal on his blog , ranting about how he'd been sandbagged and how the mainstream media was out to get him .
" It 's the first time I addressed ‘ real ' journalists head - on , " he wrote .
" And all I saw was fear , loathing , and disdain . "
The cluelessness and arrogance of major media outlets is a favorite talking point .
Arrington is especially enraged by journalists who follow in his wake without credi­ting him .
He keeps a mental list of such offenders .
" Two weeks ago , I broke the news that Microsoft and Tellme were in acquisition discussions , " he says .
" Yesterday CNET writes a post .
I know the writer reads TechCrunch .
She did n't even mention it . "
He vowed never to link to another CNET story , but he has since said that he was exaggerating .
Earlier this year , while attending DEMO , the annual tech conference for entrepreneurs , he announced on his blog that he planned to create a competing conference — this while he was sitting in the audience connected to the Wi-Fi network .
" They stole one of my writers , so I was pissed at them , " he says of the DEMO organizers .
He even lost his cool over this story .
In April , two of his friends — Jason Calacanis , who started Weblogs Inc. and sold it to AOL , and Dave Winer , who is considered the father of RSS — blogged about my emails to them seeking phone interviews .
Titling his post " With friends like these , " he scolded them for blowing a great opportunity for him .
He was worried that Wired would kill this story because of the advance publicity .
Arrington readily admits that he 's prone to excess and uncontrolled outbursts — of temper , partying , and work .
But it 's that very quality that has helped make him one of the most compelling Silicon Valley heavyweights in a long time .
He does n't deny that some of the fits of anger are for show , but he also insists that he 's just a passionate , emotional guy .
" I 'm human .
I 've put my entire life into this blog , and when I 'm attacked , it 's emotional , " he says .
" I 'm going to react sometimes — that 's just me .
Does that mean I 'm flawed ?
Yeah .
Does that mean I 'm not being 100 percent efficient about business ?
Yeah .
But it really hurts when people attack me , and I think people who do n't respond are n't very human or very interesting . "
To bring some balance to his enterprise , he hired Harde , a former mergers - and - acquisitions specialist for Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
He says she is as steady as he is volatile .
And if he 's going to make TechCrunch into the media empire he envisions , he knows that he needs someone like her to run things .
Already , he 's laying the groundwork for a whole stable of clued - in , hard - driving news blogs : MusicCrunch , SoftwareCrunch , TelecomCrunch .
" The goal is to have 15 to 20 sites 18 months from now , " he says .
He plans to hire popular bloggers and create a home­page with the best news from each site to draw readers .
From there , they could drill into each topic in more depth .
His aim is to become the premier technology news site on the Internet , one that goes head - to - head with CNET and potentially with other technology news sites , including Wired.com .
Arrington figures he can get by with just a few dozen employees .
" With 25 to 30 paid writers against CNET 's huge cost base , they wo n't be able to compete , " he says .
It 's a crapshoot , to be sure .
But there is some precedent for turning a string of blogs into a business success .
Calacanis sold his blog fiefdom two years ago for $ 25 million .
And based on pageviews , it 's estimated that Nick Denton 's Gawker Media — which includes Gawker , Lifehacker , Valleywag , Gizmodo , Wonkette , Defamer , and a half dozen other blogs — could fetch more than $ 100 million .
Arrington is clearly in that league , and he 's counting on Harde to help him win .
" If we need to make acquisitions , she can do that in her sleep , " he says .
But it 's one thing to be an opinionated entrepreneur with a platform .
It 's another for Arrington to replicate his investor - entrepreneur - journalist model at dozens of sister publications .
Some TechCrunch readers , like Reid Hoffman , founder and former CEO of Linkedin , believe that Arrington may need to decide whether he wants his new blogs to be stocked with journalists working from the outside or players working from the inside .
When you combine the two roles , Hoffman says , no one knows how to behave around you :
Are you a journalist or a power broker ?
Arrington says it 's a false dilemma .
He and his new bloggers can straddle this line forever , he says , as long as they disclose their conflicts .
" I strive to be fair and say only what I believe the truth to be .
But that 's where it ends , " he wrote last year in an 800 - word post on his companion blog , CrunchNotes .
" Human interaction is simply too complex to pretend that we are all objective . "
Like the capitalist he is , Arrington trusts the market to reward or punish him as it sees fit .
If readers and advertisers keep coming back — so far , so good — what 's the problem ?
And if the market shifts , expect to hear it from Arrington first .

Some elections are defined by the gap between the rich and the poor .
Others are defined by the gap between the left and the right .
But this election will be shaped by the gap within individual voters themselves  the gap between their private optimism and their public gloom .
American voters are generally happy with their own lives .
Eighty - six percent of Americans say they are content with their jobs , according to the General Social Survey .
Seventy - six percent of Americans say they are satisfied with their family income , according to a Pew Research Center survey .
Sixty - two percent of Americans expect their personal situation to get better over the next five years , according to a Harris Poll , compared with only 7 percent who expect it to get worse .
Researchers from Pew found that 65 percent of Americans are satisfied over all with their own lives  one of the highest rates of personal satisfaction in the world today .
On the other hand , Americans are overwhelmingly pessimistic about their public institutions .
That same Pew survey found that only 25 percent of Americans are satisfied with the state of their nation .
That 40 - point gap between private and public happiness is the fourth - largest gap in the world  behind only Israel , Mexico and Brazil .
THE Pentagon recently noted that China 's expanding military capabilities were a “ major factor ” in altering military balances in East Asia .
Since China 's military weakness was displayed in 1995 during the Taiwan Strait crisis , it has been busily deploying hundreds of short - range missiles on the coast opposite Taiwan .
It is also developing faster DF - 21 ( CSS - 5 ) medium - range ballistic missiles , which would be harder for Taiwan 's missile defences to deal with .
And it is sprucing up its nuclear arsenal .
Once , its strategic missiles could probably have been knocked out by America before launch .
Now it is deploying six road - mobile , faster - launching intercontinental DF - 31s .
It is also believed to be developing DF - 31As , which would reach any part of America , and submarine - carried ( so more concealable ) JL - 2s .
The Bungie - developed Halo 3 is designed to be hand - in - glove compatible with the Xbox 360 , right ?
A federal lawsuit filed against Microsoft and Bungie last week attempts to throw some serious doubt into the mix .
The suit alleges that Halo 3 " routinely , consistently , and systematically ' froze , ' ' crashed , ' or ' locked up . ' "
The suit then claims that these issues " disrupted game play , " which , if these issues are as terrible or widespread as the suit alleges , is an understatement .
The plaintiff , Randy Nunez , is seeking seeking class - action status along with $ 5 million in damages plus costs and attorneys ' fees .
The suit claims that " many consumers " have these issues , making their console " totally inoperable . "
The court papers cite " industry Internet web sites , weblogs , and message boards " to prove that this issue is a common one .
It also alleges that Microsoft and Bungie have " received numerous complaints " from consumers on their phone lines and service forums without admitting these alleged Halo 3 issues to the public .
It 's no secret that Microsoft has had trouble with the reliability of the Xbox 360 system .
The company has increased the length of its warranty multiple times , and the " red ring of death " has become something of an ongoing industry joke .
Robbie Bach , the president of Microsoft 's entertainment and devices division , has gone on record as saying that " the number of repairs to Xbox 360 consoles have been unacceptable to us . "
He went on to cite " general hardware failures " for these issues .
Microsoft announced a $ 1 billion initiative to repair defective systems and to increase the warranty of the units to three years .
While newer systems are expected to have better reliability , they have yet to be on the market long enough to tell if the hardware issues have been resolved , and , with many older units still in the hands of gamers , complaints about system death and issues are common .
While the Xbox 360 has a checkered past when it comes to hardware reliability , Microsoft has admitted the issues and paid dearly to fix them ; a class - action lawsuit asking for restitution over failed hardware does n't seem warranted as Microsoft has already put measures in place to replace faulty systems .
It 's possible that by alleging a specific — and incredibly popular — piece of software also causes the issue the plaintiff can say that Microsoft and Bungie have n't adequately dealt with the problems of the hardware and software combination .
Since Xbox 360 hardware issues are so widespread and Halo 3 sold in such huge numbers , as the suit points out , it 's relatively easy to point to many pieces of anecdotal evidence of gamers having hardware issues as they play Halo 3 for hours on end .
Having played many , many hours of Halo myself and having had multiple systems die on me since launch , I can say that while I share the frustration of suffering through system failures , I have yet to see or hear about a strong link between the Halo 3 software and hardware issues .
Microsoft did not immediately respond to our requests for comment .
Murray A. Straus , whose book with Richard Gelles and Suzanne Steinmetz Behind Closed Doors ( 1980 ) led to the first public awareness of the extent of domestic violence , in one sense created the " domestic violence movement . "
Their research was widely cited to justify the need for public action programs to help women .
But when these three researchers began to talk about woman - initiated violence , these former supporters turned hostile .
In this paper , Dr. Straus does an excellent job of stepping back from the conflict in which he has been embroiled for 20 years , to offer fascinating and brilliant insights as to what the conflict is about .
In a nutshell , service providers and feminist activists take a broad view of violence , as a symbol of male oppression of women .
Withholding money is seen as an act of violence , as is shouting or demeaning women .
Researchers concerned about family violence , on the other hand , take a narrower view of violence , limiting their focus to actual acts of physical violence .
The picture gets further confused when we see disparities between family conflict studies , on the one hand , and crime victimization surveys and police reports , on the other .
With all the " one hands " and " other hands " going back and forth , sometimes it appears that a shell game is going on , with groups selectively picking the definition of violence and incidence of incidents which best support their cause .
Dr. Straus does an excellent job of sorting out this shell game .
Dr. Straus opens with his observations of a short history of the controversy :
In the mid 1970s my colleagues and I made the disturbing discovery that women physically assaulted partners in marital , cohabiting , and dating relationships as often as men assaulted their partners .
This finding caused me and my former colleague Suzanne Steinmetz to be excommunicated as feminists .
Neither of us has accepted that sentence , but it remains in force .
So when Salman Rushdie was condemned to death for his heresy , we may have felt even more empathy than most people because we had also experienced many threats , including a bomb threat .
The vitriolic 20 - year controversy had largely subsided by 1997 .
There are a number of reasons the controversy subsided .
One reason is the overwhelming accumulation of evidence from more than a hundred studies showing approximately equal assault rates .
Another is the explosive growth of marital and family therapy from a family systems perspective which assumes mutual effects .
In addition , research by clinical psychologists such as O'Leary brought psychologists face to face with the assaults by both parties .
In November 1997 , however , the controversy was suddenly reignited by newspaper headlines declaring " Partners Unequal in Abuse " .
These headlines were based on findings from the " National Violence Against Women in America Survey " ( called the NVAW survey from here on ) .
The NVAW surveyed 8,000 women and 8,000 men representing 16,000 households .
The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control .
The NVAW study found that men physically assaulted their female partners at three times the rate at which women engaged in such behavior .
NOTE : Quotes are from a pre-publication version of the paper .
They have been edited to remove citations
The NVAW results differ from both " family conflict studies " and " crime studies . "
Straus cites Dr. Martin Fieberg 's analysis of 58 family conflict studies , all of which found that " ... women are as physically aggressive , or more aggressive , than men in their relationships …
The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 58,000 . "
Two - thirds of the studies that Straus himself tabulated showed that women initiated violence at a slightly higher rate .
Crime studies such as the National Crime Survey ( NCS ) , National Crime Victimization Study ( NCVS - a revision of the NCS ) , police statistics studies and National Violence Against Women in America ( NVAW ) study show that most incidents are by men .
Straus observes that what these crime studies have in common is " that they are presented to respondents as studies of crime , crime victimization , personal safety , injury , or violence , rather than as studies of family problems and conflicts . "
The differences in study outcomes , Straus states in the first part of his paper , are due to differences in the methodology of crime studies as compared to family conflict studies .
There are two significant differences : Family conflict studies show a much higher rate of assault .
Crime surveys show a much higher rate of injury .
One reason for this disparity is that assaults do not always lead to injury .
In fact , assaults legally do not even require body contact .
Crime surveys and police reports focus on injury , " violence " or threats to safety .
But a man , for example may not consider being slapped or kicked a " crime " or " threat to safety " even if it is an an assault .
Family conflict researchers focus on assault , whether or not injury occurs .
Strauss explains why : From a social policy perspective , despite the much lower probability of physical injury resulting from attacks by women , one of the main reasons why " minor " assaults by women are such an important problem is that they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men .
Assaults by women also help perpetuate the now implicit , but once explicit cultural norms that gave husbands the legal right to " physically chastise an errant wife . "
The legacy of that norm continues to make the marriage license a hitting license for both parties .
To end " wife beating , " it is essential for women to cease what may seem to be " harmless " slapping , kicking , or throwing things at a male partner who persists in some outrageous behavior or " wo n't listen to reason . "
Assaults by women also need to be a focus of social policy because of the harm to children from growing up in a violent household .
The link between partner violence and child behavior problems occurs not only when both partners are violent ( about half of families with partner assaults ) , but also when the assaults are committed exclusively by the male partner ( about a quarter of the cases ) , as well as when the assaults are committed exclusively by the female partner .
The most fundamental reason for giving attention to assaults per se , regardless of whether an injury occurs , is the intrinsic moral wrong of assaulting a partner .
Assaults by women are a crime and a serious social problem , just as it would be if men " only " slapped their wives or " only " slapped a fellow employee and produced no injury .
Although this is a fundamental reason for morally condemning women who " only " slap their partners , it should not be allowed to obscure the fact that assaults by men are likely to be even more morally reprehensible because they result in injury so much more often than women .
Nevertheless , an even greater wrong does not excuse the lesser wrong .
A society in which dating , cohabiting , and married partners never hit each other is not a more unrealistic goal than a society in which co-workers never hit each other , and is certainly no less a hallmark of a humane society .

What about the National Violence Against Women Survey ?
It used the same Conflict Tactics Scale that Strauss , Gelles and Steinmetz used in their family conflict studies .
But they used it in a different context : not a neutral " conflict occurs , has this happened to you , " but specifically in a " personal safety " context .
As Straus states , " I classified the National Violence Against Women ( NVAW ) study as a crime study because , it was presented to respondents as a study of ' personal safety ' and the term ' personal safety ' is used repeatedly .
The tone of the NVAW keeps threats , injuries , violence , and safety before the respondent at all times .
In this context , reporting that one 's partner has done any of the things asked about is the same as saying that the partner is a criminal or is about to injure them .
These and other aspects of the wording and questions ... may have ... led many respondents to perceive the NVAW as a study of crime , and therefore to restrict their reports to ' real crimes , ' thus excluding most instances of assault by a partner , and especially the ' harmless ' assaults by women .
These unintended demand characteristics probably account for the low prevalence rate found by the NVAW and for and 3 to 1 ratio of male to female offenders found by the NVAW .
To the extent that this occurred , the NVAW study does not contradict the large number of family conflict studies which show that women initiate and carry out assaults on male partners at about the same rate as men attack female partners . "
In the second part of the paper , Straus points out that the high rate of domestic assaults by women is inconsistent with cultural norms and beliefs which hold that women are much less violent than men , and inconsistent with data showing that in nonfamily situations , the rate of assault by women is only a fraction of the male assault rate .
Why the paradox ?
Straus developed a brilliantly concise table , which lays side by side cultural norms and beliefs which inhibit women from violence in public , contrasted with cultural norms and beliefs that facilitate violence by women in private .

· Men not likely to call the police
· Police not likely to arrest women
So women can get away with it even
more than men
In the paper , Straus does a concise job of elaborating on each of the factors in the table .
I found his discussion of criminal justice system involvement in domestic violence particularly interesting and insightful .
Traditionally , police and prosecutors have been reluctant to become involved in the crime of assault , regardless of whether it occurs outside the family or inside .
One of the reasons is that arrests and prosecutions for assault do not receive the public recognition of arresting , for example , a robber .
Moreover , assaults are typically in the form of " fights " involving both parties and , legally , both parties should be prosecuted regardless of who started it .
Under those circumstances , the probability of a case actually being tried , much less resulting in a conviction , are low relative to arrests for other crimes .
Such cases are regarded as " trouble . "
Police and prosecutors do not get much recognition , and may even be faulted if there are very many such cases in their record .
Outside the family , those principles apply to both men and women and the risk of police involvement is not greatly different for men and women .
For domestic assaults , both women and men as well as the police have been even more reluctant to involve the police .
As a result of the women 's movement , this has changed .
In most jurisdictions in the United States , state laws or police regulations now require or recommend arrest .
However , consistent with the greater injury rate for women , these laws and regulations may state or imply a male offender .
Although on average , when there is an injury , this is correct , it may deny male victims equal protection under the law .
In fact , there are a growing number of complaints that attempts by men to obtain police protection may result in the man being arrested .
That ironic situation is an additional reason that men are reluctant to call for police protection .
The main reason is one already discussed in explaining gender differences in police statistics : the injury rate is much lower when the offender is a woman and there is therefore less perceived need to call for protection .
The fact that assault is a legal and moral crime , regardless of whether there is injury is lost from view . '
Men are also less likely to call the police , even when there is injury , because , like women , they feel shame about disclosing family violence .
But for many men , the shame is compounded by the shame of not being able to keep their wives under control .
Among this group , a " real man " would be able to keep her under control .
Moreover , the police tend to share these same traditional gender role expectations .
This adds to the legal and regulatory presumption that the offender is a man .
As a result , the police are reluctant to arrest women for domestic assault .
Women know this .
That is , they know they are likely to be able to get away with it .
As in the case of other crimes , the probability of a woman assaulting her partner is strongly influenced by what she thinks she can get away with .

In a section Straus calls " A Sociology of Science Analysis of the Controversy , " he seeks to explain why the controversy has persisted despite the evidence , and is likely to continue .
The most fundamental reason , he asserts , is that the controversy is rooted in deep seated differences in the underlying moral agenda and professional roles of service providers and feminist activists , on the one hand , and family violence researchers , on the other .
Again , he lays out his concepts precisely in a table .
His paradigm for analysis centers on differences between definitions of " violence . "
Academics and researchers in family conflict use what he calls a " narrow definition " of violence which restricts violence to the act of assault , regardless of injury .
Service providers and feminist activists use a " broad definition " which defines violence to include multiple modes of maltreatment and the resulting injury .
He elaborates : A broad definition is essential for service providers .
It would be ridiculous and unethical if service providers such , as shelters , batterer treatment programs , or marital therapists , restricted their focus to physical assaults and ignored the psychological assaults , sexual coercion , subjugation , and economic situation of battered women , or the behavior of men who engage in these other forms of degradation .
On the other hand , those who use a narrow definition tend to be academics and researchers .
They tend to focus on investigating one specific type of maltreatment , such as physical assaults , because each type is complex and difficult to investigate .
Much can only be learned by a concentrated research focus .
I believe that most of those who focus on just one form of maltreatment also recognize the need for research that takes into consideration multiple modes of maltreatment , even though they themselves do not conduct that type of research .

Especially Assaults Experienced
as a " Real Crime " " Primary Prevention " of Physical
Violence of All Types , from Spanking
to Murder Each side , of course , uses the statistics which favor their cause .
Again , he elaborates :
The difference in emphasis on injury reflects the different needs of service providers and researchers .
For a service provider , it is essential to know if the assault resulted in injury because different steps are needed to deal with cases involving injury .
For a researcher who is investigating such things as the type of family or type of society in which partner assaults are most likely to occur , injury may not be a crucial issue because it can be assumed that injury occurs in a certain proportion of cases .
Moreover , for some purposes it is necessary to exclude injury as a criterion .
One of these is research that seeks to estimate the prevalence of domestic assaults .
If injury is one of the criteria , it restricts the data to more serious assaults and , as we have seen , the overall prevalence rate is vastly underestimated .
Thus , the widely cited figure from the National Family Violence Survey of 1,800,000 women severely assaulted each year becomes only 188,000 when the criteria for a severe assault includes injury .
Of course , this is a false dichotomy .
As indicated in a previous section , both figures are needed .
Feminist activists , for example use both figures .
They have made extensive use of the 1,800,000 figure ( often presented as a woman is battered every 15 seconds ) to mobilize resources .
At the same time they also use police , crime survey , and emergency room statistics to show that there are many more women victims ( in the sense of injured ) than male victims .

He sees the differences as related to what he calls the " moral agendas " of the two groups : ... underlying the differences just discussed [ between service providers and and feminist activists , on the one hand , and researcher into family violence , on the other ] is a deep seated difference in moral agenda .
Those who use a broad definition tend to be primarily concerned with the well being of women .
They are , of course , also concerned with physical assaults regardless of who is the victim , but their primary concern is ending maltreatment of women .
Moreover , as is to be expected , they are hostile to research that might be used by critics of feminism , and this includes research on assaults by women .
On the other hand , those defining violence as a physical assault , tend to place ending physical violence at the center of their agenda , regardless of whether the offender is a man , woman , or child .
Of the two evils , physical violence and the oppression of women , physical violence tends to take priority , even though ( as in my case ) they are also concerned with ending all types of gender inequality and maltreatment .

So where is all of this going ?
Will the controversy over domestic violence ever end ?
That , in fact , is the title of the last section of Dr. Straus ' paper , and I can do no better than to present his views .
The analysis in the preceding section suggests that neither side is motivated to understand the other .
Rather , each seeks to impose its perspective because they believe the preferred definition is vital to advancing their moral agenda and professional objectives .
In my opinion , that will continue .
Moreover , society would lose if either side gives up their perspective because society benefits from the moral agenda and professional contribution of both sides .
I for one do not intend to give up attempting to advance the " no violence by anyone " moral agenda that has informed my research on domestic assaults and spanking children for 30 years .
I believe humanity needs research inspired by the moral agenda and perspective of those who focus on the oppression of women , regardless of whether the oppression is physical , sexual , psychological or economic ; and also research inspired by the moral agenda of those who focus on physical assault , regardless of whether the assault is by a man , woman or child .
I even dare to hope that the controversy will be resolved by recognizing the need for both perspectives , and that this will bring an end to attempts to discredit those whose agenda and professional role requires a different approach and different perspective .

They have been edited to remove citations Abstract
The methodological part of this chapter analyzes the discrepancy between the more than 100 " family conflict " studies of domestic physical assaults ( those using the Conflict Tactic Scales and similar approaches ) , and what can be called " crime studies " ( i. e. the National Crime Victimization Survey and studies using police call data ) .
Family conflict studies , without exception , show about equal rates of assault by men and women .
Crime studies , without exception , show much higher rates of assault by men , often 90 % by men .
Crime studies also find a prevalence rate ( for both men and women ) that is a small fraction of the rate of assaults found by family conflict studies .
The difference in prevalence rates and in gender differences between the two types of studies probably occur because crime studies deal with only the small part of all domestic assaults that the participants experience as a crime , such as assaults which result in an injury serious enough to need medical attention , or assaults by a former partner .
These occur relatively rarely and tend to be assaults by men .
The theoretical part of the chapter seeks to provide an explanation for the discrepancy between the low rates of assault by women outside the family and the very high rates of assault by women within the family .
The sociology of science part of the chapter seeks to explain why the controversy over domestic assaults by women persists and is likely to continue .
I argue that neither side can give up their position because it would be tantamount to giving up deeply held moral commitments and professional roles .
I conclude that society needs both perspectives .
Neither side should give up their perspective .
Rather they should recognize the circumstances to which each applies .

It strikes me that five of the top articles on reddit.com are about impeachment calls being fostered in Vermont .
This follows news that a US Court has convicted Scooter Libby for lying and obstructing justice .
Their is no doubt this is an indictment of the Bush Administration as well .
Scooter 's head is n't enough for me ... I want more .
Are we finally ready to stand up and end this war , this nightmare , this darkest time in American history ?
Rather than give my own argument for impeachment , I quote and embrace the Middlebury Resolution
We the people have the power -- and the responsibility -- to remove executives who transgress not just the law , but the rule of law .
The oaths that the President and Vice President take binds them to " preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . "
The failure to do so forms a sound basis for articles of impeachment .
The President and Vice President have failed to " preserve , protect and defend the Constitution " in the following ways :
1 . They have manipulated intelligence and misled the country to justify an immoral , unjust , and unnecessary preemptive war in Iraq .
2 . They have directed the government to engage in domestic spying without warrants , in direct contravention of U.S. law .
3 . They have conspired to commit the torture of prisoners , in violation of the Federal Torture Act and the Geneva Convention .
4 . They have ordered the indefinite detention without legal counsel , without charges and without the opportunity to appear before a civil judicial officer to challenge the detention -- all in violation of U.S. law and the Bill of Rights .
When strong evidence exists of the most serious crimes , we must use impeachment -- or lose the ability of the legislative branch to compel the executive branch to obey the law .

But if you ’d like to take a test - drive before you commit , odds are that you ’ll have to look far and wide for a store that sells it .
The Mac ’s presence in the retail world remains limited , a shame given the rare opportunity for Apple to gain market share that opened up when Vista arrived .
The Mac ’s worldwide market share was 3 percent as of June 2007 , according to Roger L. Kay , president of Endpoint Technologies Associates , a consulting firm in Wayland , Mass .
That forlorn number looks even worse compared with Apple ’s peak worldwide share of 14 percent in 1984 , the year the Macintosh was introduced and sales of Apple II computers were the company ’s mainstay .
Mr. Kay noted that Apple ’s share was as low as 2 percent as recently as early 2004 .
He said the increase to 3 percent may be a result of the “ halo effect ” produced by the success of the iPod .
It could also just as easily be attributed to Apple ’s simply offering better products at more competitive prices , he added .

Via : Guardian :
Alistair Darling yesterday moved to take control of the biggest banking crisis in years with a full guarantee of deposits at Northern Rock that left the system for dealing with bank collapses in tatters .
After another day of turmoil on the high street which saw savers besieging Northern Rock branches across the UK , the chancellor threw out rules that had been in place since 2001 in an attempt to stem the worst banking crisis since the 1970s .
It was unclear whether the chancellor ’s statement would lessen queues outside Northern Rock branches today , however , the chancellor ’s decision was backed by the Treasury select committee chairman John McFall , who told the BBC ’s Newsnight programme : “ The Bank of England has done the right thing here . ”
In full - page advertisements appearing in many national newspapers this morning , the Northern Rock ’s chief executive Adam Applegarth said : “ The simple fact now is that the chancellor has made it clear that all existing Northern Rock deposits are fully backed by the Bank of England and are totally secure during the current instability in the financial markets .
As Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley shares plunged by 31 % and 15 % respectively in late trading yesterday , Mr Darling was forced to add that if another bank was to arrange an emergency lending facility with the Bank of England and was declared solvent by the FSA , the government would be willing to extend its full deposit guarantee plan .
UPDATE #1 : Independent : “ Almost Too Shocking to Contemplate ” :
Will last night ’s further commitment from Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , to put in place arrangements that would guarantee all the existing deposits of Northern Rock over and above that already offered by the deposit protection scheme operated by the Financial Services Authority do the trick ?
First , let ’s examine the quite breathtaking implications of an announcement which on a quick ring round the City last night was widely thought to be without precedent .
It is one thing to guarantee the Â £ 24bn of deposits held by Northern Rock in the hope that this might calm nerves and convince depositors that they do n’t any longer need to queue round the block in the pouring rain to get their money out .
The Government would n’t be doing it unless it thought Northern Rock essentially solvent and therefore ultimately of no risk to the taxpayer .
Yet if the authorities are to underwrite Northern Rock , the implication is that they stand behind the entire UK banking system .
Any government that is prepared to guarantee the creditors of one bank must surely offer the same facility to everyone else ?
In the event of a more generalised run on UK banks , it would be in no position to provide such support .
The sums involved would overwhelm the ability of the tax system to pay , or indeed the money printing presses to cope .
The Bank of England ’s position as lender of last resort would be stretched to breaking point .
What at first , then , seems like no more than a neat trick to restore confidence in Northern Rock on reflection looks much more high - risk .
Mr Darling had better hope it works .
If it is Alliance & Leicester , or worse , one of the big high - street banks , which next comes calling , cap in hand , then it wo n’t be just his job that ’s on the line â€ “ the Government ’s entire future would be at risk .
In order to implement his guarantee , Mr Darling would , in the event of a continued run on Northern Rock , in effect have to nationalise the mortgage bank by taking both its assets and its liabilities on to the Bank of England ’s own books .
What are the consequences for the public finances of that ?
Again , the implications are almost too shocking to contemplate .
What if it does n’t work ?
What if there are runs on other banks ?
Will the Government then nationalise Alliance & Leicester ( A & L ) , Bradford & Bingley , and others too ?
UPDATE # 2 : Telegraph : Darling ’s Risky Plan Needs to Succeed :
By guaranteeing all the existing savings in Northern Rock accounts , he has left an indelible mark on Britain ’s financial system â€ ” whether he succeeds or fails in stopping the run on the bank .
advertisement
Of course , everyone with an interest in Britain ’s economic health should hope he does succeed .
If his message gets out , he has a good chance .
The Chancellor has explicitly told savers at Northern Rock that their money is entirely safe left in their accounts .
The hope is that this brings to an end the scenes of the past few days , with thousands of account - holders queueing for hours to withdraw their savings .
This , in turn , will help arrest the dramatic decline in Northern Rock ’s share price , which continued again yesterday with a 35 per cent plunge .
A little period of calm will be enough to help Northern Rock to organise its sale to another bank â€ ” surely the best option available to the struggling institution .
Things may eventually get back to normal , with the only side - effect for the economy being a period of slower growth .
However , even if this , the best of all outcomes , is the result , things have still changed forever .
Mr Darling may be saving the banking system as a whole from an even worse crisis in the coming weeks , preventing a swathe of lenders from going bust .
But by laying down such a precedent , he also risks encouraging other banks to make precisely the mistakes made by Northern Rock .
The fuse for Northern Rock ’s near - demise may have been lit by the credit crunch , which made it difficult for it to fund itself , but the company has no one but itself to blame for strapping the financial dynamite around its waist â€ ” gearing itself up with so much debt .
Mr Darling is effectively sending the message that other banks will be bailed out â€ ” and all their accounts protected â€ ” even if they take similar or greater risks with their customers ’ and shareholders ’ money .
…
What if the Chancellor ’s plan fails ?
The mind boggles .
If the queues outside Northern Rock continue the next risk is that other banks fall victim to the crisis .
Alliance & Leicester , whose shares plummeted late yesterday , is thought to be particularly vulnerable to a run .
And as the Government has already played its most powerful hand , it will be effectively powerless to stop the fear building .
The financial world is built on trust and confidence .
If Mr Darling ’s adrenaline injection does n’t help revive these two factors , no one really knows what happens next .
The Chancellor ’s plan is high - risk .
By the end of today it will be clear whether it has succeeded .
UPDATE # 3 : Telegraph : Sterling Poised for Weakness as Northern Rock Crisis Deepens :
The crisis unfolding at Northern Rock pushed sterling lower today and analysts now expect the currency to face serious pressure in coming weeks .

A new image released from NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope shows a baby star blowing bubbles , just like , I guess , a kid with bubblegum .
But let ’s see your kid hurl out material hundreds of kilometres a second across light - years of space .
Those are some big bubbles .
The infant star is known as HH 46 / 47 , and it ’s located about 1,140 light - years from Earth .
The star itself is that bright white spot at the middle of the image .
Surrounding the star are two bubbles of material extending out in opposite directions .
These bubbles are formed when powerful jets of gas collide with the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the star .
The red specks at each end signify hot sulfur and iron gas , where the jets are colliding head on into the gas and dust material .
Astronomers think that young stars accumulate material by gravitationally pulling in gas and dust .
This process ends when the star gets large enough to create these jets .
Any further material is just blown away into space .
Producing this image was a bit of a technical achievement .
The researchers at NASA ’s JPL developed an advanced image - processing technique for Spitzer data called Hi-Res deconvolution .
The process reduces blurring , and makes the image sharper and clearer .
With this technique , astronomers were able to make out the details of HH 46 / 47 , and its surrounding bubbles .

Lawmakers from both parties also called on the Bush administration to apologize to Maher Arar , a Syrian - born software engineer still barred from entering the United States even though the Canadian government has cleared him of any links to terrorist groups .
“ Our country made a mistake and has been unwilling to own up to it , ” California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher said .
“ It reflects an arrogance I do n’t like to see in our government . ”
An administration official said she was not aware of any plans for the White House to issue an apology to Arar .
Arar described his ordeal to the House of Representatives Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees via video link .
“ The America I see and hear about today is not the same America I admired when I lived there from 1999 to 2001 , ” he said .
Arar was arrested during a stopover in New York in 2002 on his way home to Canada from a holiday and was deported to Syria .
He says he was tortured during the year he spent in Damascus jails .
U.S. officials deported him after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said he was a suspected Islamic extremist , but an official Canadian inquiry last year cleared him of any links to militant groups .
The Canadian government apologized and in January paid Arar compensation of C$ 10.5 million , equivalent to $ 8.9 million at the time and $ 10.2 million now .
The U.S. government has sought to dismiss his case in the United States on the grounds that it would violate state secrets .
“ The Canadians have acknowledged their mistake .
It ’s this nation , this government , this administration , that has failed , ” said Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Bill Delahunt .
Arar said he still suffers from nightmares , feels emotionally distant from his wife and children and has had trouble working .
“ I am not the same person I was .
I have come to accept this as part of my new life , but I want to make sure no one else goes through what I went through , ” he said .
The United States acknowledges it has conducted “ renditions ” -- secret international transfers of terrorist suspects , often to countries with dubious human - rights records .
The government says the program has prevented further attacks .
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said Arar was deported to Syria because he maintained dual citizenship there .
The United States received assurances from Syria that he would not be tortured , Boyd said .

Man In “ Liberal ” Asheville Arrested For Holding “ Impeach ” Sign
Jonas Phillips , a native of Asheville , North Carolina , sometimes stands at an Interstate overpass near his workplace and holds a sign that reads Impeach Bush - Cheney .
Wednesday morning , he ’d been standing there about ten minutes when he was approached by one Russell Crisp of the Asheville Police Department .
Crisp asked Phillips how long he intended to stay in his spot , and Philips said not long –he had to be at work shortly .
The officer then asked Phillips for his ID .
Phillips asked if he had done anything wrong , and Crisp said only that a sergeant was on the way .

It is unfortunate that economists have to debate whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse for a developing nation .
Minerals , diamonds or oil may appear to represent automatic wealth but resource - rich countries usually become mired in corruption .
High oil revenues , for instance , allow a government to maintain power and reward political supporters without doing much for its people .
The government of Nigeria has taken in billions from high oil prices , yet the average person was probably better off 40 years ago .
The easy - to - reach wealth of a resource also encourages coups , and thus political stability is problematic .
The solution is to make these governments more accountable in spending their money , but how can that be done ?
Paul Collier , an economics professor at Oxford University , has a new and potentially powerful idea .
In his recently published book , “ The Bottom Billion : Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It ” ( Oxford University Press ) , Professor Collier favors an international charter  some widely publicized guidelines that countries can voluntarily adopt  to give transparency in spending wealth from natural resources .
A country would pledge to have formal audits of its revenues and their disposition .
Imagine PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing the copper revenues of Zambia and issuing a public report .
Professor Collier ’s proposal at first glance seems toothless ; a truly corrupt country probably would n’t follow the provisions of the charter , which , after all , is voluntary .
Yet citizens could pressure their government to follow such a charter , and the idea of the charter would create a focus for political opposition and signify international support for concrete reform .
Foreign corporations would bring further pressures to heed the charter .
Multinational companies that are active in corrupt countries might receive bad domestic publicity .
Eventually the companies might push for adherence to the charter , even if the charter limited their ability to bribe .
In another context , De Beers has been stung by bad publicity about “ blood diamonds , ” and the company is now a force for positive change where it operates .

Recently , on my favorite television channel , Turner Classic Movies , I saw a couple of old biopics .
One was about French chemist Louis Pasteur , and the other was about Paul Ehrlich , a German scientist .
They reminded me of how poisoned our culture has become .
Hollywood ’s idea of heroes today are soldiers , cops , psychopaths or comic - book fantasy characters — all essentially killers .
Yet Pasteur and Ehrlich did more for the human race and saved more lives than all the generals who have ever been born .
Pasteur , from whose name the verb " pasteurize " comes , fought a lonely battle trying to convince physicians that most diseases were caused by microbes .
He was ridiculed and eventually run out of Paris for publicly warning that unless physicians boiled their instruments and washed their hands , they risked killing their patients .
That , at least , is the movie version , which demonstrates that Old Hollywood knew how to make even lab work exciting .
Pasteur later was acclaimed for devising vaccines that protected sheep from anthrax and could prevent humans bitten by rabid animals from dying of hydrophobia .
I wonder how the bigmouths in politics who decided to campaign against all things French when France refused to join us in the war against Iraq handled the fact that we and everyone else owe so much to that French chemist .
Our children can drink milk without fear of contracting tuberculosis .
A bite from a rabid animal is no longer a death sentence .
Anthrax , which used to devastate agriculture , has become rare .
And today , the entire medical and scientific professions recognize the role that microbes play in human diseases .
Ehrlich was a pioneer in chemotherapy .
After helping to develop a serum that cured diphtheria , he became convinced that chemicals could be used to combat the microbes that caused disease .
He eventually developed a compound that successfully treated syphilis .
Both movies detail the struggles of these pioneers against skeptics in the Establishment .
Scientists , as one of them pointed out , are scientists for only a few hours a day .
The rest of the time they are human beings and consequently can quickly convert their beliefs into dogma and , like the medieval church , view new knowledge and new ideas as heresy .
It ’s difficult to imagine respected physicians scoffing at the idea of washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments , but it happened .
They scoffed at the idea that most diseases were caused by microbes .
For years sea captains had been reporting that crewmen sick with scurvy were cured when they landed and were able to eat fresh fruits and vegetables , yet for years the British medical establishment dismissed the idea that diet played any part at all in scurvy ( a vitamin C deficiency ) .
I believe we are seeing that today with the evolutionists , who react with rage to the idea of intelligent design , despite the obvious flaws in the evolutionary theory .
Rather than examining the idea of intelligent design with an open mind , they attack it .
My point is that surely America ’s massive entertainment industry could find some heroes who are benefiting human beings instead of killing them .
Granted , it will require some creative people to make a film exciting without special effects , armies of stuntmen and gallons of fake blood .
Paul Muni , the actor who played Pasteur , said the greatest compliment he received was not the Academy Award but when a mother told him that after seeing the movie , her son asked for a microscope .
That ’s a heck of a lot better than a kid asking for a gun or a sword .

Down five percent .
In one month .
Down five percent , in one month , from the previous record low !
The mind reels .
The mind stumbles .
The mind falls down .
The national telephone survey of 991 likely voters , conducted October 10 through October 14 , found barely one - quarter of Americans , or 26 percent , believe the country is headed in the right direction .
The poll found declining confidence in U.S. economic and foreign policy .
About 18 percent gave positive marks to foreign policy , down from 24 percent , and 26 percent rated economic policy positively , down from 30 percent .
You know what 's worse than being a president with a record low 24 % approval rating ?
Being an opposition party that is incapable of opposing a president with a record low 24 % approval rating .
It 's embarrassing .
It 's humiliating .
Considering the real life consequences , it 's also disastrous .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spent part of yesterday running from her Democratic colleague , Rep. Pete Stark .
Stark said bad things about Bush .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spent part of last week running from his colleague , Sen. Chris Dodd .
Dodd tried to stop a bad Bush policy .
Pelosi and Reid did not spend much time running from Bush .
They did not resolve to stop his war .
They did not resolve to stop him from torturing people .
They did not resolve to stop him from indiscriminately spying on the American people .
They did not resolve to force him to comply with subpoenas .
They did not resolve to force him to comply with laws , national and international .
The elected leaders of the Democratic Party are afraid to stand up to a president with a 24 % approval rating .
The elected leaders of the Democratic Party are afraid of being criticized for standing up to a president with a 24 % approval rating .
Perhaps that 's why Reuters also reported this Zogby poll result :
A paltry 11 percent gave Congress a positive grade , tying last month 's record low .
Paltry .
That 's a good word for it : paltry .
Congress always polls poorly .
But this is a record .
A record of paltriness .
11 percent !
They 're less popular than Bush .
They 're less than half as popular as Bush !
It 's clearly not from opposing him , because they clearly have n't .
Maybe it 's time they tried something different .
Maybe it 's time they tried opposing him .
For real .
Because if you can't stand up to a president with a 24 % approval rating , what can you stand up to ?
What can you stand for ?

Have a care for the compiler writer
[ edited a few big mistakes pointed out by comments ]
My last post , a rant about the virtues of D over C++ , seems to have got read by a lot of programming folks ( thx for reading ) .
From the comments there , and the discussion on reddit.com , most of the objections to D were adroitly answered by other programmers , including comments from the author of D .
There is however one objection that came up a few times I would like to elaborate on .
Namely , some people did n't see why we should care that the language should make it easier for the writer of the compiler .
After all , the compiler is a black box , and as long as it just works (! ) then we do n't need to worry about how difficult it was for the guys behind the scenes to make the magic happen .
I disagree .
We should care greatly about the back - end logic of a language .
And we should care for very selfish reasons .
Namely , the quality of the compilers will depend on the internal logic of the language .
Compiler writers are people too .
They like us , would like to use funky new algorithms to optimize their compilers , test - driving new techniques to make the compilers go faster and faster .
The cleaner the design of the language , the easier it would be to implement new techniques .
The internal logic of a language will ultimately constrain the ability to improve the compilers .
The benefit for us , the end users , is that we will get better and better compilers , resulting in faster compilation times , smaller executables , and better reporting of compilation errors .
There are computer languages , and then there are computer languages that can bootstrap .
One of the holy grails of language design is to design a language rich enough so that one can [ practically ] write the compiler in the language in which it compiles for .
A bootstrapping language can compile a compiler for itself , in itself .
As pointed out by the comments , all languages can theoretically bootstrap themselves .
But whether one would want to , is another thing ( has anyone written a FORTRAN compiler in FORTRAN ? ) .
Preferably , it requires a language that has access to a lot of low - level systems programming .
That is the strength of C and why a lot of interpreters and compilers for other languages , are written in C .
With bootstrapping , you get into some strangely recursive territory , leading to one of the most bizarre ( and brilliant ) essays in computing – Ken Thompson 's Trusting Trust .
In that essay , Thompson shows how you can hide a security back - door by doing strange things to the bootstrapping of C compiler , and not leave a a trace , not even in the source code .
This is the type of essay that induces crises of faith in people who worry about computer security for a living .
One of the most interesting experiments in compiler design is the PyPy project .
Python , unlike C , is interpreted .
A Python interpreter , written in C , interprets a Python program and executes the code .
However , the Python community wanted to experiment with different interpreter designs .
Nevertheless , rewriting the Python interpreter in C just for the sake of experimentation would be too much work .
They came up with another approach .
The goal of PyPy is to write a Python interpreter [ and compiler ] in Python ( I 'll call this the Python - Python interpreter ) .
The idea is that you 'd run a Python interpreter that would run the Python - Python interpreter , which in turn , would be able run Python programs .
But very very slowly .
However , once you got the Python - Python interpreter to work you could modify the source code to the Python - Python interpreter ( which is written in Python not C ) , and try out different ways of interpreting Python programs .
The basic premise is that the source code to the Python - Python interpreter would be orders of magnitude easier to change than the source code of the Python interpreter written in C. ( Guido van Rossum , for instance , does not include any features in Python that can't be parsed with LL parsers ) .
If it 's hard to change things in C , its even harder in C ++.
Bjarne Strousoup originally wrote the C++ compiler as a pre-processor .
Originally you would compile your C++ program ( with the preprocessor CFront ) into C , and then compile C into machine code .
A two step process .
This was necessary in order to piggy - back the immense infrastructure that had already been carved out by the C ecosystem .
C++ inherited a grammar that had to work with CFront and C . Combine this with the development of templates , which also exploits another level of preprocessing , and you get an idiosyncratic grammar that makes C++ one of the hardest languages to write compilers for .
One of Walter Bright 's goals in designing D is to strip away the convoluted layers that had accreted in the grammar of C++ , whilst keeping the features that make C++ powerful ( pointers , templates etc ) .
Hopefully this would open the way for better experimentation with compiling D programs .
And now , even though D is much younger than C++ , with only a handful of D compilers , D compilers already appear to be approaching something reasonably robust .
The signs for an optimized future of D looks bright indeed .

The difference between “ theoretically possible ” and “ important ”
Academics , myself included , love coming up with counterintuitive arguments that change the way people see the world .
The media probably loves to publish such articles even more than the academics like to find them .
Sometimes , though , these same academics / media do a big disservice by raising issues that are theoretically possible , but not at all important in reality .
A great example appears in this article in Time magazine about how maybe seat belts do n’t save lives because drivers become more reckless when belted because they feel safer .
This effect could reduce , or even reverse the safety benefits of seat belts .
The theory is sensible .
When I am unbelted , I am at greater risk for injury , so I may drive more cautiously .
In economics , this idea is attributed to my friend and colleague Sam “ Seatbelt Sammy ” Peltzman in the 1970s .
Economists call this tendency the “ Peltzman Effect . ”
In practice , though , the evidence could not be clearer that seat belts are an incredibly cost effective way of saving lives .
( See for instance , this study of mine and the citations therein . )
Whatever small offsetting impact that more reckless driving due to seat belts may have , it is trivial compared to the benefits of wearing a seat belt .
Articles like the one in Time Magazine encourage people to come to completely the wrong conclusion on this question .
If , however , I ’m wrong and compensating behavior on the part of drivers really does undo or reverse the benefits of seat belts , there is an easy public policy solution : the government should mandate the installation of a razor sharp knife on every steering wheel aimed directly at the heart of the driver .
Just think how carefully we would all drive then .
The only known recordings of a brilliant physicist who predicted the existence of parallel universes have been found in the basement of his rock star son's flat .
The tapes document how Hugh Everett , a quantum physicist , developed his idea at the age of 24 , while a graduate student at Princeton University in 1957 .
Everett 's theory gave rise to the concept of a multitude of universes , or a " multiverse " , where all life 's possibilities play out .
It means that somewhere Elvis is still rocking , the Nazis won the second world war and England qualified for Euro 2008 .
The recordings are believed to have been made in 1977 , after a physics conference at which Everett 's parallel worlds theory was resurrected after being shunned for two decades .
The tapes were thought lost after his death at the age of 51 in 1982 .
They were found during the making of a TV documentary in which Mark Everett , the physicist 's son and lead singer of the US band Eels , attempts to understand the work that consumed his father .
The programme , Parallel Worlds , Parallel Lives , airs on BBC4 this evening .
The tapes record a conversation between Everett and Charles Misner , a physics professor at the University of Maryland .
In the background , Mark can be heard playing the drums .
Everett talks of how his inspiration came after talking about the ridiculous consequences of quantum theory over a few glasses of sherry with Misner and Aage Petersen , an assistant of the Nobel prize - winning physicist Niels Bohr .
Everett completed a draft paper describing the idea in 1956 .
On seeing it , his supervisor , John Wheeler , said : " I am frankly bashful about showing it to Bohr in its present form , valuable and important as I consider it to be , because of parts subject to mystical misinterpretations by too many unskilled readers . "
Everett 's work tackled one of the most puzzling mysteries to emerge from the field of quantum mechanics .
One consequence of the theory is that tiny particles such as electrons can behave in a curious way that allows them to be in two places at once .
As Bohr was to comment : " Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it . "
In the 50s , the prevailing view , and one championed by Bohr , was that weird quantum behaviour vanishes as soon as the object is measured .
But Everett thought differently .
His calculations showed that whenever quantum mechanics said a particle was in two places at once , the universe divides .
In one universe the particle appears in one place , while in a second it appears in the other .
The implications were apparently so alarmingly counter - intuitive that Everett 's ideas were largely ignored , notably by Bohr .
Speaking to New Scientist magazine , Mark Everett said the rejection had had a devastating effect on his father .
But recently , the theory has been accepted by many scientists as profoundly important .
From HaskellWiki
Type arithmetic ( or type - level computation ) are calculations on the type - level , often implemented in Haskell using functional dependencies to represent functions .
A simple example of type - level computation are operations on Peano numbers :
data Zero data
Succ a class
Add a b ab | a b -> ab , a ab -> b instance Add Zero b b instance ( Add a b ab ) =>
Add ( Succ a ) b ( Succ ab )
Many other representations of numbers are possible , including binary and balanced base tree .
Type - level computation may also include type representations of boolean values , lists , trees and so on .
It is closely connected to theorem proving , via the Curry - Howard isomorphism .
A decimal representation was put forward by Oleg Kiselyov in " Number - Parameterized Types " in the fifth issue of The Monad Reader .
There is an implementation in the type - level package , but unfortunately the arithmetic is really slow , because in fact it simulates Peano arithmetic with decimal numbers .
Library support
Robert Dockins has gone as far as to write a library for type level arithmetic , supporting the following operations on type level naturals : addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , remainder , GCD , and also contains the following predicates : test for zero , test for equality and < > <= >=
This library uses a binary representation and can handle numbers at the order of 10^15 ( at least ) .
It also contains a test suite to help validate the somewhat unintuitive algorithms .
More libraries :
type-level Natural numbers in decimal representation using functional dependencies and Template Haskell .
However arithmetic is performed in a unary way and thus it is quite slow .
type -level - tf Similar to the type - level package ( also in speed ) but uses type families instead of functional dependencies and uses the same module names as the type - level package .
Thus module name clashes are warranted if you have to use both packages .
type-level - natural - number and related packages .
A collection of packages where the simplest one is even Haskell2010 .
tfp Decimal representation , Type families , Template Haskell .
typical Binary numbers and functional dependencies .
type-unary Unary representation and type families .
numtype , numtype - tf Unary representation and functional dependencies and type families , respectively .
More type hackery
Not to be outdone , Oleg Kiselyov has written on invertible , terminating , 3 - place addition , multiplication , exponentiation relations on type - level Peano numerals , where any two operands determine the third .
He also shows the invertible factorial relation .
Thus providing all common arithmetic operations on Peano numerals , including n- base discrete logarithm , n- th root , and the inverse of factorial .
The inverting method can work with any representation of ( type - level ) numerals , binary or decimal .
Oleg says , " The implementation of RSA on the type level is left for future work " .
Djinn
Somewhat related is Lennart Augustsson 's tool Djinn , a theorem prover / coding wizard , that generates Haskell code from a given Haskell type declaration .
Djinn interprets a Haskell type as a logic formula using the Curry - Howard isomorphism and then a decision procedure for Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus .

And we need to be able to run this somehow , in the typechecker .
So fire up ghci :

A Really Advanced Example : Type - Level Lambda Calculus
Again , thanks to Roman Leshchinskiy , we present a simple lambda calculus encoded in the type system ( and with non-terminating typechecking fun ! )
Below is an example which encodes a stripped - down version of the lambda calculus ( with only one variable ) :
{-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts #-} data X data
App t u data Lam t class Subst s t u | s t -> u instance Subst X u u instance ( Subst s u s' , Subst t u t' ) =>
Subst ( App s t ) u ( App s' t' ) instance Subst ( Lam t ) u ( Lam t ) class Apply s t u | s t -> u instance ( Subst s t u , Eval u u ' ) =>
Apply ( Lam s ) t u' class Eval t u | t -> u instance Eval X X instance Eval ( Lam t ) ( Lam t ) instance ( Eval s s' , Apply s' t u ) =>
Eval ( App s t ) u
Now , lets evaluate some lambda expressions :
> : t undefined :: Eval ( App ( Lam X ) X ) u => u undefined :: Eval ( App ( Lam X ) X ) u => u :: X
Ok good , and :
> : t undefined :: Eval ( App ( Lam ( App X X ) ) ( Lam ( App X X ) ) ) u => u ^ CInterrupted .
diverges ;)

It 's possible to embed the Turing - complete SK combinator calculus at the type level .

49,000 questionable names on Texas voter rolls 49,000 questionable names found on voter rolls
Auditors say none of them cast ballots in the May election
AUSTIN — State auditors found more than 49,000 potentially ineligible felons and dead people on Texas voter rolls this year , but did not find that any cast ballots in May 's special election .
The audit report released Tuesday said that there may be even more potentially inaccurate voter information but they were unable to check for U.S. citizenship status or federal felony convictions or verify records that lacked a Social Security number and Texas driver 's license number .
The audit recommended that the Secretary of State 's Office do a better job of matching criminal conviction and death records with the voter list .
Although there were no instances found of potentially ineligible voters casting ballots in the May 12 special election , auditors noted the " relatively low 7 percent voter turnout " for that special constitutional amendment election to extend a school property tax cut to senior citizens and disabled homeowners .
Computer system at risk
The audit also found inadequate security controls over a new computer system that maintains voter records and weaknesses in data backup that increase the risk of prompt and full recovery of data from a disaster .
Scott Haywood , a spokesman for Secretary of State Phil Wilson , said the office has implemented many of the auditors ' recommendations but wants to be careful about wrongly removing anyone from voter rolls .
He noted that the auditors were unable to verify that the 23,114 possible felons and 23,576 possibly deceased voters actually should be removed from voting lists .
" We can't remove someone from the voter roll unless it 's a strong match because we do n't want to take away an eligible voter 's right to vote , " Haywood said .
The audit said that potentially ineligible felons may be able to register because of the way the Secretary of State 's Office processes data from the Department of Public Safety .
The office receives daily felony data updates from the DPS and weekly updates of death records from the Bureau of Vital Statistics .
Those are matched one time against the voter rolls , but the SOS does not retain a comprehensive history of the records .
Thus , an ineligible felon could try to register at a later date , and the computer system would not flag the record as potentially ineligible , the audit said .
People convicted of felonies are eligible to vote once they have completed their sentences .
Hampered by privacy laws
Auditors tried to check for citizenship status but could not find authoritative information .
They contacted the U.S. Social Security Administration to obtain the citizenship status but were told that federal privacy laws prohibit the disclosure .
The audit could provide fodder for supporters of legislation requiring voters to show a photo ID .
Republicans were unable to pass photo ID bills over Democrats ' opposition during this year 's legislative session .
" This audit is further evidence that while our state and local elections officials are doing everything to secure the electoral process , additional safeguards as simple as requiring a photo ID to vote in Texas should be put back on the table next session and finally passed , " said Hans Klingler , a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas .
Rep. Garnet Coleman , D - Houston , said the audit did n't find any fraud had occurred in the May election .
He said the ID requirement could suppress turnout among many Texans who are eligible to vote .
" Everytime someone says , ' Show me the fraud , ' there is n't any , " said Coleman .
The audit also found deficiencies in a computer system developed through contracts with IBM and Hart InterCivic that came online in January .
The computer was slower than the previous system for six of 10 benchmarks , including adding and canceling voters and producing a list of registered voters and those who voted .
More than half of 204 county voter registration officials who responded to a survey said the Texas Election Administration Management system , known as TEAM , does not allow them to perform their jobs effectively .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -- Michael Mukasey should be denied Senate confirmation as U.S. attorney general unless the retired judge denounces as torture the interrogation technique known as waterboarding , a top Democrat said on Sunday .
Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey arrives for his second day of Senate confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington , October 18 , 2007 .
Mukasey should be denied Senate confirmation as U.S. attorney general unless the retired judge denounces as torture the interrogation technique known as waterboarding , a top Democrat said on Sunday .

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said Mukasey must declare such simulated drowning to be unlawful while two more Republicans said the nominee should clearly stake out a position against waterboarding .
“ He should not be confirmed unless he is very , very clear about these aggressive techniques , which violate our laws and violate ( the international ) Geneva ( convention on treatment of prisoners of war ) , as being totally unacceptable , ” Levin , a Michigan Democrat , told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
Mukasey is expected to spell out his position this week in responses to written questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Mukasey appeared headed toward easy confirmation as President George W. Bush ’s nominee to succeed Alberto Gonzales as attorney general until he ran into trouble this month at the second day of his Senate confirmation hearing , much of it stemming to his response when asked about waterboarding .
The retired federal judge and former prosecutor from New York said torture violates the U.S. Constitution .
But he declined to specifically say whether waterboarding is torture .
“ If it amounts to torture , it is not constitutional , ” Mukasey said , drawing complaints he was dodging the question .
Mukasey may likely still be confirmed .
But a growing number of senators have said they want a definitive answer from him before passing judgment .
Critics have accused the United States of torturing suspects in the war on terrorism .
Despite Bush ’s assurances he prohibits torture , it ’s unclear how detainees are treated since he has refused to disclose interrogation techniques .
Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , a member of the Judiciary Committee , and John McCain of Arizona , a Republican White House contender , voiced concerns about Mukasey but neither said whether they may vote against him .
“ I am convinced as an individual senator , as a military lawyer for 25 years , that waterboarding ... does violate the Geneva Convention , does violate our war crimes statute , and is clearly illegal , ” Graham told “ Face the Nation . ”
“ I think it would serve the attorney general nominee well to embrace that concept , ” Graham said .
Asked if he would oppose Mukasey if the nominee refused to do so , Graham said , “ If he does not believe that water boarding is illegal , then that would really put doubts in my own mind . ”
McCain , appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” said , “ Anyone who says they do n’t know if waterboarding is torture or not has no experience in the conduct of warfare and national security . ”
Asked if he would oppose Mukasey unless he declared waterboarding to be illegal , McCain said : “ I ca n’t be that absolute , but I want to know his answer . ”
Researchers at the University of California , San Diego ( UCSD ) School of Medicine have discovered that inflammation provoked by immune cells called macrophages leads to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes .
Their discovery may pave the way to novel drug development to fight the epidemic of Type 2 diabetes associated with obesity , the most prevalent metabolic disease worldwide .
In recent years , it has been theorized that chronic , low - grade tissue inflammation related to obesity contributes to insulin resistance , the major cause of Type 2 diabetes .
In research done in mouse models , the UCSD scientists proved that , by disabling the macrophage inflammatory pathway , insulin resistance and the resultant Type 2 diabetes can be prevented .
The findings of the research team , led by principle investigators Michael Karin , Ph.D. , Professor of Pharmacology in UCSD 's Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction , and Jerrold Olefsky , Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Associate Dean for Scientific Affairs , will be published as the feature article of the November 7 issue of Cell Metabolism .
" Our research shows that insulin resistance can be disassociated from the increase in body fat associated with obesity , " said Olefsky .
Macrophages , found in white blood cells in the bone marrow , are key players in the immune response .
When these immune cells get into tissues , such as adipose ( fat ) or liver tissue , they release cytokines , which are chemical messenger molecules used by immune and nerve cells to communicate .
These cytokines cause the neighboring liver , muscle or fat cells to become insulin resistant , which in turn can lead to Type 2 diabetes .
The UCSD research team showed that the macrophage is the cause of this cascade of events by knocking out a key component of the inflammatory pathway in the macrophage , JNK1 , in a mouse model .
This was done through a procedure called adoptive bone marrow transfer , which resulted in the knockout of JNK1 in cells derived from the bone marrow , including macrophages .

With this procedure , bone marrow was transplanted from a global JNK1 knockout mouse ( lacking JNK1 in all cell types ) into a normal mouse that had been irradiated to kill off its endogenous bone marrow .
This resulted in a chimeric mouse in which all tissues were normal except the bone marrow , which is where macrophages originate .
As a control , the scientists used normal , wild - type mice as well as mice lacking JNK1 in all cell types .
These control mice were also subjected to irradiation and bone marrow transfer .
The mice were all fed a high - fat diet .
In regular , wild - type mice , this diet would normally result in obesity , leading to inflammation , insulin resistance and mild Type 2 diabetes .
The chimeric mice , lacking JNK1 in bone marrow - derived cells , did become obese ; however , they showed a striking absence of insulin resistance -- a pre-condition that can lead to development of Type 2 diabetes .
" If we can block or disarm this macrophage inflammatory pathway in humans , we could interrupt the cascade that leads to insulin resistance and diabetes , " said Olefsky .
" A small molecule compound to block JNK1 could prove a potent insulin- sensitizing , anti-diabetic agent . "
The research also proved that obesity without inflammation does not result in insulin resistance .
Olefsky explained that when an animal or a human being becomes obese , they develop steatosis , or increased fat in the liver .
The steatosis leads to liver inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance .
The chimeric mice did develop fatty livers , but not inflammation .
" Their livers remained normal in terms of insulin sensitivity , " said Olefsky , adding that this shows that insulin resistance can also be disassociated from fatty liver .
" We are n't suggesting that obesity is healthy , but indications are promising that , by blocking the macrophage pathway , scientists may find a way to prevent the Type 2 diabetes now linked to obesity and fatty livers , " Olefsky said .

How is it that regimes widely acknowledged to be the world ’s most oppressive nevertheless continually win favors in Washington ?
In part , it is because they often have something highly desired by the United States that can be leveraged to their advantage , be it natural resources , vast markets for trade and investment , or general geostrategic importance .
But even the best - endowed regimes need help navigating the shoals of Washington , and it is their great fortune that , for the right price , countless lobbyists are willing to steer even the foulest of ships .
American lobbyists have worked for dictators since at least the 1930s , when the Nazi government used a proxy firm called the German Dye Trust to retain the public - relations specialist Ivy Lee.
Exposure of Lee ’s deal led Congress to pass the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 ( FARA ) , which required foreign lobbyists to register their contracts with the Justice Department .
The idea seemed to be that with disclosure , lobbyists would be too embarrassed to take on immoral or corrupt clients , but this assumption predictably proved to be naive .
Edward J. von Kloberg III , now deceased , for years made quite a comfortable living by representing men such as Saddam Hussein of Iraq ( whose government ’s gassing of its Kurdish population he sought to justify ) and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire ( for whose notoriously crooked regime he helped win American foreign aid ) .
Two other von Kloberg contracts — for Nicolae Ceaus¸escu of Romania and Samuel Doe of Liberia — were terminated , quite literally , when each was murdered by his own citizens .
In the 1990s , after Burma ’s military government arrested the future Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and cracked down on the pro-democracy movement she led , the firm of Jefferson Waterman International signed on to freshen up the Burmese image .
